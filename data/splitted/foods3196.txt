review/summary: Personalized Fortunes with Personal Service
review/text: I ordered these fortune cookies for my school staff and was unsure about the steps involved to get things done correctly and in a timely manner. The support and service from these folks went above and beyond.  The product is delicious, was delivered exactly when I requested, and the staff was delighted to find fortunes that related to our school.  I would readily recommend them and use them again for an event.

review/text: These fortune cookies were a hit!  My sister LOVES fortune cookies and was so excited to have her own custom fortunes.  We received help writing the fortunes from the company which helped a lot. The cookies were fresh and yummy.  They arrived on time and were packaged so well that not one was broken.  I would definitely order them again.  Thanks again!

review/text: Not only were these the best fortune cookies I have ever tasted, this company redefines what customer service should be.  SO many extra steps were taken to ensure that we recieved what we wanted, the order was customized not only to our requests but also to our timeline of when we were able to respond, etc.  Best customer service I have ever seen from a company.  The rest of the world should take notes and learn from this company.  Seriously amazing.  I highly reccommend them to anyone.

review/summary: Zhen Bang! ~ Freakin Awesome!
review/text: Another birthday means another order for fortune cookies from Greenfire.  This has become an annual tradition in our family.  Our son picks a theme and the experts at Greenfire come up with awesome looking fortunes to give to his friends.  I have also used the cookies as gifts for colleagues as well as clients and they think they not only look cool but they are yummy too.  I love the fact that we get to be creative and different at a reasonable price.  Perhaps even better than the actual cookies  -- the staff at Greenfire.  Always accommodating and easy to work with.  I am not just a customer - I am a part of the team.

review/summary: Okay but not my favorite
review/text: The chocolate layer, while nice and smooth is so thick so that it overpowers the thin toffee layer and the delicate flavor of the macadamia nuts. I prefer the ones sold at Target stores during the Christmas season (Archer Farms brand). Those have just the right amount of chocolate to allow full appreciation of the crisp toffee and nuts.  I purchased these from Amazon because I was too late in shopping at Target and they were sold out, but I was disappointed. I have a very sensitive palate and I miss the crisp sweetness of the toffee and the delicate macadamia nuts. These are fairly pricey, too compared with the Archer Farms brand. Next year I will shop early at Target and stock up on their special chocolate toffee macadamia nut treats.

review/text: I actually haven't eaten these from a can, but I've eaten them from a bag.  They are addicting.  Like Lay's chips, you can't eat just one.  Chocolate coated macadamias are good, but these add the toffee flavor to elevate them to great.  My problem is I can finish off a bag by myself in one sitting.  The other problem is I can't find them anymore.  If you get the chance to buy some, don't pass up the opportunity or you'll regret it.

review/summary: Green tea that tastes like black tea!
review/text: Disclaimer: I'm a huge tea-drinker and tea-lover! However, I don't like teas that are too bitter or astringent-tasting.<br /><br />Puerh tea (pronounced "POO-air") can be either green or black, which is really confusing. This one in particular is a green that tastes like a black! Puerh must be gathered from very old tea plants, which is partly why it tends to be quite expensive. Puerhs are supposed to be very strong-tasting, but this one is relatively mild.<br /><br />This Magnolia Puerh tastes very, very floral, almost like a jasmine, but is also very mild. It steeps up light, so don't over-steep thinking it needs to darken and turn it bitter. (Any tea will bitter if over-steeped due to the tannins.) The mouth-feel is light and silky, and it's very floral and aromatic. I do not agree with the product description that the flavor "changes with every sip", but it does take on a very faint citrusy flavor if you let it sit for 10 minutes before drinking. It is only enhanced by honey and milk.<br /><br />If you like Jasmine tea, you would be very likely to enjoy Numi's Magnolia Puerh tea. It's also a good choice for someone who loves black and floral, and wants to gradually ease into drinking more greens.

review/summary: Tastes Awful!
review/text: I know taste is a very subjective attribute, but in my opinion Peter Pan is the worst tasting name brand peanut butter there is (both crunchy and smooth). I am literally "in-love" with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches - I eat them every single day (sometimes twice a day)! For this reason I consider myself "familiar" with peanut butter, and out of the 3 or 4 brands I have used regularly Peter Pan is the worst tasting. It seems to have a "plastic-like", chemical, artificial flavor that all the other brands don't have. I bought a case of (12) 18oz. jars and I am struggling to use them up!<br /><br />My favorite PB (both crunchy and smooth)is Jif, with Reese's a close second. Both have a very natural peanut flavor, with the Jif winning due to a slightly better consistency than the Reese's.

review/summary: Perfect balance between ginger and apricot!
review/text: I love the beneficial effects of ginger teas, but most of them are way too strong.  Good apricot teas with authentic flavors aren't widely available.  Although green teas are nice, the ginger flavor always overpowers the delicate green tea flavor.<br /><br />Imagine my joy when I happened upon Good Earth's Apricot Ginger Black Tea!  Nothing else comes even close to matching the satisfying flavor (not too sweet, which is gross!) and stimulating feel of good ginger, especially satisfying in cold weather when throats and nasal passages need soothing.  Simply inhaling the moist steam from my cup of tea brings a smile to my face and helps me breathe easier.<br /><br />I brew this tea at 175 degrees Fahrenheit, which keeps it mellow and wonderful, even if I leave the teabag in my cup longer than intended.  This tea still tastes good brewed at temperatures as high as 195 degrees.  Whenever I need a vacation from winter, up north here in the frozen midwest (only hours south of the Canadian border), I brew a cup of Apricot Ginger tea, close my eyes, and -- presto! -- I'm lounging in a Mediterranean resort.  No jet lag, no lost baggage, no metal detectors or pat-downs!  Life is good!  ";-}

review/summary: soggy PB&J sandwiches?
review/text: I am a Dad that makes my kids lunch every day. As most parents in my situation know-- it is a delicate balence trying to find healthy products the kids like and finding a way to make a couple lunches without spending half the night doing it!<br /><br />This product pretty much fits the bill. My kids would complain that their PB&J sandwich would get soggy by the time they ate it at school. So now, rather than actually making the sandwich for them-- I give the kids two slices of bread, this single serve peanut butter pack (together with a similar single serve jelly pack I bought on Amazon as well)-- a plastic knife to "spread it on themselves-- and they have a freshly made-not soggy- sandwich for lunch that they make themselves.<br /><br />This is a timesaver, a healthy alternative-- and it tastes good.

review/text: When I was working I used to buy the small snack packs of these and keep them in my desk for a snack on my break.  They became quite popular, and started disappearing as people found out that I had them and where I kept them.  Not a problem, I like sharing, but now that I'm retired I don't have to share.<br /><br />I buy the big box simply because of cost and in an effort to create less trash.  They're convenient and tasty and GREAT with a cup of tea.  I'm on auto-ship so they come without my having to even think about it.  Great price, too, cheaper than the supermarket.  I used to make my own crackers but the peanut butter would go bad before I used it all up.  With the packages like this I never have to worry about stale peanut butter again.<br /><br />Only 4 stars because I like Keebler Townhouse Crackers better.  Small sacrifice for great convenience and savings.

Cassia cinnamon reduces sweetness according to my taste buds but this cinnamon greatly enhances the flavor.  I can't tell if it enhances the sweetness or just doesn't reduce it but I love this product.  Considering that most people do not use a large amount of cinnamon I would not be deterred because of the price.  If it came in smaller quantities without a significant increase in price-per-unit it would be even better.<br />DCP

review/summary: Ceylon Cinnamon Powder
review/text: I have been taking cinnamon medicinally for many months now; however, in some of my research I found that the cinnamon I buy in the grocery store was not the kind that helps lower/stabilize blood sugar. I read that it was the Ceylon cinnamon that did this, so I ordered it. It is actually more mild than the grocery story kind, a little grittier, and it has a sweet taste. I use a spoon of this along with the same amount of turmeric (that I ordered from the same company), milk thistle, a liquid multi-vitamin, and water every morning. I feel this improves my health. I was a little concerned that there was no inner or outer safety seal on this product. The turmeric had and inside safety seal. I called the company and they said there was a freshness seal, but that is not the same as a safety seal.

review/text: We have two seven month old Yorkie-Poos who love, love, LOVE these treats.<br /><br />They're basically a rawhide roll, dipped in a beefy tasting baste, that are filled with an artificial "marrow" that drives my dogs wild.<br /><br />They LOVE to chew on these and it does keep them busy for some time.<br /><br />I use a serrated knife to "saw" these in half so each dog gets half of the same treat, just so I can drag out the lifespan of each package.  The price is a little premium, but really worth it, since the dogs seem to enjoy these so much.<br /><br />Amazon's price is much better than anything I've found locally for these treats & as always, you can't beat getting them delivered right to your door.  I'm hoping Amazon will start offering these through Subscribe & Save soon!

review/summary: The best cereal ever.
review/text: I've had almost every type of cereal out there, and this is the best.  Take a delicious, perfect, organic raisin bran and add crunchy, lightly sweetened oat clusters lightly flavored with Organic Cardamom Seed, Organic Fennel Seed, Organic Fenugreek Seed, Organic Nutmeg.. what do you have?  Mouth-watering perfection. As a bonus, it happens to be healthy.

review/summary: Absolutely wonderful for high-fiber oat-bran muffins!
review/text: I discovered this oat-bran raisin cereal when at my mother's - it is not available in my area.  As a cereal, it is better than most oat-bran cereals we've tried, with nice crunchies mixed in with the flakes.  But it isn't what I reach for first to pour in my bowl for cereal.  My mom and I used it to make muffins.  It made the best high-fiber oat-bran muffins either one of us had ever tasted!  We made dozens and dozens of them and then froze them - thawing them out one-at-a-time.  My sister came and tried them later too.  She agreed the muffins were wonderful.  I now order 6 boxes at a time from Amazon and make muffins at home for my family.  We have them in the freezer all the time and my husband takes them with him on trips.

review/summary: great
review/text: Yes, these noodles are dried.  But they are also SO much better than anything else on the market.  Amd much less expensive than others online.  The Amish make some great food.  A shame I guess that you have to live close to them to enjoy it.  I live close to a Mennonite restaurant and they have the most awesome and reasonably priced food.  Just me I guess, but if they are closer to God than we are, than maybe we should listen because then God gives them the most awesome food.

review/text: I have always made my own egg noodles but decided recently to make a stab at buying off the shelf, most have always left me wanting more, not tasty at all.  The Amish Kitchen noodles are the best I've ever eaten and that includes a lot of brands.  My husband raved over these (he doesn't do that over my homemade noodles doggone) so they have to be good, no not good, they are dee-licious!

review/summary: Not bad, not great either...
review/text: First off, the taste and overall noodle-like properties of these noodles are pretty good.  But!  If you're like me and grew up in Ohio and Amish noodles are a staple of your diet these don't hold a candle to the vast majority of Amish noodles out there.  The biggest problem I have with them is their thickness; they're about half as thick as other brands you'll commonly find like "Homestyle Noodles" and "Country Pasta".  Ultimately, for things like soup and such these noodles don't hold up nearly as well as the others (you end up with noodle mush compared to a soup you can keep in the fridge for days with the noodles staying al dente).  Also, be advised the the bags here are 12oz vs. the 16oz bags of the two afore mentioned brands.  Ultimately, if you can't get comparable noodles near you (which is almost impossible considering I live in the middle of Wyoming at moment and our Wal-Mart carries Country Pasta) give them a shot; but in all honesty these aren't worth your money and you'll end up being stuck with 12 bags to eat.

review/summary: Great soup noodles!
review/text: I've been experimenting with various homemade soup and chili recipes in my crockpot this fall and winter, and was looking for a hearty noodle for chicken noodle soup.  I thought I'd give these a try, and WOW...are they good!  They cook up without sticking together and hold up well in soup, even after being frozen and reheated.  I keep 2-1/2 cup portions of various homemade soups in my freezer for a quick lunch, and this is one of my favorites.  Great price, too!

review/summary: its cleanable
review/text: bought in in conjunction with a big bottle of Torani chocolate syrup. the pumper is sturdy and it disassembles with a threaded cap just above the cap where it attaches to a bottle. I had to clip off about one cm of the intake straw that goes inside the bottle. it is rather ridged and would not flex and the cap was put in a bind that created a concern it would crack the plastic. I used those scissors that can cut pennies in half, clipping off small increments so it would be as close to the bottom as possible. I was so pleased to see the pump came apart for cleaning, my experience from coffee shops are these things are going to clog. Its the nature of such a thick chocolate. Now I know I wont have to pull the straw out of the bottle to clean it, just the pump part. When I placed it in the bottle, I did not just shove it in since another reviewer mentioned it would over top the chocolate out of the bottle, but I put it in a bit, then pumped out some of the air then there was no problem with extra sauce.

We keep it on a paper plate to catch the drips which is not ideal, but it works.  Like another reviewer mentioned, you need to pour out a little sauce first to prevent overflow.

review/text: This sauce pump works adequately with the larger Torani sauce bottles.  I'm only giving four stars because I find it clogs pretty frequently with the Torani Mayan Chocolate sauce.  While this is probably more due to the nature of the sauce, it's still worth noting that if you do not use this every day, you'll likely have to clear clogs fairly often.

review/summary: took a long time -- not for caramel sauce
review/text: First of all, I bought these with prejudice.  I'd recently purchased Starbucks sauce and syrup and they included the pumps at no additional cost.  I got spoiled.<br /><br />So I didn't think to order pumps when I bought Ghiradelli and Torani sauces through Amazon.<br /><br />After reading reviews and looking at prices, I bought these.  Disappointed.<br /><br />Got a workout pumping the Torani Pumpkin Pie sauce.  But eventually it came out.<br /><br />Broke a sweat pumping the Ghiradelli Caramel sauce so I left it alone for a while.  Thought the problem could be because the stem is too long.  So, I cleared away the caramel and trimmed off 3/8".  Pumped some more for about two minutes and got a weak cough from the spout.  I thought to myself, "it won't be long now."  Except now, the pump doesn't even rise.  Got annoyed and started writing this scathing 1-Star review.  Looked over and saw the pump came back up and gave it another go.  Voila, caramel sauce.<br /><br />Changed the review to three stars for making me have to work -- Oh, and for the packaging or lack of; I'd expect them to be individually cellophane sealed instead of open in an envelope.<br /><br />*edit 02/03/12<br />Knocked it down to 2-stars.  Like another reviewer wrote it's not good for thick sauces, it definitely isn't.  The stem and spout are just too narrow.  I have to apply great pressure, put my body in it, to pump the caramel sauce.  Too much work getting my morning coffee.  I will spend more for the right pump.

review/summary: Just a bit too small for thick syrups
review/text: I like this pump pretty well. My only complaint is that for the thicker syrup (chocolate) that I have it doesn't always want to pump the syrup very well. The issue is that the chocolate dries at the end of the spout after a day or so and when you go to start pumping it again it's very slow and difficult. It's a mild annoyance, but I do wish I had gotten one that was just a bit bigger.

review/text: These dried blueberries are absolutely the most delicious by far that I have ever tried before and I have tried several different brands. I choose Eden brand because they are sweetened with apple juice rather than cane sugar. For some reason the juice sweetened berries don't make me feel that sugar spike the others do. I use these in my homemade breakfast granola and for just eating out of hand. I HIGHLY recommend them. Wonderful quality. Also, the resealable ziploc bag actually works the way it's supposed to! Very easy to get into and keeps the berries moist after opening. Love the whole package.

review/summary: Almost perfect!
review/text: I am happy that I've found this product (organic juice-sweetened blueberries) at a good price point. They are delicious but have more oil on them than others I have had in the past (purchased from a natural store in bulk). As I am not able to purchase from a previous, local supplier, I am glad to have these but preferred the less-oily product. I would also love for Eden to offer larger quantity bags.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: For me, the flavor of these blueberries is too mild and the texture oily.  I had been buying Fruit D'Or dried wild blueberries but they do not seem to be available locally any more.  In comparison, the Fruit D'Or flavor is really intensely blueberry.  If you like the Eden dried wild blueberries this is a great buy.  It sells at Whole Foods in Philadelphia currently for 9.99 per 4 oz pack.

review/text: I have numerous food allergies and got these as a healthy "on the go" snack. Unfortunately, I think the only way I would be able to enjoy them is cooked or baked in something since I don't like their taste "au natural." They are also extremely small and kind of hard to eat because when you put some in your hand, they roll all over the place!

review/summary: The Best of the Best
review/text: Make no mistake...there is a HUGE difference between Crown Prince canned clams and Crown Prince Natural Smoked canned clams.  I'm pretty sure that when it comes to the nutritional powerhouse that clams just happen to be, most people either are unaware or just don't care how many key nutrients are provided by these little mollusks.  One little 3 oz. tin has 130% of the iron we need in a day and although it isn't listed on the nutritional label, clams are the best source of vitamin b12 on the planet at over 1000% per serving. Certainly not recommending to eat a whole tin everyday for health but half a tin every other day(refrigerate leftovers of course) will do the body good. Simply, put some good old clams = anemia's worst enemy.  Now back to how these clams packed in olive oil annihilate all other canned clams out there. Canned clams, even other Crown Prince canned clams have a knack for providing more SAND than clam. That's right, it's usually a grainy experience.  But not with these CP Natural in Olive Oil. Delicious and actually does this healthy treat some justice. Being a huge fan of the CP Natural canned oysters in olive oil, I just had to try these. It's safe to say those delicious oysters have some new competition breathing down their necks(9 out of ten oysters don't have necks but you get the idea).

review/text: I did enjoy the Crown Prince smoked clams for years (cottenseed oil). They were sand and shell free in the beginning . Over the years, however, these tasty clams contained too much sand and shell to enjoy - spitting out the sandy treat. Surprisingly, these olive oil cans contain the same soft clam taste without ANY sand so far on the fourth can. Love them.

review/summary: The Best Chocolate
review/text: We had a taste test in our family (3 generations at once) and we tried several organic and non-organic chocolates.  The "chimpanzee chocolate" won hands down.  I don't understand why the two negative reviewers decided to write a review when they admit in the review that they don't like dark chocolate?  If you are looking for a chocolate - this is the best tasting according to our family.  (You could also do your own taste test with a bunch of chocolate bars and see if you come up with the same result!)

review/summary: Awkward packaging distracts from too-crunchy chocolate
review/text: There's way too much packaging here for something clearly going for the "green" market.  There's a large recycled cardboard container with 10 small pieces of chocolate wrapped in individual, very hard to open (I have to use my teeth!) paper wrappers.  By the time I've fought my way to the chocolate it would have to be pretty amazing, and it's not.  It's crunchier and not as sooth and creamy as I would prefer, which is a common problem with very dark chocolate.  If it makes a wooden noise when I break it I know it's too hard.  The taste is just fine, and those who like a crunchy texture, and don't mind struggling with packaging would probably be fine with it.

review/summary: It's good
review/text: When the Senseo's first came out, we started receiving free ones to test various coffees. I admit I'm a bit of a coffee snob and come from a long line of coffee snobs. My Dad roasts his own beans and when you've had fresh roasted? From a high end brewing system? Heaven. We have the latest model and for Senseo coffee having tried everything out there, honestly this flavor is very good. But that's with the qualification of it's Senseo coffee most of which kinda is on par with crappy diner coffee or instant. This is about the quality of Starbucks. Mass produced and flavored, but drinkable. I bought this because we have relatives in town visiting our baby and honestly, they just want a cup of joe when they crawl out of bed and don't seem to mind what it tastes like as long as it's fresh. I don't have the time or patience with an infant to wait on them so this was an easy solution that each person visiting can do themselves when they wake up at various times throughout the morning without risking anyone messing up the fabulous coffeemaker my family gave me over Christmas (these relatives have broken two similar machines in the past....sigh!). I do like the greener pod factor over the plastic k-cups and with going through so much of these, I'd feel terrible filling my recycle bin instead of our compost pile. So an easy fix and a win-win. If you love the Senseo coffee, this is worth it.

review/text: I can't seem to make a strong cup of coffee with these pods, even using two at once. The pods fit perfectly, but I think the problem is the pods are packed too tightly or the filter paper does not allow adequate water flow. They seem to swell into a ball shape and the water then flows around the pod and not extracting a lot of coffee. I'm going to try to engineer a fix and will update the review.

review/summary: Robust and strong....like coffee should be
review/text: If you like weak, wimpy coffee, then this coffee is not for you.<br />  But if you like strong, robust, tasteful coffee, with a soupcon undertone of bitterness, then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V2SUU4">Java One French Roast Coffee, 14-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a> is the best choice that I have found. I used to use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026VJI9K">Senseo Kona Blend Coffee (10% Kona Coffee Blend), 16-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a>; it was good, but then when Amazon's inventory was temporarily exhausted, I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBJ3U2">Senseo Colombia Blend Coffee, 16-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a> which was stronger. But now, Amazon doesn't seem to carry Senseo brands anymore--or Senseo doesn't sell thru Amazon (which is the former's loss). In any event, I needed coffee that featured pods that would fit my Senseo machine, and I serendipitously stumbled upon Java One French Roast, and I'm glad I did!<br />  Further, the Java pods--unlike the Senseo pods--are individually sealed in air-tight wrapping, which means the coffee stays fresher, longer. Java pods contain a bit more coffee so I have to use the two-cup holder because it's deeper. Java costs more than the Senseos, but, in my mind it's worth it! Try it--you'll like it!

review/summary: A Little Sweet. A Little Tart. A Little Carbonated. Perfect Fruit Soda.
review/text: I'm not much of a soda drinker, but I enjoy a good natural fruit soda in the summertime. Izze offers some unusual flavors to suit a variety of tastes, and their Sparkling Pomegranate is one of the best fruit sodas I've tasted. Pomegranate juice is sometimes described as "slightly sweet, slightly tart", but I always found the pure juice too strong. This soda is perfect, though. The sparkling water dilutes the pomegranate flavor just enough to leave its essence without curling your tongue. It's delicious. It tastes more like fresh pomegranate fruit than pomegranate juice, which is too concentrated. And it's lightly carbonated for extra refreshment. If you like a fruit soda that is flavorful but not very sweet, Izze Sparkling Pomegranate fits the bill perfectly. And it contains no artificial ingredients or caffeine. No sugar added. It's sweetened with fruit juice concentrate. 12 fl.oz. glass bottles.<br /><br />Ingredients: sparkling water, apple juice concentrate, grape juice concentrate, pineapple juice concentrate, lemon juice concentrate, pomegranate juice concentrate, cranberry juice concentrate, carrot juice (color), blueberry juice (color), natural flavor. One bottle contains 120 calories, 15mg sodium, 34g total carbs.
