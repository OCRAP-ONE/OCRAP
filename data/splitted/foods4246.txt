review/summary: Red Snapper
review/text: My cats (all 5 of them) go insane when I bring out the Petite Cuisine.  The red snapper is one of their favorites - have tried several of the PC entrees - only one they didn't go crazy over - the Chicken pot pie - way too much liquid (half the tiny can!)

review/summary: Petite Cuisine Red Snapper
review/text: When I first purchased this product I wasn't sure my cats would like it.  However, I quickly discovered that they do.  It's a pity that they can't do the review.  I've tried a number of different brands of cat food and, though, they still don't eat a lot; this seems to be their favorite.  It smells so good, I feel like I could eat it myself but it's just too expensive.

review/summary: Cats love it -- but I am concerned
review/text: This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various "high end" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the "Before Grain" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy "Duck a l'orange" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a "treat" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing "Made in Thailand" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.

review/summary: Cat's love it
review/text: I got this new cat food after reading an article in Natural Health magazine's October 2008 edition, "Feed your pet Right". The article identified protein rich, nutritionally balanced cat food.  My TWO cats did not like the chicken types, but LOVE the red snapper, tuna and shrimp, tuna and sole and yellow fin tuna.  I get the combo in the 4 pack.<br />I would recommend switching over from dry food to wet slowly so there's no upset stomachs.  I think your cats will like this food, even if they are picky, like mine.

Neat thing, there was a [...]  off your next four packs in side each of the packages.<br /><br />My taste test panel of two - Foutchie and Miss Fuzz gave it 8 paws up.  They eat the expense 85 cent a can fancy stuff, so this compares well to that brand.  Same size.  They list is as Chicken pot pie, and frankly, that is what it looks like--the filing of a pot pie.<br /><br />I always think of Jane Fonda in KLUTE feeding her cat and then licking the spoon of the cat food can herself.

review/text: Hello!  We are Marissa and Lilith.  Mojosmom is our human.  She said we could write this review because we ate this and she didn't.  We like it!  We especially like the Chinese Chicken (mom said the package actually calls it "Sesame Chicken", but we can't read, so it doesn't matter).  The Pot Pie entr&eacute;e had an awful lot of broth and not a lot of meat.  But we licked the bowl clean anyway.  Mom says she likes this because it doesn't have a strong, icky smell like some canned cat food.  But she says that it would take a lot of these cans to feed it to us all the time (1-2 cans per 2.5 lbs of our weight - she said something about how Lilith could stand to lose a a pound or two or three), so we'll just get a couple of cans along with our dry food.  Maybe if we ignore the dry food she'll get the message, but she can be pretty stubborn!

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: I usually give my cats canned food as a treat, so I thought I would give this a try for them.<br /><br />Like the other reviews the ingredients list was nice, there were a few ingredients I wasn't sure about like carrageenan and menadione sodium bisulfite but they all turned out to be a mineral supplement or a thickening agent.<br /><br />I opened the chicken pot pie first. Very watery with pea sized chunks of chicken, tiny bits of carrots and what looks like onion in it. It smelled like cat food.<br /><br />The sesame chicken also smelled like cat food, mind you not like a horrible smell, but if you put that and the actual chicken pot pie or sesame chicken in front of me blindfolded I'd be able to tell which was which just from the smell, it's a cat food smell. Anyway, the sesame chicken had pea sized chicken bits in it along with carrots and rice and a hint of sesame oil aroma to it.<br /><br />Minion Number Two is my picky eater (no, that's a nickname). He liked the juice and ate a few bits of the meat then went to his regular cat food, even side by side he still didn't eat the treat.<br /><br />Minion Number One (also a nickname) will eat most natural foods from potatoes, hamburger to whole wheat bread. He too enjoyed the juice a lot, ate a few pieces of the chicken then wandered off. He never came back to finish it.<br /><br />It gets three stars. Two for the ingredients and one that my cats like the juice. It doesn't get five because one, the price, I can see why it's more (because of the ingredients) but my cats will finish off other cans of cat food that are only half the price which is point two, being two adult male cats with hearty appetites they didn't like it enough to finish it.

review/summary: I'm sorry to say that things did not go well with this food
review/text: The chicken pot pie variety was extremely runny, interestingly that seemed to be the only part my cats ate, the licked up the broth.  But they literally nosed the potatoes and carrots right off their plates.  It was like watching picky toddlers.  I divided one can between three cats and I still had about a half a can left after they ate.  I also watched as they finished all three cats ran to the litter box. (apparently it comes out watery too)<br /><br />One of my cats - the little vixen whose part siamese then went and did a protest in my laundry hamper.<br /><br />So when they tried the seasame chicken I only gave it to the two critters who don't voice their displeasure so eloquently.  They still did not finish their meals, again the carrots hit the floor, and perhaps the most suprising, normally when I open a can of cat food they come a running, not so on either opening, and even though the company claims the food smells more appealing, I disagree, as did the cats.<br /><br />So it's 3 stars because at least they ate some of it, but I'm very sorry to say they didn't appear to like it.  If you would like to try a sampler package of this product you can access that through their website.  All the packaging is recyclable, this product is made in Thailand, and claims to be all natural:<br /><br />The chicken pot pie lists the following information:<br />Chicken, Chicken broth,Sweet Potato,Carrots,Soy bean oil,Trialcium phosphate,Tapioca Starch,Calcium Sulfate,Olive Oil, Vitamins and Minerals,Vitamin E supplement,Vitamin A supplement,Vitamin D3 supplement,Zinc Sulfate,Thiamine Mononitrate,Manganese sulfate,Menadione sodium bisuifite complex (source of vitamin K activity),Riboflavin supplement,Folic acid,Pyridoxine hydrochloride,<br />Copper amino acid complex,Iron amino acid complex<br />Carrageenan,Cholinechloride,Taurine,Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie: Protein: 12% Min.<br />Fat: 1% Min.<br />Ash: 3% Max.<br />Fiber: 1% Max.

review/summary: Quality Product, But Not What My Cat Would Prefer
review/text: I purchaed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  My cat enjoyed this selection okay, but it seemed like he was much happier with the seafood sampler.  This picture on the box looks like something very similar to human food, but the actual contents weren't as close as I had hoped.  I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.  My cat is a 12 year old Tabby Manx with some minor health issues.  His well being is important enough that I will buy better made food instead of just cheap stuff... but when it starts going to waste... and at a higher cost to me?  I consider this to be a one time only purchase and do not plan to reorder even if it's on sale.  Nothing against this company, but I think they would do better with a variety pack of 6-8 flavors with only one chicken flavor for every 5 or so other flavors.  If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater.

review/summary: One out of three cats partially liked it
review/text: I have three cats, one is 12 years old (Fred), one is 9 years old (Jewel) and a kitten that is 4 months old (Angel).  The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.  I was disappointed that my cats did not care for this food.<br /><br />I must say, however, that cats are very particular animals.  Even though my cats did not like it, your cats might devour it in an instant.  As for quality, I give this food high marks.  It looks edible and smells like real food.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would recommend purchasing a sample before you go out and get a whole box.

review/summary: Pleasing for the cat and for me - a good alternative for my Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys addict
review/text: My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys.  It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens!  When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him.  After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food.  First, I want it to have real ingredients listed.  I don't like for it to have by-products.  (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food)  Second, I don't want it to stink.  If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it.  Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria.  Next was the big question:  would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off.  He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting.  Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior.  He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day.  I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn.  It really looks like people food.  He seemed to really enjoy the "soupy" broth.  This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off.  He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest.  Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken.  It smelled pleasantly like Asian food.  His reaction was to sniff and wander off.  After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food.  So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor.  I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM.  It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day.  A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior.  He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits.  I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily.  Clearly, my kitty has preferences.  I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>) that are available on Amazon.  He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past.  It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand.  I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance.  That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general.  The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.

review/summary: My 12 cats like this product just fine (details)
review/text: With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn't take me long to test this product! The first day, I introduced the cats to the Petite Cuisine seafood entr&eacute;es. The next evening, they got to try these two Entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- two Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;es<br />-- two Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;es<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included half of one flavor, and half of the other) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the "gravy" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the solid food. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of chicken meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery. I was pretty enthused when I saw the tiny carrot pieces in the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e. I was initially afraid that they would eat around the carrots but they didn't -- they gulped it right down with the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e: Chicken, chicken broth, sweet potato, carrots, soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Olive oil, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex, Carrageenan, Choline Chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 12%, crude fat (min) 1%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on both flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I have one finicky cat and one food-hog cat. Both of them like this food. First ingredient is chicken, good. Next few ingredients are also good, but this is not "natural" cat food and thus, includes preservatives and taste enhancers (that I generally avoid). Also, the packaging is cute, but excessive. You get a case of 24 cans, but within that case, are 6 smaller boxes that hold 4 cans each. None-the-less, the quality is superior to "fancy feast" or other bottom-rung cat foods. This food is a solid "medium quality". The food is what I call "gravy" style as opposed to "loaf" style, meaning you are paying for a decent amount of gravy in each can as opposed to meat and other real food. To their credit though, the chicken is REAL white meat chicken, not processed chicken parts made to look like "shredded chicken". The cats love it and the packaging (though excessive) makes it convenient for storing little cans in your cupboard.

review/summary: Good Quality Cat Food for "People Food" Cats
review/text: We have two cats, both of whom can be finicky eaters. One cat is a "people food" lover; he will eat almost anything that we eat (turkey is his favorite).  The first time we introduced this food to him, he lapped it up.  The other cat does not touch "people food" at all.  He took one sniff of this food and turned on his heels.  We tried all flavors and he wouldn't eat any of them.<br /><br />So, if you have a cat who loves "people food", Petite Cuisine will probably satisfy him.  This cat food is of high quality with no "by-products" and comes in single serving pop-top cans.  Highly recommended for cats that are open to new flavors but may not be for those that prefer to stick with what they know.

review/summary: They should call it "Cat Crack"
review/text: Yes, they should call it "Cat Crack". We have 5 extremely finicky cats, and it's very difficult to get them to eat the same thing. When we find something, we stick with it. Whenever we've tried to introduce something new, chances are 1 or 2 of them will turn up their noses and walk away.<br /><br />This has not been an issue with Petite Cuisine. The problem now is that they truly won't stop sceaming for it. We've now gone through each of the four flavors (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, and Tuna & Shrimp), and each is an unqualified hit with all five cats.<br /><br />You can tell as soon as you open the can that this is something different. It certainly smells fishy, but it doesn't smell like regular canned cat food. It looks and smells very high quality and fresh. Real tuna flakes, real tiny popcorn shrimp, a good amount of sauce. These are smaller 3 oz cans. We pretty much limit each cat to a healthy tablespoon of wet food a day, so 1 can will feed three like that. But the cats could certainly find the motivation to eat more.<br /><br />Each box (and each can) is clearly labelled with all of the ingredients, which for the most part are whole seafood. Not too thrilled with the presence of Menadione sodium bisuifite in each, but on the whole, it's probably no more risky than other foods we've been feeding them. 1/2 star off for that.<br /><br />Value? Well it's a little pricey (3x per oz more expensive than, say, a good deal on a can of Friskies. But we'll continue to get it for the occasional break and special night treat for our babies. It's certainly been better received than almost anything else we've paid a premium for from any grocery store or pet store.

review/summary: The cats' dessert
review/text: We used to get this at a local grocery for our cat, who adores it. We moved cross country and now have to mail order it because the cat went on a hunger strike when his supply from before the move ran out. We acquired 2 more cats, and all 3 adore this stuff. Two of them especially like the "soupy" texture of it, sometimes we spoon it over their kibble and cats just snarf it up.<br /><br />This isn't the primary food for cats, it is their "dessert" - served twice daily after morning and evening kibble. However, they think the stuff is the best thing ever, and prefer it to anything you can name in the way of people food.

review/summary: My cats lapped this up!
review/text: I read a lot of reviews before ordering this variety of cat food so I knew the pros and cons, but since it had no by-products or wheat gluten, which are still my top "no-nos" I decided to give it a try.  My cats LOVE the extra gravy!  They love the chicken chunks too, of course but the gravy really got them going.  I've now tried several other varieties with gravies and they couldn't be more enthusiastic.  I switched them from all dry food to mostly wet and a little dry because the oldest cat was constantly throwing up...likely from her unable to effectively chew dry food well and swallowing it whole.  I will continue to order this for them as well as some of the other Petite Cuisine varieties.

review/summary: A taste winner for sure
review/text: Our cat practically raced over to the food dish to sample this, and ate with intent devotion. This cat food is definitely a taste winner. I also like the fact that this package doesn't have tuna -- which cats like but to which it's said they can become addicted.<br /><br />Not sure what else to say. The Petite Cuisine website is quite convincing about the nutritional value and careful screening of ingredients. The small cans mean the food, once opened, says fresh enough under refrigeration to appeal to the cat the next day. If you can afford it, this is a great cat food.

review/summary: People Food?
review/text: As this cat food has the somewhat comical tagline "People food for cats!," it may either at first appear charming or like a gimmick.  I think it is fair to say that it is a charming gimmick.  The foods are indeed fashioned after human food, but are more like food for baby humans than us adult humans that prefer strong seasoned flavors.  Of course, that is a good thing, as a healthy diet for a cat is quite different than for a human.  The ingredients, then, are basic, with nothing offensive like wheat-gluten.<br /><br />As for the taste, I agree with other reviewers that this comes down to the preference of each cat, but it has been a great hit with cats in my experience!

review/summary: One ate, the other didn't
review/text: This cat food is really special. It doesn't smell like cat food. It smells like canned chicken. The cans are easy to wash for recycling. It's a joy to serve.<br /><br />My ditzy calico cat, Creampuff, loved the food. She scarfed it down immediately. The other, a new adoptee named Ophelia, said, "Thanks but no thanks." She's quite finicky but alas, I think her taste buds have become accustomed to the traditional, more pedestrian Friskies type food.<br /><br />Seems like a good cat food, if you can get your cat(s) to eat it.I'm not qualified to evaluate the nutritional quality or the taste, bt appearance and smell are excellent.

review/summary: Ex's cat likes it--need I say more?
review/text: My ex-girlfriend is a lovely woman in many ways, but her cat...well pretty much everybody and everything is beneath him. He is picky about being petted, how he is being petted, how long he is being petted, and by whom (I think the phase of the moon figures into this somehow too, but I digress). This persnickety nature also applies--in spades--to his food. When I gave Zede (the cat, not the ex-gf) some of this food, he actually ate it without giving me his "How dare you put this slop in front of me, knave?" look. I got reports later that he became even more enamored with the stuff as time went on. So there you have it: an endorsement from Zede the finicky feline. Well, how else do you rate cat food? I'm not going to try it myself...and besides, I'm a vegetarian!

review/summary: Nigel is gonna be sad - we're out of chicken pot pie
review/text: My cat Nigel is very into food. When I opened the first can of Petite Cuisine, he thought he'd died and went to heaven. This was bits of chicken breast, broth and a few very finely chopped vegetables. The chicken pot pie had a more watery broth - the sesame chicken was in a more gravy-like sauce - but both flavors were devoured.<br /><br />My cats are big, outdoorsy cats. They were all once feral. They still frequently bring home a snake, vole or squirrel for entertainment - or supper. I have six: 4 big guys (14-17 pounds) and two slightly smaller girls (11 and 12 pounds).) They appreciate fancy little tidbits of food on a saucer. They especially liked Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />They have free access throughout the day to dry kibble: Purina One Chicken&Rice and Purina Indoor  mixed half and half. We have 3 small <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DI30O">Petmate Le Bistro Feeders</a> which they love. Then in the evening I feed them 3 ounces each (1/2 can) of Friskies Salmon&Chicken Dinner Shredded. Because the Petite Cuisine cans were so small (3 ounces) I first gave them one can per cat, but that was too much. I split 4 of these tiny cans between six cats and that was just right: no leftovers. They liked the Petite Cuisine better than Fancy Feast or Purina Selects.<br /><br />This package contains 24 cans. 12 cans are pot pie - 12 sesame. The price is comparable to Purina Selects, Fancy Feast or Sheba from the grocery store - but I think the quality is higher. This looks and smells like chicken my Moma cooks! At the end of one week of feeding Petite Cuisine, all of six of them - their fur just glistened.<br /><br />Nigel is plotting: How to work computer and get Petite Cuisine on auto-subscribe shipment from Amazon? Hmmmmm? Bodhi just wants the A-4 Smiley Box* it comes in!<br /><br />* A-4 Smiley Box - the new cat sleeping container that is delivered almost weekly by the man wearing brown. A sleeping cat's smile is on the side.

So, as we all know with cats... they can be finicky! I would have to say give it a try and see if yours like it. They really look great, smaller cans store easily also.

review/summary: Pleasing for the cat and for me - a good alternative for my Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys addict
review/text: My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys. It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens! When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him. After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food. First, I want it to have real ingredients listed. I don't like for it to have by-products. (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food) Second, I don't want it to stink. If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it. Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria. Next was the big question: would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off. He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting. Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior. He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day. I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn. It really looks like people food. He seemed to really enjoy the "soupy" broth. This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off. He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest. Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken. It smelled pleasantly like Asian food. His reaction was to sniff and wander off. After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food. So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor. I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM. It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day. A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior. He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits. I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily. Clearly, my kitty has preferences. I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)) that are available on Amazon. He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past. It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand. I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance. That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general. The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.

She didn't eat it until it was in her dish for most of the day when she had eaten her regular dry food.<br />It looks like it would be good.  It looks like pieces of fish, but for some reason this didn't excite her as much as tuna.<br />I'm getting a new kitty soon, and I'll update it when I try to give new kitty this food.<br />Edit: New kitty likes it fine.  This isn't her favorite choice.  She likes tuna, chicken, and beef all better than this.  Unlike the other cat, she likes this more than dry food - about as much as she likes the Iams wet food I also feed her.

review/summary: If it looks good, is it good for the cats?
review/text: My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term "all about tuna fish".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.

review/summary: Tempted to eat them myself!
review/text: This is quite a unique brand of cat food. Their tagline is "People food for cats" and they are quite right. They smell and look delicious.<br /><br />There are basically two types of canned cat food in my experience, the first kind is the solid kind where you tip the can into the plate and the food retains the shape of the can. The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate. For me this second type is preferable because it has a higher content of liquid which I consider to be healthier for the cats urinary system. This cat food is of this second type.<br /><br />My cat is a very finicky eater and he takes time to adjust to new foods.<br />This package contains two flavors; the first is chicken pot pie which looks just like real chicken pot pie, right down to the light gravy, there are cubes of real chicken breast and it really looks like pot pie. My cat laps up all the sauce then moves on to the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Second flavor is sesame chicken: This smells really good and the chicken is not chunked but in thin strips. My cat loves the sauce and will drain it all dry but is not too fond of the chicken. He will probably adjust to it over time. This is why only four stars.

review/summary: Not a hit with both cats, but blame them not the food!
review/text: One of my cats who eats everything loved this food. The other more picky one, not so much.<br />My cats are old though, and weren't raised in this era of healthy cat food, and most of the time wont touch the stuff. So I was happy that at least one of them liked it.<br />I like how all the ingredients are fresh and how there are only a few; not a list 30 things, where half of the words are unpronounceable. The food doesn't smell as bad as most cat food, the kind where as soon as you open it wafts through the house. It also has fresh chunks of chicken and fresh corn and carrots. The gravy in it is very watery and not thick like most cat foods, so it spilled everywhere the first time i opened it. Since then it hasn't, because I haven been more careful.<br />I wish both of my cats liked this food because I know it is so much better for them than what they do like! But I give much kudos to Petit Cuisine on making healthy food for cats.

It took him a minute, but he, too, enjoyed it. The rest of the herd came flying into the kitchen, even the deafie!! The baby with cerebral palsy got so excited she forgot to remove her toes and tail from the door of the feeding cage, did a flip, and almost took a header to the floor.<br /><br />THANKS Petite Cuisine!!<br />Love, the special critters

review/summary: Five out of six cats say "Yummy!"
review/text: Both entrees were popular at my house, with all my furkids except "Mr. Picky!"  This product line should also be popular with humans, because it has a pleasant odor, and it looks like "people food," as the box says.  If you're concerned about issues such as "gluten free," it's that, too.<br /><br />I did feel that the "Chicken Pot Pie Entree" had a lot of liquid in proportion to the amount of solids, especially for the price.  About half the can is broth.  Kitties who prefer minced meals would probably not like this.

review/summary: My cats like this
review/text: My cats seem to enjoy this food as much as their erstwhile favorite, Wellness wet food.  They are pretty fussy so I am pleased.  I also like the fact that the the ingredients seem to be nourishing (no by-products) although since some reviewers have mentioned a possibly dangerous ingredient, I think I will do a little more research before ordering this again.

review/summary: Great Ingredients...If Only They Would Eat It....
review/text: I had a whole case of this to try, so thought it would be fun to try it on as many cats as possible. Thus, by recruiting 5 friends, we ended up trying Petite Cuisine chicken cat food on 13 cats--7 males & 6 females; 4 inside cats, 5 outside & 4 inside/outside. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food--namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.<br /><br />I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat--a 2 year old male--ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male--a 16 pound inside/outside orange tabby--would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the broth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of broth, which I think is brilliant, since all the cats I know always like the broth of canned cat food or tuna best.<br /><br />I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked. It has great ingredients and smells like human food. I hope to try Petite Cuisine seafood catfood one day...I think they all might like that much better.

review/text: Opening both the Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e and the Chicken Pot Pie, there is not a lot of aroma, it looks like chicken soup with carrots and it is brothy and wet.<br />Having so slight an aroma, I thought my cat may not like it, but she does like both flavors.<br />Small in size like Fancy Feast, one can isn't a meal. My cat eats dry food and this is a treat for her.<br />It is expensive though. It seems like a very high quality food for cats.<br />I would recommend this to someone whose cat is very fussy.

review/summary: People Food For Cats!
review/text: They aren't kidding! The albacore smells better than people food! My cats LOVE this cat food, and it is gluten free, so there is no worries about our cats getting poisoned! Great stuff! I'll likely be buying this cat food instead of their regular brand, especially for treats. If your cat likes a lot of sauce, there is plenty of it here, and it's not just water. If you want to give your cats a healthy canned food, this is the best one by far that I've fed them... Better than even the high-end fancy foods. The cans are small, but the nutrition is better than most cat foods. They even use yellow-fin tuna for the albacore! 1st rate cat food!

review/summary: sesame awesome and chicken pot water
review/text: The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the "chicken pot pie" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the brand ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up.

review/summary: 3 cats give 5 stars to 5 out of 6 flavors but  should I?
review/text: This review covers the two chicken flavors offered here as well as four fish flavors in the variety pack offered elsewhere on this site.  My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of "menadione sodium sulfite in pet food" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page.

review/summary: The Cat's Meow
review/text: All four of my cats loved this canned cat food!  The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.<br /><br />The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.<br /><br />I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends.

review/summary: Source of protein and hearty enough to serve as one meal
review/text: First of all, your cat should hopefully like fish-flavored foods, because obviously this variety pack is all seafood - yellowfin, snapper, tuna, and shrimp. And if your cat is picky about which fish he/she likes, you won't be breaking the bank by discarding the cans of the flavors he/she doesn't approve of. There is also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I">chicken variety pack</a> available by Petite Cuisine, which contains Chinese chicken and chicken pot pie dishes. Give that a try if your cat is simply a lover of all foods.<br /><br />The food actually could pose as human food if someone was unaware they were being served cat food. But do yourself a favor and just buy a can of tuna or whatever it is you like - leave the cat food to the cats. The dishes are quite moist with chunks of meat/fish and broth. They are a source of protein and are hearty enough to serve as one meal for a small cat. You may try adding dry food if one can isn't enough. Or simply use two cans and order more as necessary.

review/summary: Five Paw Salute !!
review/text: My selection, which contained 12 cans each of Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken, arrived quickly, and I looked forward to seeing how my kitties would like it.<br /><br />I liked the fact that:<br /><br />(1) Petite Cuisine has NO Wheat Gluten,<br /><br />and<br /><br />(2) it's made from "Human Grade" ingredients -- which means even I can eat it if I really wanted to -- and truth be told -- I DID sample a bit from each of those 2 selections -- and both selections tasted better than anything I have tasted when I buy a Brand Name can of canned chicken for myself.....<br /><br />But ok -- this Petite Cuisine is for my kitties, so let's see what THEY think of it:<br /><br />Well, I had no idea what to expect when I opened the first can --  Chicken Pot Pie (and word of caution -- open the "Chicken Pot Pie" can over the sink--there's alot of Broth inside and it sloshes out if you are not careful).<br /><br />However, Big Bad Baby Twinkle was standing behind me watching my every move, and once the top came off the can, her Supreme Largeness, BBBT, surprised me with several OCTAVES worth of Mew-sical praise for the tempting smell.<br /><br />Yes - I know you are supposed to mix new cat food with their old food, but I had no desire to mix this pristine, tasty, fresh diced chicken and veggies entree with any of their stinky canned stuff - so Big Bad Baby Twinkle and Sweet Cee Cee feasted on 1/2 can of "Chicken Pot Pie" each, along with the liquid broth. I waited for a reaction -- nothing untoward happened. They licked their chops and came after me for more of the same.<br /><br />Now, it has been noted that there is alot of "water" (Broth) in this can of Chicken pot Pie -- I am familiar with "Spot's Stew" and that brand also has alot of liquid in its can. I have no problem with this Chicken Pot Pie broth -- if anything, it helps to hydrate my kitties (cats, being descended from desert animals -- get most of their liquid from their food-- and as long as the sodium content of this broth is low, then they can slurp it to their hearts delight -- and they certainly did, as the dishes were licked clean)<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken, was less liquidy and looked very nice, shredded with its vegetables -- it had special smell, which actually was just the smell of Sesame Oil. But my cats inhaled this as greedily as they did the Chicken pot Pie. I was impressed that Sesame oil would be used (along with Soy oil) as an ingredient. I'm looking forward to seeing what these oils will eventually do to nourish (former abandoned, street-kitty, but thoroughly vetted) Cee Cee's somewhat dull coat. * * *<br /><br />And to top off the Petite Cuisine experience, each box comes with a coupon worth $2 -- $1 off when you buy a four-pack, or four cans of Petite Cuisine from the supermarket -- and another $1 coupon will be sent to you if you fill out your name and address on the first coupon before you present it to  the check out clerk.<br /><br />The only thing I take an issue with is the origin -- Thailand -- why not keep this "at home" and produce it in the USA?<br /><br />* * *UPDATE -- Dec 18 2008 -- Cee Cee's coat grew out a little more, is BEAUTIFUL and silky!! Since the only new thing in her life is this food, I can surmise that this diet of Petite Cuisine DID help flesh her out and beautify her fur (She is a former street-kitty, and has always been a little wan (although she goes to the vet regularly) since she was rescued and I brought her inside.)

review/summary: More watery than expected; cats are not digesting it well
review/text: Our cats usually get the "green can" Fancy Feast shredded varieties (they aren't interested in the green can souffle types, and the Florentine varieties give them gastric problems).  The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back.

review/text: All three of my cats are wild about the Chicken Pot Pie variety of Petite Cuisine.  It's real chicken in a clear broth, and it actually looks like something you'd serve yourself.  All the ingredients are "real" -- no meat by-products, wheat gluten, preservatives, dyes.  There is actually quite a bit of broth, which concerned me when I opened the first can because I thought the can was mostly water.  However, it's real broth and evidently pretty tasty, because my cats practically inhale it -- they love it!  Once they finish the broth, they start working on the chicken and always clear the whole plate.  I'll definitely buy more of this.

review/summary: Delicious, says my cat; messy, says I...
review/text: It's a cute idea to produce a cat food that is similar to people food, and Petite Cuisine seems to fill the nutrition needs of cats, if you can believe the label. However, the "in sauce" makes things a little messy, especially with the "Chicken Pot Pie" entree. There's so much sauce (aka gravy/water/whatever) that my cat would pull the pieces of food out onto the floor and slurp up the sauce afterward. There's just too much liquid in this cat food. The Sesame Chicken is a bit more solid.<br /><br />Whatever the consistency, my cat gave this product high stars, if licking up every morsel and drop is any indication. And I have to admit it smells pretty darn good, not like a lot of cat foods. (Of course, funky smells have never bothered my cat -- the more odorous the better, in her opinion). The daily serving size suggestions are a bit too generous:  1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight. That means 3 to 6 cans for an 8-pound cat, and if you've got a healthy 10-pounder, that means 4 to 8 cans a day? No way.<br /><br />I don't think we'll be using this as a daily food, but rather as an occasional change of pace. It's certainly palatable, but the messiness is a negative. I say 3 stars, and my cat says 5, for a 4-star average...

I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

review/text: The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch. We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house, we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite, never enough bags to get us to our next shipment. I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself!!!

review/text: WOW!  I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day. Kettle chips are the BEST non-baked chips I have eaten. I decided to try the sweet onion chips, since I've never had them. I now have a FAVORITE!! If you like onions, this is a MUST buy! I will definitely reorder these, as I mentioned above, they are the BEST I have ever eaten! The flavor is GREAT.

review/summary: Ridiculously Good
review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

review/text: These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

review/summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review/text: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.

review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/summary: A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor
review/text: I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!

review/summary: Convenience at low cost
review/text: I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!

Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)

review/summary: Excellent Thai-flavored chip
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.

review/text: In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.

review/text: I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend these other Kettle Chips flavors: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

review/summary: These chips make me weak at the knees
review/text: These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag!

review/summary: By far my favorite chips
review/text: These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close.

review/summary: Good chips, more cheese
review/text: They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.<br /><br />On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime.

review/summary: Best sour cream & onion chip I've had
review/text: I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.

review/summary: Fabulous!
review/text: These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess, don't even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them!
