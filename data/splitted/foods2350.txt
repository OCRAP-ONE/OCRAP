review/summary: Maybe too bold...
review/text: We've tried many K-cup flavors in our house and this one quickly became the one you had to drink when we were out of everything else.  Finished the last one this morning and can safely say we'll stick with other tried and true flavors (like Tully's Kona Blend, Caribou or Gloria Jean's Cappucino).  Definite bitter taste and aftertaste, takes a ton of flavored creamer to make it palatable.  My wife went as far as to describe the flavor as what burnt tires would taste like.  Wish I'd read the other review about one k-cup being good for 2 cups of coffee--might have meant less creamer!

review/summary: I love extra bold, but not this one!
review/text: I love bold/extra bold k-cups, but unlike some other choices this one was intense, bitter, and far too strong for my palate.

review/summary: Tried to like it...
review/text: Not one person in my household who has tried this, has enjoyed it.  I bought some of this for my dad and i thought he would love this because he likes a really bold cup of coffee but he hated it.  I have to had it to him though... he tried to like it for my sake.  He tried it several times before he was honest and said he truly hated it.  My mother, who likes her coffee on the weak side tried to water it down but she said she almost spit it back out into the sink when she took the first sip (wish i had been there to see it).<br /><br />I tried it knowing it wasn't really my type because my dad honestly didn't like it and that made me curious.  Also i tend to believe with the appropriate amount of milk and sugar any coffee can be decent right?  Well i didn't finish the cup even after the extensive doctoring i did.  It was burnt tasting and very bitter.  I'm very surprised there are so many good reviews for this one.  The only use i could think of for it is if you are on a long drive down the highway at night... it would be good to keep you awake.  Not only will the caffeine help but the terrible taste in your mouth.

review/summary: Bold? Not!
review/text: I bought Emeril's K-cups based on the reviews here. I love strong, bold coffee but Emeril's goes way over the top. There is a difference between bold and bitter and this coffee is just plain bitter and it is one of the worst coffees I have ever had. I got a Keurig B60 after my coffee maker broke and saw a Keurig in one of the lounges at work. I was taken in by its convenience and bought one and am the sorriest person I ever did. I have sampled all the Keurig K-cups and cannot find one to my liking. They are either too weak and watery no matter what size cup you make or just plain bitter which leaves an aftertaste. In addition,if you like stronger coffee, you need to make the smallest size cup, 5.5 oz. which in this day and age is ridiculous; people drink out of large mugs and you can drink that 5.5 oz in 3 or 4 gulps! I am getting rid of the darn thing and going back to brewing my own. There is a reason that the majority of the nation's premium coffee roasters have NOT jumped on the Keurig bandwagon. It does not make an excellent cup of joe.

review/text: This Extra Bold, Dark Roast K-Cup is great for those who like the convenience of using a K-Cup, but prefer a richer, more bold flavor to coffee. If you're like me, and tend to find most K-Cup coffee weak and reminiscent of vending machine coffee, you might like this. Its flavor and strength do not seem to require using only the smallest cup size, but seem good to the medium mug size. It is similar to Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond, Tully's French Roast, and Black Tiger (among a few others).

review/summary: How Could You Be So Bold
review/text: After FINALLY purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a "to each his or her own" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the "Midnight Magic" brand; I've tried the "Jet Fuel" brand; I've tried the "Donut Shop" brand; I've tried all of the "Extra Bolds"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!

review/summary: Differentiate Between Bold and Bitter
review/text: Some reviews here call this coffee "Bitter" - well all I have to say to them is: "Clean your pot" - if you can't handle a strong cup of coffee, go buy a latte and let people who like REAL coffee define - coffee - not a non-carbonated soft drink that you want so badly.<br /><br />Of all the K-Cups, this is by far the best coffee around. It is bold, strong, and keeps you wanting more. This is why its the best selling K-Cup around. I suggest that you shop wisely online for these, and buy in quantity, this is what I do - I get usually 12 24-Pack boxes. Me and my wife drink this daily - it truly is a great tasting coffee - without any of that ridiculous flavoring that some on here want - if you drink this you better wear pants - otherwise stay in your skirt and drink some Sanka!

If you drink Coffee, you really should get a subscription.<br /><br />On to the coffee. I'm pretty picky about coffee, this one I quite like. It's got character without being bitter, a bit of kick without being obnoxious. I would definitely pit it against a good coffee shop, and at the subscription price, it's a steal.

review/summary: the real bold coffee
review/text: I've chosen many bolds from the Amazon offers here as well as other on line shops. I always felt there left something more to be desired in each one I tried. This is the problem with the K-cup b/c the amount of coffee is limited, and when I am feeling like I want something stronger, which is often, I can't just put more in the hopper like I used to with the old machine. I often add another K cup after the first into teh same big cup. Also, often when I'd get to work I'd make another.<br /><br />I've had Emeril's Big Easy for a month now, and rarely have I felt like I needed to double the cups, or needed more when I get to work.<br /><br />I think that says it all.

It is everything advertised: Big (strong), Bold (great flavor), and Easy (not bitter at all). Another reviewer mentioned Newman's Own Extra Bold, which is also good, but for me, Emeril's wins without contest.

I couldn't even choke it down with 5 squirts into 6 oz of seltzer water.  My kids HATED it and now I have a large bottle of sugar-free "syrup" to find a home for. I would not recommend this product.

review/summary: LOVE it!!!
review/text: I LOVE Torani syrups in coffee, hot tea, and iced tea, which is what this peach was for. I bought this in sugar free because I am trying to cut sugar, and to me it tastes just like the regular. Maybe a touch less sweet - very nice! Some other flavors that were very good in their sugar free form:  Mango, Lime, Strawberry, Black Cherry and Raspberry. Sounds strange but Black Cherry and French Vanilla make a really good Italian soda and are also good together in iced tea, as are Mango and Coconut. Try some different combos, but don't shy away from sugar free, I don't notice much after taste and Im VERY picky about that... good stuff :)

review/summary: Wonderful Peach Flavor
review/text: I love the flavor of peach tea, but finding it can be quite a problem.  Now, I can serve it anytime.  I add the sugar free peach syrup and some lemon to a pitcher or glass of tea, and everyone is happy.  The flavor is marvelous - not too sweet or too tart.  I love all of the Torani flavors, but peach is the family favorite.  It also works well on ice cream, yogurt, even scones with cream cheese.  The delivery was fast and the product was well packaged.

review/summary: My Pugs Love Them
review/text: Our black pug eats anything, so using him to decide whether or not a new treat is good is not wise.  To him, everything is good.<br /><br />On the other hand, we have our fawn pug. He is the pickiest animal there ever was. At least it seems that way. These are the first and only harder type treats he has liked. He actually saves it for a long time while teasing our black pug. He plays hide and seek with it. After all of the hiding and growling, he eats its quickly.<br /><br />These are not that much cheaper than buying them locally, but saving even a little helps. Our pugs love these and did not get sick from them like a few others have stated in their reviews. Our black pug usually is the first to have bathroom problems with anything new, and he did not with these.<br /><br />We will be buying these again and again for those once-in-awhile treats.

review/summary: SUPERIOR VALUE AND QUALITY!
review/text: I have tried both flavors and was very impressed that not only did my Rottie like them, so did my picky Maltese.  The size worked just fine for both size dogs and there was some lasting chewing power which is what I was also looking for.  The ingredients are impressive.  I do like the idea that it is made in the USA and I tried both flavors.<br /> (But I do NOT understand how the previous reviewer can say they stay away from things that say made in the USA although they want items/ingredients from the USA.I get it that MAYBE the ingredients may not be, but even in doubt you at least have the USA quality controls.)<br />Now, down to the brass tacks... The price per ounce is RIDICULOUSLY REASONABLE for the QUALITY!  I calculate cost per piece and cost per ounce and how long it will keep my dog busy, clean their teeth and contribute to their health with high quality ingredients.  PLUS THEY WERE TASTY TO MY DOGS...VERY RARE! Neither my little Maltese nor my Rottie or my Maltweillers got sick.  That previous review was just plain craziness.  Cyn A. New York

review/summary: Gave My Wheaten Severe Diarrhea, vomiting and runs
review/text: Just as in one of the previous reviews, my dog (wheaten terrier) had severe liquid diarrhea a few hours after eating the Rachel Ray Nutrish Soup Bone product.  He ran outside as quickly as possible to "go" and seemed very embarrassed and panicked. After the "explosions" and him trying to scoot all over the grass, he was drooling and panting more than normal and curled up in a ball at the bottom of the basement steps, after which, he went straight in his kennel. Poor thing! I normally feed my dog Go! and Now! all natural and/or grain free dog foods, made in Canada and sold at an independent pet supply shop. Apparently, they are well worth the price.  Never again will I make an impulse treat purchase on a rare trip to Wal-Mart. I hope he recovers quickly and allows me to clean his bottom. Eeek! I blame Oprah. I bet she wouldn't feed her cocker spaniels this crap!

review/summary: Made both my dogs sick!
review/text: I bought the Soup Bones thinking that they would be a great treat for my dogs, a 70lb german shorthaired pointer and a 14lb shitzu. Several hours after eating them, my pointer had a rumbly stomach that was so loud I could hear it and she was rolling around, obviously uncomfortable. My shitzu started vomiting and had terrible diahrrea. He did not eat for a full day and threw up everything, even the water he drank. He was a very sick little dog! It was sad to see my dogs so miserable because of something I had given them. I do not reccommend giving these to your dog!

review/summary: Be Careful!! (if Amazon later decides to carry this product)
review/text: First of all, I decided to stay away from the chicken flavor since I found out just b/c dog treats & food say made in the USA, doesnt mean the chicken farm the company uses is also in the USA. I bought the "Real Beef & Barley Flavor" & it's not hard like in bone-hard. It begins to crumbles apart as the dogs chew it which was fine w/ me. I gave it 2 stars because it seems to have really healthy ingredients but still havent figured out why it made my dog so sick. The problem was, my 5 yr old dog (min pin) carried it around yet refused to eat the bone after sniffing it a few times. I figure he was just being picky because his 2yr old 23 lb son, Gordo, ate it (but got sick later). After eating 1 beef bone he wouldnt eat his doggie food the rest of the day & night. Less then 4,5 hrs, I seen Gordo at his water bowl then instantly threw the water up. There was very little traces of the beef bone tho ..until after 1 am. He kept waking me up by scratching my hands to rub his tummy. The minute he broke to go to their doggie pee & poop pads, I rolled over & quickly went back to sleep! In the morn, my son went to get a pair of clean socks out of the dryer & seen diarreha & pudding poop all over both pads & floor. I realized definitly it came from Gordo after checking both dog's butt butts. I cant seem to find any reviews on it but haven't looked at ALL the consumer sites yet. Just wanted to warn other pet owners to be careful. Thank God I didnt give Gordo 2 bone treats *whew*

review/summary: Crushed? More like total slush...
review/text: So, I previously purchased the "chunk" version of this product [Native Forest Organic Pineapple Chunks, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)] since I love pineapple, and they were delicious. The chunks were of a nice size, and even my cat kept bothering me when I ate them, as he apparently liked the sweetness of them.<br /><br />Then I saw this version, labeled as "crushed." The picture basically makes it look just like smaller chunks than the "chunk" version. But it's not. Instead, it's like this awful kind of sludge or mush, and for some reason it comes from a different country than the "crushed" version, and doesn't taste as good.<br /><br />In my opinion, stay away from "crushed" and go for the "chunk" version. I've also now ordered the "mini rings" variety to see how those are.

review/text: We have two dogs, one a medium-size dog, another large-size. I've tried many different brands and types, from super-market brands to expensive organic boutique products.  Yet, this is the one my two dogs like most so far.  The chewy meat bits blended with hard dry bits somehow induce their appetite, it seems. I used to do some extra work to let them eat commercial dog food (sometimes they didn't like it as is), such as moistening dry food, mixing with canned dog food, etc.  After finding this Pro Plan brand, no need to do so anymore.

Certainly not something you would cook with - it is a finishing oil.  A family member who knew I loved this brand saw a tin of the Basil infused oil and purchased it as a gift.  We tasted it and fell in love.  While we generally just use it on a good Ciabatta bread or on top of fresh pasta, my favorite use is to put it on top of a grilled steak!<br /><br />I have not yet tried the other infused oils from L'Olivier, but I look forward to trying them soon.

review/text: I have been using Sweet 10 for as long as I remember...35+ years.  A long time ago,  it was Pillsbury Sweet 10 & it came in a glass bottle.  I still have several glass bottles that I use to transfer the current Sweet 10 in to, as the current plastic bottles are worthless for dispensing the product.  They need to redesign these bottles. You can have a birthday waiting to squeeze out enough drops to do the job.  Be careful, as excessive squeezing will rupture the flimsy plastic bottle, resulting in Sweet 10 all over the counter.  This is real bad, as Sweet 10 has just become very expensive.  I recently ordered a case & it has doubled in price.  Why, I do not know.  Not happy with this, but nothing out there has the "taste of suger" like Sweet 10.  My grocery store has discontinued carrying Sweet 10.  The only place I can get it is Amazon.  No problem with this, but I am not happy with the price.

To be fair, I liked them the most the 4th time I ate them and really savored and enjoyed them. But if I was only going by my personal opinion I would have given this 3 stars.
