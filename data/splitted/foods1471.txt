This is a strong, bold tasting coffee.  It is excellent. It is not bitter and has no aftertaste.  However, your mileage may vary....

review/summary: Work for Me
review/text: Cashews are my favorite nuts. Even cashews in a can bring back fond memories of the warm almonds bought at the Nut House in Cape May each year. No, the Emerald Whole Cashews don't match the magic of those ocean side cashews, but in their own right they are some excellent tasting nuts.<br /><br />I like the Emerald cashews because they are whole, sweet, and not overly oily or salty. They are seasoned perfectly and totally satisfy my cashew cravings. Today Mrs. Spudman opened a can of CVS whole cashews; of course, I had to open a canister of Emerald nuts for a comparison. The Emerald cashews surpassed the other in size, taste, and enjoyment.<br /><br />Emerald cashews aren't the least expensive snack, but they surpass most others. Be sure to eat these in moderation to avoid too high an intake of fat and /or calories.

review/summary: It's hard to eat just a few of them!
review/text: Cashews are the tastiest (and one of the costliest) of the what we call nuts. Although a nut in the culinary sense, in the botanical sense the fruit of the cashew is actually a seed that grows from the cashew tree. Their caloric numbers may be a bit high, but they provide surprising amounts of potassium, protein, and dietary fiber.<br /><br />That being said, these are some of the tastiest cashews that you'll find, and they have no trans fat, either. Must also note that Emerald's "On the Go" canister" is an excellent variation from the standard packaging, featuring a handy lid that seems about right to measure a single portion.<br /><br />Pros: Good sized cashews (Emerald says they're "25% larger than that other brand"); very few pieces. Lightly salted with an excellent natural buttery cashew taste. No trans fat.<br /><br />Cons: oil and sodium... but it's the salt that makes them great.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup)<br />Servings per container: 10<br />Calories per serving: 160<br />Calories from fat: 120<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want some really flavorsome cashews, Emerald does a tremendous job with these. For those who prefer a slightly less costly alternative, just try Emerald Nuts Cashew Halves & Pieces, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4), and for an interesting (and highly-recommended) five-star taste treat, you might want to try Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashew, 10oz Canister (Pack of 4). All of these have outstanding natural buttery cashew taste, and are packaged in the same handy canister.<br /><br />Warning: any of these can be habit-forming!

review/summary: Just What the Doctor Ordered
review/text: My wife is the big lover of cashews in the family, I can usually take them or leave them, preferring almonds.  But recently--since she goes through quite a few cans of Walgreens brand cashews a month, I decided place a (4-pack) subscribe and save order for "Emerald Nuts Whole Cashews."  When the box arrived i took one can to work with me to snack on between meals; doctor's suggestion.<br /><br />I have say for the record that I like "Emerald Nuts Whole Cashews" much better than the store brand I had been buying.  The cashews are thicker and taste smother, and are thus more enjoyable going down.  And the 10-ounce can last longer that the store-brand I have purchase for the last five years or so.

review/summary: stale, odd flavor
review/text: Cashews are my favorite nut. Even when they're bad, they can still be rather good. And there are so many ways they can go wrong: they can be oily and slippery, oversalted, or flavorless from being roasted too lightly.<br /><br />These Emerald cashews don't have any of those problems. The canister is a convenient shape and size. The price I paid on Amazon is reasonable.<br /><br />However, they suffer from a terrible flaw -- they taste stale! The beautiful roasted milky flavor of the cashew suffers from a  horrible aftertaste, like they were roasted in bad oil or stored in a hot warehouse too long. The expiration date for these is 1-1/2 years from this date, so I don't know exactly what went wrong. I'm not quite sure how I'll eat these -- maybe by blending them with other cashews from other sources. In any event, I cancelled my Subcribe & Save order.

review/text: I love Hazelnut coffee and these are my favorite.. I just wish they were a bit more cost efficient.  My husband does not drink coffee so I purchased the single coffee maker and the Green Mountain hazelnut has definitely been my favorite of all the coffee pods I've tried, but sometimes it is hard to justify the price when I can make a whole pot of more upscale flavored coffee for a whole lot cheaper (of course then I end up drinking the whole pot).  I think that the flavor is great.. almost too good that sometimes I'm tempted to drink more cups than I should!! It seems to me that if you buy in more quantity that the price per pod should go down more than just a few pennies.

review/summary: Scrumptious coffee!
review/text: The Swiss Chocolate Almond is the only coffee I have in the mornings since my family discovered Red Buffalo in 2006 or 2007. We did try the same flavor description from four other vendors in the past. We are repeat customers simply because the flavor is perfect, unlike anything else with a similar description made by other coffee vendors. This last time we ordered, we ran out and had to be satisfied with another brand, and there just were no happy mornings for the adults in this family those two mornings. This particular coffee is fully flavored, but has pretty overtones, with just the right amount of (hmmm) sweetness (?) to make it not need additional cream or sugar. The aroma is out of this world. It is not harsh like the coffee from that company with the green circular logo that has the drive-through window. That coffee could grow hair on your chest! This coffee does not irritate my stomach with acidity like other brands have done in the past. I do not get jittery either.<br /><br />Each package is sealed and labeled, and can be resealed, but I use a rubber sealed canister. The packages Red Buffalo ships make beautiful, thoughtful gifts. I buy the ground version, but I seem to remember that the whole bean was once ordered by us by mistake and the coffee was just as good either way. We know that life needs a few special touches and this coffee certainly helps.

I've been purchasing this elsewhere online for months, and looked forward to ditching the shipping costs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even with shipping, the price of two 24-count boxes on the other site is a good $10 cheaper than the $38.99 offered here.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee
review/text: I really enjoy flavored coffees, and Green Mountain Mocha Nut Fudge is one of my favorites.  The flavors aren't over-powering, and give just the right blend of mocha and roasted nuts.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a weak spot for mocha.  If you're looking for a strong, dark roast, this will not be the coffee for you.  It's just a very pleasing way to start the day.

review/summary: Just Okay
review/text: I purchased this flavor because I had read on another site that it was the closest available flavor to the now discontinued Gloria Jean's "Holiday Traditions." It doesn't really even come close.<br /><br />It is a light to medium strength coffee with a nutty aftertaste. It isn't sweet. The smell when brewing is a little artificial. I don't find the chocolate or caramel notes at all. That being said, I prefer any of the hazelnut k-cups available to the nut taste in "Mocha Nut Fudge." And if you are looking for a chocolate/nut combination in a light to medium blend, Gloria Jean's "Swiss Chocolate Almond" is much more enjoyable for me.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's okay and I will finish the box, but won't be ordering it again. If you are looking for a nut flavored coffee with more of a mixed nut taste, you might enjoy it.

review/summary: Mocha Nut Fudge? I'm a NUT  for wasting money on it. lol
review/text: This coffee is weak and a major disappointment. I gambled on this coffee because of the 3 positive reviews. I bought a 24 pack of the Mocha Nut Fudge and I'm seriously considering tossing the 22 remaining k-cups. Sad statement.<br />It's advisable when there are hardly any reviews to look elsewhere for MORE reviews. I found some other sites with dozens of reviews of this coffee and my thoughts on it were confirmed.. I'm not crazy :)<br /><br />How is it disappointing? Well, there is virtually NO flavour. It is a light roast coffee. I was expecting something chocolately, nutty,fudgy?lol.. with a definitive aftertaste.<br /><br />When I first bought my Keurig machine, I ran out and bought the usual coffee shop style coffees and an assortment of flavoured coffees, such as: "Butter Toffee", "Cinnamon Pastry", "Hazelnut", "Macadamia Nut Cookie" and... you guessed it.. Mocha Nut Fudge :(  Well, people, Butter Toffee rocks, Cinnamon Pastry is yummy , Hazelnut is very good, Macadamia Nut Cookie is more on the mellow side, but is still enjoyable. Mocha Nut Fudge is now sadly taking up space in my cupboard..ahaha.<br />Moral of the story is read other reviews on other sites. Loving my Keurig KUB40 though. :)

review/summary: Can't be without M&Ms!
review/text: My two vices, if you want to call them that, are coffee and chocolate. I keep both in the house at all times. M&Ms are just very satisfying when the chocolate craving hits, and it makes sense to have the biggest bag on hand if you crave it a lot! This size is also ideal for a party. I like that these bags are reclosable. Some chocolate has hydrogenated oil, but not M&Ms! Maybe food coloring isn't ideal, but oh well, they are such a happy snack! And they are easy to enjoy -- M&Ms don't make a melty mess like a chocolate bar. If you purposely put some in a warm place, the chocolate melts inside the crispy candy shell, which is a yummy sensation when you eat them!<br /><br />My stars and review are for the product only. I really wish Amazon would start to carry these at a comparable price with prime shipping (especially with subscribe and save!). Until then, I stock up when they go on sale for eight bucks at my local Target, drugstore or grocery store.

Arrived promptly.<br /><br />Just a heads up if you are planning on serving to guests.<br /><br />If for yourself, zip top bag for easy storage!!

review/summary: really not very good
review/text: I don't get it- why even produce peanut-less M&M's?  The whole point -and the reason people eat M&M's- is because the delicious chocolate eventually melts away to a tasty peanut in the middle.  Without the peanut, it's like petting a dog without any fur, or drinking water out of a bucket.  There's hardly anything appealing about the taste of regular chocolate M&M's because it's the same taste as several other types of chocolates.  Nothing special, memorable or fulfilling about them.  And to spend over 10 bucks for a bag?  Get out of town right now.

review/text: I am severely disappointed in the shipment of five pounds of M&M's .They were delivered to me in an package meant to ship small rigid things in and not something that is fragile like m&ms .When were received them today ,not only was the package torn open ,they were left in the sun to melt at the front door and the candies were all loose in a postal or fedex envelope. I will never buy from your company again. This is a product meant to be consumed and not a item that is non perishable.. Would you want to eat candy that is loose in a shipment bag and melted..I am very upset with you !<br /><br />UPDATE. This company contacted me immediately and apologized and sent super fast replacement in nice box with bubble wrap. I have changed my mind, I will do busisness with again and recommend them highly for very quick reply with complaint and great customer service . Thank you !

review/summary: Healthy alternative?
review/text: M&M's are never recommended for your health.  They are high calorie for their size and weight, and 'empty calories' at that.  Still, chocolate has been found to have beneficial properties (in moderation).  Also, a few M&M's in place of a full dessert is also a convenience and money saver, as well as calorie saver.<br />The problem comes when you stop taking a few from the jar and instead put that jar by your side as you watch TV or work on-line.  THEN, these candies convert from harmless snack to a real diet problem.  It's up to you and your self-control.  To be honest, I used them as a harmless snack for a while and then broke down. (I admit it.)  So, as for this author, I just cannot have that huge bag of temptation in the house, the car, or anywhere within 100 yards of me...

review/text: I can't slight the product.  Anything that contributes to the wealth of 4 or 5 of the richest Americans(the Marz family) can't be bad.  But, you might want to wait until we are past the summer months.  Somehow these babies were overheated when under pressure?<br /><br />OMG, I opened the bag to discover crumbled and re-solidified M&Ms.  Broken chunks and pieces.  Possibly 20% of the individual M&Ms were okay.  The rest were ArM&Mageddon.  Guernica in chocolate & M&M colors.  Shist, geologically that is!  That's  what the chunks remind me of.<br /><br />So, what am I doing?  I'm eating them, 1 to 2 inch chunks at a time.  True, I can't sort my colors and I don't know how many M&M's equal a Chunk. Still they're an exceptional product.  Yum.

review/summary: Product Arrived Damaged Twice- UPDATE!!!
review/text: I had the same experience as another reviewer. I love this dressing and my local supermarket stopped carrying the product so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. My shipment arrived poorly packaged. All the bottles were leaking and the seals had been broken. Considering that the dressing needs to be refrigerated after being opened I did not want to eat it. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement order free of charge. The second shipment was no better and I had to discard all the bottles. I wonder if Amazon is responsible for the poor packaging or if it is the vendor and whether or not it may be the heat during shipping that is causing all the seals to be broken.<br /><br />UPDATE: The manufacturer/company contacted me after this review and offered to send me a case of their dressing for my troubles. It arrived in a matter of days and all the bottles were undamaged. Their customer service is impeccable, making sure to follow up with me after I had received the delivery to ensure all was ok. I loved this product before and love it even more now. Wonderful experience! Thank you, WAFU!

review/summary: NOT AT ALL LIKE JAPANESE STEAKHOUSE DRESSING!
review/text: The consistency is watery, and the taste is extremely sweet.  I assumed it would've tasted just like the dressings from the Japanese Steakhouses.  I only bought this item because of the reviews and I saw it a had 5 star rating on it.  From this experience, I decided not to ever base a purchase on Amazon solely on the reviews or star ratings ever again!  Beware!!

review/summary: Urine for a surprise!!!
review/text: To be fair, I was looking for the Japanese Style, roasted Sesame Dressing, that seems to only be available in...wait for it...JAPAN.  I bought this junk, opened it, and it smelled an awful lot like urine, and the taste wasn't much better.  I have no idea what people put this on, I can't imagine this stuff, making anything taste better.  But like I said, this review may be unfair, since I was expecting a deep roasted, creamy sesame dressing, and all I got was a pungent vinegar based nostril burning disaster.  If I was looking for something with enough vinegar in it, to make my kitchen smell like pee, then the buck stops here!!!

review/text: Wow this vinaigrette is probably the most disgusting thing i ever ate!<br /><br />I just came back from Japan after staying there for more than a year i saw this a the local supermarket and bought it at 5$ which i pretty expensive for the quantity.<br /><br />I thought that for 5$ i was betting on quality...<br /><br />Wow was i wrong when i open the bottle an awful smell came out of it!<br /><br />I currently live in canada and japanese steakhouse and real japanese salad dressing are two different thing.

Secondly, as a recently quit smoker, I am fast becoming addicted to these.<br /><br />These little babies pack a punch, in fact they are so strong that the first few times you try them, you may even notice a slight burn on your tongue.<br /><br />The tin is very small and fits perfect in a pocket or purse.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Sugar free<br />Small pocket size tin<br /><br />Cons:<br />None

review/summary: Nice, Light refreshing Green Iced Tea
review/text: I Love the Lipton Green tea with Citrus in the bottle and I go through 2 or so cases a month, BUT I'm trying to cut down on buying the bottles so much so I decided to try this and it's REALLY good.  I used to purchase the 4C brand Green iced tea mix, but it's very dark (and is very staining to the teeth) and this is so great, it's a very pale green color and tastes very similar to the green iced tea that I get from my local Chinese restaurant (which makes me wonder if they use this, lol)  It has a very slight citrus flavor, not really lemon, not lime either, maybe pineapple-ish? But it's really really Good!<br />I was a little disappointed in the size of the can, since I'm so used to the 20 quart size.. wish this came in a bigger size since broken down this is just over $3 a can.. but I'm not complaining at all, this is IMPOSSIBLE to find in the supermarket around here.

review/summary: Tastes like the pure leaf green tea with honey and lemon in the glass bottle!!! I love this stuff!
review/text: I first found and became addicted to Lipton Green tea with honey and lemon in the glass bottle 5 years ago . I'm not a huge tea drinker. I tried the other flavors of Lipton in the bottle that were nowhere near as good and even other brands of green tea that never did it for me. This stuff has the perfect light flavor with that twist of lemon and tang of honey. It's just an incredibly refreshing mix, but kind of expensive at 1.49 a bottle.  I tried to save money by making my own green tea using the Lipton green tea bags and sugar and adding my own honey and lemon. Too much work and didn't taste quite the same. I then tried to buy the bottles in bulk, but could never find a supplier. And then for almost two years I couldn't find it at all. I feared they had taken this flavor off the market and replaced it with that terrible Lipton green tea with citrus in the plastic bottles. So when I found it again in the glass bottles last year, I jumped for joy and started drinking it again even at the ridiculous premium I had to pay. And then last week I saw this can in the store. I immediately picked it up and looked at the ingredient list: Sugar, citric acid, honey and lemon just like the stuff in the bottle. I bought it, took it home , mixed it up, and finally I had my tea at a reasonable price!! I can mix up like 20 bottles of this stuff with one can at like 30 cents a bottle. I'm saving like 25 bucks on every full can I use. Needless to say, I'm stocking up on this stuff.

review/summary: Good jerky, too much pepper!!
review/text: The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!

review/summary: Never again
review/text: I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

review/text: The price was very good, but I guess I know why.  I gave it 1 star because it's low in carbs and another because it's edible.  There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

review/summary: Horrible at WSOP
review/text: So I have been hanging with a top player at the world series of poker and I purchased 2 packages of Jacks Links beef jerky.  These 2 purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money.  The meat was so dry I was not sure if I was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey.  The "meat" caused sickness and lock jaw.  Jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes.  It was pretty incredible of them to sponser the WSOP but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price.

review/summary: Great snack....even during battle!!
review/text: I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!
