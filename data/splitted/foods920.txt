review/summary: my cats can't get enough
review/text: I have tried a lot, I mean a whole lot of cat food.  My two cats are so picky and I can never really tell what they will eat.  They loved the first can of this and I thought, well, we will see what happens in a coupld days.  They go through food like Sherman through Atlanta and even though I have only had the food for a couple of days, they have eaten six cans!  Little piglets.  I love this food.  The consistency is nice and juicey and my cats appreciate that.  If you are looking for a good quality, tasty food, order this.

review/summary: Confessions of a Finicky Eater, Part Two
review/text: Hello. My name is Maggie, and I'm a finicky eater. I'm one of three furry beings that share a dwelling with our friend Two Legs, and the food that is usually served is gross. Fancy Feast! Ugh. I refuse. Poached salmon I grudgingly nibble on because of the omega oil (makes my fur shiny). I do like sirloin steak when it is cooked precisely medium rare...but wait!<br /><br />Two Legs is opening up something new!<br />It smells wonderful. Enticing.<br />Looks good too.<br />WOW. What a flavor.<br />Tuna and Shrimp. Tuna and Sole! Yellowfin! And the Snapper is the cat's pajamas.<br />I'm in heaven.<br />Thank you Two Legs. From now on, only buy Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (the Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie is delectable too).

review/summary: Our cats love these Petite Cuisine meals
review/text: I love the smaller size of these cans so the cats can eat them in one sitting, and the quality seems very high.  The cats both love them, and they are know to be picky eaters.  My husband commented they looked like 'people food' :) I think this is a very good product and I would buy it again.

review/summary: The Cats' meow
review/text: We have two cats and they are picky with their "crunchy" food and seem to like most "soft" cat food. They both liked this soft food and didn't have any issues with it. Sometimes they've not liked some of the soft food and cat vomit is not fun to clean up.<br /><br />The cats heard me opening up the food and would bolt into the kitchen and lick their bowls clean. That is a five claw rating.

review/summary: A Winner!
review/text: Well, the other reviewer are correct; this is a very fine cat food. Yes, it looks and smells tasty--flakey chunks in gravy. Probably tastes as good as human food (and just as expensive, but I presume it is formulated for cats). I like the way it is packaged and the small servings are just right. I actually divide it in half for my two cats, because I free-feed them kibble. They snarf it down!

review/summary: My cats love it...
review/text: Our cats love soft cat food, so I was not surprised when they quickly devoured Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />One of our cats is allergic to corn products, so I was pleased to discover that Petite Cuisine doesn't contain corn or corn products.  It's also free of wheat gluten.  Vitamin supplements are added into the food - Vitamins E, A, and D3.  Our cats have digested it without any noticeable problems.<br /><br />The 24-can pack contains six cans each of "Red Snapper Entree," "Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree," "Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entree," and "Yellow Fin Tuna Entree."  Our cats especially love the Yellow Fin Tuna, and they eat every last morsel.  Some pieces get left behind with the Red Snapper and the Tuna and Shrimp flavors, however, maybe because the fish pieces are larger (I suppose I could mash it up for them, though.)  The product's packaging promises "no bad odors," and they're really not that bad -- unless you can't stand the smell of fish.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine seems to be kind of spendy; it costs about twice what you'd pay for a can of Friskies, and the cans of Petite Cuisine are smaller.  After giving my cats Petite Cuisine, I went to the grocery store to look at similar cat food products, and discovered there are several very similar items (to P.C.) on the market, and for a lot cheaper.<br /><br />So yes, there are cheaper options.  But in terms of taste and kitty appreciation, this was a hit.

review/summary: The Cats Came Running!
review/text: I was so excited to treat my 3 kitties to "People Food for Cats" ~ Petite Cuisine!!  They eat dry food daily and then once in awhile they get the moist food as a special treat.<br /><br />In opening the can, there was not the overwhelming ucky fishy smell that most moist cat foods have.  And it looked like people food too!  I portioned out on one plate 3 equal helpings and called in the calvary!<br /><br />As they licked, the plate rotated on the floor ...ha ha!!... and so did they!!  They followed their portion around like it was the last thing they were ever gonna get to eat!<br /><br />The response ... a resounding purrrrr and then paw-licking/face cleaning!  They loved it!  And that was just the  Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree!!<br /><br />Each day after they got a new flavor, Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, and Steamed Tuna and Shrimp ... responses were all the same! 2 paws straight up from my kitties!!<br /><br />Highly recommended for humans owned by cats everywhere!!<br />- 1smileycat :-)

review/summary: Reminds Me of Garden Medley
review/text: This cat food looks and smells a lot like the Fancy Feast premium brand, Garden Medley, that comes in the green cans. (Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium brand, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this brand because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast brand.)<br /><br />I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.<br /><br />Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal.

review/summary: 50/50 response from family cats
review/text: The quality of this cat food is excellent, with fish broth and the named fish (tuna, red snapper, sole, shrimp, or yellowfin) listed as the first (i.e., primary) ingredients.  It is 100% nutritionally complete, with no grain fillers.  When you pop the top on the single-serve can, it looks and smells like exactly what it is -- fish and shrimp.  Obviously, the fish smells like fish, but it's a natural, clean fish smell, not a nasty cat-food odor.  I swear, the steamed tuna and shrimp, with its whole shrimp, looked good enough to set out with crackers for a human appetizer!<br /><br />Although I would feed this food to my cats without hesitation, I felt I had to downgrade it one star because of the cats' opinions.  I fed this to three family cats, and being cats, each had its own opinion, but none endorsed it 100%.  One cat loved the steamed tuna and shrimp, one wouldn't go near it.  One gobbled up the yellowfin tuna, two picked at and left most of it.  My son's cat is notoriously fussy about canned food, and ate only one of these entrees with enthusiasm; my two cats are notoriously unfussy, but ate only two wholeheartedly (however, they usually prefer poultry flavors to fish).<br /><br />Petite Cuisine comes in handy single-serving cans and, as I mentioned, contains excellent ingredients with no foul odor or appearance.  If your cat generally likes fish flavors and you are looking for a high quality, healthy cat food, I would certainly recommend trying Petite Cuisine.

review/summary: 12 cats later.....
review/text: With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn't take me long to test this product!<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- one Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Steamed Tuna and Sole Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Yellow Fin Tuna Entr&eacute;e<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included an equal number of each flavor) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the "gravy" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the chunks of seafood. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e: fish broth, Tuna filets, Red Snapper Fillets, soy bean oil, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Carrageenan, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 13%, crude fat (min) 1.5%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%, taurine (min) 0.1%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on all four flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cat Goes On Hunger Strike
review/text: I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.

review/text: Well, he's a cat. I opened the can, spooned it down on his dish, and he ate it. Not all in one sitting, but he did gobble. Bear in mind though that this cat denuded a mouse and has gnawed on baby rabbits, so he will eat things that don't smell like seafood and are not on an attractive ceramic plate.<br /><br />I suppose the true taste test would be to partake of it myself, but Amazon Vine, I'm not willing to go there, even for you.<br /><br />The cans are on the smaller side, the smell was not overpowering. The product is made in Thailand, if that information would help you decide whether to purchase.<br /><br />Personally, I'm sticking to Red Lobster for my seafood. But I can't take my cat there.

review/summary: My Cat Loves It
review/text: Granted, my cat does not have the most discriminating taste (I've seen him happily munching on lizards and cockroaches), but I can tell he really likes this food. He usually breezes by whenever he feels like it to eat the dry food I leave in his bowl. Since I have been giving him Petite Cuisine, he is ready and waiting by his bowl at meal time. I have to push his head out of the way so that I can finish emptying the can into his dish.<br /><br />Most canned cat foods look like fishy hummus or strange, extruded rubbery strips, but this food looks just like what you get when you open a can of tuna, except with more sauce. The shrimp flavor has tiny recognizable shrimp in it.<br /><br />Full Crazy Cat Lady Disclosure: Before I would let my babies eat a new cat food, I did a little (ok, hours) of due diligence research on Petite Cuisine. After the Chinese pet food debacle, I wasn't about to let them eat food produced by an unknown foreign entity. According to what I could find on the internet, PetPlay Inc. is a relatively new American startup by CEO Eric Weber. He has years of experience with the premium cat food market; was part of the team that launched the Fancy Feast brand and ran the Friskies Japan division (both part of the Nestle SA family).<br /><br />(According to the SoCal Buzz podcast I listened to, he even worked for Hello Kitty. I particularly loved his remark about cat owners being "a little more illogical" than other pet owners, therefore they are more likely to spend money for premium products - I resemble that remark.)<br /><br />Yes, the cat food is produced in Thailand, but it is not associated with any of the companies involved in recalls for Thailand or China, and is not on any of the FDA's lists. They have nutritional facts and a nutrient analysis for each product readily available on their website [...]

review/summary: Two Paws Up!!
review/text: I cannot really comment my own opinions on this product since for obvious reasons I will not be sampling it but I will trust the vendor that it is every bit as good for my cat as they say.  How would I know differently anyway?  All I can tell you is my cat's reaction.  This consisted of the following:<br /><br />"Meowwwww! Errowwww!" (as I am dishing it out)  After placing it on the floor there was copious munching and slurping until the bowl was empty followed by licking of chops to devour anyy stray morsel that may have stuck to a whisker and then a forlorn look that indicated the preceding events should be repeated.  I'll take that as two paws up or whatever the feline equivalent is to the Siskel & Ebert sign of approval.<br /><br />None of this is any great surprise.  The noted finickiness of cats usually applies to dry food.  Place a bowl of any random dead animal parts in front of them and they are far more decisive.  Still, this was an especially energetic performance and hence the high rating.

review/text: Unlike other fish catfood, this product does not have that strong fishy smell.  Nice flaky chunks of fish in some nice gravy.<br /><br />However Ms Cassiopia lapped up the gravy and left the fish.  This has happened with other food so it is no reflection on the product.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars but since I won't be buying it, I gave it 4.  If your cat will eat food other than pate, you will want to give this a try.  Looks almost like something you would eat.<br /><br />I have given the remainder of the package to a less fortunate friend.<br />Her cat will probably eat it and expect it all the time.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />MEF

review/summary: You can see this is quality food when you open the can
review/text: I have 3 cats.  2 are inside and 1 is outside.  They all loved this food, especially my outdoors cat.  Unfortunately, my dog liked it even more, and it became a bit of a problem keeping him away while they were eating, and it normally is not a problem.  He is a very picky dog who loves fish, so I could tell by his reaction that the seafood taste was definitely good.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the can, I could see that this food includes real flake tuna - it is not very much different in appearance than Starkist tuna in the can for people.  It does not have that terrible smell that some wet catfoods do, (Like the Meow Mix Wholesome Goodness).  That is nice, because with some catfoods if you open the can and some flys on you, you have to go shower or smell like a fishmarket.  This food is not stinky like that.  It has a good enough smell to excite the cats, but the human noses here did not smell it in our trash or from across the room.<br /><br />I watched my cats closely, and my dog as well, since he got 'into it' and it treated their digestive systems well. Sometimes new food will make them sick, but this food did not in the least.<br />I am only giving this a 4 star because my cats did not finish the red snapper flavor either time I put it down for them.  They ate maybe 1/2 of it.  I don't think they liked that particular flavor as well as the others.  They ALL liked the yellowfin tuna the best.

review/summary: Pricey but my cats love it
review/text: Petite cuisine is probably the best cat food I have ever bought for my cats.  Open the can and it looks and smells like people food.  The ingredients are basically fish, vitamins, and minerals.  There are no meat by-products or fish by-products and if you know what "by-products" are you will be happy about that. If you are concerned about your pet's health, this is a great food. And if your cat is finicky about what she eats, then this is a wonderful food.<br /><br />This size variety pack is quite a savings over the 4-packs so if you are sure your cats will like it then it is worth it to buy this size.  Some cats don't mind having the same food every day and some cats might not like each flavor so whether to get the variety pack of 24 or the single flavor pack of 24 is up to you and your cat.  My cats love all 4 flavors and I'll bet your fish loving cat will too!

review/text: According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione "produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung." Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.

review/summary: made my kitties into addicts
review/text: We have three cats. The two older ones are huge, 10-year-old DSH males, litter mates, who have been separated about 5 days their entire lives and have had just about the best of everything all along. The third is a 5-year-old Siamese male who adopted us as a tiny kitten; he was malnourished and his physical condition showed it when he came to my back porch 4.5 years ago.<br /><br />All are at healthy weights and are active. The big cats are not obese - they're just large cats. I always have dry IAMS available as kibble 24/7, and I give them each a portion of canned food a couple of times a day; they do not ask for food unless they are hungry. The older cats don't like poultry or beef (read: loudly whine for seafood when presented with chicken, in stunned disbelief that I'm not running a restaurant after the 5,391 times they've already complained). The Siamese isn't as picky because he was a stray until he found us. Mushy, gooey loaf? Won't eat it at all. Texture is important.<br /><br />I had not heard of this brand before I saw it here on Amazon.com and I have not seen it locally. Since my little monsters enjoy food, like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B6IFY">Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food Grilled 3-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>,  I thought I'd try the 'Subscribe & Save' option for a couple of months to see if they like Petite Cuisine too.<br /><br />Verdict: they're absolutely nuts about it. We call it 'kitty crack' - if there was a rehab or 12-step program for addicted cats, I'd have to send all three of mine for treatment. They can't get enough of it.<br /><br />This is definitely not fish 'flavored' food. The cans are chock full of fish, with tiny shrimp, flaky red snapper, tuna, and whitefish. It smells like fish but it doesn't have a fishy or stale odor. The cans open easily and not much sticks to the bottom and sides of the can - I can just dump food into a bowl without using a utensil to get the last bits out. The aroma and appearance are so good that _I'd_ eat it if I had to do so.<br /><br />I have read and noted concerns about menadione. However, high doses mentioned in some studies aren't equivalent to the small amount contained per portion in this food. To me, the benefits outweigh the risks. Best of all, my Siamese has developed a shiny, thick, ultra-soft coat which he did not have before he started eating this food. He's almost as soft as a chinchilla.<br /><br />In short: looks great, smells great, and I have happy, happy cats. A winner. :-)

review/summary: Great Food, Bad CS
review/text: First of all, I am subscribed to receive two boxes of the variety pack every month. My cats LOVE the food and refuse to eat other canned food. I have tried to give them more expensive, better quality food but they only want Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />That said, I am quite disappointed at P.C.'s customer service. After researching on menadione, I emailed P.C. and asked if they plan to not use menadione in near future. I never heard back from them. Before this, I received an email from them with a coupon code. I tried to copy and paste the code on their web site and it didn't work. I emailed their CS and they told me that the coupon was working. Come to find out, they misspelled the coupon on the email. The code contained the word "cuisine" and they misspelled it. I emailed them back about it and they didn't responded nor sent out another email with the correction. Very disappointing indeed...<br /><br />In the future, if I find another brand that did not contain menadione and had better customer service, and I would instantly switch over to the new brand. Well, my cats have to like the new food too, which is why I haven't able to give them something else yet.

review/summary: Cuisine for kitties
review/text: We've gone through all of the flavors now three times.  Both cats chowed down quite happily on the food.  The boy got quite vocal and insistent the next few days about how much he wanted more of the wet food.  Far, far more vocal than he got after getting the 9 Lives canned food before.  Judging from that it seems to be tastier.<br /><br />It definitely looks more appealing to me.  Actual flakes of fish, small shrimp, no unpleasant smell beyond a slight seafood smell.  After putting the food into a bowl the can doesn't look nasty either.  White interior, no discoloration spots.  A quick rinse gets rid of any remaining juices before tossing the can in the recycle bin.<br /><br />Can is made of aluminum, not steel.  Cans are opened with a pull-tab, no can opener required.  The other cat food we had varied; some flavors had a tab on the can to open it and others required a can opener.  In our house it's much nicer when it has a tab to open.  Otherwise I had to go hunting for the can opener after pulling the bowls out of the cupboard.  And of course the cats heard the clang of the bowls coming out of the cupboard which meant they appeared within seconds and promptly started exclaiming how much they wanted the wet stuff while weaving in between the legs in an attempt to get me to give them the food as fast as possible.  We all know how difficult it can be to dodge cats weaving around underfoot  while digging through drawers and cupboards searching for the can opener.<br /><br />Amusingly, the label lists the product as being gluten free.  Not something I expected to see on the label.<br /><br />Overall we're pleased.  I'm not offended by the way the product looks or smells  and the cats love it.  My only complaint is that it is rather pricey compared to other options.<br /><br />Update Feb 17, 2009:<br />Well, after trying this I started sampling some other upscale cat foods.  I also started reading the ingredients.  I had no idea that wheat gluten was such a common ingredient.  Now that makes sense.<br /><br />As for price, it is close to the price range for other upscale / premium / gourmet (whatever you want to call the  small expensive cans) cat foods. Without subscribe & save the pricing is a bit higher here compared to what the other premium foods go for in the local stores.  With subscribe & save there isn't as much difference.<br /><br />I didn't think I would want to spend this much on cat food yet I just ordered some more.  To me there is significant value in that it doesn't have that 'canned cat food' smell.  You know what I'm talking about, and it really isn't a great way to wake up in the morning.  It also helps that Petite Cuisine is more visually appealing than the other stuff.<br /><br />The menadione thing?  From what I can find that may be valid.  Most of the stuff online references (and quotes) one article but the material safety sheet does have notes about toxicity of the substance to human organs at high doses.  It is in other pet foods as well, not just Petite Cuisine, so if you're concerned about it you need to read the label of any product.<br /><br />I did contact the company asking about it and stated that I was concerned about its use in their product.  If enough people contact them about it explaining their concern they may rethink using it as an ingredient.  For me, I'll probably use it in rotation with other foods.  Hopefully I can find something that doesn't stink and doesn't have any potentially objectionable ingredients.

review/summary: good food, but may not please picky cats
review/text: After trying all the flavors I found that 2 of my cats love this food.  The 3rd cat, notoriously picky, will only eat the yellowfin flavor.  He doesn't seem to like foods with whole chunks in them, but he is very fond of thinner foods with gravy.  There is less gravy in these cans than you find in "regular" store bought food, which means you get more actual food.  Good for us, but not so good for my picky cat who wants nothing but gravy!<br /><br />It's somewhat comforting to see recognizable bits of food in the cans.  The shrimp in the tuna & shrimp flavor especially is neat - they're whole salad shrimp.  Also, the food sits well with them.  The price isn't much more than what you'd pay for good food at a pet shop.  All in all I would recommend trying this.

review/summary: Healthy Feline Cuisine For Your Finicky Cat(s)
review/text: Most people know that cats can be finicky eaters.  They devour some food and simply walk away from others.  I guess that is one trait that I find most interesting about our three Bengal cats.  They can eat like horses and yet are rather picky about what foods they will eat.  They all like tuna, ham, and even beg for a potato chip from time to time, yet they don't seem to care for turkey and even some types of cheese.  My family and I love our cats very much, and we are concerned about their health and want to feed them nutritious food.  Since all of our Bengals love chicken, I was delighted to recently have the opportunity to try the new Petite Cuisine Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie Variety Pack.<br /><br />We received a 24 pack, which includes 6 individual boxes, each containing two 3 oz. cans of Sesame Chicken and two 3 oz. cans of Chicken Pot Pie cat food.  The ingredients for each flavor are as follows:<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Carrots, Sesame oil, Soy bean oil, Rice, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Tapioca starch, Calcium sulfate, Salt, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Sweet Potato, Carrots, Soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Calcium sulfate, Olive oil, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />As you can see, the ingredients in the two flavors are nearly identical.  One controversial ingredient contained in both flavors is Menadione Sodium Bisulfite, which is a synthetic version of vitamin K.  MSB has been called "potentially harmful" by many researchers, and is not allowed in human food.  However, the FDA does not restrict the use of MSB in pet foods, and these pet foods are even able to proudly claim "Natural" on the label, even if it contains this un-natural ingredient.  Studies indicate that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite can be toxic in high doses, and the tests indicate that this synthetic vitamin supplement can prove toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, and mucous membranes.  Since I only use the Petite Cuisine food as a supplement to my cat's regular food, I don't consider the levels of MSB to be high enough to put my animals in any danger.  However, it is up to the owner to determine if they find this risk acceptable or not.  You can find more information about Menadione (Vitamin K3) here:<br /> http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=menadione<br /><br />The manufacturer website (http://www.petitecuisine.com) says that "Petite Cuisine is People Food for Cats."  There is no wheat gluten, no grain fillers, and no meat byproducts.  The label on the cans says "Product of Thailand", and the website boasts that nothing about this food is sourced from China.  All of the meat and vegetables are steam cooked, and each variety is hand packed into each and every can (according to the manufacturer).<br /><br />We have been feeding the Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken Petite Cuisine entr&eacute;es to our three Bengal cats for the past several days now.  We dispense one can onto a saucer for all three cats to share, once each day.  One thing my wife and I really like about this food is that it doesn't have an unpleasant odor, like most canned pet foods.  It smells like chicken and gravy, and although neither of us are daring enough to try a taste ourselves, our noses tend to support the claim that this is "people food for cats."  The chicken pot pie entr&eacute;e contains several chunks of white meat chicken, along with small bits of sweet potato and carrots, all swimming in an ocean of gravy (or broth, sauce, or whatever you wish to call it).  The food looks good, but I feel that there is just too much gravy, and it could prove to be messy when serving or during feeding.  The sesame chicken entr&eacute;e contains shredded chicken (not chunks), along with bits of carrots and rice in a far more reasonable amount of gravy.  Both entr&eacute;es look good and smell good, but how do the cats like it?  Well as we observed our cats when we served up the food, here is what we found:<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Asia, our 3 year old female Bengal, greedily devours the hearty chunks of chicken and veggie bits, but leaves most of the gravy behind.  Neo, our 10 month old male Bengal, also enjoys the chicken and licks up quite a bit of the gravy, but doesn't seem at all interested in the bits of sweet potato and carrots.  Matrix, our 2 year old male Bengal always approaches the food, sniffs at it for several seconds, and ultimately walks away without eating any.  Matrix will take a little taste, every now and then, but isn't interested in eating any quantity of it.<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Asia again scarfs down the chicken and veggies, but leaves behind the rice and gravy.  Neo seems to eat a little bit of everything.  Matrix again sniffs at the food but will not eat any of it.<br /><br />So overall we have encountered very mixed results with our three cats.  Of course they are cats, so being somewhat finicky is only natural.  Two of the three seem to really enjoy the Petite Cuisine chicken entr&eacute;es, while the third doesn't care for it at all.  So would we buy this variety of Petite Cuisine in the future?  Well I think we will likely try some of the other varieties first, to see if we can get all three cats to enjoy the food.  Petite Cuisine also makes Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp, and New England Crab Cake varieties, which all sound like something our cats would like.  We are going to order the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and see how our cats like these varieties. My wife and I both feel that Petite Cuisine produces great quality food, with high quality ingredients, and we will certainly buy more of their products in the future.  I do admit that I wish they didn't use the synthetic Vitamin K supplement (Menadione), simply because so many others have expressed real concern about the potential risks of this ingredient.  Many other manufacturers have removed this ingredient from their products, so maybe PetPlay, Inc. (makers of Petite Cuisine) will omit this synthetic ingredient in the future if enough consumer concern is expressed.  I do recommend the Petite Cuisine chicken varieties of cat food to other cat owners, but do so with a bit of caution due to the inclusion of the controversial Menadione Sodium Bisulfite ingredient.  If Petite Cuisine tastes as good as it looks and smells, then I am sure all but the most finicky cats will enjoy it a great deal.

review/summary: So Far the Kitties Aren't Buying It
review/text: UPDATE to the review below: First I'd like to downgrade this to a two star, but the system won't let me...well, would a 1 & 1/2 actually, but it really won't let me do that.<br /><br />NEITHER cat ever became fond of this, and we stopped using it completely when I found two 1" bones and several smaller bone chunks in one of the cans of the "Snapper" flavour.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: We have two cats: Bruegel, a 16 year old female who is very petite and very picky, and Banjo, a 7 year old male who is very large and quite indiscriminate in his choice of what to eat. Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours.

review/summary: Good enough to eat--literally!
review/text: I am careful about the food that I select for my cats because I want them to be healthy.  Unlike dogs, cats are strict carnivores, so any fillers in cat food are unnecessary and potentially harmful.  Also, cats have a very short digestive tract, so though fiber is good for humans, it is not important for cats.  Finding a cat food that meets these stipulations takes quite a bit of research.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine makes the mark.  The first three ingredients in each of the formulations in these variety packs are fish broth, and two different fish meats.  There is no trace of any grain fillers, and of course no wheat gluten, which was the source of the melanine tainting that has now killed and sickened humans as well as pets.<br /><br />The guaranteed analysis on the cat foods is crude protein - 13% min, crude fat - 1.5% min, crude fiber - 1% max, moisture - 85% max, ash - 3% max, and taurine 0.1% min.<br /><br />My cats of course love it.  They even seem to take a little time to savor the meal, and the food has caused zero digestive difficulties.<br /><br />The consistency is similar to a can of BumbleBee tuna, with fish chunks in a broth.  In fact, I could probably use this cat food to make a tuna fish salad, and no human would be the wiser (except for the accusatory and incriminating looks of the cats.)<br /><br />The recommended daily ration for this cat food for an adult cat is 1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight, which is a bit higher than my other canned cat food.<br /><br />Overall, this is the finest cat food that I've come across so far.  I'll probably use it as a supplement to brand that I feed as a mainstay.

review/summary: Best cat food ever
review/text: My cat is a picky eater and I'm a picky owner in that I don't want to feed him by-products, preservatives or other questionable ingredients.  When I found this cat food, he loved it and I loved the simple ingredients.  If I ate meat, I'd have a hard time telling the difference between this and actual human food if both were set before me for dining pleasures.  The food doesn't have that nasty characteristic cat food smell.  I don't know if I can attribute it to this food, but my cat's breath doesn't stink (I've had several cats in my life, and smelly breath was generally a constant).  My only complaint about this food is that all of my local grocers and pet stores don't stock it.  I wish it was more readily available in my town.  Also, I wish the ingredients were sourced in the good ole US of A.  Aside from these points, it's a fantastic cat food and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality food for their special buddy.

review/text: I have a Bengal cat and was looking for a good quality food that had the taurine she needs. She was very thin when I got her (a rescue) and was a bit picky. I tried a large number of foods including some quite expensive ones, and this, by far, is the best I've found. The quality appears to be excellent. It has a high amount of taurine and the vitamins she needs to be healthy. The food looks and smells like our food!!!..with chunks of chicken and pieces of carrot in the "pot pie" and shredded chicken whichs smells just like the real thing in the "Sesame Chicken". This product (and the fish variety pack) is all I buy for her now. She eats every bit at each meal and looks absolutely wonderful!!!

review/summary: Slurp. It's gone.
review/text: I discovered Petite Cuisine when I tried to switch my 13-year-old cat from dry food to canned; I tried every variety of canned food, and while he wouldn't touch any other brand, he inhaled this stuff. I'm a vegetarian, but Petite Cuisine looks more like real chicken/fish than anything I've seen - actual, identifiable strips of meat!  What a concept.<br /><br />My new kittens love it as well, and Chicken Pot Pie is by far their favorite flavor.  It's got a little more fat than the fish flavors, but still well within the AAFCO guidelines. It's also a little more expensive; you can usually get 24-packs of fish flavors for $18 if you go to the manufacturer's web site. But the chicken pot pie makes a great treat for a healthy dinner.<br /><br />But: check out Joe's post about menadione.

review/summary: Cats love it -- but I am concerned
review/text: This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various "high end" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the "Before Grain" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy "Duck a l'orange" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a "treat" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing "Made in Thailand" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.

review/summary: 8 paws up
review/text: Evidently these are to be sold in the stores as four can packs.  Neat thing, there was a [...]  off your next four packs in side each of the packages.<br /><br />My taste test panel of two - Foutchie and Miss Fuzz gave it 8 paws up.  They eat the expense 85 cent a can fancy stuff, so this compares well to that brand.  Same size.  They list is as Chicken pot pie, and frankly, that is what it looks like--the filing of a pot pie.<br /><br />I always think of Jane Fonda in KLUTE feeding her cat and then licking the spoon of the cat food can herself.  Well, chow down, Jane.

review/summary: We licked the bowl clean!
review/text: Hello!  We are Marissa and Lilith.  Mojosmom is our human.  She said we could write this review because we ate this and she didn't.  We like it!  We especially like the Chinese Chicken (mom said the package actually calls it "Sesame Chicken", but we can't read, so it doesn't matter).  The Pot Pie entr&eacute;e had an awful lot of broth and not a lot of meat.  But we licked the bowl clean anyway.  Mom says she likes this because it doesn't have a strong, icky smell like some canned cat food.  But she says that it would take a lot of these cans to feed it to us all the time (1-2 cans per 2.5 lbs of our weight - she said something about how Lilith could stand to lose a a pound or two or three), so we'll just get a couple of cans along with our dry food.  Maybe if we ignore the dry food she'll get the message, but she can be pretty stubborn!

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: I usually give my cats canned food as a treat, so I thought I would give this a try for them.<br /><br />Like the other reviews the ingredients list was nice, there were a few ingredients I wasn't sure about like carrageenan and menadione sodium bisulfite but they all turned out to be a mineral supplement or a thickening agent.<br /><br />I opened the chicken pot pie first. Very watery with pea sized chunks of chicken, tiny bits of carrots and what looks like onion in it. It smelled like cat food.<br /><br />The sesame chicken also smelled like cat food, mind you not like a horrible smell, but if you put that and the actual chicken pot pie or sesame chicken in front of me blindfolded I'd be able to tell which was which just from the smell, it's a cat food smell. Anyway, the sesame chicken had pea sized chicken bits in it along with carrots and rice and a hint of sesame oil aroma to it.<br /><br />Minion Number Two is my picky eater (no, that's a nickname). He liked the juice and ate a few bits of the meat then went to his regular cat food, even side by side he still didn't eat the treat.<br /><br />Minion Number One (also a nickname) will eat most natural foods from potatoes, hamburger to whole wheat bread. He too enjoyed the juice a lot, ate a few pieces of the chicken then wandered off. He never came back to finish it.<br /><br />It gets three stars. Two for the ingredients and one that my cats like the juice. It doesn't get five because one, the price, I can see why it's more (because of the ingredients) but my cats will finish off other cans of cat food that are only half the price which is point two, being two adult male cats with hearty appetites they didn't like it enough to finish it.

review/summary: I'm sorry to say that things did not go well with this food
review/text: The chicken pot pie variety was extremely runny, interestingly that seemed to be the only part my cats ate, the licked up the broth.  But they literally nosed the potatoes and carrots right off their plates.  It was like watching picky toddlers.  I divided one can between three cats and I still had about a half a can left after they ate.  I also watched as they finished all three cats ran to the litter box. (apparently it comes out watery too)<br /><br />One of my cats - the little vixen whose part siamese then went and did a protest in my laundry hamper.<br /><br />So when they tried the seasame chicken I only gave it to the two critters who don't voice their displeasure so eloquently.  They still did not finish their meals, again the carrots hit the floor, and perhaps the most suprising, normally when I open a can of cat food they come a running, not so on either opening, and even though the company claims the food smells more appealing, I disagree, as did the cats.<br /><br />So it's 3 stars because at least they ate some of it, but I'm very sorry to say they didn't appear to like it.  If you would like to try a sampler package of this product you can access that through their website.  All the packaging is recyclable, this product is made in Thailand, and claims to be all natural:<br /><br />The chicken pot pie lists the following information:<br />Chicken, Chicken broth,Sweet Potato,Carrots,Soy bean oil,Trialcium phosphate,Tapioca Starch,Calcium Sulfate,Olive Oil, Vitamins and Minerals,Vitamin E supplement,Vitamin A supplement,Vitamin D3 supplement,Zinc Sulfate,Thiamine Mononitrate,Manganese sulfate,Menadione sodium bisuifite complex (source of vitamin K activity),Riboflavin supplement,Folic acid,Pyridoxine hydrochloride,<br />Copper amino acid complex,Iron amino acid complex<br />Carrageenan,Cholinechloride,Taurine,Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie: Protein: 12% Min.<br />Fat: 1% Min.<br />Ash: 3% Max.<br />Fiber: 1% Max.

review/summary: Quality Product, But Not What My Cat Would Prefer
review/text: I purchaed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  My cat enjoyed this selection okay, but it seemed like he was much happier with the seafood sampler.  This picture on the box looks like something very similar to human food, but the actual contents weren't as close as I had hoped.  I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.  My cat is a 12 year old Tabby Manx with some minor health issues.  His well being is important enough that I will buy better made food instead of just cheap stuff... but when it starts going to waste... and at a higher cost to me?  I consider this to be a one time only purchase and do not plan to reorder even if it's on sale.  Nothing against this company, but I think they would do better with a variety pack of 6-8 flavors with only one chicken flavor for every 5 or so other flavors.  If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater.

review/summary: One out of three cats partially liked it
review/text: I have three cats, one is 12 years old (Fred), one is 9 years old (Jewel) and a kitten that is 4 months old (Angel).  The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.  I was disappointed that my cats did not care for this food.<br /><br />I must say, however, that cats are very particular animals.  Even though my cats did not like it, your cats might devour it in an instant.  As for quality, I give this food high marks.  It looks edible and smells like real food.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would recommend purchasing a sample before you go out and get a whole box.

review/summary: Pleasing for the cat and for me - a good alternative for my Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys addict
review/text: My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys.  It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens!  When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him.  After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food.  First, I want it to have real ingredients listed.  I don't like for it to have by-products.  (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food)  Second, I don't want it to stink.  If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it.  Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria.  Next was the big question:  would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off.  He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting.  Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior.  He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day.  I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn.  It really looks like people food.  He seemed to really enjoy the "soupy" broth.  This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off.  He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest.  Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken.  It smelled pleasantly like Asian food.  His reaction was to sniff and wander off.  After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food.  So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor.  I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM.  It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day.  A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior.  He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits.  I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily.  Clearly, my kitty has preferences.  I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>) that are available on Amazon.  He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past.  It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand.  I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance.  That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general.  The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.

review/summary: My 12 cats like this product just fine (details)
review/text: With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn't take me long to test this product! The first day, I introduced the cats to the Petite Cuisine seafood entr&eacute;es. The next evening, they got to try these two Entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- two Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;es<br />-- two Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;es<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included half of one flavor, and half of the other) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the "gravy" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the solid food. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of chicken meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery. I was pretty enthused when I saw the tiny carrot pieces in the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e. I was initially afraid that they would eat around the carrots but they didn't -- they gulped it right down with the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e: Chicken, chicken broth, sweet potato, carrots, soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Olive oil, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex, Carrageenan, Choline Chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 12%, crude fat (min) 1%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on both flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I have one finicky cat and one food-hog cat. Both of them like this food. First ingredient is chicken, good. Next few ingredients are also good, but this is not "natural" cat food and thus, includes preservatives and taste enhancers (that I generally avoid). Also, the packaging is cute, but excessive. You get a case of 24 cans, but within that case, are 6 smaller boxes that hold 4 cans each. None-the-less, the quality is superior to "fancy feast" or other bottom-rung cat foods. This food is a solid "medium quality". The food is what I call "gravy" style as opposed to "loaf" style, meaning you are paying for a decent amount of gravy in each can as opposed to meat and other real food. To their credit though, the chicken is REAL white meat chicken, not processed chicken parts made to look like "shredded chicken". The cats love it and the packaging (though excessive) makes it convenient for storing little cans in your cupboard.

review/summary: Good Quality Cat Food for "People Food" Cats
review/text: We have two cats, both of whom can be finicky eaters. One cat is a "people food" lover; he will eat almost anything that we eat (turkey is his favorite).  The first time we introduced this food to him, he lapped it up.  The other cat does not touch "people food" at all.  He took one sniff of this food and turned on his heels.  We tried all flavors and he wouldn't eat any of them.<br /><br />So, if you have a cat who loves "people food", Petite Cuisine will probably satisfy him.  This cat food is of high quality with no "by-products" and comes in single serving pop-top cans.  Highly recommended for cats that are open to new flavors but may not be for those that prefer to stick with what they know.

review/summary: They should call it "Cat Crack"
review/text: Yes, they should call it "Cat Crack". We have 5 extremely finicky cats, and it's very difficult to get them to eat the same thing. When we find something, we stick with it. Whenever we've tried to introduce something new, chances are 1 or 2 of them will turn up their noses and walk away.<br /><br />This has not been an issue with Petite Cuisine. The problem now is that they truly won't stop sceaming for it. We've now gone through each of the four flavors (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, and Tuna & Shrimp), and each is an unqualified hit with all five cats.<br /><br />You can tell as soon as you open the can that this is something different. It certainly smells fishy, but it doesn't smell like regular canned cat food. It looks and smells very high quality and fresh. Real tuna flakes, real tiny popcorn shrimp, a good amount of sauce. These are smaller 3 oz cans. We pretty much limit each cat to a healthy tablespoon of wet food a day, so 1 can will feed three like that. But the cats could certainly find the motivation to eat more.<br /><br />Each box (and each can) is clearly labelled with all of the ingredients, which for the most part are whole seafood. Not too thrilled with the presence of Menadione sodium bisuifite in each, but on the whole, it's probably no more risky than other foods we've been feeding them. 1/2 star off for that.<br /><br />Value? Well it's a little pricey (3x per oz more expensive than, say, a good deal on a can of Friskies. But we'll continue to get it for the occasional break and special night treat for our babies. It's certainly been better received than almost anything else we've paid a premium for from any grocery store or pet store.

review/text: We used to get this at a local grocery for our cat, who adores it. We moved cross country and now have to mail order it because the cat went on a hunger strike when his supply from before the move ran out. We acquired 2 more cats, and all 3 adore this stuff. Two of them especially like the "soupy" texture of it, sometimes we spoon it over their kibble and cats just snarf it up.<br /><br />This isn't the primary food for cats, it is their "dessert" - served twice daily after morning and evening kibble. However, they think the stuff is the best thing ever, and prefer it to anything you can name in the way of people food.

review/text: I read a lot of reviews before ordering this variety of cat food so I knew the pros and cons, but since it had no by-products or wheat gluten, which are still my top "no-nos" I decided to give it a try.  My cats LOVE the extra gravy!  They love the chicken chunks too, of course but the gravy really got them going.  I've now tried several other varieties with gravies and they couldn't be more enthusiastic.  I switched them from all dry food to mostly wet and a little dry because the oldest cat was constantly throwing up...likely from her unable to effectively chew dry food well and swallowing it whole.  I will continue to order this for them as well as some of the other Petite Cuisine varieties.

The Petite Cuisine website is quite convincing about the nutritional value and careful screening of ingredients. The small cans mean the food, once opened, says fresh enough under refrigeration to appeal to the cat the next day. If you can afford it, this is a great cat food.

review/text: What can I say? The cat loved it and lapped every bit of it up from her bowl. She is usually a picky eater, but this suited her fancy. What more can you ask of a cat food!

review/summary: People Food?
review/text: As this cat food has the somewhat comical tagline "People food for cats!," it may either at first appear charming or like a gimmick.  I think it is fair to say that it is a charming gimmick.  The foods are indeed fashioned after human food, but are more like food for baby humans than us adult humans that prefer strong seasoned flavors.  Of course, that is a good thing, as a healthy diet for a cat is quite different than for a human.  The ingredients, then, are basic, with nothing offensive like wheat-gluten.<br /><br />As for the taste, I agree with other reviewers that this comes down to the preference of each cat, but it has been a great hit with cats in my experience!

review/summary: One ate, the other didn't
review/text: This cat food is really special. It doesn't smell like cat food. It smells like canned chicken. The cans are easy to wash for recycling. It's a joy to serve.<br /><br />My ditzy calico cat, Creampuff, loved the food. She scarfed it down immediately. The other, a new adoptee named Ophelia, said, "Thanks but no thanks." She's quite finicky but alas, I think her taste buds have become accustomed to the traditional, more pedestrian Friskies type food.<br /><br />Seems like a good cat food, if you can get your cat(s) to eat it.I'm not qualified to evaluate the nutritional quality or the taste, bt appearance and smell are excellent.

review/text: I got this new cat food after reading an article in Natural Health magazine's October 2008 edition, "Feed your pet Right". The article identified protein rich, nutritionally balanced cat food.  My TWO cats did not like the chicken types, but LOVE the red snapper, tuna and shrimp, tuna and sole and yellow fin tuna.  I get the combo in the 4 pack.<br />I would recommend switching over from dry food to wet slowly so there's no upset stomachs.  I think your cats will like this food, even if they are picky, like mine.

review/summary: Ex's cat likes it--need I say more?
review/text: My ex-girlfriend is a lovely woman in many ways, but her cat...well pretty much everybody and everything is beneath him. He is picky about being petted, how he is being petted, how long he is being petted, and by whom (I think the phase of the moon figures into this somehow too, but I digress). This persnickety nature also applies--in spades--to his food. When I gave Zede (the cat, not the ex-gf) some of this food, he actually ate it without giving me his "How dare you put this slop in front of me, knave?" look. I got reports later that he became even more enamored with the stuff as time went on. So there you have it: an endorsement from Zede the finicky feline. Well, how else do you rate cat food? I'm not going to try it myself...and besides, I'm a vegetarian!

review/summary: Nigel is gonna be sad - we're out of chicken pot pie
review/text: My cat Nigel is very into food. When I opened the first can of Petite Cuisine, he thought he'd died and went to heaven. This was bits of chicken breast, broth and a few very finely chopped vegetables. The chicken pot pie had a more watery broth - the sesame chicken was in a more gravy-like sauce - but both flavors were devoured.<br /><br />My cats are big, outdoorsy cats. They were all once feral. They still frequently bring home a snake, vole or squirrel for entertainment - or supper. I have six: 4 big guys (14-17 pounds) and two slightly smaller girls (11 and 12 pounds).) They appreciate fancy little tidbits of food on a saucer. They especially liked Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />They have free access throughout the day to dry kibble: Purina One Chicken&Rice and Purina Indoor  mixed half and half. We have 3 small <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DI30O">Petmate Le Bistro Feeders</a> which they love. Then in the evening I feed them 3 ounces each (1/2 can) of Friskies Salmon&Chicken Dinner Shredded. Because the Petite Cuisine cans were so small (3 ounces) I first gave them one can per cat, but that was too much. I split 4 of these tiny cans between six cats and that was just right: no leftovers. They liked the Petite Cuisine better than Fancy Feast or Purina Selects.<br /><br />This package contains 24 cans. 12 cans are pot pie - 12 sesame. The price is comparable to Purina Selects, Fancy Feast or Sheba from the grocery store - but I think the quality is higher. This looks and smells like chicken my Moma cooks! At the end of one week of feeding Petite Cuisine, all of six of them - their fur just glistened.<br /><br />Nigel is plotting: How to work computer and get Petite Cuisine on auto-subscribe shipment from Amazon? Hmmmmm? Bodhi just wants the A-4 Smiley Box* it comes in!<br /><br />* A-4 Smiley Box - the new cat sleeping container that is delivered almost weekly by the man wearing brown. A sleeping cat's smile is on the side.

review/text: These catfoods come in smaller cans, which is great for one serving. Upon opening, they look delicious. However, not all cats like it. I tried one of each with my two, who love fish and seafood, and they sniffed and walked away.<br />A neighbor's cat and two friend's cats loved it. So, as we all know with cats... they can be finicky! I would have to say give it a try and see if yours like it. They really look great, smaller cans store easily also.

review/summary: Pleasing for the cat and for me - a good alternative for my Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys addict
review/text: My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys. It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens! When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him. After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food. First, I want it to have real ingredients listed. I don't like for it to have by-products. (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food) Second, I don't want it to stink. If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it. Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria. Next was the big question: would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off. He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting. Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior. He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day. I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn. It really looks like people food. He seemed to really enjoy the "soupy" broth. This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off. He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest. Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken. It smelled pleasantly like Asian food. His reaction was to sniff and wander off. After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food. So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor. I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM. It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day. A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior. He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits. I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily. Clearly, my kitty has preferences. I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)) that are available on Amazon. He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past. It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand. I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance. That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general. The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.

review/text: My kitty loves tuna and dry cat food.  I've never tried to give her soft food until this.  She didn't eat it until it was in her dish for most of the day when she had eaten her regular dry food.<br />It looks like it would be good.  It looks like pieces of fish, but for some reason this didn't excite her as much as tuna.<br />I'm getting a new kitty soon, and I'll update it when I try to give new kitty this food.<br />Edit: New kitty likes it fine.  This isn't her favorite choice.  She likes tuna, chicken, and beef all better than this.  Unlike the other cat, she likes this more than dry food - about as much as she likes the Iams wet food I also feed her.

review/summary: If it looks good, is it good for the cats?
review/text: My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term "all about tuna fish".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.

review/summary: Tempted to eat them myself!
review/text: This is quite a unique brand of cat food. Their tagline is "People food for cats" and they are quite right. They smell and look delicious.<br /><br />There are basically two types of canned cat food in my experience, the first kind is the solid kind where you tip the can into the plate and the food retains the shape of the can. The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate. For me this second type is preferable because it has a higher content of liquid which I consider to be healthier for the cats urinary system. This cat food is of this second type.<br /><br />My cat is a very finicky eater and he takes time to adjust to new foods.<br />This package contains two flavors; the first is chicken pot pie which looks just like real chicken pot pie, right down to the light gravy, there are cubes of real chicken breast and it really looks like pot pie. My cat laps up all the sauce then moves on to the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Second flavor is sesame chicken: This smells really good and the chicken is not chunked but in thin strips. My cat loves the sauce and will drain it all dry but is not too fond of the chicken. He will probably adjust to it over time. This is why only four stars.

review/summary: Not a hit with both cats, but blame them not the food!
review/text: One of my cats who eats everything loved this food. The other more picky one, not so much.<br />My cats are old though, and weren't raised in this era of healthy cat food, and most of the time wont touch the stuff. So I was happy that at least one of them liked it.<br />I like how all the ingredients are fresh and how there are only a few; not a list 30 things, where half of the words are unpronounceable. The food doesn't smell as bad as most cat food, the kind where as soon as you open it wafts through the house. It also has fresh chunks of chicken and fresh corn and carrots. The gravy in it is very watery and not thick like most cat foods, so it spilled everywhere the first time i opened it. Since then it hasn't, because I haven been more careful.<br />I wish both of my cats liked this food because I know it is so much better for them than what they do like! But I give much kudos to Petit Cuisine on making healthy food for cats.

About half the can is broth.  Kitties who prefer minced meals would probably not like this.

review/summary: Great Ingredients...If Only They Would Eat It....
review/text: I had a whole case of this to try, so thought it would be fun to try it on as many cats as possible. Thus, by recruiting 5 friends, we ended up trying Petite Cuisine chicken cat food on 13 cats--7 males & 6 females; 4 inside cats, 5 outside & 4 inside/outside. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food--namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.<br /><br />I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat--a 2 year old male--ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male--a 16 pound inside/outside orange tabby--would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the broth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of broth, which I think is brilliant, since all the cats I know always like the broth of canned cat food or tuna best.<br /><br />I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked. It has great ingredients and smells like human food. I hope to try Petite Cuisine seafood catfood one day...I think they all might like that much better.

If you want to give your cats a healthy canned food, this is the best one by far that I've fed them... Better than even the high-end fancy foods. The cans are small, but the nutrition is better than most cat foods. They even use yellow-fin tuna for the albacore! 1st rate cat food!

review/summary: sesame awesome and chicken pot water
review/text: The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the "chicken pot pie" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the brand ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up.

review/summary: 3 cats give 5 stars to 5 out of 6 flavors but  should I?
review/text: This review covers the two chicken flavors offered here as well as four fish flavors in the variety pack offered elsewhere on this site.  My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of "menadione sodium sulfite in pet food" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page.

review/text: This is an edit so I was unable to change my star rating.  At first I was happy with this canned cat food until the trouble began.  It has caused severe diarrhea in both of my cats who were eating it.  Now I'm in the process of trying to get things back on track.  As anyone who has been in this situation knows, the negative impacts of the situation affect the entire household, not just the poor cats who are suffering from it.

review/summary: The Cat's Meow
review/text: All four of my cats loved this canned cat food!  The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.<br /><br />The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.<br /><br />I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends.

review/text: Wow, my cats just love these, especially the Chicken Pot Pie variety.  They also gobble up the Chinese Chicken (now renamed to Sesame Chicken), but the Chicken Pot Pie is their all-time fave.  I enjoy feeding my cats food that they like as long as it's healthy, and Petite Cuisine is.  It's "real" food (no meat by-products) and there aren't any added dyes or preservatives.

review/summary: Source of protein and hearty enough to serve as one meal
review/text: First of all, your cat should hopefully like fish-flavored foods, because obviously this variety pack is all seafood - yellowfin, snapper, tuna, and shrimp. And if your cat is picky about which fish he/she likes, you won't be breaking the bank by discarding the cans of the flavors he/she doesn't approve of. There is also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I">chicken variety pack</a> available by Petite Cuisine, which contains Chinese chicken and chicken pot pie dishes. Give that a try if your cat is simply a lover of all foods.<br /><br />The food actually could pose as human food if someone was unaware they were being served cat food. But do yourself a favor and just buy a can of tuna or whatever it is you like - leave the cat food to the cats. The dishes are quite moist with chunks of meat/fish and broth. They are a source of protein and are hearty enough to serve as one meal for a small cat. You may try adding dry food if one can isn't enough. Or simply use two cans and order more as necessary.

review/summary: Five Paw Salute !!
review/text: My selection, which contained 12 cans each of Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken, arrived quickly, and I looked forward to seeing how my kitties would like it.<br /><br />I liked the fact that:<br /><br />(1) Petite Cuisine has NO Wheat Gluten,<br /><br />and<br /><br />(2) it's made from "Human Grade" ingredients -- which means even I can eat it if I really wanted to -- and truth be told -- I DID sample a bit from each of those 2 selections -- and both selections tasted better than anything I have tasted when I buy a Brand Name can of canned chicken for myself.....<br /><br />But ok -- this Petite Cuisine is for my kitties, so let's see what THEY think of it:<br /><br />Well, I had no idea what to expect when I opened the first can --  Chicken Pot Pie (and word of caution -- open the "Chicken Pot Pie" can over the sink--there's alot of Broth inside and it sloshes out if you are not careful).<br /><br />However, Big Bad Baby Twinkle was standing behind me watching my every move, and once the top came off the can, her Supreme Largeness, BBBT, surprised me with several OCTAVES worth of Mew-sical praise for the tempting smell.<br /><br />Yes - I know you are supposed to mix new cat food with their old food, but I had no desire to mix this pristine, tasty, fresh diced chicken and veggies entree with any of their stinky canned stuff - so Big Bad Baby Twinkle and Sweet Cee Cee feasted on 1/2 can of "Chicken Pot Pie" each, along with the liquid broth. I waited for a reaction -- nothing untoward happened. They licked their chops and came after me for more of the same.<br /><br />Now, it has been noted that there is alot of "water" (Broth) in this can of Chicken pot Pie -- I am familiar with "Spot's Stew" and that brand also has alot of liquid in its can. I have no problem with this Chicken Pot Pie broth -- if anything, it helps to hydrate my kitties (cats, being descended from desert animals -- get most of their liquid from their food-- and as long as the sodium content of this broth is low, then they can slurp it to their hearts delight -- and they certainly did, as the dishes were licked clean)<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken, was less liquidy and looked very nice, shredded with its vegetables -- it had special smell, which actually was just the smell of Sesame Oil. But my cats inhaled this as greedily as they did the Chicken pot Pie. I was impressed that Sesame oil would be used (along with Soy oil) as an ingredient. I'm looking forward to seeing what these oils will eventually do to nourish (former abandoned, street-kitty, but thoroughly vetted) Cee Cee's somewhat dull coat. * * *<br /><br />And to top off the Petite Cuisine experience, each box comes with a coupon worth $2 -- $1 off when you buy a four-pack, or four cans of Petite Cuisine from the supermarket -- and another $1 coupon will be sent to you if you fill out your name and address on the first coupon before you present it to  the check out clerk.<br /><br />The only thing I take an issue with is the origin -- Thailand -- why not keep this "at home" and produce it in the USA?<br /><br />* * *UPDATE -- Dec 18 2008 -- Cee Cee's coat grew out a little more, is BEAUTIFUL and silky!! Since the only new thing in her life is this food, I can surmise that this diet of Petite Cuisine DID help flesh her out and beautify her fur (She is a former street-kitty, and has always been a little wan (although she goes to the vet regularly) since she was rescued and I brought her inside.)

review/summary: More watery than expected; cats are not digesting it well
review/text: Our cats usually get the "green can" Fancy Feast shredded varieties (they aren't interested in the green can souffle types, and the Florentine varieties give them gastric problems).  The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back.

review/text: My cats are real picky about trying new foods. I popped open 2 cans (1 yellowfin & 1 tuna and sole)and set down the dish.  The first cat walked over took a little nibble and then went for the full chowdown.  The second cat realized that she was missing out, pushed the older cat out of the way and set about to power eating.  2 happy cats over here.<br /><br />Happy human notes: no BIG fishy smell, no strange looking formed bits,  just some good looking, healthy cat food.

review/summary: Cats went nuts over it!
review/text: All three of my cats are wild about the Chicken Pot Pie variety of Petite Cuisine.  It's real chicken in a clear broth, and it actually looks like something you'd serve yourself.  All the ingredients are "real" -- no meat by-products, wheat gluten, preservatives, dyes.  There is actually quite a bit of broth, which concerned me when I opened the first can because I thought the can was mostly water.  However, it's real broth and evidently pretty tasty, because my cats practically inhale it -- they love it!  Once they finish the broth, they start working on the chicken and always clear the whole plate.  I'll definitely buy more of this.

review/summary: Healthy food for cats
review/text: My two cats loved these Petite Cuisine chicken flavors, and that's where the rubber meets the road in cat food. Happily, the food itself is very healthy and does not contain garbage byproducts. It's not human food but it's darn close. My cats preferred the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp)</a> which I also received, but they certainly didn't turn up their noses at the chicken flavor!<br /><br />My sole complaint is that the chicken-pot-pie variety is very watery. My cats did not seem to mind though.<br /><br />If you want a premium, healthy cat food that is full of the good stuff, this is a great option.

review/summary: Delicious, says my cat; messy, says I...
review/text: It's a cute idea to produce a cat food that is similar to people food, and Petite Cuisine seems to fill the nutrition needs of cats, if you can believe the label. However, the "in sauce" makes things a little messy, especially with the "Chicken Pot Pie" entree. There's so much sauce (aka gravy/water/whatever) that my cat would pull the pieces of food out onto the floor and slurp up the sauce afterward. There's just too much liquid in this cat food. The Sesame Chicken is a bit more solid.<br /><br />Whatever the consistency, my cat gave this product high stars, if licking up every morsel and drop is any indication. And I have to admit it smells pretty darn good, not like a lot of cat foods. (Of course, funky smells have never bothered my cat -- the more odorous the better, in her opinion). The daily serving size suggestions are a bit too generous:  1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight. That means 3 to 6 cans for an 8-pound cat, and if you've got a healthy 10-pounder, that means 4 to 8 cans a day? No way.<br /><br />I don't think we'll be using this as a daily food, but rather as an occasional change of pace. It's certainly palatable, but the messiness is a negative. I say 3 stars, and my cat says 5, for a 4-star average...

I do not see the UPC code label on the product or any date code.  Looks more homemade.  Just in case you're wondering, you get one small slice of truffle peel in the bottle.

review/text: So glad to find an instant pudding that uses Splenda instead af aspartame. If it's a little too sweet for you just add a pinch of instant coffee and that fixes the peoblem.

review/summary: Wonderful product!
review/text: I have been looking for aspertame-free pudding and gelatin for a long time.  I happened upon the Better Bowls products on Amazon and decided to give them a try.  The chocolate pudding and the strawberry gelatin were both very good.  My entire family especially loved the chocolate pudding.  I would highly recommend the pudding or the gelatin to anyone wanting a quick, easy sugar-free dessert.

review/summary: splenda pudding
review/text: I was looking to find an aspartame free instant pudding mix and found this brand. It mixed up like any other instant pudding, however, the pudding is too sweet for my taste buds and not chocolatey enough. Since I bought it in bulk, I am going to experiment with adding Heshey's Special Dark Cocoa powder to my next batch, maybe 1 -2 tblsp of cocoa powder and see if it improves the flavor and decreases the sweetness.

review/summary: Low Carb?
review/text: The package indicates 2 carb grams per 1/2 cup serving - but when you calculate total carbs minus fiber it comes out to 7 carbs per serving.  This is just for their powdered mix - adding the necessary milk to make the pudding adds extra carbs. I also didn't care for the aftertaste it left in my mouth.  I won't be reordering this product.

review/summary: Aspartame aka Acesulfame K with Splenda
review/text: I would never recommend this product to anyone, diet or no diet. Made consumer ill. Level of Aspartame nauseating. My suspicion is high levels of Aspartame are undisclosed while obvious 'Splenda' wording is used as a selling boost.

review/summary: Goes on like oil - flavors like hot sause
review/text: I love this stuff.  My gf and I started using it when we found a bottle randomly in the communal pantry of her apartment.  An item that had long ago been abandoned by a former resident, we mad short work of it by adding it to a slew of dishes.  Sometimes we'd mix it into a dish after cooking to add some oily texture, like a dressing, and a spicy kick to a mild dish.  Other times we'd add it to a stir fry while it was cooking to aid in cooking and to give the meal a little more kick.  If you like spicy food and you like to cool with oil this stuff is a must.  Check it out!
