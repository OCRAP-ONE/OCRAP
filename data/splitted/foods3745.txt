review/text: I found this Jamaican Lemonade at Whole Foods.  I love it!  It appears many others love it too because it seems to be out of stock or low on stock all the time.  I has a different twist on your regular lemonade flavor.  It's really good.

review/text: After a lifetime of drinking very sweet sodas every day, I decided to cut out everything with high fructose corn syrup. Problem is, I can't stand the taste (or non-taste) of water, and plain fruit juice has too much sugar. Then I found these all-natural, lightly sweetened fruit spritzers! The carbonation is just right, and they are really tasty. It tastes like ginger ale with some additional lemon flavoring. I order these in bulk now!

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I bought this at a small market near Mayfield KY and loved it. Ordering from Amazon will save me gas and I have Prime so no shipping charges.<br /><br />I like it because it does not contain High Fructose Corn Syrup or Sugar but is sweetened with Grape Juice.  It is not overly sweet to the taste and is not overly carbonated.  I like the hint of Lemon and the hint of Ginger Ale. To me the taste is like Lemon Ginger Ale.  Delicious.<br /><br />I am not a soft drink person.  I have not had a Coke or Pepsi in years because they are too sweet and too carbonated.  So if you love that type of drink, this one will probably not have the overly sweet taste that you prefer.  But give it a chance. You may find that you like it better.

review/summary: tastes like kc masterpiece bbq potato chips
review/text: I got a sample of this stuff at a bbq festival in NYC.<br /><br />It's got an eerie taste to it.  At first I couldn't figure out what the stuff tastes like.<br />It tastes salty and kind of sweet, there is some good almost smoky flavor to it.  Then I figured it out!  It tastes like those bbq potato chips.<br /><br />Let's break down the ingredient list:<br />#1 is salt.  Not a bad thing but don't overdose on it.<br />#2 dehydrated onion - great flavor<br />#3. spices - not sure what this is, but it's probably some proprietary blend with pepper,<br />#4. sugar - this is where the sweetness comes from<br />#5. dehydrated garlic- where more flavor comes from<br />#6. brown sugar - more sweetness, but a different flavor<br />#7. dehydrated tomato - did you know that tomato contains a bunch of natural glutamic acids (like MSG), and you wonder why pizza is so addicting.<br /><br />there's more but more sugar and other stuff in there, but you get the gist of my review.<br /><br />I would be careful about using it.  It can help make formerly nasty tasting cuts of meat and low qualty burger patties really irrestible.<br />It'll make you eat more.<br /><br />Combined with the fat in the patties, it can be an addicting item.  It'll hit all of the taste senses (Unami, salty, sweet, sour, bitter) and make you come back for more.<br /><br />I would rather have a higher quality burger and just season it with salt and pepper, but if you have to get the cheaper quality patties, I think people would like this seasoning.  You can skip the ketchup if you use this seasoning.

review/text: This soup is very good.  It's easy to fix--just add water--and olive oil if you want.  It's done cooking in 30 minutes.  What could be easier.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the soup seemed a little thin compared to the home made bean soups I make.  The flavor is really good, however.  I might add a can of red beans to the mixture next time to give it more body.

review/summary: What's In This Stuff?
review/text: I didn't buy this from Amazon, and the reason I didn't is that the product description does not give details about what is in this product.  The Miracle-Gro website was equally uninformative.  Thus, I went to a "big box store," picked up a container, read the ingredients, and bought it.  My main concern was whether the product contained magnesium, manganese, iron, and calcium, as many of the websites on palm care recommend fertilizers containing these ingredients.  The tiny print on the back of the container lists all of these elements except calcium.  The label on the back of the container also lists copper, zinc, and sulphur.  The fertilizer ratio is 8 - 8 - 8.  Some of this information actually is present on the Amazon site, but only if you "zoom in" on the photo of the front of the product container, and then you can barely make out a statement that it, "Contains Magnesium, Iron, & Manganese."  I only figured out that I could have done that after I had the product in my hand and saw the writing.<br /><br />Anyway, I just used it to fertilize my palms only two days ago, so it is too soon to tell if it will be effective, but it was easy to apply.

review/summary: Good K-Cup Coffee on the darker side
review/text: I recently decided to give these Diedrich K-Cups a whirl.  For years, I've been a dedicated Green Mountain Coffee Roaster customer, and their K-Cup varieties are excellent; however, even at their "Cafe Express" discount rate, their coffees are more expensive by several dollars per 25 count pack than the current price Amazon is offering on Diedrich blends.<br /><br />I'd been traveling in Southern California a few months ago and tried some Diedrich coffees then.  Although the coffees I tried tended to exhibit the Starbucks/West Coast tendency to roast beans too darkly -- to the point of effacing some of the original regional characteristics of the beans -- they are fine for dark roasts and preferable to what I've had from Starbucks.  Coupled with the Keurig brewer, this makes for a decent cup of medium-to-dark "West Coast" style coffee.

review/summary: Great way to start the morning!
review/text: Ever since I brought my Keurig brewer to my office, this has been, hands down, the most popular K-Cup in the collection I keep on hand.<br /><br />Being a Full blend, it's strong enough to use on the 8 oz brew setting to give it a nice strong, yet subtle flavor.  I can taste a hint of the vanilla in the blend which ties the entire blend together.<br /><br />There were some comments about the Diedrich roast being stronger than most East-Coast roasts, but I found that Diedrich's roasting to be superb.  I've tried Timothy's, Green Mountain, and Van Houtte, and I find Diedrich to have less of a burned taste.  After all, Diedrich did invent one of the most successful roasting machines used by other coffee houses (look for Diedrich Manufacturing for more information).<br /><br />While I still enjoy drinking Diedrich's Colombia in the mornings (at the lowest setting to make its flavor stand out), I find myself always drinking a cup of Morning Edition afterward.

review/text: I can drink coffee black and love it, but occasionally I like to add a little milk or a little cream.  So far, most of the K-cups are too strong to add cream.. meaning if you add cream, it still just tastes like black coffee so you might as well drink it black.  Morning Edition is perfect.  It tastes great black, but you can add cream and it tastes like coffee with cream.  My sister who loves creamer hated my k-cups because she said she had to use too much creamer.  Now I finally have a cup that she loves, that I can drink both ways and it still pleases my husband who loves it black!  Will continue to buy it monthly!

review/text: I am extremely particular about coffee being too strong, burnt, bitter, or one with a unpleasant after taste. This one is wonderful! It has flavor, it's not weak like a light roast, it does not need sugar, and it doesn't bite your tongue first thing in the morning. BUT it's very nice ANY time of the day! I have sampled many of the keurig k-cups and this one I will keep. So if you wonder about a coffee that has more punch and stronger flavor, I also keep on hand Diedrich French Roast. It's the ONLY french roast I approve of. The other of my 3 choice's is Caribou Columbia. That one is not available here on Amazon, but when it is I'll add it to my auto delivery which is the BEST way to pay much less per k-cup!

review/text: When I bought my Keurig Brewer for home use, I read just about every review for every type of coffee available before choosing Diedrich Morning Edition. My place of work has used Keurig brewers for a few years and keeps Green Mountain coffee on hand. I normally drink the Breakfast Blend, so that's all I knew. I was pleasantly surprised to find the Diedrich Morning Edition to be much, much better. More flavorful and less bitter. I love this coffee so much, I will probably drink it exclusively for as long as it remains available.<br /><br />Also, judging by the reviews I read, the extra bold varieties were supposed to be not so bold and rather weak. But after trying out some of the different varieties that came with my Keurig brewer, I can only assume that the people who said so are accustomed to drinking coffee that has soaked in its own grounds overnight. The extra bold roasts are so strong I can barely drink them. The regular roasts are just fine, thank you very much.

When I unpacked it and saw the word "vanilla" on the box, I thought - oh no ... this is a VANILLA coffee. But if there is any vanilla to this, it is so mild that I can't really taste it. I guess there is just enough to smooth the flavor out. I like it a lot, and so does everyone else evidently. I can't keep it stocked in the lounge!

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I have enjoyed these every Christmas for the past 4 years.  I first had them in Germany, where they are available only during the holiday season.  I sent a pack to my Mom as a Christmas gift, and she loves them too.  She's deathly alergic to nuts, and unlike the Mon Cheri's you find in the states (with hazlenuts), these Mon Cheri's have no nuts, only chocolate, brandy, and a cherry; thus, she can enjoy them without worries.  I wish America would sell these little delights in stores, rather than just online.  They're well worth the wait of mail order though!

review/text: Candy was old and past the expiration date! Plus, I ordered 25-count gift box, but they sent 3 boxes of 10 which looks lousy as a gift. I had to send 2 emails to try to get a response. Finally given a phone call of someone to call, who told me "the candy comes from other countries and it takes a while to get here." Then they place the burden of getting a refund on the customer. They emailed me a return label, but I have to purchase mailing labels or clear plastic tape, print out the label they sent me, pack it up, find a UPS store, and pay for parking so I can wait in line to return their expired candy. They could have easily looked up the lot number to verify that they had sent expired candy, but they intentionally place the burden on the consumer. I have not yet received my refund. BUYER BEWARE.

review/text: After having received a first order of Mon Cheri in a very bad condition, the Candy shop tried to make up for it with a second sending. I appreciated that. In general they should not send the chocolates at room temperature, since the chocolates melt and the liquor leaks all over the box. Although not happy in the beginning, they at least tried to repare it, which is not always the case with other sellers.<br /><br />Rudolf, Augusta, GA

review/text: After seeing some enticing Instagram photos of friends in Brooklyn enjoying Stroopwafels atop the cups of coffee, I wanted nothing more than to create the experience for myself. I ordered two tins, and I fear that I paid over thirty bucks for.... two pretty tins. The stroopwafels themselves are dry, tasteless, and barely have an inkling of the caramel-y center that the coffee steam is supposed to turn into magical goodness. They're not completely disgusting, just vastly disappointing. I found some for under four bucks at a local grocery store the other night, and they are much, much better.

review/summary: Vegan Natural Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Kosher. I love Indian spinach (palak.) Alu palak (or aloo palak, meaning potato with spinach) is a very traditional Indian dish, also very often served with thali meals. Thalis meals are served on separate dinner plates to each guest with small bowls on each plate holding the various tasty choices. This Tasty Bite Aloo Palak is wonderful for adding another easy serve choice to your own 'thali' creation or as an additional item for an Indian or Asian-themed meal. Alu palak is great spooned over basmati rice or with Indian breads [or vegan whole wheat tortillas.] Can also be used as a base for a more elaborate mix of your favorite vegetables and/or beans. Tofu cubes are another delightful addition. I have also used it to make a delicious(!) spinach soup by adding Asian buckwheat noodles. Nicely spiced and not spicy by Indian standards. The spinach is a puree, partly a wonderful spinach gravy, accompanied by small diced potato cubes. A great choice for those who like or enjoy creating with spinach dishes. Made with spinach [palak], potatoes [aloo or alu], tomatoes, onions, water, sunflower oil, salt, cornstarch, ginger, garlic, sugar, chilies, turmeric, and spices. 200 calories and 6g protein per pouch. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

review/summary: Delicious Spinach and Potatoes
review/text: Because I have celiac disease I must eat a gluten free diet, I'm also vegan by choice.  This item meets both of those requirements and is also absolutely delicious.  It is not spicy hot at all, perfect for typical western tastes, yet the sauce is very tasty.<br /><br />I've been using Tasty Bite products for years, as they have long offered gluten free and vegan items, but this is the best of all of their products I have tried.  I eat it over rice and it causes me to have Happy Tummy, always good for people with celiac disease.<br /><br />The spinach and potatoes dominate, but I love both.  It probably is not as high in protein as many other similar dishes, but not every meal needs to be packed with protein.  I'd subscribe to this product if the option were available.

review/text: If you're looking for something that's going to taste exactly like what you get at your local Indian restaurant, forget it. Don't waste your time. Go spend $15 for lunch.<br /><br />But if you want some variety in your diet and an easy to make entree for lunch or dinner, then this is good stuff. Just cook for 90 seconds, add to rice or whatever you want and you've got a meal. Again, if you like Indian food and you a) don't have time to make it from scratch yourself and b) refuse to spend a ton of money, then buy this Aloo Palak.<br /><br />I gotta go, I'm ordering more.<br /><br />BTW, I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, but this stuff is good.

review/summary: Easy To Prepare. Unappetizing Appearance.
review/text: Last week I bought a couple Indian-style items in  heatable pouches. My idea was they might be used for a quick lunch. Today, I tried the second of then, Tasty Bite Aloo Palak. It's real easy to prepare. You just partially tear off the top part of the pouch and put the pouch into the microwave for 90 seconds. Afterwards, you empty it into a bowl or wherever else you may be putting it. It dish is all vegetarian with potatoes being the most obvious ingredient. Spinach, tomatoes and onions and a variety of spices are included. The potatoes stand out with the other ingredients cooked into a gray-green rather unappetizing mush. The spicing is very mild for Indian food. The taste is all right, but nothing I'd write home about. The fat and sodium content are low, to it's credit. All in all, I'm disappointed with this dish and probably wouldn't be buying it again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

The pouches are usually good for two people, and taste great with rice. Also, the Aloo Palak is a tiny bit spicy, which I love but know some people can't handle.

review/summary: not quite like typical beef jerky
review/text: Not what I expected it to be or taste like. Not your typical beef jerky. It's hard to describe what I mean by that, sorry. Thin slices of processed beef. Slick and waxy/greasy, so much so that you feel the need to wash your hands afterwards. A little spicy - burns the mouth a bit afterwards (I guess this is from the added "smoke" flavor.) Not as "tender" as advertised.  On occasion you may find quite hard little pieces in them (may be fat, I don't know). I wouldn't suggest eating too many of these at once.<br />  I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 because I got it at a good price (because of a rebate) and received a large quantity, so I feel I got my money's worth and because it serves its purpose as a handy, portable snack at work to subside my hunger. But. let's just say that I was planning on buying it again in the future, until I tried it. Now, I'll opt for another Jerky over this kind. Perhaps it's a matter of taste and some enjoy this; but I don't.

They are fresh, they taste great,  the pkg is resealable and convenient to keep in my office fridge. I have a palm full every morning -- I started with the whole prostate health idea but now - I would eat them regardless if there is anything to that theory or not.

review/summary: So healthy and taste sooo good
review/text: After learning about the importance of eating your seeds, nuts and legumes sprouted, I began looking for alternatives and found that Go Raw makes them and Amazon offers them at an affordable price. The Go Raw pumpkin seeds have all the good points you should look for: 1.they are organic, 2.they are raw, 3.they are sprouted, 4.they don't haves any unnecessary ingredients added, except sea salt, which makes them gluten, wheat and soy free, 5.and they taste delicious, which makes my 7 year old son want to eat them as a snack. The company is family owned and they source the seeds from local growers.

review/summary: GROSS!  This has so much salt it IS "junk food" !!!
review/text: I love pumpkin seeds.  I love them so much I never thought a company that claims to offer them "simply" could ruin them.  "Go Raw" is probably a company filled with nice people, but I found this product absolutely disgusting -- that's how salty it was.  I didn't want to finish even the 1st handful of these pumpkin seeds; and after forcing myself to try several handfuls in case the first one was not representative of the whole bag, that was it.  No more for me!  I tried to give them away to other "healthy eaters" amongst my friends -- & I didn't tell any of them what I disliked about these pumpkin seeds, either.  Turns out I didn't have to.  Each one discovered the problem on his/her first try, too.<br /><br />Hence no one wanted them any more than I did.<br /><br />Any food this salty IS "junk food" -- and EXPENSIVE junk food, at that.

review/summary: Absolutely Exquisite Taste & Scent! Autistic Son Adores!
review/text: I just love this stuff. To some it may seem weird to eat the flowers you relate to your perfume etc. But it's a taste you must try! My favorite is to sprinkle sparingly on my rice dishes and deserts! Plain Rice, Dab Of Butter, Dash Of Salt, and sprinkle of Lavender...MMMHHH GOOD!<br /><br />A major benefit is for my son who has Autism. He just loves to smell this and adds it to everything he wants to give me. It makes him feel so proud that he made Mom's food, birthday card, etc not only look good but smell wonderful. It has him smiling daily at his accomplishments. He knows IT IS SAFE FOR INGESTING! That's a really good thing. The other day I caught him adding it to his bath water! The sheepish grin when I walked in was priceless! I recommend keeping a bottle of this handy!

review/summary: Good product, LOTS of it!
review/text: I bought this product as a economical way to purchase lavender to cook with.  Those looking to do so needs to investigate their options as not all lavender is culinary grade (most is for its scent and isn't recommended for eating!)  Culinary lavender is MUCH more expensive than non culinary lavender.  This was a great deal however there is a ton of it.  Hopefully you've already tried lavender and enjoy the taste because if you don't you've got some expensive potpourri.<br /><br />Recipe for Lavender Tea Bread:<br />Ingredients<br />* 3/4 cup milk<br />* 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh lavender (or 1.5 TBS dried)<br />* 6 tablespoons butter, softened<br />* 1 cup white sugar (can partly substitute with honey)<br />* 2 eggs<br />* 2 cups all-purpose flour<br />* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br />* 1/4 teaspoon salt<br />* Glaze:<br />o 1/3  cup  sifted powdered sugar<br />o 1  teaspoon  water (or a citrus juice)<br />o 1/4  teaspoon  vanilla extract<br />o Optional pinch of lavender<br /><br />Directions<br />1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.  Can also make cupcakes<br />2. Combine the milk and lavender in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat to a simmer, then remove from heat, and allow to cool slightly.<br />3. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg until the mixture is light and fluffy. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk and lavender until just blended. Pour into the prepared pan.<br />4. Bake for 50 minutes (or less if cupcakes) in the preheated oven, or until a wooden pick inserted into the crown of the loaf comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack.<br />5. To prepare glaze, combine powdered sugar and remaining ingredients. Spread over hot cake.  Serve with fruit if preferred.

review/summary: Good K-Cup Variety Pack - Gloria Jean's 96 each
review/text: We ordered this since we already knew the Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee is one of our favorites.  The Gloria Jean's French Vanilla and Hazelnut are both good.  We have not yet tried the Mudslide of the same brand, but will update this review when we do.  Good price, accurate shipping time, nice product.  Think the price is lower since the expiration date is about 3 months away (01-2013).  That's OK with us since these won't be around long enough to find out if they go stale or not.  Note that stickers on the boxes obscured the product description so we could not verify the products before the plastic wrapping was removed and we had to acutally open the boxes since these stickers do not peel off.  Thankfully the products are exactly what we ordered.

This time when I went to replace them  the store had only Knorr Caldo Con Sabor De Pollo bouillon powder so I purchased this 7.9 ounce jar. Works fine. In fact, I like it better in-as-much as I can adjust the amount much easier and stir the ingredient in much quicker than with the solid cube. I'm not certain why the label would be in Spanish as the product was bought in a store that was British owned. Oh well, such is life.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: The product itself was a decent size and the quantity seemed a lot more than it actually was.  The quality however was not so great.  I had purchased these chocolates to make part of my engagement favors, but was disappointed that the foil/wrapping quality was horrible.  It was very wrinkly and cheap.  There were tears in at least 30 of the chocoaltes that I had to toss because I could not use due to the tears in the foil.  They were on the other hand tasty and I would buy again just for decor or regular guests and not for a formal event.  Due to the wrinkly foil and quality they appeared quite cheap.  The customer service was great and the staff was very helpful so nothing negative about the company itself.  I will buy again just with caution!

review/summary: Coffee has new meaning for me
review/text: I bought the Bosch Tassimo T-Disc single cup coffee and beverage maker (chocolate, teas, etc.) I am so pleased with this system. And I LOVE the Tassimo Gevalia Latte pods (T-Discs).<br /><br />What I like best:<br /><br />-- There's two discs used for each cup of coffee (latte), one is the REAL MILK creamer, the other espresso.<br /><br />-- This gives you the option of having an espresso ONLY, should you choose. Simply don't use the included creamer disc.<br /><br />-- The strength of the espresso or milk is separately adjustable. Simply hold the big, shiny button when the green light is flashing (flashes after the initial brew) and the unit adds more steamed water to the espresso and/or the milk.<br /><br />-- The milk in this latte pack is real milk, not powdered crud like other machines use! IMO it imparts a better, more genuine coffee house flavor to the latte.(Bonus Tip: The milk has been pasteurized at extremely high temperature. That gives it a longer shelf life, but still only about six to 10 months - do NOT refrigerate or freeze. So if you buy these off of eBay or here, ask the seller the date code on the side of ANY package containing dairy (hot chocolate, creamer discs, etc.) since you do not want to get a package close to the shelf life expiration or worse, with expired dates.<br /><br />-- If you want a latte quick, you can be sipping a just-right (not too hot, not lukewarm) in about two minutes from adding the first disc. To avoid fisticuffs on who goes first in the morning or in the break room, there is a dual coffee maker that brews two cups, side by side.<br /><br />-- Unlike other machines, the Bosch Tassimo machine(formerly made by Braun) has a bar code reader that reads the bar code on the label on each disc. The machine reads the bar code and knows what it is supposed to do in terms of how much water to add, how long to heat, etc. How cool is that! Very! For example, if you insert a 12 oz. coffee T-disc, the machine automatically knows to add 12 ounces of hot water to the brewed coffee. If you insert an espresso disc (which comes in this latte package) the machine adds just the right amount of water to make an espresso like you would find in an Italian cafe (about three tablespoons of water). If you need to wake up in the morning have an espresso, you will be gritting your teeth, driving 80 mph in the car to work).<br /><br />-- COFFEE FLAVOR IS EXTREMELY SUBJECTIVE. One man's elixir of the Gods is to another Satan's poison. So these coffees are like romantic relationships. Only you know what you see in someone and you are not going to base a relationship on what friends, family or co-workers think of your significant other. Same goes for coffee. Why on earth would you buy coffee, or not, based on what a total stranger (that's me) thinks tastes good. You need to make up your own mind on what tastes good to you.<br /><br />So what I recommend is that you buy a sampler and find out what you like. After that, then buy packs containing 8 to 14 cups of brew. (Because I like a lot of Half/Half in my way-too-strong coffee shop coffee, I ended up loving these Gevalia Latte T-Discs (but I also happen to like Gevalia coffee). You may like the Maxwell House coffee or the Gevalia Morning Roast blend (I find the Gevalia Morning Roast way too strong for my tastes. I found that with the 12 oz T-Disc I was cutting the 12 oz brewed coffee in half and adding 4 ounces of Half & Half like I had been doing at Starbucks, for example. So that coffee is NOT for me.)<br /><br />-- These individual coffee machines are the rage for making coffee. It is great in the office break room, or for couples who want fresh cups of coffee each morning but not a full or partial pot (making a partial pot is a hassle). I predict that all other coffee makers, except for making big pots for four to ten people, will fall by the wayside. Even with large groups I predict most people are going to want a coffee made to order.<br /><br />-- It is also a fantastic way to save money. Each cup of coffee costs less than a dollar, on average. That's far less than paying $3 to $5 at Starbucks.<br /><br />Bonus Info:<br /><br />-- The package indicates the product is made by Kraft Foods. IMO that's a name you can trust and it will back up the product.<br /><br />-- Do NOT refrigerate, do NOT freeze (the creamer disc will explode rendering them unusable).<br /><br />-- The date code (expiration date) for the creamers (that are a real dairy product, not powered MRE cr#p) is clearly displayed on the side of the package. On mine just bought on 12/02/11 the date code is Aug 05, 2012.<br /><br />-- You can also lose weight with these machines? How is that? Well I don't know about you, but when I used to get my morning and afternoon cup of coffee at Starbucks I would also cave and get a sweet roll of some type. So by not going to the cafe I cut out the temptation (and eventual desire) to get a lemon bar or carrot cake. Cutting out two sweets a day, that has to result in significant weight loss.<br /><br />-- These are cheaper online than, for example, at my local supermarket. For an Eight Latte pack (8 espresso, 8 creamers) I paid $12.99 at my local Safeway. Of course at Safeway I had the latte pack in hand immediately, no waiting for shipping. So for me in an emergency Safeway will do albeit that significantly increases the PPCOC.<br /><br />Sidenote: These machines are a win win. The coffee machine manufacturers and producers make a lot more money because these discs give us far less coffee (per pound if you want to use that measure). But we win because of convenience, weight loss, and also saving money by not spending $10 daily at the cafe (coffee and a sweet). Even a coffee by itself cost about $3 to $5 here in San Francisco, so cutting that expense is significant.<br /><br />Office managers, this is a reason to get one of these types of machines. And arguably productivity will go up since employees won't be leaving the office to get a coffee. And making a coffee with one of these machines is fun. So it might even boost morale (the first few months will be trying because you will have to determine which T-Discs people want. There might be fights if two employees argue over who gets the last latte in the pack.

review/text: I have been using tassimo gevalia espresso for at least three years and LOVE it.  The pods now have a new foil covering.  For some reason, when I lift the handle to take out the pod it explodes with hot grounds, making a gigantic mess and ruining the cup of coffee.  I would say at least half of each box does this.  Irritating!

review/summary: Good but salty...
review/text: I bought Hormel Real Crumbled Peppered Bacon not just as a topper for my salads--must...have...bacon--but I thought the real bacon bits would be a great addition to mashed potatoes, pasta, even omelets in a pinch.  The texture of the bacon is soft and chewy.  These are not imitation bacon bits, so you're not going to get crunch out of these.  You might be able to crisp them up by heating them in a skillet, but I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />They add a lot of flavor to salads, but beware when cooking with this product.  It is VERY salty!  So before you add salt to your recipe, taste it first.  The salt from the bacon may be all you need.<br /><br />Aside from the salt factor, the bacon does have a nice, balanced peppery and smoked flavor that just does wonders to cheese dishes.  I especially liked it with my macaroni and cheese.  I didn't add it to the recipe but more as an afterthought once the casserole was done and it was a nice addition.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product as it's one of those items you keep in your cupboard for use in a pinch; and because it has a decent shelf life (my shipment had one year on it), you don't have to worry about buying in bulk.

review/summary: One of my favorite coffees
review/text: This coffee is by far one of my favorites.  You can't beat it.  It has a great taste to it and I never get tired of drinking it.  It's a stronger coffee so you may not have to use quite as much as some other blends.

review/summary: Excellent Brew
review/text: If you like strong tasty almost burned coffee this is the one for you. A couple of cups of this and you'll be at your best for the excitement ahead. Of course too much and your hands will be a little shaky.  To me this is coffee at its best!!!
