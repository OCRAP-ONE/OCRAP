review/summary: The best I've found
review/text: I've tried a number of ginger beers/ales after stumbling upon some locally, and of those Fever-Tree is simply the best.<br /><br />I'm not picky about carbonation so I can't comment on that, but it has a strong ginger bite and isn't overly sweet. The real selling point is that the flavor comes from the ginger and not fruit juice or added spice, exactly what I want. I say this in relation to Reed's ginger beer which I place just behind this in ranking; it has a similar bite, and is also 'natural', but is rather sweet and the pineapple and lime juices don't contribute to the experience. I say spice in relation to Blenheim's spicy ginger ale which is just that. I could be wrong, but regardless it's beyond the point where it's palatable. I've also tried the Ginger People variety which lacks the bite and sweetness, leaving an earthy ginger taste. I don't enjoy it alone but it is present in the Fever-Tree brew, and this is good. I suppose I should note that I haven't tried these as mixers<br /><br />The downside (at least for us US folks) is obviously the expense. I can't quote prices but even with Prime Fever-Tree is more than 3 times the cost-per-ounce of Reed's which is available to me locally. And the question, is it worth it? For me, mostly. I don't drink much soda, but I'm accustomed enough that I can overlook Reed's's sweetness for its price. At the same time I will keep stocking these with the intention of making them last. I certainly don't regret buying a case just to try it. They're. Just. So. Good.

review/text: I had been using Gosling's ginger beer for my dark and stormy's and moscow mules.  I wasn't thrilled about the high fructose corn syrup and overall super sweet taste.  Fever-Tree ginger beer is exactly what I was looking for.  Perfectly balanced, natural sweetener (cane sugar), and fantastic strong ginger taste.  Couldn't be happier.

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: I got a case of this Fever-Tree Premium Ginger Beer as a present for Christmas.  Wow!  Talk about flavor (and aroma).  Immediately following my first sip, I thought it just tasted like a slightly more powerful ginger-ale.  But, after a few seconds, the ginger flavor really started growing (and kept on growing).  What it finally ended up as was a VERY gingery/peppery flavor that lasted for a long time.  It's really good.  I was worried that the 6.8 ounce bottles wouldn't be big enough.  But, with the powerful flavor and the long-lasting taste, it's more than enough.  I rate this at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5 and will be buying more in the future.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Refreshingly Differenr
review/text: I first experienced this beverage at a higher end restaurant a couple of months ago. This is NOT Ginger-Ale. It has a very unique taste, with the distinct flavor of raw ginger, a slight bite on the tongue and a clean and refreshing after taste. I searched all local retail outlets without success and was pleased to find it available at Amazon. I paid $6.00 for a bottle at the restaurant (I said it was higher end), and the price at Amazon is less than $1.25/bottle with free shipping. The bottles are small but are actually just the right size for a refreshing non-alcoholic aperitif.<br />This Ginger Beer is not for everyone but if you enjoy a different taste that is crisp, clean and refreshing, I highly recommend it.

review/text: For anyone who has ever tried ginger beer, this product really packs a punch! It reminded me of ginger beer from the islands - it has that authentic, smooth, ginger burn that you expect from real ginger beer. Totally none alcoholic and thankfully not a soda. Much more refreshing with the right amount of ginger bite. There is actual ginger floating at the bottom of the bottle so you have to shake it up before you drink the beverage...outstanding! I love the 6.8 oz glass bottles-just the right amount to quench a thirst but not too much so you don't have leftovers that go flat...smart thinking. I am a huge fan of ginger beer and I give Fever-Tree Premium a 5+. Drink up ginger beer lovers. Thank you FEVER-TREE.<br /><br />J

review/summary: British Commonwealth folk, you will not be disappointed!
review/text: If you grew up in one of the former British colonies and are now living in the States, you'll know what I am talking about - you want those long cherished tastes and regularly chase after vague product names on Google. Sadly, when you do get a popular American knock off (American Cadburys?? Really, why is it different?) it tastes different because of HFCS or some similar thing.<br /><br />Well, the Ginger Beer from Fever-Tree does not disappoint. It is not watered down and has the real sugar (pure cane) instead of that other 4-letter stuff. Strong and tasty, just as I remember ginger beer to be. On a hot summer day, an ice cold Fever-Tree hits the taste buds and brings back those memories just right.<br /><br />The bottles are 6.8 ounces, not too much or too little, just right. And they are glass like God meant them to be. They are impressively well packaged and came quickly. Unfortunately, the 24 bottles do tend to vanish rapidly because others in the household pick up on the taste rather too soon and so I am a regular customer, ordering another case right after I complete this review.<br /><br />Now to search for some good biltong and them REAL South African sausages. (Know any Boer farmers that moved to the States?)

I ordered the product on a Monday and it arrived on Wednesday.  The bottles are small, but perfect for mixing up a nice Moscow Mule.  He went on about how refreshing the drink was and how he couldn't wait to have some this summer on the boat!<br /><br />Great product and great value with the Amazon Prime free shipping!

review/summary: The taste of RAISINS...
review/text: In case any of you are wondering what the heck this is or what it tastes like, the best way to describe it is:<br />It tastes like the sweetness and flavor of RAISINS.  Which I guess makes sense, sice both raisins and beets are condensed to become the final product and both contain a natural sugar plus other ingredients that arent removed or altered. Even the color is reminiscent and the aroma.<br />I like the fact that it has high iron and magnesium content, (19 and 30%, respectively) so this is a nice way to treat a sugar craving without it being entirely wasted or in vain.<br />It does NOT however have the consistency of honey as many say; it is much thicker and nearly crystallized such that it can be 'spun' or create thing long strings/hairs and it will not pour out of the jar. You have to force it off the spoon lol<br /><br />All in all its probably an aquired taste, especially for putting on breads, and I tend to think its better as an ingredient IN bread etc, but its nothing far out or difficult to enjoy, either. If you are craving iron, this is a good answer LOL

review/text: If you like German potato pancakes you should spread a bit of this stuff on top and you might never again put watery applesauce on them.  Better yet, place the so prepared pancake on a piece of German whole kernel rye bread (pumpernickel works too).  Even better, slice a kaiser roll in half, put on potato pancake, spread some sirup on it, and top it with the pumpernickel.  You got yourself an authentic old-fashioned meal from the Rhineland in Germany.  BTW, that's also where this sirup comes from.  What a treat!

review/summary: Better than Starbucks espresso pods
review/text: Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Amazon, I have produced delicious lattes using these pods. The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts.  FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper "tab" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a "best if used by" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.

review/summary: Outstanding flavor, great price!
review/text: After years of using Starbuck's decaf and regular single serving espresso pods, I finally found a substitute that's more economical and MUCH better tasting.<p>I've used three different brands of pods in my Starbuck's Barista machine, and have found that the quality of the pod and the flavor of the espresso inside is, by far, the best in the Espressione pods. The flavor is more full bodied and stronger than in the Starbuck's pods. I actually use one pod to make two shots of espresso, and the flavor is more intense than when I buy my specialty drinks from Starbucks or other coffee houses.<p>Also, the pod itself is of very high quality. Each pod is individually wrapped in an airtight, hard foil wrapper, and I've never opened a package yet that contained a torn pod with coffee spilling out. Such is not the case with other lesser brands.<p>The tab on each pod is also handy, making it easier to switch out a hot spent pod with a new one when making a second round of espresso.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: We ordered these to go with our new espresso machine and have been so pleased with them. We were really shocked at how delicious and tasty this coffee is - I bought it based on the Amazon reviews and they were right on. I decided these deserved another good review after I tried a Starbucks pod this morning and had to throw it out it was so terrible - it had no flavor and tasted watered down even though I made the correct amount (1 oz.) I have been lavishing praise on our espresso machine, which it does deserve, but I have now realized that the Espressione pods are the big reason that we've fallen so in love with our home espressos. The coffee is very flavorful, richly so. The price is also competitive when ordered in bulk like this, a great deal (these pods come out to be $.40 each whereas the Starbucks pods were $.41 each). They are certainly worth more.<p>One caveat, make sure to order the 100% Arabica pods - you would be well advised to always buy Arabica coffee as it is far superior to coffee made with the cheaper, more acidic Robusto beans.

review/summary: Great for Handpresso!
review/text: I normally purchase the Lavazza Grand Crema pods for use with my Breville espresso machine, and have always been happy with them but wanted to try something different, so I ordered a box of Espressione Classic Espresso instead. Initially I was very disappointed with the results; a 30-second shot of espresso using these pods contained only about half as much liquid as one using my normal Lavazza pods (in other words, the water was passing through these pods at a much slower rate than through the Lavazza). Maybe my machine is lacking in pressure... but I could tell just by the feel of the pods that these are much more tightly packed than the Lavazza ones.<br /><br />My disappointment changed to delight when I tried these pods out on my Handpresso Wild, however. I had never really liked the taste of the Lavazza pods using this machine (seemed much more bitter compared to my "real" machine at home), but with Espressione it was perfect!<br /><br />Bottom line... if you are using a Handpresso, I recommend these pods 100%. If you are using a normal espresso machine, you may want to try out a smaller size package before committing to 150 pods.

The espresso machine excels in quality and ease of use.  The espresso is exquisite.

review/summary: Excellent pods that I've used in my Briel espresso unit for years
review/text: Both the 100% Arabica and the Espressione Espresso are excellent for espresso drinks. Traditionally espresso, unlike good drip coffee, is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees. The taste differences are noticeable, but I don't have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.<br /><br />If you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly on the "best before" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get "expired" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso. Basically they're vacuum packed and not much is happening inside the wrapper.

review/summary: Wow. I didn't gag! A dark chocolate vibe with slight grassy undertones--and impressive nutrients stats
review/text: I ordered this with trepidation. I've never been able to swallow green food mixes, other than Green Magma (which is not "mixed", but just barley grass). Wheat grass makes me gag. Literally--cannot swallow it. My body rejects it and I gag and spit it out. So, over the years, trying green foods trying to find something I can swallow has been trying.<br /><br />Well, there ya go. This one works.<br /><br />I ordered it on the basis of numerous positive flavor reviews and I liked the list of nutrients/enzymes.<br /><br />30 calories per serving of 8 grams= 1 g fat, 2 g protein, 4 g carbs (2 g fiber), 65% Vit A, 30% of C and K, 15% of B12 and Riboflavin, 6% of iron and manganese; organic grasses (wheat, barley, alfalfa, spirulina, spinach, broccoli, chlorela); with antioxidant from maca, acai, carrot, rose hips, beet, pineapple, green tea, acerola cherry. Fiber from apple pectin, organic oat powder, organic flax seed powder. Also L acidophilus, peppermint, Siberian eleuthero root, and sea salt.<br /><br />The flavor is pleasant. It's like the taste of bitterish dark chocolate bars with a grassy undertone that isn't offputting. It's not like it's a chocolate malted or anything, but it works fine for me. I can drink this. I do not gag. Yay.<br /><br />I will reorder this. I like the healthful profile and the flavor.<br /><br />UPDATE: Okay, I didn't really expect a noticeable effect from this (I mean, I've had superfoods before and didn't suddenly go change the world or anything), but I have actually noticed an uptick in my energy after adding this to my pre-workout smoothie and my pre-chore protein drink. I've been adding it to BSN sytha-6 chocolate protein mix with an extra teaspoon (heaping) of Raw cacao (organic), and it's a nice flavor combo. I think it would be great with a banana, too, for extra potassium (a chocobanana vibe).<br /><br />Maybe it's placebo. Who knows? But as I wasn't thinking I'd notice a change, maybe not. But wow, I do feel an energy surge in the afternoon when I usually have a slump and I get through my 55 minute personal training session with more oomph.

review/text: Amazing Grass Chocolate Green Superfood Powder is my favorite oatmeal add-in. If you are a chocolate lover looking to get healthier, the flavor of this thing will knock your socks off. Plus, it's incredible 'insurance' for obtaining a rainbow of organic(!) fruits and vegetables, and therefore a definite energy-booster. (How else would one amass all that stuff?) The packets are so convenient, especially for travel, etc. -- I only need to use about 1/2 of one (for the oatmeal alone) per day. But it also makes a great topping for other things: desserts, smoothies, and more. I have seen this identical product in health food stores for $21.00 ($19.00 when on sale), so being able to get it on Amazon for $17.00, with Free Super Saver Shipping if there's something else that you were going to buy anyway (to make the $25.00 threshold), is a great deal. Do your body and taste buds a favor, and invest in some Chocolate Green Superfood.

review/summary: Great cookies and brownies, and I am very fussy!
review/text: I bought the cookie and brownie assortment for myself because although I avoid sugar, I still like to have a rare sugar treat waiting for me (hidden in the freezer), if I need it, to help me deal with life.  These said they are made with all natural ingredients.  I was skeptical... I know from working in the food industry that companies can save alot of money by putting artificial stuff in the food and most do.  When the cookies arrived, the packaging was beautiful.. my name was embossed on the bow.  I ate a cookie and a brownie right away (I was justified; up till then it had been a tough day), and to my surprise, I did not get the usual sleepy feeling I get from eating food with sugar.  This "not getting sleepy" only also happens with my own homemade cookies, made from scratch, with all natural ingredients. So, I trust this company is telling the truth that the ingredients are all natural. I immediately froze the rest of my order because I like to tell myself I that I have some semblance of self control.  I have since eaten one other cookie.. same thing.. great cookie and no sleepy reaction!

review/summary: These treats made our dog violently ill; irradiated at too high a level?
review/text: We were looking for a 100% meat treat for our dog, sourced and also made in the USA; this particular Smokehouse USA treat fit the bill (though others under the same label do not).  Initially, we were excited that our dog seemed to love the taste of these treats (she ate the two strips we gave her with gusto), especially since she's very picky about most "healthy" stuff for dogs.<br /><br />However, not long after ingesting these, she became violently ill with gastrointestinal symptoms continuing for days.  Non-stop diarrhea was the worst part of it.  Aside from these treats, nothing else in her diet was different than usual.  Her appetite is still not back to normal, and it's been a month now.  She's listless and just doesn't seem like herself yet, though the GI issues are OK now.<br /><br />I wanted to warn people that these treats are irradiated, since the listing here on Amazon doesn't indicate it.  There's a seal on the back of the package stating, "Treated with radiation for your safety".  Since a number of foods are irradiated for human and pet consumption and thought to be safe, I'm not sure if unsafe levels of radiation was the issue in our case, or if it was simple food poisoning.<br /><br />Either way, I wish I'd known the treats were irradiated before I bought them, especially since the irradiated Orijen cat food imported to Australia in 2008 ended up being the cause of death and illness for many cats.  It's getting harder and harder to stay healthy in this world, but being forewarned of potential issues is better than lack of awareness at all.  And I won't be buying more Smokehouse USA products, regardless of what the source of our issue was.<br /><br />(See article re: feline deaths/illnesses from Orijen cat food irradiated at entry into Australia (2008), here:[...]

Sad to say, these are really like rawhide, not like jerky. They are much harder to chew and she can't even bite through them. Considering the price paid plus shipping, we are not at all satisfied.

review/text: Bought Sun-Maid small box of raisins at Albertsons thinking it was the old 1.5 oz size we bought for years. Paid their regular price but noticed later the box seemed smaller. Got home then compared it to an older box we had and yes it confirmed our suspicions.<br />Sun-maid reduced the box thickness size to 1 oz but kept the same price...so we paid the same price for 33% less raisins. Nice try Sun-Maid.. The overall dimensions and packaging stayed the same is what fooled us.<br />Needless to say won"t be buying them again due to their tricky maneuver!

review/summary: To Life!
review/text: Sun Maid raisins are the best brand of raisins on your grocer's shelf--period. These raisins are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They are relatively high in sugar (29 grams per 1/4 cup) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these raisins are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that the raisins do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily.<br /><br />These raisins are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. These 1.5-ounce cartons provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!

review/summary: If you like Stoned Wheat Thins from Canada...
review/text: ...then you will probably like these.  I would say that they are about halfway between the Canadian crackers and traditional American saltines.  Halfway in texture (tougher than saltines but not as much body as the Canadian) and halfway in flavor.  I love the Canadian crackers, because they are plain -- like saltines -- and yet are subtly flavorful.  These are more flavorful than saltines but less so than the Canadian crackers.<br /><br />The Canadian crackers are my ideal (can't stand traditional American saltines), but they have gotten more expensive and are increasingly difficult to find in my grocery stores.  (The Canadian dollar is worth more than it used to be and the imports are probably being squeezed over price.)<br /><br />There are lots of snack crackers in the store that are alternatives to saltines.  But most of them impress me as just having extra salt with a sprinkling of chicken powder and garlic powder.  They strike me as artificial...manufactured and unappealing.  I much prefer the subtle flavor of these crackers for most purposes.  (I am excluding Cheeze-It crackers from this discussion...I ~love~ them!)<br /><br />I saw these in my price club and decided to give them a try.  As I said, they are are a decent, "halfway" substitute for the Canadian crackers.  Now price is a whole separate issue.  I would not buy them at a non-competitive price.  Breakage in shipment is also an issue...I've had uneven results with ordering this sort of thing for UPS delivery.

review/summary: Better than Starbucks espresso pods
review/text: Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Amazon, I have produced delicious lattes using these pods. The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts.  FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper "tab" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a "best if used by" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.

review/summary: Outstanding flavor, great price!
review/text: After years of using Starbuck's decaf and regular single serving espresso pods, I finally found a substitute that's more economical and MUCH better tasting.<p>I've used three different brands of pods in my Starbuck's Barista machine, and have found that the quality of the pod and the flavor of the espresso inside is, by far, the best in the Espressione pods. The flavor is more full bodied and stronger than in the Starbuck's pods. I actually use one pod to make two shots of espresso, and the flavor is more intense than when I buy my specialty drinks from Starbucks or other coffee houses.<p>Also, the pod itself is of very high quality. Each pod is individually wrapped in an airtight, hard foil wrapper, and I've never opened a package yet that contained a torn pod with coffee spilling out. Such is not the case with other lesser brands.<p>The tab on each pod is also handy, making it easier to switch out a hot spent pod with a new one when making a second round of espresso.

review/text: We ordered these to go with our new espresso machine and have been so pleased with them. We were really shocked at how delicious and tasty this coffee is - I bought it based on the Amazon reviews and they were right on. I decided these deserved another good review after I tried a Starbucks pod this morning and had to throw it out it was so terrible - it had no flavor and tasted watered down even though I made the correct amount (1 oz.) I have been lavishing praise on our espresso machine, which it does deserve, but I have now realized that the Espressione pods are the big reason that we've fallen so in love with our home espressos. The coffee is very flavorful, richly so. The price is also competitive when ordered in bulk like this, a great deal (these pods come out to be $.40 each whereas the Starbucks pods were $.41 each). They are certainly worth more.<p>One caveat, make sure to order the 100% Arabica pods - you would be well advised to always buy Arabica coffee as it is far superior to coffee made with the cheaper, more acidic Robusto beans.

review/summary: Great for Handpresso!
review/text: I normally purchase the Lavazza Grand Crema pods for use with my Breville espresso machine, and have always been happy with them but wanted to try something different, so I ordered a box of Espressione Classic Espresso instead. Initially I was very disappointed with the results; a 30-second shot of espresso using these pods contained only about half as much liquid as one using my normal Lavazza pods (in other words, the water was passing through these pods at a much slower rate than through the Lavazza). Maybe my machine is lacking in pressure... but I could tell just by the feel of the pods that these are much more tightly packed than the Lavazza ones.<br /><br />My disappointment changed to delight when I tried these pods out on my Handpresso Wild, however. I had never really liked the taste of the Lavazza pods using this machine (seemed much more bitter compared to my "real" machine at home), but with Espressione it was perfect!<br /><br />Bottom line... if you are using a Handpresso, I recommend these pods 100%. If you are using a normal espresso machine, you may want to try out a smaller size package before committing to 150 pods.

review/summary: Excellent pods that I've used in my Briel espresso unit for years
review/text: Both the 100% Arabica and the Espressione Espresso are excellent for espresso drinks. Traditionally espresso, unlike good drip coffee, is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees. The taste differences are noticeable, but I don't have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.<br /><br />If you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly on the "best before" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get "expired" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso. Basically they're vacuum packed and not much is happening inside the wrapper.

review/summary: melted bag of jelly goo
review/text: I live in Arizona and it is still warm in September, but I have never had gummi bears melt into gelatinous goo!  I usually order Haribo brand but wanted to try these. I opened the box to find two bags of brightly colored hunks of melted candy that resembled something from the Aliens movie. Do not order these in warm months as there is something lacking that causes them to melt unlike other brands. It made my heart jump when I first opened the box it looked that scary, kind of like a Halloween joke where you get the trick instead of the treat. I will stick with Haribo from now on. Amazon did credit the cost back to my account, which was nice of them since you can't ship this alien blob back.

review/summary: Great tasting!
review/text: I recently ordered this product and like it a lot.  I was told it's a better alternative than normal salt.  It's very good and the price was reasonable enough.  It is WAY saltier than normal salt with the chemicals so you do need to use a LOT less on/in your food though.  :-)

review/text: Love the flavor.  Makes a alot of servings of flavored water (I like mine sweet).  Great way to get my kids to drink more water.  Try the other flavors if Berry Pomegranate is not your thing.

review/summary: Finally, Something that Makes Me WANT to Drink Water ...
review/text: I have always struggled trying to drink a decent amount of water each day ... especially at work.  I dutifully carry a large water bottle to work that sits on my desk all day.  A sip of tepid water here and there doesn't add up and at day's end, I find myself chugging almost the entire 30 oz. bottle before I leave the office.  Yes, the simple, healthy act of drinking water has become a chore.  The problem for me is that tepid water is just unappealing (and my office's water fountain isn't much colder).  While I like some of the flavored bottles of water, I did not like the sugar content, the odd taste or the thought of buying water every day.  The Crystal Light packets and other similar products proved to be too potent, somewhat messy (pouring the contents into bottled water) and never dissolved completely.  The first time I saw a MIO commercial, I immediately thought of it as yet another short-lived gimmick ... then I actually tried it.<br /><br />Ironically, I find MIO somewhat revolutionary in that one little bottle of flavored liquid seemed to address all the problems I had with flavoring water:<br /><br />- the convenient little squeeze bottle with its rubber spout and snap top eliminates any potential for mess ... no drips or leaks and the bottle is sturdy enough to throw in a pocket, glovebox, or briefcase without fear.  The responsive squeeze bottle easily allows the user to control the amount of desired flavoring.<br /><br />- the liquid concentrate tastes "natural", dissolves immediately and, depending on a person's flavor preference (strong or weak flavor), a single 1.62 fl. oz. bottle can last quite a while (for me, it justifies the price).<br /><br />- the caloric content is nothing but zeros:  0 calories, 0 fat, 0 sodium, 0 carb and 0 protein.<br /><br />- there is a decent array of flavors ... although I hope more will be added down the road.<br /><br />MIO has kicked life into my water-drinking at work and eliminated my end-of-day chugging ritual.  While I enjoy the flavors, I feel what makes this product really work is the packaging ... that little squeeze bottle makes all the difference.
