review/text: This is just plain instant coffee, not even the decent kind.  The K-cups come out empty after brewing, there is just powder in them- just like the gas station cappuccino machine.  Except the gas station charges less.  Very disappointed.

review/summary: GAS STATION COFFEE!
review/text: These cappucino k-cups are truly awful. I pre-ordered this one as well as the french vanilla one and they are both horrible. The consistency, taste, and smell are exactly like the cappucino you get out of those machines at the gas station. Don't bother, there are way better k-cups out there...the green mountain espresso one and the gloria jean cappucino ones are much better. Yes you have to mix your own milk in, but you can get creative and get a cheap foamer to use with different flavored creamers. Way better.

review/summary: YUMMY is an understatement
review/text: Don't buy this coffee if you want regular coffee.  It is NOT, I repeat NOT just coffee that sort of has a hint of flavor, or smells better than it tastes.  It's sweet and creamy, don't have to add a thing to it.  Great on a cold day, or just a special treat for yourself.  Has a delicate caramel flavor and good aroma.  I've been looking for something like this since I discovered the Chai Tea Latte (which is my all time favorite).

review/summary: Gas Station Coffee? Yep.
review/text: Like many others, I too was looking for the gas station coffee taste, as I find gas station coffee to be the sweetest and tastiest for an amateur coffee drinker like me. If you prefer the strong, exotic, even authentic taste, this is not the coffee for you. But if you are looking for coffee that is sweet, and tasty without having to do much, this is it.

review/summary: WAKE UP PEOPLE  You are being scammed !
review/text: This company is scamming everyone.  They put instant coffee in a k-cup and pass it off as real brewed coffee.  I purchased their Dark roast to try it out.<br />The first thing I noticed was how lite the k-cup felt.  If you shake it, it sounds like a little snarl drum.  As it brews, you get a real dark thick mixture of water and coffee, and then only water.  When it was done I opened the k-cup.  No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good. (that's my personal opinion on the taste)  Overall:  You're getting low quality instant coffee at fresh brewed prices.  Shame on Grove Square.

review/text: The worst coffee beverage I've ever had. Grove square also has "coffee" which you wouldn't serve to your worst enemy. The taste is worse than Pakastani gas station brew, it's more like Nescafe that's been left to burn in a pot for hours. If you think this review is an exaggeration and you have money to waste, try it out, and then proceed to throw $10 in the trash can. Keurig should seriously consider removing all of Grove square's products.

review/text: If you're looking to buy some French Vanilla coffee, look no further! Having tried several k-cup flavors, I have to say this French Vanilla is in a league of it's own. It is amazing, so rich and creamy. I have made it both on the medium and small settings on my Keurig and both are very good, the small so creamy and thick, almost like a dessert. AND it is the least expensive of all the cups I've tried, being only 50c per cup, with the next lowest being 67c. I can't wait to try the Grove Square caramel flavor.

review/text: It wasn't until my It got "backed up" and only dispensed a half-cup that I realized these were instant and as such, required special cleaning. These are not the brew kind so after making a cup, you need to run 1-2 cups of water through the It or the needle and bottom of the filter dispenser/spout (I have no idea what it is called) gets clogged. I clean my It frequently, but these and the hot cocoas are really not worth the hassle of two cups of water after every cup I make. The cappuccino tins from like International Coffee or a packet of swiss miss, etc are much less fuss.

review/text: Yes, this is an instant coffee.  It dissolves as the hot water runs through the K-Cup.  But it is so refreshing and fast when you need a pick-me-up cup of coffee.  The flavor is wonderful.  My husband and I also like the hazelnut and caramel flavors.  You can't beat this price, especially with "Subscribe and Save".  I have found Grove Square at HEB in Texas, but it is more expensive than the price here.  I'm not very picky about it being a perfectly brewed coffee with deep, rich taste.  I just want something that is hot and tasty.  Try it out and if you don't like it, share it with a friend or family member who will be glad to have some free, good coffee.  A box of 18 K-Cups makes a great hostess gift.  By the way, the order is for 3 boxes of 18, a total of 54 cups of coffee.  I wasn't too clear on that when I ordered the first time.  Why pay $3 for a cup at Starbucks when this is just as good, convenient at home, and tastes great?

I brewed myself a cup and it was so bad I couldn't even drink it, i had to throw it out.  First off, I want to say that I'm not a cappuccino snob, I enjoy a great cappuccino at a coffee shop but I also regularly drink the powdered flavored kind that you just mix with water.  I didn't have the highest of standards for this drink to begun with but it was bad, t doesn't have very much flavor the flavor that it does have is not good, it's watery (I brewed it on the small cup setting) and it has a bad aftertaste that I just couldn't get over.  These are also pretty expensive for what you get and you are much better off in my opinion to just go to get a mix with water types.

review/summary: Not quite coffee, but delicious!
review/text: One of my coworkers bought a giant K-Cup variety pack, and this variety was in there. Man, it's delicious. It's as good as those French Vanilla cappuccinos you might get from a gas station in the middle of the night when driving down I-5, but you can get it in your own kitchen.<br /><br />Does it have much coffee in there? It's hard to say. The box claims that there is some instant coffee inside, but it certainly doesn't taste like it. It simply tastes like sweet delicious vanilla.

review/summary: BETTER THAN "5 HOUR ENERGY" AND GREAT FOR A HANGOVER
review/text: Yessiree- this is the same sweet coffee-esque sugar buzz that you'll find at most convenience stores and gas stations. Is it a chemical abomination? You bet! Does it taste great with a day-old buttered roll in a wax-paper sleeve? Absolutely! Here is the real thing that fogs your windows and leaves a vanilla aroma in its aftermath. It is sickeningly sweet and guaranteed to snap you out of a hangover when followed with a day-old roll or bagel with cream cheese. Nothing short of an American classic and friend of the open road.<br /><br />It's not just about the sugar. They actually put 30mg of caffeine into this concoction of--well, you really don't need to know.<br /><br />It's cheaper than the $1.75 at the gas station (around $.45 a paper cup).<br /><br />It's not actually coffee-- but it hits the spot when you're down and out and need something more for breakfast than a Baby Ruth Bar.<br /><br />Go ahead- you know that you want this, uh...whatever it is. Mmmmm! Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!

review/summary: Really deserves each star!
review/text: My favorite thing about this K-cup Cappuccino is that it does NOT taste artificial!!!!  I purchased a personalized variety pack of K-cups on amazon and this cup was included.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to the artificial flavoring of many K-cups.  This tastes smooth, creamy, and sweet (bc of the caramel).  It tastes like it could have come straight from the coffee shop, really!<br /><br />You don't have to add any cream or anything because it is already included in the cup.  The only complaint that I can imagine others might have is its level of sweetness, if they don't like sweet cappuccinos, but then don't purchase one that is caramel flavored right?

review/summary: My new favorite for a cocoa-type drink
review/text: While Mocha Nut Fudge coffee is still my favorite, and hazelnut the coffee I most often drink,  This is the best tasting cocoa-type think I have yet had.  I find myself drinking the hazelnut, then making this in the same cup with some of the hazelnut still in there, as well as just drinking it by itself.<br />After trying several cocoas and cappuccinos, I was skipping the kcups and just using the machine to make hot water and using the far cheaper instant cocoa packets.  But after a freind had me try the caramel cappuccino, I ordered boxes of my own, and I am still happy with the taste after a month of it.

review/text: I had a cup of this at a friend's home, and he asked me if I liked it. I told him frankly that it wasn't great; it tasted too much like instant coffee. He said that it WAS instant! Conclusion: It is anathema to use a K-Cup brewer to make INSTANT anything. And at 50 cents (minimum) per cup, it's got to be the height of misplaced convenience. There are wonderful flavored coffee K-Cup varieties out there -- try them.

review/text: I found that Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuchino did not have any pleasant French vanilla or coffee smell. The taste was somewhat medicinal with a bitter aftertaste. Not returnable at Amazon since it is opened and after exchanging emails with the company, Sturm Foods, Inc.,  I learned they do not refund customers based on "personal taste". I would suggest staying with a brand you know and love and avoid this "bargain" item.

Unless you are a fan of flavored laxatives,which is what this reminded me of, save your cash and just either buy an over priced cappuccino from a trendy cookie-cutter coffee vendor, McDonald's or a gas station because any of them have better tasting product than this. I literally took a sip and spewed it out in the sink. It was foul. Seriously, don't buy it.

Disappointed and upset are only two words that I can use to describe the experience. It was extremely sweet and already lightened (very light) and what I consider an instant coffee !! No where did it say that it is instant or artificially lightened. I called the company and they said it did not have to be labeled "instant" coffee. I don't think he even wanted to listen to me. I told him that I probably would not buy another of their products, especially after reading other reviews......and I would forwarn people about the product!

review/text: The only reason this gets one star is because you have to give it atleast that much.  This is not anything like a K-cup.  It is instant coffee in a K-cup wrapper.  There is a supposed guarantee on the box but I have called the number many times and can never get anyone to call me back.  I usually won't bother trying to get my money back on this kind of thing but I have made an exception due to the horrid product.  In the company's defense, there are probably so many people calling to tell them about this wretched product, they may have not had time to get back to me.

review/summary: Bad aftertaste - and review the ingredients!  24% of daily saturated fat per serving!
review/text: I got this and wanted to try it out and the price was right!  Wow - the taste is sub-par and does taste like something you would find at a gas station dispenser!<br /><br />When I was reading the nutrition facts I noticed that it had 80 calories per serving (not a big deal), I then scanned down and saw that it has 23% of your daily saturated fat!!  Wow!  When I read through the ingredient list the first ones are: Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, corn syrup solids, and then instant coffee and some others.  I'm not health nut both those things don't sound that healthy to me and I can see where the saturated fat is coming from!

review/summary: good until the aftertaste
review/text: These have wonderful flavor until it hits the last note. The aftertaste is so poor it ruins the entire drink. As my daughter put it " I keep drinking it because it is so good but then it tastes so bad." It has the same bitter aftertaste as drinking a diet soda just a bit stronger.

review/summary: Good cup of "fake" cappuccino, just know what you're buying
review/text: Yes, this has instant coffee in it and is ready to drink. If you have ever gotten one of those instant cappuccino drinks from a gas station you pretty much know what this is going to taste like. (you know, the one you have to hold the button and make sure you release in enough time so your drink doesn't overflow!) I enjoy it for what it is, because sometimes I just have a craving for those cheap cappuccino drinks. A few things to note:<br /><br />- Make sure you don't brew more than 8 ounces with one cup, it will be diluted. The stuff is powder mix, it doesn't brew like regular coffee grounds<br />- Please pay attention to ingredients if you are health-conscious (See below for nutrition info & ingredients)<br />- It can leave residue in your keurig/brewer so try to run a round of hot water right after brewing<br />- The box indicates that each serving contains 20-30mg caffeine<br /><br />Nutrition Info for 1 cup:<br />80 calories, 4.5 grams fat (all saturated), 170mg sodium (7%), 9g carbs (5g sugar), 0g protein<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, corn syrup solids, instant coffee, sodium caseinate, salt, cocoa, natural & artificial flavors, dipotassium phosphate, cornstarch, mono- & diglycerides, solicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color, sucralose

review/summary: Instant coffee in a k-cup
review/text: I never review products, good or bad, but this "coffee" is so bad I had to.<br /><br />This is not the typical k-cup coffee. This is an instant coffee similar to Nescafe or SB Via but tastes horrible.<br />The sugar/splenda mix makes this way too sweet. Mixing it half and half with black coffee makes it drinkable.<br /><br />This is basically just adding hot water to instant coffee. There isn't a filter or coffee grounds in the cup.

review/summary: Great taste!
review/text: I absolutely love this cappuccino! I had my doubts, but they were proved wrong! I myself have a sweet tooth and I was worried that this product would taste too much like coffee and not enough like a cappuccino. But thankfully, I was worng and it had the right blend of both. I had 2 cups the first day I bought it! Shared it with my family, they loved it too!

review/text: Dear Coffee snobs, if you want real cappucino, you bought the wrong coffee maker. Considering that you did, be happy with this selection, as its actually VERY Tasty compared to any of the other Cappucino K Cup knock offs. Its the only one I'll buy.

review/summary: Exactly what I wanted!
review/text: I am not a huge coffee drinker, so for me the best cappuccino is one that doesn't have a strong coffee taste. . .I actually prefer the gas station variety over the 'real deal'.  If that's what you like, then this is the perfect fit!  I love it, my husband loves it as well, and he was quite skeptical!  We purchased an actual cappuccino maker several years ago and hated the strong coffee taste, so the machine went back to the store.  He refused to believe me, that this mix was what we were looking for, until I made him a cup!  He's surprised and happy to have a cheaper way to make a favorite drink at home w/out having to stop on the way to work!

review/summary: Hello Diabetes
review/text: Oh my goodness, this was bought for us as a housewarming present for our new Kuerig machine.. I ended up having to stab open the K-cups and put half a teaspoon into the bottom of a regular coffee for it to seem anything like a cappucino and for it to be even remotely drinkable.. I feel like energy drinks would give me less of a sugar high than one of these!!

review/summary: VERY Good!
review/text: The Grove Square Capuccino Cups are just great.  A real treat!  Some of the flavored K-cups are just that - flavored coffee - and you need to add your own cream or milk and sweeteners.  But this is all ready the minute it stops brewing!  To me - the entire concept of the Keurig is to have your favorite beverage ready instantly.  If you have to fill little cups and add your own filters or add your own cream and sugar and flavoring - it isn't quick and instant - and you might as well go back to brewing an enitire pot of coffee or use the espresso machine.  K-cups for the Keurig makes it instant - and with this Vanilla Cappuccino - its ready right away - no need to add another thing.  AND - this is the ONLY place we've found that carries this product.  I've looked at every store in our area that carries K-cups and no one carries this.  Also - the price is great.  Especially this time around.  This is the 3rd time I've placed an order for these and the price was the best ever - $8.47 I think - for 24.  Great price!  Usually they are are betwween $10.47 and $12.  My only regret - I wish Grove Square would also make a Mocha K-cup.  That is another of our favorite coffee drinks.
