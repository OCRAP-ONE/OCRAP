review/summary: The Best Gluten Free Bread Mix!
review/text: There is no gluten free bread out there like this. This is truly one of a kind. The texture is like normal bread! The taste is like normal bread! Make the mix for a pizza crust and you will love it! I am a Manna from Anna pizza crust junkie! Or make hamburger buns from the mix- you will really like how great they taste. I can't say enough about it!

review/summary: poorly assembled
review/text: While I have no complaint about the contents of this order, half of the purpose for paying so much for some tea and trinkets is the arrangement. This item arrived looking like it was simply tossed together as an afterthought. The appeal of sending a gift basket is that it is supposed to look pretty (like the image). If the vendor can't take the time to properly arrange a gift basket, especially if I paid extra for wrapping on top of the cost of the basket itself, I would be hesitant to order such an item from amazon in the future. Might I suggest using FTD or your local florist...

review/summary: Contains gluten.  AVOID if you are a celiac
review/text: This cereal is made in the same facility as wheat containing raisin bran. The amount of gluten in it appears to be low, but it was enough to cause a family member to miss 40 hours of work over a several week period!<br />What really makes me angry about this cereal is that the info on the box makes it seem that Erewhon is a small family owned company dedicated to healthy products.  It may have been at one time, but Erewhon is now owned by U S Mills and they are NOT dedicated to your health. It took weeks to figure out what was making our family sick, because I trusted the brand...BIG MISTAKE. If you want to be strictly gluten free, DON'T EAT THIS CEREAL!

review/text: Both my 2 yr old and my husband like this cereal a lot.  And I didn't even mind it when I had to eat GF for a short time.  I love to use it as a bread crumb for chicken nuggets or fried chicken. I just pop it in the blender and get it really fine. It has a nice sweet taste to it which makes it perfect for breading.<br /><br />I only wish that it had some more nutrients in it.

review/text: Being a school teacher, having severe food allergies, and also being diabetic, I need a breakfast that is fast, good, and meets all my dietary needs.  Erewhon Rice Twice Whole Grain Cereal does this for me.  I have been enjoying this cereal for breakfast for several years. Mixed with sliced bananas, Silksoy milk, and a little bit of fructose, my needs are met.  I was raised on Rice Crispies as a child, and this has been the closest cereal I have found to that yet.

review/text: I love this cereal.  I have purchased it for the last decade- at least and it is a staple in my cabinet.  Great with fruit!  Good with cow milk, almond milk, any milk.  I have baked with this and even made Crispy Treats- which are good, but not as chewy as the brand name when used in crispy treats and they do fall apart.  This cereal is better than the new gluten free Kellog cripies- I think.  Erewhon has their own treat recipe made with nut butter and everyone in my house loves when I make them.

review/summary: Read the ingredients after you.........
review/text: Let your taste buds explode. If you think this cereal has no flavor,your taste buds have been destroyed from _______. This cereal is manufactured from Attune foods. ALL ingredients are grown/produced in the USA. There are no bait and switch,"natural flavors","spices" or refined sugars. Minimally processed,it doesn't get any better for you then this. Nor does it sacrifice ANY great taste. This cereal is a bench mark other cereals should set bar to. Subscribe and save make it more affordable. Until more people understand that it takes more sales to drive the costs down, great truly natural products will be more expensive. Hats off to Attune foods for not sacrificing quality for the almighty dollar.<br /> As one reviewer mentioned,it does turn mushy rather quick. But would you rather have some lab produced creatively named ingredient to firm them up for you so you can enjoy a bowl of cereal for a half hour or more,or know exactly what your eating  is actually good for you?

review/text: The Cereal has changed.<br />The company Attune foods which bought the old company has changed the recipe. It is no longer in the purplish box that Amazon shows, it is in a golden box and the cereal is now called Honey rice twice. The new recipe does not taste like the old rice twice, the new cereal is very sweet and has a fake taste like a child's cereal. So be aware If you are like me and loved the original rice twice you cannot get it anymore. Amazon should not be showing the old product box.

review/text: Not being a breakfast person, but have to eat in order to take medications, this is a great choice...tastes good, fast...just add milk.  If I have more of a "sweet tooth", a little bit of cane sugar works well. Having a lot of food allergies, makes my choices very limited. If you are on the fence about ordering...few things to say about...limited ingredients for high allergy person, taste is good, I do not find it gets mushy like other people say...box is small, but then again, any organic, allergy or gluten free products usually come in small packages, so for the price I feel it is worth it...paid over $2.00 more per box to try from local health food store, so I feel it is priced fine.  Overall, I would say try it...see if you like it..

review/text: This was one of the first cereals that I tried when I began living GF almost three years ago.  I enjoyed it then and I enjoy it now.  Because it has the two different types of rice, it has a touch of sweetness, but isn't too sweet that it makes me feel like I am eating pure sugar.  My one complaint is that I would like it to have more vitamins & minerals in it.

review/text: To make this you add milk and then cook as you would if cooking tembleque from scratch. That's all well and good, saves some time and mess, but the end result is missing a lot of coconut flavor. If I was good at experimenting I'd try to add coconut flavoring to make it more tembleque tasting. The texture is pretty good with this product though compared to "authentic" tembleque texture.

review/text: I've tried a bunch of brands of wipes, including the hypo allergenic ones, like 7th Gen, pampers and huggies naturals, etc... These are the only ones that don't make my son break out into diaper rash. The pampers and huggies ones are terrible... Within a day of using them, he's completely red. The 7th Gen are ok, but I feel that they are too wet. These ones are great. They are soft and not too wet and he doesn't break out at all, and they don't smell weird or anything. The only thing that's annoying is that they are really hard to separate from each other. So it's a bit of a pain to do one handed. But that inconvenience (and the price) is worth it.

Well, this is almost as popular (let's face it mustard is never as popular as barbecue sauce!) but the family does love it.  It has a little bit of a sweet/smokey under-flavoring to it for those who prefer that kind of taste.<br /><br />I read one of the other reviewers who got their jar shipped in a padded envelope.  I think either the shipper read their review and got smarter, or maybe I just lucked out and got a smarter employee (or maybe because I ordered it with another jar of the barbecue sauce) but they shipped the jars with tons of bubble wrap and put them in a sturdy box.<br /><br />In any case, my shipment arrived safely (Spain) and I was able to try this out--flavorful and good!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />JTG

review/text: For those who like a zesty taste and do not mind a sweet and slightly hot taste to their sauces, this sweet hot mustard is for you.  I really like the taste and it gives a new life to plain old beef hotdogs.  There is a great recipe for a seaside sauce which is on the side which is very good.  And the mustard can be used as a marinade for ribs, beef, pork, chicken and BBQ. It can be mixed in seafood, pasta, vegetables, fish and in stir fries.  Great on hot dogs or in cold salads and as a cheese dip.<br /><br />It is fantastic on grilled cheese sandwiches for extra flavor and you can use it on ham biscuits (although for this particular use, I have not had an opportunity to experiment).<br /><br />It is all natural, fat and gluten free with no msg. It is certified Kosher/Pareve.  You can even make a bagel spread by mixing cream cheese together with diced onions and the mustard.  It is manufactured by Ford's Foods, Inc in Raleigh, North Carolina.  And they have a toll free number: 1-800-446-0947.  It comes in a variety of sizes and you can try it out with a smaller package (also on Amazon).

Many companies were charging more.<br />Seeds sprouted up in a week, and now 1 month after planting I count 124 plants (not bad out of "80 seeds"), mostly 4-6" tall, and ready to transplant into rows!<br />I raise vegetables organically on a small truck-garden for the Farmer Markets in my area. In a few months I'll let you know what my customers & I thought of the tomatoes themselves. Thank you, Seed Needs... sincerely.

review/summary: Updated: Broken pieces, no returns, but some salvalgable
review/text: I've tried Tiger Tiger's "Puppodums" before and enjoyed them. They're fun to nuke, tasty (though not really spicy) and pretty healthy as snacks go. I was psyched to find them on Amazon, especially with a subscribe and save option. Unfortunately I received the first box with each of the 12 packages crumbling around the edges, cracked and broken. If you've tried these before you know this makes them pretty useless. You need the whole 'sheet' to be intact to oil on either side, then bake or nuke. Small pieces are really no use, and large cracked off pieces are a pain. I'm so used to Amazon being great about returns, I was rather shocked to realize (somewhat understandably) food items are on the No Returns list. So I'm stuck with this big box that I'll probably just toss out. And out twenty bucks.<br /><br />Although I get why food can't be returned, given that this is dry packaged imported goods I wish Amazon wouldn't blanket ban returns. In fact, I'll probably think 3 or 4 times before ever ordering a grocery/food item again.<br /><br />Sorry to say I suggest skipping this item. If you receive it as I did, you too will be out a twenty spot with a box of perfectly good useless food to throw away.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/12: As I didn't want to actually throw away this big box of poppodums, I've been slowly working through them. There were a few packages in the middle of the larger box that were unbroken. The broken ones, mostly around the edges, so they've lost 10 - 20%. But I'm still enjoying them. Changed to 3*. Still tasty and a good protein substitute for a starch.

review/text: Now I'm not sure if I should have gone with a different brand, or what but these were horrible. I used the microwave because I will not deep fry food, I followed the direction exactly. They made my microwave stink, along with the kitchen. Took awhile to get the taste out of my mouth too.

review/summary: Convenient and reliable
review/text: When microwaved, puppodums provide a nice savory snack without too many calories!  We like them with dips of various kinds or chutneys but they are good with many kinds of Indian foods<br /><br />Yes, these are quite expensive, but compared to the retail price locally (if we can find them at all), they are extremely reasonable -especially on Subscribe and Save.  They taste every bit as good as the ethnic sort.  To me, a great advantage is that these Tiger Tiger puppodums puff up beautifully in the microwave (a little spray of olive oil or cooking spray is all they need)which is something that the cheaper equivalents from ethnic stores do not do reliably. I think that the smaller package size may keep them in better condition.

review/summary: I've eaten these for 15 years
review/text: I have been eating these pepperonis for 15 years.  I have had two go bad in storage but that is not Bridgford's fault.  They store for a year or more at room temperature if you keep them in a cool room but if one gets a puncture in the wrapper or exposed to too much heat, etc., then all bets are off.  If the wrapper is still vacuum tight and the expiration date has not passed, then it should be fine.  If the wrapper is loose at all or the product has expired then, yes, you might have one that is bad.  If it is as bad as some here describe then it is my guess they are eating spoiled food.  Not smart.  But in 15 years of eating these, I have only thrown out two for spoilage and that is after having stored them for quite a while.<br /><br />These do have more fat (and more flavor) than bagged pepperoni.  They do make great pizza but you will have a hard time slicing them as thin and even as some big factory - so just don't expect the exact look, feel, and taste.  These are still delicious in their own right.<br /><br />I have to laugh about reviews from folks who eat seemingly spoiled food and then say that anyone who likes this must work for Bridgford. No, I do not work for Bridgford.  I just eat their products.

review/summary: Great if you like solid/dry meat snacks.
review/text: I eat this like a summer sausage with cheese crackers. I'm a fan of meat snacks like beef jerky and summer sausage.<br /><br />I know that this is meant to be used as a pizza topping but all the summer sausages I have tried lately are very moist almost like Spam or potted meat. I like a more dry summer sausauge so I thought I'd try this.<br /><br />This is very dry and solid. This is a plus for me.<br /><br />If you eat it in thick pieces like I do, it has a grainy quality to it. The spices are very strong, distinct, and unique.<br /><br />Where this loses points is the pepperoni casing that surrounds the pepperoni. In most sausages, the casing is so thin that you can't even taste it or know it's there.<br /><br />The casing on this is thick and it tastes similiar to wax paper.<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy this again even to use on pizzas. It will take me a long time to use the two sticks I have left.<br /><br />It's a decent product but just not good to use as a meat snack. It's not worth buying it for pepperoni on a pizza, either, for me. I'll just stick to Hormel for that.

review/text: The person with the negative view must have received pepperoni that had accidentally been punctured at some point. Something is definitely wrong. I have been eating this pepperoni for over 30 years and it is fantastic! Thirty years ago, my brother convinced me to put some slices of the pepperoni in my spaghetti sauce; it was outrageously good. I have used it ever since--me and my entire family.<br /><br />I even eat it "raw" (can't be raw or it wouldn't keep). It's one of my primary snacks on the Atkins (and I've lost 25 lbs). I hope the nay-sayers try it one more time--they are missing out.<br /><br />The super Wal-Marts sell it and they are always running out. And by the way, I live in Sacramento and I'm an instructor at a college; don't work for Bridgeford! I'm only online because Wal-Mart runs out so fast (just came from there) and I would like to buy a large supply I can count on. Actually, I have two, inch and ahalf pieces that I've hid from my husband in the fridge. I guess I'm addicted!

Just peel off the casing or it warps the pepperoni into a concave dome that pools the fat. And there's TONS of fat.<br /><br />Another tip would be to put the cuts on paper towels then nuke them. Good to get rid of as much grease as you can.<br /><br />LOL at the people eating them "raw" and giving it a negative review. What the hell are you expecting?<br />This isn't a sausage stick to eat like you just bought from a gas station.<br />The fat content is way too high be to eaten plain. Add chunks to a soup, bread, whatever.

review/summary: Different
review/text: I have been preparing pizza at home exclusively for over 20 years and only considered recently to purchase pepperoni in quantity to get a better price. I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that "practice makes perfect".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni. I have had 2 shipments and both arrived in 3 business days.

review/text: This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily-- good if you're into that. It's also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you've eaten a piece (or two, or however many you're going to munch on at that instance). If you're sensitive to spicy food, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12" pizzas (one if you really want to pile on the toppings).

review/summary: Handy for "Seasoning"
review/text: Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great "seasoning" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture.

I found it locally and I have been eating it ever since, I use it when making Pizza and it tastes very good, I like it when it gets crispy in the oven on top of the pizza. I am not an expert in pepperoni, however this low calorie choice does a great job, it doesn't have any after taste or all that grease, maybe because it is made with turkey (less grease, fewer calories) and high quality ingredients. I love low calorie turkey pepperoni! Thank You

review/summary: The slices are, um, greasy
review/text: This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie.

Each 8 oz. serving of Campbell's Tomato Juice contains:<br />full serving of vegetables<br />only 50 calories<br />Vitamin A<br />Vitamin C<br />20 mg of the antioxidant Lycopene"<br /><br />Most importantly, this "low-sodium" variety has only 140 mg. sodium and 920 mg. potassium compared to 680 mg. sodium and 430 mg. potassium in the standard tomato juice product!<br /><br />WHY SHOULD YOU WANT IT?<br /><br />If you are looking for taste, nutrition and low carbs/calories, this beverage is for you. Add to that, low sodium in this particular variation, and you have a drink we should all be drinking. I was always a bit reluctant to indulge in this yummy tomato-fest because of the huge amount of added sodium, but now the low-sodium product has become much more available and costs only 30% more than the original high-sodium version. Typically, this low-sodium, mixed 100% tomato juice is the type of drink that sells for $2-4 at a juice bar per 8-ounce serving or about $8-$10 per quart from a health food store in bottles.<br /><br />BY THE WAY:<br /><br />Campbell's Tomato Juice is available in several varieties:<br />Regular<br />Low Sodium<br />Healthy Request�<br />Organic<br /><br />Campbell's website (...)has nutrition info on all their products and each of the 4 tomato juices individually. However, the only difference on the label of each variety of tomato juice was in the amount of sodium it contained. Obviously, their are other differences, but label standardization eradicates their ability to illustrate it to us.<br /><br />It may take time to get use to tomato juice without salt, but one can taste the tomato in the juice for a change in this product.

review/summary: My son loves this!
review/text: My son absolutely loves this baby food. So often we have found stage 3 foods that are just as runny as stage 2's, but this one is nice and thick. He didn't like it when he was still on the runny foods, but now it is one of his favorites! He's got quite an appetite, able to eat 3 or so stage 3 jars at one time and will soon transition to regular food, as he also has a mouth full of 16 teeth, but for now he still loves this stuff and we buy lots of it for him frequently.

review/summary: Good product, Outrageous price discrepancy.
review/text: My 2 Bengal cats love this flavor.  It is their favorite of the Prairie Homestyle canned food.  This is a chunks in gravy style food - which is the only type of canned food they will eat.  The Prairie Homestyle canned dog food is the SAME FORMULA with larger pieces at literally 1/2 the price per volume as the cat food.  My cats are on the larger size, 15lbs each (healthy, not overweight).  I STRONGLY suggest monitoring your animals if you test out the dog food, but my cats have no issues with the larger pieces. I have spoken to vets, animal trainers, pet sitters and have had no objections from the professionals.

review/summary: Should have gone for quality over quantity
review/text: Just got a shipment of bulk candy for Christmas (reds and whites).  Honestly kind of disappointed in the taste, not horrible but rather chalky and artificial tasting.  Also I think the fact that they only use the "sunflower kernel" rather than a "sunflower seed" may make a noticable difference.  I got the idea after buying a few packs of Sunny Seed Drops[...] which are delicious but more expensive and I don't see any Christmas varieties on Amazon (they do have other varieties).  In this case you get what you pay for.  If I had to do it over again I would buy a smaller quantity from Sunflower Food & Spice Co.<br /><br />No issues with shipping, packaging, etc.

So I opened the second one and although I still did not like the product because of the curry flavor did not seem moldy.  Maybe sprouted is not a good idea for something that has a shelf life, but curry is definitely not a good idea for sunflower seeds in my opinion.

review/summary: A basic filter
review/text: This is a basic filter for the more advanced Bosch Tassimo brewers.  Using it requires the plastic insert to hold the filter (Bosch part # 646364).  If your Bosch didn't come with a filter, and has a square water tank like this one : Bosch TAS4511UC you can google around and order just that part direct from the Bosch e-store.  (Note, it will NOT work for brewers with the more rounded tanks like this : Bosch TAS2001UC )<br /><br />It is easy to insert, works fine, and helps if you have water quality issues.<br /><br />The question is, do you need filtered water at all...  If your tap water is fine and tastes good, then you may not need to filter the water.  If however you filter your tap water, or drink bottled, then it could help.  I recommend making the coffee without using a filter, then with using a filter, and seeing if you can taste the difference.  (getting someone else to brew the coffee for a "blind" taste test is even better.)

review/text: I can't say enough good about this dry cat food.  After searching and searching for a small sized kibble, this one delivers the bill.  If you have a flat-faced persian with a tiny mouth, be SURE to grab this food.  The kibbles are all different shapes but very, very small and thin so the cat can actually chew it and not be uncomfortable.  Plus, he absolutely LOVES the taste and about tears into the bag whenever I bring home another one.  Cannot recommend this enough - it's worth the higher price just for the palatability and the size of the kibble.  Great stuff!

review/text: I cannot claim to be a coffee connoisseur, seeing as I normally drink instant, hotel packets that people tend to leave for me for some odd reason, or wally world brands, but this is a very decent coffee.  Very smooth going down, with very little of the bitterness that typically plagues what I've been used to drinking.<br /><br />My only complaint is I'm not used to this much flavor.  It really hangs around for a good while after finishing the cup, too.<br /><br />Obligatory Halfway Through Bag Edit: Having given myself some time to get used to this coffee and let my taste buds settle down from a cold, I do have to say there is a non-insignificant burnt smell/taste going on. While I'd still consider this a pretty good coffee, this means next time I will be trying a different brand.

review/summary: These are wonderfully healthy!
review/text: The best things about these are that they are great for small dogs, as well as large dogs. Unlike pigs ears my Miniature Pomeranian can chew through them, just like my parents German Shepherd. They are much healthier than pigs ears, because they are much easier on the dogs digestive tract. If a dog eats too many pigs ears they can get backed up, and have to have surgery to remove the blockage due to them swallowing large chunks that can take a really long time to digest in the animals stomach acid, if at all. You don't have to worry about that with these at all, because they come off in softer, more fibrous pieces, while still being hard enough to promote healthy teeth and gums. Especially where small dogs like mine are concerned, because they just don't eat enough food to keep their teeth clean, while these don't completely solve the problem they are certainly a big help. My little pooch loves these things, and she is the pickiest eater on the planet. I highly recommend these, but don't forget to brush your dogs teeth, especially if it's a small breed. I have health insurance on mine, and her insurance pays for a teeth cleaning once a year, and by feeding her these it works out just about right. Your dog will love these.

It was shipped in a regular old cardboard box, and I was home to receive the package. Thank goodness I was, because it was 90+ degrees outside, and the candy was already sufficiently melted. He can't even enjoy his favorite candies, as they are melted to the sides of the package. I was not happy to have spent nearly $20 on candy, only to have it arrive in an indigestible condition.<br />With that being said, this candy is delicious in it's true, unmelted, form. It's one of our favorites. However, if we were to ever buy it again, we'll have to go out and search for it, since shipping is apparently a terrible idea.

Keep in mind that this is a value priced wine kit and can't be compared to a primium 16 liter wine kit.  But I am very happy with the results.  This is a refreshing, fruity, dry, white wine.  I made it a 5 gallon kit instead of the 6 gallons per the instructions and have found this kit to have surprisingly great flavor.  These Vino Italiano kits are better than two buck chuck and they are fun to make.  I used to drink Trader Joes wines in the $5-$7 range for everyday enjoyment.  I think the Vino Italiano wines are better than what I had been drinking.

review/summary: Good kit for the money!
review/text: I still have this batch "in the works" but so far it looks to be one of the best batches I have ever made. I did two modifications: I added one Granny Smith apple plus two pears (minus the peels) to the batch when I started it, and then I also stopped the fermentation when the SG was at 1.02 as the alcohol was at 14% and this left a residual sugar in it which is leaving it sweeter (used crushed Campden tablets to stop the fermentation)(I also made it about 5 1/2 gallons as opposed to 6). I am about 1 week from bottling but so far the flavor is awesome - distinct fruit flavors, cross between semi-sweet and semi-dry; very tasty. I also made a Chardonnay which also came out well, and am getting ready to order two more Vino Italiano kits. These are the best deals on the market when the free shipping is included. Highly recommend!

I figured $41.35 shipped for a kit that includes everything I needed except bottles was worth trying out.  I've made some of the premium kits from other companies in the past, and I wasn't expecting anything great from this kit, but hoping for a drinkable wine.  However, I've been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the finished product.  My wine has been bottled and aged for 3 months now and the flavor is very good and getting better.  Crisp with hints of apples and peaches, no unpleasant or bitter aftertaste.  I'll let it age a few more months before sampling again.  Granted the kits that cost 2 to 3 times more do make a better wine, but the difference isn't what the price would indicate.  This kit will make a decent wine, comparable to a bottle you could buy in a store for about $8.<br /><br />Previous reviewers have indicated that if you make it to 6 gallons the wine will be a little weak and thin in flavor.  I believe this would be correct.  I was aiming for a specific gravity of 1.090 to start, and I got that with a little over 5 gallons volume.  What I did was add 2 cans of frozen concentrate white grape juice and brought the total volume to 6 gallons, which gave me a starting gravity of 1.092.  Fermentation took longer than indicated in the kit instructions, probably because the juice concentrate I added isn't intended for fermentation purposes and contained sorbate as a preservative.  To help counteract any problems from this I made a yeast starter 24 hours in advance to pitching the yeast and had it bubbling good when I pitched it.<br /><br />The finished wine was fairly dry; my wife and I prefer just a hint of sweetness in a riesling so I added some additional sorbate and sweetened a bit just before bottling.  It was a little harsh when bottled but that's normal. and has improved significantly after 3 months.  I expect it to be even better after 6 months.  Adding some metabisulphite when bottling provides increased protection for longer aging, I did that and will let half the batch age at least a year.  We're very pleased with the results.  The next time I make this kit I will consider adding some golden raisins to the primary fermtation, I think this would increase body and result in an even better wine.  Mostly what I make are fruit or floral wines from scratch, but I will purchase additional Vino Italiano kits in the future of various types for my grape wines.  I've rated this kit 5 stars because it yields a good wine for an excellent value.

review/summary: A Bargain Kit That's Really A Bargain
review/text: Let me start by saying I'm reviewing this based on what it is...a bargain priced kit. It's not really fair to compare it to a $120 premium kit. With that said, I found it to be a solid product with nice flavor.<br /><br />Based on other reviews on Amazon and forums I knew that I shouldn't make this kit to the full 6 gallons or it would be weak and lack body. I only made it to 5 gallons, but I would recommend you make it based on specific gravity rather than volume, because mine came out a little strong. Mine came out to about 13% ABV. On a Cabernet or a more full-bodied wine that would be okay, but it's a little strong for a Riesling. They give you the recommended starting SG, so I would shoot for the middle of that, rather than filling to volume, but probably about 5 1/2 gallons is where you want to be. That will allow you to leave the sediment behind and still fill up a 5 gallon carboy. If you have left over, then keep it in a one gallon jug/carboy and use to top up later in the process.<br /><br />The flavor is still excellent and very drinkable. It was a dry kit, so I sweetened with 1 1/4 cups of wine conditioner. I added a little sorbate after clarifying and before adding the sweetner to avoid fermentation kicking off again. Give it a few days between adding the sorbate and sweetening to make sure fermentation is completely killed off. It's still not very sweet, so I would recommend 1 1/2 cups conditioner/sweetner to get closer to a Washington style Riesling.<br /><br />Overall I think the kit is a true bargain, especially with free super saver shipping. I've since ordered the Shiraz and so far it is exceeding expectations as well.

review/summary: Great value for the money!
review/text: I've made several of the Vino Italiano kits and have been happy with all of them.<br /><br />I even shared a bottle with my wine-snob sister and she was quite impressed. (gosh, I hope she never reads this!) Impressed enough to consider wine making as a hobby!<br /><br />The instructions for the kit are nearly identical to those of the the more expensive kits you'll find at your local home brewing / wine making store.<br /><br />That said, I must say that the instructions would probably not be adequate for a first-timer (neither are those of the $100+ kits!). Beginners simply won't understand the sanitation requirements or how to use the tools... that's when the advise of a local merchant would probably come in handy, though there are certainly enough videos and websites out there to cover the basics. I still can't help but feel the kit manufacturers should have links to their own material.<br /><br />If you've ever successfully made wine from a kit, then you'll have no trouble with this one. It's just less expensive!<br /><br />The fact that these low-priced kits come complete with corks, labels and heat-shrink capsules, just adds more value.<br /><br />I've made both kit wines and country wines and have enough experience under my belt to "play around" with the kits now. The Riesling was made according to instructions with the only variation being the length of time for each stage. Not for any reason other than my own convenience (I waited longer between racking and bottling). Comparing the results to a Vintners Reserve kit that a friend made at the same time... The Vino Italiano kit was BETTER. Just my opinion, of course... I did a blind taste test, so it was impartial. But then taste is a matter of personal preference, I'm not a wine judge.<br /><br />I've got two different VI reds fermenting right now, slightly different variations to the instructions. Will post reviews on those when they're properly done.

review/summary: Riesling Vino Italiano Kit
review/text: This wine kit is one of 5 Vino Italiano kits I've made. These cheaper kits give you a quick turnaround with a decent wine(a lighter variety than the better kits produce-a little less balanced). So far the whites have tasted better to me. The first 3 kits were made as to instructions, with the next 2 (Pinot Biano and Rosso Magnifico) I reduced the water added to make about 5.25 gals of of must and racked off into a 5 gal carboy. Don't know what to expect but will follow up this review. I did notice that the reduced water version takes much longer to degas.<br />---The Riesling kit produced a dry wine.

review/summary: Bang for the Buck
review/text: Another relatively decent wine for the money. I find that this wine needed some sweetening to create a bolder and obviously less dry taste and to bring out some of the fruit flavors, however at $1.50 a bottle and to be enjoying it in a mere 4-6 weeks is well worth the time and labor. I do think that the description by the manufacturer should make you aware that you will need a primary bucket (a 7 gallon pail) and some kind of secondary vessel (six gallon total type of jug i.e. water jugs)along with an airlock ot two. a little $$ ($10 or so) but can be reused just about forever.
