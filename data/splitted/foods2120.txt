review/summary: Great-tasting Mexican tomatoes
review/text: This review is for the product, not the price.  These tomatoes are a great addition to the Ro-Tel line.  They add fresh flavor to chili, tortilla soup, stacked enchiladas, etc.  They contain green chili peppers, garlic, and a little bit of onion as well as lime juice and cilantro.  I mention the peppers because the label picture features jalepenos, but the name of the product doesn't indicate if they are spicy or not.  They are, pleasantly so.  Very tasty.<br /><br />RE: Amazon's fluctuating prices:  If it's not an urgent purchase and you know what is a competitive price for the item, you can put it in your cart and save for later, checking back from time to time.  It would be nice if Amazon's prices did not change so dramatically, but that's my workaround.  I buy these locally for about $1.00/can, so Amazon's price today of $1.15/can ($27.60/24) with free shipping is good if you can not find them locally.

review/text: I buy this delicious spread directly at the Trader Joe's store for  $3.99 a jar, why it is so much more on here I have no Idea.  In saying that, I absolutely LOVE it and normally buy two at a time in case we run out.  My husband is from the Netherlands and loves Nutella as do the kids. I do not like it so I thought I would try this thinking if I did not like it (Nutella is made with Hazelnuts and this with Almonds) they would eat it.  I am so glad I tried it.  It is wonderful on soft fresh bread or toast.  I would say try it for sure but but buy it at Trader Joe's where it is much less expensive!!!!

review/text: This is a good spread. Unfortunately, it does not equal the near-perfection of Nutella. This spread has a more pronounced nut flavor as well as a dark chocolate flavor that, in my mouth, seem to be a bit at odds. Maybe I'm just too used to the milk chocolate, mild hazelnut flavor of Nutella.

review/summary: FINALLY I FOUND YOU!
review/text: About 18 years ago when on vacation, I found this marvelous halvah bar that did not have any refined sugar in it.  It was made with honey, but the flavor and texture was marvelous.  Unfortunately, I have looked for the company and could never find their products in the US.<br /><br />FINALLY it is here!  My mom bought some of these and gave us a bunch and it was divine to taste them once again.  A different texture than the Joyva halvah, it is still superior and we love it.  It still has no refined sugar (and one of the rare products with NO SUGAR CANE IN ANY FORM) and we hope Amazon carries them for a long time to come.  We can not use sugar cane in any form and have been very upset with the so called natural foods people who have caved to the pressure of $ and started using sugar cane in their products.  HOORAY FOR CAMEL!  They still use decent ingredients in their products.

review/summary: Stale Halvah Bars
review/text: I continue to be disappointed with the quality of the Camel Halvah that I have received from Amazon. When it is available, it has been stale. I usually do not order the vanilla, but since they had been out of the marble for so long I decided to try them. They were even more stale them the majority of the marble bars I had received over the past year or so. I really don't understand that if a product is temporarily out of stock and then they re stock, in my mind I think it is fresh stock. Apparently this is not true with this product. I will point out that though I have emailed the manufacturer of the Camel Halvah, Nobel Foods, about this problem with little satisfaction, I have not contacted Amazon customer service to complain. I am guessing that when I have the opportunity to and with their track record, they will do their best to make the situation right with me.

review/summary: You may find these are an acquired taste!
review/text: I and my spouse both found these to be just fine- even very good. They're tasty and filling. However they are not like the halvah that you are likely to be used to. They are not very sweet, only a bit, hardly oily(juicy) at all, but are more like a pressed cake of ground seed mash. They take some getting used to- the flavor is different from other brands of halvah too- not bad just different. These are definitely not candy- they're food, and not to everyone's liking. They're also quite hard to take a bite out of. A nurse at the clinic I work at that I gave one to try, gave it back with just an inch missing, and asked me "How can you eat that?!". She told me she had to spit it out- which I thought was an extreme reaction.<br />I find that one bar can make a whole lunch in a pinch and the nutritional listing bears that out. They'd be great for backpacking and traveling- very "durable". Just be ready to "adjust" your expectation of getting a confection to getting a somewhat non-american style food bar.<br />Will I buy them again- maybe for Susan, who doesn't eat refined sugars, but I do like the sweet halvah better- I'm a sugar-holic, so I'll be getting the other brand in my next order.

review/summary: Ingredients of Camel Halvah Vanilla Bar
review/text: I wish the retailers and manufacturers took the time to do this; after all, they're the one's who want to make a sale. So, here goes:<br />CAMEL NATURAL SESAME BAR: HALVAH - VANILLA<br />Ingredients: Pure milled sesame seeds, malted corn barley syrup, egg whites, natural flavor, soy lecithin (as an emulsifier). May contain traces of peanuts, treenuts, wheat, and milk.<br />Servings per bar: 3 (28g each); Calories 140; Calories from Fat: 80<br />AMOUNTS PER SERVING: Total Fat: 9g (14%), Saturated Fat: 1.5g (8%), Trans Fat: 0, Cholesterol: 0, Sodium: 20mg (1%); Total Carbohydrate: 14g (5%), Sugars 5g, Dietary Fiber 2g (8%), Protein 3g; Calcium 8%, Iron 8%.<br /><br />I hadn't eaten Joyva halvah in over thirty years, after I discovered it contained hydrogenated oils, which are not good for our arteries and heart. So when I discovered that Camel halvah had no trans fats, I sent for it and made a fascinating discovery - after eating two bars in a couple of days, the pain and muscle/joint cramping from arthritis had diminished. I had previously tried flax seeds and omega oil capsules, but nothing helped as this nice, low sugar candy that I had enjoyed as a child. Now I keep both the Camel halvah and Wilderness Family sesame oil in the house. I use the oil liberally over practically everything that I eat, and enjoy an occassional Camel halvah now and then (I'm not much for sweets). I have less muscle cramping and pain and walk normally; I had been advertising the number 7 as I walked; my back is now straight.

review/summary: Not our best idea
review/text: As a treat to our 2 year old ACD mix, we bought this bone for her.  She loves her nylabone durachew (much to my dismay) and we were aware that this one was actually edible before we bought it.  We don't often give her treats like this, and she really seemed to love it.  So much so, in fact, that the entire thing was nearly gone within 10 minutes..... and we purchased the largest one - the one with the first on the end since our dog is 50+ lbs.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling about it, and a few hours later, it was confirmed.  My dog started gagging and then vomitted.  She ate it at about 4pm and got sick around 10pm.  Slept through the night, although she woke me up a few times, and was still licking her mouth and gagging the next morning.  I don't know if it's because the bone is really rich and she's not used to it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a product you and your dog are already familiar with as it was our experience that it made our dog ill.<br /><br />If you do purchase this product, definitely make sure you watch your dog with it - if they're eating it too fast, consider taking it away so they don't devour the entire thing in 10 minutes like ours did.

I do not recommend it at all.<br /><br />My dog loves Nybone products. All the other ones seem to last a long time. I guess this "Edible" line is just made for eating and not chewing. In my opinion, the price is way too high for what you get. I highly recommend other Nybone products, but steer clear of this one.

review/text: Let me start off by saying I love these. My dog gets so excited when he gets one of these. These are not durable and go away within an hour or two, but they are meant to. These are not meant to be for a teething puppy or for a chew toy that lasts. These are supposed to be super special treats that you give your dog once in a blue moon (Like if you are leaving to go on a trip). Yes, they are expensive, but for a reason. They are made in the U.S. and for those of you that do not know, it is healthier to get treats from the U.S. if you can. They are also healthy. One Dentastix is about 300 calories and I read many reviews saying it gave their dog diarrhea and made them sick. Yes there is a review saying this made their dog sick, but he probably ate it too fast. Your dog may need to be watched while eating these. These are meant for a treat and not a bone that lasts. But my dog loves them and that makes me happy!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

review/summary: is eaten way too fast
review/text: I was under the impression when I bought this at our local pet supply store (based on salesperson's advice) that this bone, while edible, would take several days of working on to be consumed.  Great.  It's a little pricey, but I have a teething 5 month old puppy who has recently been spayed; she can't get her regular course of exercise so I bought this as a nice treat to help keep her occupied in her restless state.  I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes.  Just one end was left.  I had bought her the largest "souper" size.  After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it.  Yes it's a "treat", but at $6, it's a treat I cannot afford to give her very often.  Health wise it's not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down.  I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.  All for a LOT less money.  That said, I give it 0 stars for value, 5 for "my dog loved it".  It gets a 2 overall from me and I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend to a friend.

review/summary: Once in a while special treat
review/text: My 9 month old 45 lb pit bull is an avid chewer who has and will eat just about anything he can find, including my hard wood floors.. while picking up bird food I grabbed one of these relieved that at least when he devoured it he wasn't eating chunks of plastic and hence wouldn't get mad when I had to take it away and throw it in the trash.  I came home, read a magazine, he sat quietly on the sofa beside me happily chewing and by the time I had finished my magazine he had finished his bone.  While certainly not a long lasting chew it is something I'd pick up again when I get bird food since I know he enjoys it.  I used to buy the stuffed regular bones but then I'd end up with him wanting to play fetch with the empty bone and would end up throwing it away so at least I know this isn't something that months later i'm stepping on getting out of bed.

review/text: I wish I had read the other two reviews here. I picked this up at a local store for about 6 bucks. My dog just ate half of it in 5 minutes and would be done with it now if I had not taken it away. And he is only 5 months old...so an older bigger dog could destroy this even quicker. I can't believe they actually sell these...at that price at least. He absolutely loved it and is quite mad I took it away...but not worth the money.

review/summary: doesn't last very long
review/text: As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.<br /><br />With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.  I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.<br /><br />I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).<br /><br />My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it.

review/summary: FANTASTIC
review/text: My daughter is 5 months old and has been struggling since the day she was born with constipation, gas, and reflux.  We've tried formula after formula after formula, nothing but vomit and severe constipation.  Finally we found a formula that helped with her constipation but she was still having problems with her reflux, even with added rice.  The drs however continued to say she was at a steady growing rate so there was nothing to worry about.  Well, one day I ran out of formula and ran to the store to pick up some more.  FORTUNATELY, the store was out of the Similac Alimentum.  Nearing her feeding time, I was in a rush, so I glanced over the other formulas to find one that would be the closest match.  I just happened to pick up Similac Sensitive R.S. Now not only is she not spitting up, she's staying full longer, sleeping through the whole night, and SHE'S NOT GASSY OR CONSTIPATED!!!  HURRAY!  Another minor pro is that it doesn't reek like the Alimentum does.  Kind of smells like Vanilla Flavored Ensure.  I called all my friends just days after buying the product and recommended it to everyone.  I couldn't be anymore grateful.

review/summary: This is a GOD-SENT formula for babies with reflux/GERD!
review/text: We just had our second baby in five years with severe GERD/reflux.  Luckily, I was able to identify the signs much earlier this time.  We also determiend before even leaving the hospital that she was lactose intolerant, as I am.  She was first switched from Enfamil Lacto-free to Nutramigen, to Enfamil A.R.(not lactose free), to Enfamil Gentlease (reduced lactose), to Similac R.S. (lactose free with rice starch additive).  After the third one, they put her on Zantac and continued on with the formulas until we got to this one and it worked.<br />It is pricey and only available in ready-to-feed, but it was the ONLY formula that kept my daughter from screaming in pain.  She still spits up, but it's not as much.  I might also mention that she was constipated as well before going on this one.  Another word of advise to parents whose babies are put on Zantac- it's much easier to administer if you mix it in with their formula.  Our pediatrician told us it's just as effective that way.

review/summary: Wow...great alternative to Alimentum!
review/text: Our 3 month old has gone through numerous types of formula including Enfamil Newborn, Similac Soy, Similic Sensitive for Fussiness & Gas, and finally a formula that worked for our baby boy's extremely bad gas: Similac Alimentum. It was costing us a ridiculous amount of money to feed our baby and just started to settle on the fact that we'd be paying over $9.00 per bottle until he starts on solids.<br /><br />I started reading some other reviews on Amazon and found that the Similac Spit Up formula could work just as well as Alimentum. My wife and I tried it and after almost a week it has proved to be a success. Our baby boy is happy and so are Mom and Dad!<br /><br />Try this if you're currently paying too much for hypoallergenic formula and you don't know for sure if your child has food allergies or not.

review/summary: Similac Sensitive RS is the BEST!!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P41A46">Similac Sensitive R.S. Infant Formula with Iron, For Spit-up, Ready to Feed, 1-Quart (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />When my son was born, I was exclusively breastfeeding. However, due to some problems with gaining weight and constantly spitting up HUGE amounts, we had to supplement and eventually switch to exclusively formula. His doctor initially recommended Enfamil AR (powder)and at first it seemed to work, but after a day or so, the spitting up returned. (As well as days of constipation and gas!!) I was becoming frustrated and started researching Similac. I had read several reviews from moms that had used Enfamil AR, switched to Similac Sensitive RS and had great results, so I bought a bottle at my local store to try it out. WOW!! We have had excellent results from Similac Sensitive RS!! Not nearly as much spitting up,(not any more than just a little with a burp) NO constipation and NO painful gas!! It can be expensive, which is why I purchase it here on Amazon. A case of 6 for not even $30 is a very competitive price and very affordable! Which is great for our one income family!!<br /><br />Oh and BTW, I also like the ready to feed much better than a powder type formula... not as many bubbles which is great for little tummies! :)

review/summary: Good formula for sensitive systems
review/text: After our preemie twins came home, the doctors had us supplementing breast milk with the Similac Neosure (powder) which the babies hated and fussed over and spit out (and up).  They had gas and were constipated and our boy had trouble eating the Neosure and every feeding was a struggle.  After buying the sensitive formula while on a road trip because the Neosure unavailable we discovered they like it much more, are eager to eat it and it digests more like breast milk, giving the babies the loose stool that breast does so I felt better about that.  Our very fussy boy is eating so much better and we have heard from other twin parents that the rice starch is what makes the difference.  I would recommend parents with fussy babies give this formula a go and see if it works as well for them as it did for us.

review/summary: Incredibly Helpful for Reflux
review/text: I always count on Amazon reviews when buying products, but never write any of my own.  In this case I wanted to write a review, because I was persuaded to try this product based on the positive feedback provided by Amazon customers after extensively researching any/everything I could find related to infant reflux.<br /><br />My daughter was diagnosed with reflux after a scary choking episode at 8 weeks.  She was on Gentleease and the doctor prescribed Zantac 2x a day as well.  The reflux improved a bit, but she still had major issues and painful reflux episodes so we were switched to Prevacid Solutabs.  The Prevacid helped with the pain of the reflux, but the reflux itself also troubled our daughter and caused discomfort and gas since she tends to gulp air when refluxing.  After trying Enfamil AR RTF her reflux improved greatly the 1st 24 hours, but she reacted terribly on day 2 with severe gas and stomach pains (Maybe because the proteins in Gentleease are broken down, but they're not in the Enfamil AR?).  At our doctor's suggestion we started to add rice cereal to the Gentleease instead (12 teaspoons per 8.5 oz bottle) which also helped the reflux, but made her very gassy - I suspect because the liquid was so thick even with a Dr. Brown's level 3 nipple that she was sucking in too much air.<br /><br />I decided to give Similac Sensitive RS a try and have been thrilled with the results.  We have been using it for roughly 5 weeks with great success.  Even though the prevacid neutralizes the stomach acid that is needed to bond with the Rice Starch, the formula helped with my daughter's reflux tremendously.  She takes her prevacid 1x/day in the evenings and her reflux is tougher at night, but vastly improved from anything else we have tried.  At her 4 month check-up the doc suggested that we start rice cereal with a spoon and that has seemed to help as well.<br /><br />If your infant is suffering from reflux and you're playing the formula roulette game I highly recommend trying this product.  Other pro's - the container is easy to store (vs. a can) and it is less expensive than the Enfamil RTF products.<br /><br />The product can get very bubbly if accidentally shaken, but the bubbles dissipate after the bottle is warmed up.

review/summary: Helped my reflux baby with terrible diarrhea
review/text: My 3rd baby was born with bad reflux. We were able to (mostly) control it with Gentelease and ranitidine (Zantac) after failing with breast feeding and trying several other formulas. Then, when she was 5 months old, she caught an intestinal virus.  She had horrible diarrhea all day and night long.  We would feed her and within 20 minutes, it was coming out the other end.  We were up every hour or two in the night changing her diaper.  After a couple of days of this and barely keeping her hydrated, our pediatrician suggested we try Similar Sensitive R.S.. Since it has rice protein in it, she thought it might help thicken the stool and keep the food in her longer.  It worked by the second feeding.  By the next day, she had mostly solid stools.  Our pediatrician had told us that the virus would most likely take 7-10 days to clear up so it was a huge improvement.  We also were thrilled with the way her reflux was so we continued her on the formula after the virus was over.  We were even able to take her off of the ranitidine which I was very happy about.  I never liked having to have her on medicine at such a young age.  I can't recommend this formula enough and wish I'd known about it when she was a lot younger.

review/summary: Great for reflux baby!
review/text: We love this formula.  We battled it out with breastmilk, and several different kinds of formula during my daughter's first month of life.  Only this formula would work for her.  Everything else always came right back up.  It has been determined that she has reflux.  Zantac has really helped.  Still we need formula!  This is premixed and the thickest kind.  I find it doesn't stain much, either (though I do wash things frequently).  While the price fluctuates, it does seem to cost less than most of the other ready-made formulas, too, but you can't always count on that.  All in all, I like this better than the sensitive for fussiness and gas (too thin so it came right back up), alimentum (baby didn't even want to taste it, too bitter? bad smell), good start (made her poop immediately and she fussed while drinking), and regular similac (too thin, came right back up).

review/summary: IT REALLY WORKS!
review/text: Our son, since he was born, has had really tough problems with GERD, spit up, etc.  It's made the little guy pretty miserable.  His doctor suggested that we switch to a formula especially designed to address spit up issues.  Although he says--and I'm sure he's right--that Similac and Enfamil are basically identical, and interchangeable, at least in our household they're not.  My son will not drink Enfamil at all, but is perfectly happy with the Similac.  We had no trouble switching from Similac Advance to this formulation; he sucked it right down, unlike the Enfamil, which, even when he was really hungry, he refused to eat.<br /><br />And, not only does he eat it, it works!  We were really surprised at how much of a difference it made, and how quickly.  He did have some difficulty at first, because he'd gotten used to eating so much MORE formula--he spit up so much before, that a lot of his eating was playing "catch up."  So we had a few "I ate too much" episodes, but then he started feeling much better and settled into a more predictable eating pattern.  He still does spit up, but it's nowhere near as bad as it was.  He used to have these fountains of vomit, and now it's just the occasional (small) vomit bubble.

Also, it was recalled in 2010, we have not been able to find it in powder form in any stores or online so, we called the company on Tuesday and they informed us that they have not had the ingredients to make it in powder form and that the first batch shipped out this week.  With the liquid form you have to (per the instructions on the bottle) shake it well before every use; this creates form and you have to sit the bottle down and wait before pouring it into bottles or the oz amount will be off significantly due to the foam taking up space in the bottle.

review/summary: So much better than Enfamil AR
review/text: When our little girl was born I tried breastfeeding but I didn't produce enough milk and she lost too much weight. We switched to Enfamil Newborn but she would spit whole bottles back up. We switched to Enfamil AR but besides it being a pain in the you-know-what to mix, it got her horribly constipated. So we finally switched to Similac for Spit Up. It didn't solve all our problems, we still need to add 1.5 oz of pear juice a day for constipation and 1.2 ml of Zantac for heartburn. She still spits up a little too, but it's sooooo much better than before. This stuff is easy to feed since you don't have to mix it yourself. It never cloggs up the nipple. It does stain, most of her clothes and bibs now have light brown stains in it that won't come out. We still like it a lot though and are sticking with it!

review/text: Heard about this on a BBQ podcast from Grate.tv. Tried it on fried pork-chops a few days ago and tried it on a sirloin tip roast with vegetables today. Both dishes turned out wonderful. The hint of garlic with the rest of the spices gives you just a little something extra than you can't get from other seasoned salts. It is quickly turning into my "secret ingredient" for some of my rubs. Highly recommend!

review/text: Very good seasoning for anything I've grilled. Last night, I pitted it against a well-known brand of BBQ seasonings (the ones with the round black cap) on some pork chops. The Goya Adobo chops were favored over the other brand by everyone at the table.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy again.

review/summary: Awesome seasoning
review/text: I have been using Adobo for many years!  My family is originally from Spain and this seasoning makes just about everything taste great!!!  Chicken, fish, shrimp-- use it on garlic bread.  I sprinkle some in soups and stews I make!  In regards to the MSG/salt, as in everything in life-moderation is the key!  If you can't tolerate any MSG then don't use the product but don't bash it either!  Friends of mine who are not familiar with adobo and come over for dinner at my home rave about the food.  I am always happy to share my "adobo secret" with them!!

review/text: I have used Adobo for a while now and so do all the people I know.  I prefer not to use powder seasoning and I was about to stop using Adobo when I read the review stating that this product was full of MSG.  I dont know where he got his information from, but I took the liberty of looking at the ingredients are are stated on the product (legally required) and it does not mention MSG, Monosodium Glutamate or spices.<br /><br />This product does give food a "boost" that makes it taste better when missing that "kick".  I would recommend Adobo to anyone.

review/summary: Good, if you like MSG and nothing else.
review/text: Note that the description provided by the...(?)...producer or merchant of this product says it's filled with "gurlic."  Maybe that's true.  However, the primary ingredient of this "seasoning" is nothing but MSG.  Then it has pepper.  Then some more MSG.  Then maybe a few specks of some type of powder, which I presume is some derivative of MSG.  Then it has one flake of oregano.  Then it has MSG.  Then it has one speck of parsley flakes.  Then it claims to have onion powder, but I think it's just more MSG.  Finally, it has MSG-powder, MSG-salt and MSG-flakes.  Perfect stuff for your next MSG-induced nightmare headache, the likes of which you've never known.  Other than that, you'll probably like this stuff.<br /><br />Edited to respond to the lone critic who claims this does NOT have MSG...an individual I can only surmise is a shareholder or employee of Goya...so, here's the ingredient list for you people, since he, while claiming it has no MSG (not true), failed to provide it himself:<br /><br />Ingredients: Salt, Granulated Garlic, Tricalcium Phosphate (prevents caking), Monosodium Glutamate, Oregano, Black Pepper, Tumeric, Onion Powder, Spices.<br /><br />Note that "spices" can also be termed to include MSG as well, but here they go the extra measure and at least spell it out for you...something this other reviewer must have missed or be unable to read.<br /><br />So, there you have it.  Enjoy your MSG.

review/summary: A Good Chew
review/text: Our shih tzu Piper had dental surgery to remove four broken teeth. Her dental surgeon vet blamed hard chew treats for the broken teeth. In hindsight some of the chews were so hard that I had to use a saw to cut them in half for sharing between the two dogs. The vet advised us to use the bend test. If the chew isn't flexible, don't give it to your dog.<br /><br />The Nylabone Healthy Edible passes the bend test. Looking at the bone-shaped treat, one would think it is a hard object and a long lasting chew. Piper and Gabby both like these chews. Depending on the dog, these treats can be long lasting without jeapardizing the teeth of the dog.<br /><br />Being a spudophile, I'm pleased that ingredient number four is potato starch. Despite the Nylabone name, these chews contain no plastic. Also lacking are sugar, salt, preservatives, and gluten. The ingredients are natural and it is edible and highly digestible as advertised. Our pooches give the American made Healthy Edibles their barks of approval.

review/summary: treat not a chew bone
review/text: These are great as a treat, but not as a chew. They are so well liked they don't last. What I can't understand is why a seller that offers Amazon Prime charges albout 3 to 4 times the cost that other prime sellers are charging for the same items and think they will make a profit. I guess it's buyer beware and be a bargain shopper if you don't want to seriously overpay.

review/summary: Made my dog throw up bad
review/text: Our 14 lb Mini Schnauzer easily started splintering this bone in a matter of minutes and being an 'ever hungry' dog he just swallowed these pieces. Seeing this I took the bone away after he ate about a third of it. Less than 24 hrs later when it was time for his breakfast at 7:30 AM (his standard time) he refused to eat! This was the first time he ever refused to break his overnight fast!! But after a few minutes the hunger must have gotten the better of him; he gave in and ate almost all of it (usually he cleans up his little bowl) and about an hour later he threw up all of it in FOUR rounds of puking!<br /><br />I could see small, softened yet still relatively firm pieces of this Healthy Edible "bone" in his vomit. What a shame I went for this thinking it would be a great alternative to feeding my dog indigestible nylon.

review/text: For a pre-ground, supermarket shelf coffee, Seattle's Best Level 1 isn't bad.  Due to it being on sale at my local grocer, I decided to give it a try and was impressed.  It is smooth and has a mellow, but full bodied flavor.  It is much better than most pre-ground coffees that sit on supermarket shelves.  I'd say this one is on par with Starbucks pre-ground coffees.<br /><br />Very nice coffee, but a bit pricey.

review/text: I received this assortment of gourmet caramels from a company in Montana I do business with.  These are both delicious and an asventure.  I think the chunks of sea salt were one of the most surprising flavors, surprising that I quite liked them, and of the others the only ones I was not crazy about were chipotle and jalapeno.. the only reason they don't get five stars is this odd choice of flavors.. but the next person might be thrilled with them.  They are chewy, tasty and the flavors stick with you.  I instantly bought some for my sister's birthday.

review/text: I don't like caramel and trying all the Bequet caramel versions didn't change my mind.  But the guys I work with claim caramel is a guy thing and the women are all about chocolate.<br /><br />Most of the men liked the Apple  one the best.  They said it tasted like a candied apple, the state fair, and Halloween.  I thought it tasted like caramel.<br /><br />The Celtic Sea Salt version was the least favorite.  One thought it was too salty, one said it tasted less sweet, I thought it tasted like caramel.<br /><br />One said the Chocolate version was the best.<br /><br />I think the Espresso tasted less like caramel so I liked it better.<br /><br />My husband said the chipolte version was best with a slow, pleasant afterburn. That was the only one I kind of liked.<br /><br />Regardless of what you like, this collection is fun to share and compare reactions.

review/summary: The Best Popcorn Out There
review/text: I've tried a lot of popcorn in my life and have finally decided that Pop Secret is the best popcorn I've tried. It never burns or tastes artificial and because it is made in the microwave you need less oil. Of course you could air pop corn and I've tried that. Still I prefer microwaving popcorn because it is so fast and less messy. I will admit that I buy the 94% fat free so I can add my own melted butter. A girl has to have some fun and now experts are saying saturated fats are good for us. One thing I do with this popcorn is to pour it into a strainer and shake it around. Then I scoop out the popcorn and put it in a big bowl. This will save your teeth otherwise you never know if a stray kernel that hasn't popped is just waiting for you to bite down on it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

I set it on 2 1/2 minutes the first time- another brand i buy takes that long- but the extra 30 seconds burnt the bag and the popcorn. Takes less time to pop than you might expect. Tastes good once it's popped right. Arrived well packaged. Still have several months left till expiration date- so plenty of time to use.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: This was my first time to try anything with carnivorous plants. I looked around at a few websites about how to care for them, I am by no means an expert. Its been a month since I received my plant and it is thriving. Just follow the simple instructions and you will have a great plant. A word of warning though, don't expect a plant that looks like the pictures, that's just an example of what it will grow to look like. Also something I learned is that Venus Fly Traps will actually go dormant and look pretty much dead, but with some watering and sunlight they will come back just as healthy. After having the plant a little more than a month I'm already about to re-pot it into a larger pot. Great product, quick shipping from Hirt's. I just ordered a pitcher plant and sundew from them since I was so satisfied with my Fly Trap. I'd recommend this plant to anyone who likes unique things. I'm actually working on a CP garden to try and rid my backyard and deck of annoying bugs without spray or chemicals.<br /><br />Overall, Great buy at a great price.

review/summary: Unhealthy... Look at the Ingredients
review/text: I fed my dog Iams Proactive Health for five years before realizing that it is a unhealthy, low-quality, and species-innappropriate dog food.<br /><br />The package states "No fillers."  However, take a look at the first five ingredients...chicken, corn meal, ground whole grain sorghum, chicken byproduct meal, dried beet pulp.  The last four of the first five ingredients are fillers!  Also, the first ingredient, chicken, probably occupies a lower position on the list because, after cooking, most of the moisture is lost and chicken is about 80% moisture. [1][2]<br /><br />As to being species-inappropriate, have you ever heard of a wolf attacking a corn stalk?<br /><br />After I started researching dog food, I switched my dog to Taste of the Wild, a grain-free kibble, and Bravo Balance, raw dog food.  When my dog was eating Iams, she often left food in her bowl for several hours.  Now she eats her food as soon as I give it to her.  Also, her coat is softer and she doesn't get constipated anymore (she did every now and then eating Iams).<br /><br />Yes, Iams is "vet-recommended" and my vet approved of it.  However, I have reason to believe that many vets have been improperly and undereducated in nutrition, and the education that they do receive is biased.  Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., which makes "Hill's Science Diet" with similar ingredients to Iams, has created and distributes a nutrition curriculum to vet schools around the world.  They also administer the Hill's vet school graduate feeding program, which provides pet food to students at no charge that they can resell for a profit.  In addition to providing course materials to veterinary students, Hills's, Iams, Purina, and other well-known manufacturers also offer additional perks for students. [3][4]<br /><br />Please, do not believe pet food companies' claims without looking at the ingredients for yourself!  It's a pay now or pay later situation.  If you feed your dog a high-quality, wholesome food now you will have to pay less in vet bills later.  The Dog Food Advisor's website, which rates dog foods based on their ingredients, is a great, unbiased resource.<br /><br />[1] Sagman, Mike. "Iams ProActive Health Adult (Dry)."

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I have tried many, many, many brands and flavors of k-cups. This brand is my favorite and their Italian and French Roasts my favorite flavors. I like a bold, strong cup of joe and don't mind a pinch of bitterness, though this brand doesn't really have a bitter bite in my humble palate's opinion. When I do end up with another brand whose flavor is too bitter for me, I use the Columbia flavor of this brand to temper it. The cost keeps trying other brands, but I always have some of this in stock.

review/summary: Great tasting low cal chips!
review/text: These chips are the best tasting low calorie snacks I have ever tasted! A normal sized chip snack pack is only 100 calories and they do NOT taste fake. They do NOT taste like cardboard. They taste delicious. My husband, who will not eat anything that is "diet" or "low fat", loves these. I have never found such a great tasting salty snack. They taste like good old fashioned potatoe chips should taste - crisp and light.

review/text: e.frutti Mini Burgers are so delicious they are addictive.  They are individually wrapped so they stay fresh for a long time.  At the present time you cannot buy this item from Amazon because I purchased the last one.  I have thus "cornered the market."  If you want to have an e.frutti Mini Burger you will have to buy them from me.  HaHa!  Did I tell you they are delicious?

review/summary: So far
review/text: This is my 55th wine kit and my second all juice kit.  At this point, the kit has been made and bottled-after bulk aging a couple of months.<br /><br />The inside of the kit reminds me of a Mosti Mondiale all juice kit.  The instructions were fine.  The instructions also reminde me of the Mosti Mondaile all juice kit I have made.  The look of the juice was lighter than what I'm used to seeing in an Amarone kit.  I'm wondering if this going to be the weight of a Pinot Noir.  This kit did not come with any crushed grape pack so I added a used one to increase the solids/weight of the wine...so now the kit is bottle aging.  I'll try a bottle at about 6 months of age---which puts it at the beginning of June.  Stay tuned.

review/summary: Just a warning!
review/text: Just as a warning, I looked everywhere on this page to see how it would arrive at my parents house for Christmas.  I addressed it to myself as this gift was meant to be a huge surprise on Christmas day for my mother who loves wine.  Sadly, it did not arrive in a box and therefore the surprise was ruined.  I'm sure the kit will still be great, but be warned if you're sending this somewhere to later wrap as a present, it does not come in a box.  The creativity behind a gift like this will be ruined.  For someone like me who lives far away from home I often dont have much of a choice but to have presents sent to my parents house (addressed to me) to then wrap and give to my family on Christmas day.  Not being there to see the surprise on my mother's face has really put a damper on my holiday.

review/text: I first purchased this candy at a truck stop-rest area in Italy and loved it. I bought a package called Capri and it had lemon and orange flavored hard candies. They are similar to jolly rancher but more sophisticated in flavor and texture.<br />This version - Sorrento - was exactly the same as I purchased in Italy and with an additional flavor: tangerine.<br />I love them and so do my daughters.

review/summary: Excellent Matcha for Beginners!
review/text: There are so many good things to say about this matcha as well as this company.  Let's start with how awesome Red Leaf Tea is.<br /><br />The customer service is prompt and friendly.  They listen to your suggestions and opinions and take action to please their customers.  It's a sad world when decent customer service is a novelty, but Red Leaf Tea brings some joy back into a bleak world with their courtesy.  Thank you, Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />Now, this matcha...it's great for beginners!  The price is perfect and you get a good amount of tea so you can experiment with  how you like to drink it.  The basic flavors here are sweet, green and minerally.  THe texture is pretty smooth with only a hint of a powdery texture.  It's a pleasing beverage hot, prepared in the traditional way.  Yes, the quality isn't the best, but it is definitely a good introduction.  It is not bitter at all and completely inoffensive.  I used to be scared of preparing my own matcha because the one time I did it before Red Leaf, it was with a horrible matcha that was extremely bitter.  Now I make myself matcha drinks all the time!<br /><br />After trying this tea the traditional way to fully appreciate the flavors you're working with, you can use the powder to add flavor and healthiness to pretty much anything!  Like the Starbucks green tea latte?  Now you can make your own at a fraction of the cost!  Breakfast smoothie need a healthy caffeine kick?  BAM! Starter Matcha to the rescue!  Want some green tea cookies to go with your green tea latte?  You know where I'm going with this.  :)<br /><br />My favorite way to have this matcha right now is to add it to my Almond milk, banana smoothie.  It was also awesome in my amaretti cookies.  :)<br /><br />Conclusion?  Highly recommended!

review/text: I'm sorry guys but this is not very BBQ. The chips are almost like regular classics, barely any noticeable seasoning whatsoever. They are just tangy and that's it. NO FLAVOR! If you want some nice flavored chips I suggest you try the Cajun Herb & Spice. They should be named Tangy BBQ! Not very cajun but so good I eat the whole bag!

review/text: ..............................U P D A T E...........................<br /><br />TASTE AND QUALITY OF PRODUCT.....5 stars<br />BARGAIN RATING...................0 STARS<br /><br />.<br />.<br />" W I D A ".........RECENTLY, I bought myself one small bag of (other) potato chips, and one THREE MUSKETTEERS Bar.  I love both of these snacks a LOT, but I wanted to see which I liked best.  The potato chips won, (by a nose) -- and so I must come to the conclusion that potato chips, for good or ill, are my VERY favourite snack, and, (as I think I mention below), I have yet to meet a potato chip I do not like to eat!<br /><br />Also, as mentioned below, these particular potato chips are ESPECIALLY tempting to me, because the gracious living of the Old South, (and also in todays New South, in New England, Old England, India, Sweden, Canada, and wherever kind and hospitable people can be found...which is all over the world), is warming and comforting to me, reminding me that there are STILL outposts of civilzed behaviour, (and manners), all over the world -- and these potato chips, purporting to be of a "Carolina BBQ variety", happily remind me of this.  (I am also "turned off", (mightily), by the sad, recent trend amongst many people, (also unhappily all over the world), who take a "who cares?" attitude, are NOT gracious and do NOT have any<br />manners whatsoever.  Etiquette, (as Letitia Baldridge, former social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, has said), is the art and practice of making OTHER people feel comfortable, and there is NOTHING "stuffy" about it.  Too many people today forget this -- and grab, and gab in 4-letter-word language, and stab, by telling dirty, (and worse) "jokes" -- and it is a truly sad when people mistake manners for inflexible social stratification, while proceeding, (seemingly of their own free will), to slide down a few levels in civilzed behaviour, taking those with whom they come in contact -- if they are not aware, and prepared to do battle with such attitudes -- sadly along with them.  (II say "SEEMINGLY of their own free will", because I know that the unconscious, deadly influence of the mass media has SOMETHING to do with this slide downhill, by so many.  Or at least, some images portrayed by the media intensify this slide.....)<br /><br />At any rate, in my quest for ANY outposts of civilized behaviour, today, the lure of LAY'S TANGY CAROLINA BBQ POTATO CHIPS proved irresistable.  The hot weather often found in the Southern US can bring out the worst -- but also, the best -- in people, and, ever the optimist, I just could NOT pass up this chance to have a real "taste" of a sample of what I hoped to be the best the Southern US has to offer.<br /><br />In my main review, below, I mentioned I was NOT going to buy these potato chips because the seller did NOT mention how many bags would arrive.  But, upon taking a second look, I noticed that each bag would weigh a total of 10.5 ounces, and the entire package would weigh 3 pounds.  This would seemingly make for 3...or perhaps 4 bags of potato chips, with the extra weight given for the packaging.  Slightly more expensive than potato chips in the supermarket -- but not by much.  And besides, I had NEVER seen the "Carolina BBQ" style of Lay's potato chips in my local store.  These combined circumstances proved irresistable to me -- so I finally decided to buy one unit of these over-whelmingly tempting chips, and see what I could see, (and taste what I could taste.)<br /><br />Well, they arrived this morning.  In a US "Priority" Mail box, which presumably would take UP TO three pounds in weight.<br /><br />The box weighed far, far lighter than this.  It did not say "Potato Chips" on the outside, so I didn't know what was inside, until I opened the box.  Inside was ONE 10.5 ounce bag of potato chips.  Just ONE!  It was covered with stick-on bubble wrap, to protect the contents -- but also, I suspected, so that I could not easily duplicate my purchase, and send it back for a refund.  (The seller seems to know potato chip afficitionados well -- once we see the bag of p.c.s, it's hard not to open it!)<br /><br />The potato chips inside WERE quite good.  Somewhat like a "light" BBQ flavour, with just a small bit of barely-noticable extra sweetening for a different flavour.  But $18.95 (cost plus shipping), for a single bag of potato chips, (with the normal price marked as $3.98, there for me to notice only AFTER I had opened the bag)?  NEVER again!<br /><br />I could easily put all the blame here on a perhaps-far-too-greedy seller -- but, to be totally honest, I cannot.  I had sadly forgotten the fact that ANY seller can be contacted, before purchasing anything, through Amazon itself.  For those items NOT sold by Amazon, but through a third party, (as these potato chips were), all one need do is click on the seller's name, and see his or her "store-front" revealed.  This "store-front" page lists many things...including satisfaction ratings by customers -- AND A LINK TO CONTACT THE SELLER!  This link is sometimes difficult to find -- but it is ALWAYS there.  All I had to do, in this instance, was contact the seller, and inquire of him or her just HOW MANY bags of potato chips were actually contained in any one shipment.  I have contacted sellers before -- but totally forgot in this instance, for which I have only myself to blame.  Hopefully, though, this part of my review will help other buyers who have questions about products sold by third parties, to more easily ask questions of sellers. This said, (and my own inadequicy admitted), I still think that puting only ONE 10.5 ounce bag of potato chips into a carton stated to be of three pounds in weight, is a rather unsavoury selling tactic.  By my calculations, the seller here has made over a 300% profit -- at my expense.  (It would be a 600% profit, but I am not here counting shipping and handling charges.)<br /><br />I begin to wonder if the seller has some connections with the I.R.S.?  (Only kidding here, I.R.S.!) Yet I must admit, though the seller perhaps, should be taught the meaning of "usury", for his higher-than high profit on my purchase, I also must admit that I forgot the most rudimentary of buyer resources.  When In Doubt -- Ask.  Or -- W. I. D. A.!<br />.<br />.<br /><br />................O R I G I N A L.......R E V I E W...............<br /><br />...As a Northerner who yet yearns for the grace and polish of the Old South, (which can also be found, even today, anywhere civilized people comport themselves -- including, (in great numbers), people living the modern South, and hospitable places such as New England, Old England, India, Sweden and Canada, (but also, in smaller numbers, perhaps, in other places all over the world), and yet ever-mindful of the fact that the Confederate Anthemn, "Dixie", was actually written in Brooklyn, New York -- where I was born -- I, (being a potato chip affictionado in any event), obviously found the LAY'S TANGY CAROLINA BBQ FLAVOURED POTATO CHIPS -- 10.5 oz -- herein offered -- totally and absolutely irresistable.  Yet, I will resist (!)  Why?  The price given is $9.95.  Plus $8.95 shipping.  The NUMBER OF BAGS IS N_O_T GIVEN!  Will I then be paying close to $20.00 for 10.5 ounces, (one bag) of potato chips????  As the number of 10.5 ounce bags is, as I have mentioned, not included in the description, I very well could be doing just this, should I decide to buy.  For this reason, (and for this reason only), have I sadly decided not to. I have yet to meet a potato chip I do not like...and so I will chose another.  Maybe not as tasty, but tasty enough.  Any extra money I will save will go for "the taste of freedom", and my favourite political party!  PLEASE state the NUMBER of bags included in ordering these wonderful, southern-style potato-chips, in future!  Thank you!<br />Hopefully,

review/summary: Changed the formula...
review/text: Well, not really.  What they have done is change the size, from the fantastic small size bites to big chunks.  As an engineer, I know exactly why they did it - its cheaper from an energy consumption.  The larger sizes are not as dried out, and so take less energy to get the surface consistancy right. However, this changes the overall consistency, and makes them useless for the sprinkler, the snacker, or the person who mixes them with nut.  So now this is no better than any of the other types of dried fruit.  Sun-Maid has made a serious error- if they feel its too expensive to dry them, then raise the price - don't get rid of the bite size bits we loved....
