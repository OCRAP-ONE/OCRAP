review/summary: Suprisingly great for my severe PMS and cramps
review/text: This tea is wonderful. I was skeptical that it was going to help my cramps but I decided to try it. I knew the tea by itself is good for you and it's organic so I thought--why not? Because of this tea, this month is the second time I have not been popping Ibuprofen like candy. I drank this tea in the morning (double dose..2 bags in 1 cup) and 1 dose 3 hours later. I was at church so I didn't take the tea with me and the cramps were starting to bother me again. When I got home, I drank the tea and after 30 minutes, completely pain-free. I read raspberry leaf is good for the uterus..Anyway, it helped me. The tea has to steep for 10-15 minutes covered. Honestly a pleasant surprise. Everyone was telling me to take birth control pills to lessen severe cramps but I refuse to because of the serious side effects. Can't go wrong with natural.<br /><br />UPDATE: I cannot live without this stuff. It has consistently helped with my cramps. I will always buy this.

review/text: This is by far the best RRL tea ever. Traditional Medicinals uses the best herbs and this particular tea helps me very much. Not only that, but it tastes good, too. I drink three cups a day and don't have to add anything to it. This is an excellent product and I order it through the Subscribe & Save service and I really do save a bundle! Each box only turns out to be like $3 and change. In the store they are $5.65 each. I absolutely love this product!

review/summary: For Labor/Pregnancy
review/text: I read and read about midwives etc who recommended red raspberry leaf tea for strengthening and toning the uterus in preparation for labor. I finally bought this, and worked myself up to 3 strong cups of it a day after my 36th week. I'll just tell you what I know. This was my 2nd pregnancy. With my first I went almost to 42 weeks and then induced (and subsequently c-sectioned). This time, I spontaneously went into labor at week 38 (and had a VBAC). My labor was about 2 hours long. INTENSE (and kind of terrible). I don't know if this tea really did strengthen my uterus into being more efficient, or if it brought on labor. I definitely had a very different outcome this time around. And if nothing else, how can it harm? Hey, you're not only getting hydrated, but it's good for the psyche too. You feel like you're doing something to help your little one come out to your arms, safely. I'd do it again.

review/summary: Great tea that really works!
review/text: I used this tea first when I was pregnant. It was my first pregnancy and I had read great things about it toning the uterus to make labor go a bit more smooth. I drank 3 cups a day starting at 37 weeks. my son was born at 40+ weeks and my labor was short and the pushing didn't last that long. I do attribute that to this tea. This tea is also great for taking away menstrual cramps. Today in fact I took many different medications to try to get some kind of relief, and nothing would help. I found this tea that I forgot I had, made some and what do ya know, cramps are gone. I highly recommend this tea to all women.

review/summary: All women should drink this daily
review/text: Red raspberry leaf tea has a long tradition as a tonic for all women. This tea tones the uterus making the monthly cycle easier and also helping achieve positive outcomes for pregnancy, labor and delivery.<br /><br />Of course I can't make medical recommendations.<br /><br />However from my own personal use I can tell you this tea tastes OK and helps me with my monthly cycle. Without it, I am finding myself take up to 600 mg of ibuprofen every few hours. With it, I can be without pain and without pills.<br /><br />The best way to enjoy this tea in the winter is to pour 8 oz. of boiling water over the tea bag. Let it steep, covered (so it doesn't cool off) for 10 minutes (15 minutes for a stronger brew). In the summer, just pour over ice and sip as a chilled drink. Very refreshing.<br /><br />Happy sipping!

review/text: Excellent tea. I bought several other brands but was not impressed with taste. This tea actually has a great taste. I bought this tea because my midwife said it helps to strengthen your uterus for labor.  I'm not sure about about that...but I did go into labor 2 weeks early.  Not sure if there is a connection...but it's an excellent tea that I will recommend to anyone!

review/summary: Seems good...but how would I know?
review/text: I purchased this on the advice of a doula.  I am told this is supposed to make your uterus stronger.  I don't know how I could tell if my uterus is stronger or not until perhaps after I have my baby, so I guess you could call this an interim review.<br /><br />What I do like is that it is organic, a warm drink I can have, and the price on Amazon is way better than the natural food store I originally found this in.  I personally don't like the taste, but I'm not a tea drinker.  I do drink it on average 0 - 3 times a day depending on if I remember to, and for the most part I am able to drink it with no bad effects (other than I don't like the taste), and its a good way for me to stay hydrated other than water.<br /><br />Amazon's shipping was pretty good.  If you already know you want to drink this and are convinced it will help you, then I think its a good deal.  I'm just going on blind faith that it will do what I'm told it will do, and hopefully my labor will be fast and easy.<br /><br />UPDATE: I had my baby, he was 4lb 8oz. While he was very small, once I was fully dilated, I pushed him out on 31 min. I now understand the benefits of a strong uterus!

review/summary: For Inducing Labor
review/text: I bought this to try and induce my labor. I drank a few glasses 5 days before I was due to give birth. I started drinking the tea around noon and I had my baby that same night. I was however taken by surprise. Contractions came out of nowhere around 7:30pm.... and they were a million times more painful than anything I felt with my first labor. I didn't want to wait around to time them since they were so painful, we left for the hospital at 8:05 pm, arrived there at 8:30 and she was born at 8:45pm. I didn't even have time for pain medicine or an IV... so a little scary... and I felt things I'd rather not ever feel again...but the tea seems to have done the job :)

review/summary: Miracle!
review/text: On the recommendation of an Ayurvedic practioner, I tried Raspberry Leaf Tea.  I'm peri-menopause and am having problems with my cycle -- heavy bleeding, severe cramping, and bleeding for long periods (21 days).  I bought the tea and tried it at day 4 of my period.  After one day of drinking the Raspberry Leaf Tea, the cramps stopped.  After two days of drinking it the bleeding slowed down to only spotting.  The spotting continued for 5 days.  My period, which had been lasting 21 days shortened to 10 days, after only drinking the tea for a week.  I continued drinking the tea every day until my period started again.  This time I was back to regular bleeding, no cramps and only 5 days of bleeding.  I have been suffering with long, heavy periods for over 6 months!  This tea is a miracle.  It also tastes very good. I love it with almond milk and honey.

review/text: That's about it.  We were trying very actively, with OPKs, the whole shebang, with no luck for over 4 months... so I got this tea and 2 weeks after drinking it every day, I got pregnant.  Also, this may be TMI, but I got a Moon Cup, which I read could help facilitate conception, and I used it after sex every time... so not sure which of the two did it, or if either did it, but for someone looking for help, it's not too much investment- and the moon cup seemed like it would be an amazing menstrual solution... I haven't gotten to use it for that purpose yet!  Due in Jan 2013- good luck to all you ladies who are TTC!

review/text: I am drinking this tea because I was told that if you start drinking it around 7 months pregnant until after delivery, you should have a short labor. It's suppose to prepare your uterus for delivery and afterwords it's suppose to make it contract back down faster. We'll see. I've heard nothing but good stuff about it though.

review/summary: Thank God for this Tea!!
review/text: I did not purchase this tea on Amazon (like I do everything else), but I came here to see what other people who used this tea felt about it. This may sound strange, but God led me to this tea back in October, but I didn't heed the 'sign' until recently. After having been on the pill for 10 years straight, I got off of them last year. My normal periods started up within two weeks, but then after a few months, they just stopped. I had started working out strenuously and not eating right and think this is what caused it. I eased up on the exercise but my period didn't come back (this started last July). After ruling out being pregnant, I prayed about it, asking God what was wrong with me. I'm pushing 40 and not quite ready for menopause and I didn't think this was what was wrong, but I was scared. I didn't go to the doctor because I didn't want to go back on the pill or any other type of drug.<br /><br />After a week or so of praying about this, I went into our kitchen at work (by now it's October, three months after my periods stopped)and was rooting around in the cabinets for something and found a box of Traditional Medicinals Raspberry Leaf Tea in there. I read the description and froze. It talked about how it works for irregular menstruation & promoting healthy menstruation. Was this God's answer to my prayers? I went online to do research but found more women who had used it while pregant than for irregular periods, but this whole herbal angle stuck with me and I went to something else for help - Vitex. I ordered the supplements from Amazon and took them for 2 weeks. It gave me horrible heartburn and I had to stop. Back to the drawing board, back to praying.<br /><br />Please know, I'm not a religious fanatic. I'm just a sinner who has faith in God. And sometimes it takes a while for me to realize He has already given an answer for something I keep praying about. After months without a period, worrying about it and trying to accept that I might not have anymore, a couple of weeks ago, I came across that box of tea in the kitchen where I work again. I had never given it a try - why not try it now? I went out and bought some and just started drinking it, 2 cups a day. Last week was my first week and it made me sleepy but I kept feeling these twinges in my lower abdomen. My guess is this was my uterus contracting. It was strange but it wasn't unbearable. I didn't stop drinking the tea though and got through last week. Then, this past Thursday, 3/28, I came home from work and went to the bathroom and was surprised to learn I was bleeding. Oh, my God! After less than 2 weeks on this tea, after eight months of uncertainty and worry, my period had returned. My flow is normal and I have no cramps. Hallelujah!! I know this is the first one, but I am thoroughly convinced this great tea is responsible. I just wish I had had the faith when I first saw this tea back in October.<br /><br />Sometimes God will snap His fingers and make things right for you, and somethimes, He will lead you to the tools to make things right for yourself. For anyone with irregular periods, I would definitely recommend trying this tea. I plan to keep it as part of my healthy daily regimen - and to pay better attention from now on when I pray! I will come back and write a follow up when I get my next period:-)

review/text: A local health food store rep recommended organic raspberry leaf tea to get my system back on track ( tired, moody, stress, indomnia,overweight) though skeptic, I started drinking the tea three times a day as directed. By day two I noticed my milk supply began to increase it doubld. By the end of week 1 friends and family notice a positive mood change and my milk supply had tripled I went from 4oz to 8oz every 3 hrs. Im at the end of week two and I am now at 12oz per pumping session! I tripled within two weeks of me taking the raspberry leaf tea! I have enough milk to freeze now. As far as the issues I had mentioned above all are decreasing but not completely gone away. My life is more in order due to me being less irritable and being able to sleep, I haven't loss weight but I am not gaining weight either with exercise. It's only been two weeks and I feel as though my body is getting back on track! I love this tea and it is a must have, keep and share!

review/summary: helps with period symptoms
review/text: I see this tea has reviews already, but I will attest to the balance it brings me during PMS and after my period.  Both those times can be difficult for me physically and emotionally.  This tea lessens those tendencies.  The taste of it is definitely of the leaf.  You shouldn't expect a raspberry taste with this.  It isn't as herb-like as other teas I've had.  It reminds me of a mint leaf tea--not a strong mint flavor, but it is a bold taste that you will likely notice.  It has a strong effect going down.  Not a subtle tea.

review/summary: This tea made my periods SO much better!
review/text: I'm always into more natural ways of treating things and turn to herbs quite often. I have always had bad periods, with bad PMS symptoms and heavy flow. I have to admit that I did not know about this tea even though I had purchased the Mother's Milk tea for a colleague as part of her baby shower gift basket. My colleague came back a few months ago and let me know how much the Mother's Milk tea had helped her and sounded so relieved. That's when I started researching the other teas in this brand and came across Red Rasberry Leaf tea. I had heard about this tea from another colleague who was pregnant some years ago, so I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />It has been 2.5 months since I started drinking this tea and I can say that it made a difference even after the first few days. I have gone through 2 period cycles now and last time, there was a marked decrease in menstrual cramps just after a few days on this tea and less flow as well. This month, the difference is quite noticeable. First, I did not have any of the PMS symptoms - no bloating, migraines or intense cramps. In fact, i had slight cramping the day before and then the flow is substantially lighter!!!<br /><br />I wanted to give it another month before writing a review, but why wait when the results are so obvious? This tea is great. You do have to let it steep for 10-15 minutes as instructed. The taste gets some getting used to, but believe me, you won't notice after your third cup. I do want to mention that I do not drink this tea every day, 3 times a day as indicated on the packaging. I probably drink once a day, 1-3 times a week. Can you imagine how it would be if I drank it regularly?<br /><br />I cannot thank Traditional Medicinals enough for the relief. Try it and you won't regret!

review/summary: Good Tea
review/text: This tea is so much like black tea.  I'm pregnant now and drink 2-4 tea bags a day.  I'll use two tea bags per cup for a nice, strong cup of tea.  I do add milk and a little sugar.  It reminds me of a nice cup of black tea.  A great alternative if you are trying to avoid caffeine.  I'm pretty sure that adding milk and sugar takes away from the medicinal benefits, so I do drink it plain once and a while, but as far as it goes I'm sure it is much more healthy than black tea.  It's nice to be able to enjoy simple pleasures--guilt free (or nearly!) while pregnant!<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot.  I purchase this from Amazon.com via subscribe and save.  It costs less than half as much per box compared to what I was paying for it in the store.  This enables me to drink up to 4 tea bags worth of tea daily without breaking the bank.

review/summary: Raspberry Leaf is an excellent remedy.
review/text: Raspberry Tea is a staple in my medicine cabinet.  Good for virus/flu -- sipping when your stomach just won't settle down or for intestinal distress.  Also other uses as mentioned by other reviewers.  Raspberry leaf is just an excellent remedy for a multitude of uses.  Some local grocery stores are wise enough to stock this tea, so we can purchase a box at a time.  If you're not so lucky - share a case (of 6 as offered here) with like minded friends and get yours from Amazon.

review/summary: Smooth mellow flavor
review/text: I have a long history (if not a bit sporadic at times) of a variety of herbal use over the years & I remember squeezing my face in a grimace when I had to take certain ones, such as dong quai or some herbal tea that was deathly bitter & vapid.<br /><br />I drank Red Raspberry Leaf tea in my 20's & liked the mellow flavor so much that I continued to drink it for several years. I found it not to be bitter or strong but also not weak & didn't have a foul aroma. Overall a very pleasant & enjoyable herbal tea, even if I don't remember why I was taking it back then (maybe for menstrual cramps?). Well nothing ever aleviated my menstrual cramps except pain killers, but I would drink this tea again just for the enjoyment of it. I'm currently on green tea for the past number of years & I'm tired of the bitterness (albeit it's excellent in antioxidants, which is why I'm drinking it).<br /><br />I don't find Red Raspberry Leaf to be dark like black tea but more like a urine-yellow color (medium to deep yellow, depending on steep timing), similar to green tea. Generally I drank it plain with a little sweetener, though it was pleasant enough to take without any sweetener.

review/summary: This bulk deal is NOT a value...
review/text: I thought this was a pretty good bargain, but each teabag is about a 1/4 full, some less than that. When buying it at the grocery, the tea bags are much fuller. Since I'm drinking it for health reasons, that matters to me.<br /><br />It IS a good tea. I have PCOS, and normally have to take hormones (bc pills or progesterone cream) to get a period each month. I tried doing this alone, 2-3 cups a day, to see if it would bring on a period. I read in the reviews that a woman who hadn't had a period for several months did this, and she got it. I didn't get my period this month, BUT I didn't get breakouts (zits) or bad mood swings like I used to on the months that I skipped periods. I had only been drinking it a couple weeks prior to when my period was to start, so I guess I should stay at it a bit longer. I also bought Fertilitea and plan to alternate it with this. I don't want a baby; I just want to feel normal. :-( PCOS is challenging.<br /><br />In summer, I grow my own raspberry leaves, and that is always best - so much fresher and stronger. But, this has to do b/c I ran out of leaves, and have to wait til May for a fresh crop. This tea has been of some success, but I know there are no guarantees on whether it will work for me, having PCOS. It is said to balance hormones as well as benefit pregnant women. When I get the barely-filled bags, I double up so I get a nice, dark tea. I like the taste, but it is different - kind of like a mix of green tea and black tea.

Many of them didn't make sense in relationship to raspberry tea, until I noticed that the header of each review mentioned what tea the review was for. All the different teas made by Traditional Medicinals are mixed together. Not very helpful, Amazon. I bought this tea in the supermarket, so I know I like it.

review/summary: Reacted badly to this tea
review/text: I actually had bad effects using this tea.  I was given it by a friend and was unaware of its medicinal properties (so was my friend, fyi).  Within 15 minutes I was starting to get paranoid and less socially apt, and started to feel distant from everything which was going on.  Before long, I was also tending towards depression (which I've experienced before while on birth control, so I caught the signs of it).  I also felt like fainting at a few points.  The effects did go away within about 5 hours.  This was after drinking only a quarter of a mug of it.<br /><br />These are actually the same reactions I had to two different varieties of the birth control pill.  So, if you've reacted badly to birth control, be warned that you may also react badly to this tea.  Or, you may be lucky in that it will not affect you.  Take care if you do try it, and good luck!

review/summary: Spotty results with Senseo machine & flavor is only so-so
review/text: I don't see that these pods are advertised as fitting the Senseo machine so I'm not rating them lower--wouldn't be fair. One out of 4 or 5 times, I get a satisfactory cup of coffee--the other times, I get mostly water and a few drops of dark coffee at the end of the cycle. So I'm mostly rating them here for taste, which I think is pretty artificial vanilla-y.<br /><br />I use the 2-cup pod holder with the Senseo (these pods do NOT fit in the 1-cup holder, as they're fatter than Senseo pods and rounded on both sides), and use the one-cup button.  I actually get better coffee by using the two-cup button -- it seems that the one-cup button doesn't get the hot water pushed sufficiently through the pod.  Aggravating when I use half milk and only want the amount of coffee that is made with the one-cup button.<br /><br />I won't buy these again.

review/text: In rescue I see some pretty sad and sickly thin coated dogs.  I rescue primarily small dogs.  I can't sing the praises enough about this Avoderm dog food.  My 9 yr. old senior 4 lb. longhair rescue Chihuahua went from being the skinniest little thing with bare paws and a thin coat to being a 5 lb. stunning fur muff on Avoderm.  She doesn't have teeth so I get her the Chicken with veggies canned and I mix in a little bit of water to make it easier for her to eat.  She absolutely loves it and gobbles it up and it clearly loves her cause she's absolutely gorgeous now.  I wish I could show you before and after pictures.  You wouldn't believe the difference the Avoderm made! All my rescue dogs eat it and the Avoderm kibble and do fabulously well and develop muscles, strong bones and shiny coats on it.

I read several dog food review websites and I subscribe the the Whole Dog Journal, which does an annual review of canned and dry dog foods.  The Avoderm product line consistently was rated highly. I fed my puppy the chicken and rice puppy food, now she's eating the chicken and vegetable stew, the salmon and wild rice stew, and the turkey and vegetable stew.  I also feed her several of their dry kibbles sold under the Pinnacle brand name which is also the Avoderm brand.  She likes all of them, and I plan to continue feeding her the canned and dry foods as the ingredients are of high quality.

review/summary: APPEALS TO MY ONE PICKY EATER WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS!
review/text: I have 10 toy poodles.  One deals with terrible allergies.  I buy other very good canned dog foods to mix with their dry food but he would just barely touch it.  In trying to build up his resistance and get him to gain weight I have been trying different canned dog foods,  (along with other things) all which are very high grade.  This one finally did it!  My other dogs just love Happy Hips, which is an excellent quality dog food and very similar, of late, but not him.  He goes crazy over this food and the added perk, it is good for him.  It smells like human quality food, I think.  I shall continue buying it. I wish it were a little less expensive but compared to some others in this quality range it at 20.95... it is less expensive!  I am also now using the Avoderm dry kibble now (see my review on that) which is just the most perfect dog food for all my little ones.  I am very happy with the quality of dog food this company makes.  So glad I found it.

I am definitely sticking with this flour and telling my friends about it. It's like a hybrid mix of white and whole wheat flour and makes an excellent loaf of bread.

I've always had trouble with my whole wheat breads being too dense and heavy, but not with this flour! It was amazing. I usually mix at least half white flour with whole wheat to prevent that heaviness, but decided to just go for it when this flour arrived, and I used no white flour with it at all, and made the best whole wheat bread ever! The dough rose to great heights, baked beautifully, and the bread was so delicious it was gone in 2 days! (and that was 3 loaves.) Will definitely buy again. I'm so glad I tried this flour.

review/summary: NOT white flour
review/text: Once my baking craze started, the was no stopping it. It got to the point when the flour sold in supermarkets just wasn't good enough and I ordered this as well as the whole wheat flour of the same brand from amazon. Pros: awesome quality, you can tell right away by taste and texture that it is superior. Cons: it is heavy and dense. I bought the unbleached wheat thinking it was white but it's actually a lighter whole wheat flour. So if you want to make white bread or white pizza crust, it will not work. However, I mix it with another brand's white bread flour now (2 cups other brand, 1 cup great river flour) and it gives me amazing tasting whitish bread. Also do use gluten powder with this brand bc it is too dense to rise much. I only wish they would make white bread flour.

review/text: Our family is recently switching over from processed foods to whole/organic foods.  One of our first steps was to begin making our own bread.  I used to buy two loves of white bread, per week for our family of 7.  I have been making bread ever since I have received this flour.  We love it!  My kids love it!  I use all wheat flour and no other kind and my kids have said nothing about the taste.  I was concerned because I have tried many different types of wheat products and have always been disappointed in the tasted.  2/5 of my children are very picky eaters.  I am so thankful I am able to feed my family healthy grains instead of store-bought bread.  I am going to make homemade hot dog and hamburger buns today!  Thanks so much for creating such a wonderful flour!!

review/summary: Great for Paratha and No Knead Bread
review/text: I absolutely love this flour. I disagree that it is dense, especially since this is a whole wheat bread flour not a white, all-purpose flour. I first purchased the sampler pack and liked this flour the best. My flatbread is perfect and my no knead bread seriously was amazing on the first try ever. The taste is delicious. All in all, I definitely recommend this for the first-time or anytime baker :)

review/text: This is labeled: "Great River Organic Milling 100% Organic Bread Flour Unbleached Wheat"<br />This I evidently mistook to be ordinary bread flour made from wheat. What I got was 20 pounds of Whole Wheat Flour which I have no need for and can not return.<br /><br />The label should have read: Unbleached Whole Wheat Bread Flour.

Sometimes the boxes are a little damaged and a couple cans here and there have gotten opened from this and damaged.  Product is wonderful, shipping and breaking open is sometimes a problem.

review/summary: Our little dogs LOVE this flavor Might Dog
review/text: Our two little Toy Manchester Terriers (8.5 lbs) have very sensitive digestive systems so we are careful what we feed them and they are also a bit fussy about what they'll eat.<br />This flavor - Rotisserie Chicken and Chicken with Rice agrees with them just fine and they love it for the 2x a day feedings.<br /><br />We do feed a moistened dry high quality dry food mixed in with the Mighty Dog just to make 100% sure they're getting a well balanced diet and we like them to have a bit of crunchy food to help keep their teeth clean.<br /><br />Our vet tells us they're both in tip top shape and their coats have a beautiful show quality shine. We believe that the food they consume has a lot to do with that.<br /><br />Yes, Mighty Dog is a little higher priced than some but it's a good quality food that along with regular vet visits and exercise will keep your dog healthy for their lifetime.

review/summary: Creamy Smooth and Satisfying Soup at Hand!
review/text: This Campbells Cream of Broccoli "heat and eat" soup is so "Creamy Smooth and Satisfying!" I added a few spices and heated it a little longer than suggested the first time I tried it, and it instantly won a permanent place in my fast food pantry! A cup of this soup rounds out a simple lunch perfectly, or it makes a quick, convenient snack anytime, just about anywhere. I had to try this soup blind because Amazon doesn't list nutritional details, but it was worth the risk. Here are a few facts, so YOU know what you're getting: Campbells Cream of Broccili Soup at Hand contains (per container) -<br />150  calories<br />3 grams protein<br />7 grams fat<br />3 grams sugars<br />7 grams fiber<br />and gets 40% of its calories from FAT!

review/summary: Tasty, cheap, and convenient
review/text: I've been buying these soups as a matter of cheap thrills and convenience. They are probably best used as a no-fuss and light lunch st work and school. Not all of the flavors are created equal, however. I rank the ones I've tried as follows:<br /><br />1. Tomato Parmesan<br />2. Cream of broccoli<br />3. New England clam chowder.<br /><br />The first two are very tasty. The third is a bit bland but still pretty decent.<br /><br />I can think of three advantages of going with this product:<br /><br />1. Cost. Bloom charges me $1.89 a can for this soup. Amazon's subscription plans often make the soup significantly less expensive.<br /><br />2. Ease of preparation. Just shake, microwave for 90 seconds, and you're ready to go. No other cooking utensils or preparation is required. The metal rims on the containers do not cause sparking. Pretty neat.<br /><br />3. Ease of consumption. Just sip from the container, which seems to be a foam material or plastic that doesn't conduct much heat and is easy to hold. It fits easily into car cup holders. No spoons or bowls are required.<br /><br />Anyone on a low-salt diet should think twice. The soups have 30+ percent of the RDA. The fat content is a bit elevated. These things are to maintain the flavor. Calories don't go above 220 or so.<br /><br />All in all, these soups have turned out to be an unexpected winner. I expect to be buying more.

review/text: These are really convenient (just microwave for 1:15 and it's ready to drink, no spoon needed). This one is actually my favorite flavor. I used to buy it at my local Target and they discontinued it (not sure why, since this flavor would always sell out before the others). The Amazon Subscribe & Save price is competitive with the Target sale price and much lower than the Safeway price for this item, so I'm very happy with my purchase.

review/text: This is my all-time favorite Campbell's Soup.  I was looking for one of their "At Hand" soups so I would have the convenience of using the microwave and having no dirty dishes.<br /><br />To add some sticking-power and extra protein to this flavor-packed soup, I add some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UQEDTG">Kraft Grated Parmesan, 8 Ounce Cannister (Pack of 12)</a> to the top and after a few bites (no, I don't use the sippy lid although one could) I shake more into the cup and stir it in.  I know it's not Parmigiano Reggiano but, hey, it's microwaved soup.<br /><br />I like the Cream of Broccoli soup so much that I doubled-up on my subscription.

review/text: I have tried other flavors of the Campbell's Soup at Hand and did not like them.  To me they do not taste like the soup they are supposed to be duplicating, nor did they have the same texture.  However, the cream of broccoli hits the mark.  It tastes just like the original.  It's creamy and delicious (and very difficult to find in the stores around my area, so I was glad to find it here).  If you like the taste of the cream of broccoli soup by Campbell's made from a can where you add water, then you will like this. It tastes the same, just more convenient.

review/summary: What took me so long to find this gem?
review/text: This is exactly what I've been looking for.  I use wild rice in a few applications and hate that all my grocery store carries is these little boxes (6oz by weight - 1.6 cups by measure) for over six dollars.<br /><br />This wild rice is the same great quality as what I've been buying for so much more.  Since I tend to use it in one cup increments, I just measured them out and vacuum sealed each cup separately to store in my freezer.  I got OVER twelve cups of wild rice out of the 5lb bag.<br /><br />The only thing that was unusual for me was the cooking instruction.  I just went ahead and revised that to what I thought it should be - boil water (three parts water to one part wild rice), put wild rice in boiling water, pinch of salt, give it a stir, cover, turn heat way down to almost low, and set timer for 50 minutes.  Came out perfectly.

review/summary: reacted very badly to this pasta
review/text: My wife and I ate the recommended serving (2 oz dried). It was delicious, and we felt full afterwards. Later that night, neither of us slept well because we were so hungry. I don't know if this is related, but we both had heart palpitations that night.<br /><br />We both woke up feeling starved. I usually don't even feel hungry in the morning! My wife checked her blood sugar levels (she has gestational diabetes) and found they had skyrocketed.<br /><br />This is not a low-carb product, it is a high-carb product where the carbs have been altered in a way that affects absorption - but not necessarily to truly lower its glycemic impact.<br /><br />If it works for you, great, but it REALLY did not work for us. We're throwing out all the boxes that I bought based on the 5 star ratings here. If you want to try it, start with a single box and see how it makes you feel.

review/summary: Not low carb unless al dente
review/text: The reason, I suspect, that people have varying results regarding glucose levels after eating Dreamfields. Their website explains that it must be cooked precisely according to the individual box directions in order to retain the low carb aspect. This should probably be explained on the box as well. The website states:<br /><br />"It is very important not to overcook Dreamfields because over cooking can damage the protective matrix and increase the digestible carbs per serving. We also recommend pouring any sauce over the pasta just before serving. If the pasta is mixed in a pan with the sauce, do this only over low heat for a short amount of time."<br /><br />I don't cook mine even a minute longer than the the recommended time.<br /><br />With the exception of the lasagna noodles, it's not recommended for storage after cooking, either. The company recommends only preparing what you will consume at the time. Storage in a sauce, especially an acidic sauce (like one with tomatoes or vinegar), will also break down the protective matrix which prevents digestion.<br /><br />Needless to say, portion control is important, too. A diabetic friend told me that her blood sugar level rose significantly after eating it but, upon further questioning, she admitted she'd eaten almost the entire box at one time.<br /><br />This product does work, but has to be as directed.

review/summary: Dreamfield's pasta study; no difference compared to regular pasta
review/text: [...]<br /><br />In this study, we have compared the glucose response over 3 h after ingestion of a 50-g CHO portion of the Dreamfields product with the same dry weight CHO of a traditional commercially available pasta. A crossover design was used. Two groups of five subjects each, i.e., 10 subjects total without known diabetes, were recruited for the study. They were not aware of which pasta product was being served. Regarding taste as well as mouth feel, our results confirmed the Dreamfields company claim. All subjects agreed that they could not detect a difference between the Dreamfields product and the traditional pasta. Both were considered to be highly acceptable. When the first five subjects were studied using the same cooking method for both products, the Dreamfields pasta did not result in a smaller glucose rise. To our surprise the mean postmeal glucose curves were essentially identical. Therefore, we studied five different subjects. The result was the same; that is, the curves were essentially identical (Fig. 1). In 10 people without diabetes, the Dreamfields pasta product we purchased did not result in an improved glucose excursion when compared with a commercially available traditional pasta product as would have been expected based upon the company's claim. Because we did not test several different batches of Dreamfields pasta or other commercially available pasta products for comparison, it is possible that different results would be obtained in other studies.

review/text: First and foremost it tastes identical to normal high carbohydrate pastas and this factoid is why I considered this an excellent choice despite a few shortcomings.  What I found to be minor caveats is that one 3 hours after consuming this pasta I was fairly hungry again.  The other minor issue was and I apologize for offering up TMI but I also thought the next day that when nature was calling that it called a little longer meaning I had a lot more volume in my stool.  To me this made sense though if their is only 5 net digestible carbs then that meant to me that most of this pasta it is being sent off to the packing and shipping station rather than being converted to sugars and ultimately fat.  One man's opine, but all in all give it a try as I find it to be the most guilt free pasta on the market.

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta - Highly Recommended!
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again. We have tried most of the Dreamfields types and enjoy them all.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: NEW & Improved? Now with LESS for your $$$! 1lb size box now contains13.25oz
review/text: Well before I talk about the product quality, I'll mention that DreamFields has kicked their customers right in the wallet. I bought a case of this recently, and at first I thought the box had a leaked in shipping. Then I took a closer look, and saw that the box now said 13.25oz. That's right, an 18% (EIGHTEEN PERCENT)  price increase slipped in low and sneaky.<br /><br />Now let me make one thing clear, I like this product. I'd have to be a fool to pay three times the cost of regular pasta if I didin't! However, playing games with packaging and value is simply not an honest way to deal with customers. And while I know companies need to make a buck, I don't like them being stealth about a price increase. I especially don't like it when I'm trying to budget what I spend like everyone else in this lousy economy. And I do not appreciate being duped out of 18% of my purchase.<br />If Dreamfields feels they need a price increase (even though wheat and gasoline are actually lower in price) the just do it. If you're affraid you'll alienate customers by doing so, then cut costs. But don't be sneaky about it!<br /><br />Product taste and quality gets 5 stars<br />Product value for the money gets 2 stars

review/summary: An answer for diabetic pasta lovers
review/text: When my husband was diagnosed with diabetes earlier this year, I believed pasta would have to be eliminated from our diet. A session with his nutritionist proved me wrong and I couldn't be happier. We all love pasta and I am so happy with Dreamfields for providing us with an alternative that won't spike his blood sugar, but also tastes terrific.<br /><br />Whatever you folks at Dreamfields are doing, you are doing it right. We absolutely love your products and will continue to buy them as long as we can get them. Oh, and how about trying your hands at egg noodles?

review/summary: Angel hair is my favorite
review/text: The other reviews got it right! This pasta is delicious, tastes like regular pasta, and I never get tired of it. Angel hair is my favorite. I cook it a few minutes longer than the recommended 5 so it's softer. Then I mix in butter, basil, and a little milk for sauce. I could literally eat that everyday. Yum!

review/summary: Best Low Carb Pasta
review/text: You would not even know that this is a low carb pasta.  My husband & kids like it and cannot tell the difference.  Only complaint is that it is too expensive online.  Finally, one of our local stores added them back to the shelves and we stock up every time we visit.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: As a gourmet and pasta lover on a low carb "diet", this pasta has allowed me to maintain my desired weight without even remotely feeling like I'm on a diet.  I don't think I could do that without it.  Mac and Cheese made with heavy cream, loads of yummy cheeses, and this pasta ~ diet, what diet??  Lovely to be thin AND completely satiated!  The five-starrers are right ~ this pasta would fool anyone into thinking it's the traditional high-carb kind.

review/summary: Not a substitute it's the real deal
review/text: I started reducing carbs several months ago and happened upon Dreamfields pasta. I do not consider it to be a 'replacement' as to my palate it is indistinguishable from any other good pasta. A month ago it was recommended I go gluten free so I no longer eat it but I'm still a fan seeking to write about how good it is one month later.<br /><br />If one happens to be diabetic eating a recommended serving, waiting a while, then testing blood sugar to see how it impacts you is a good idea as with any food.<br /><br />Note despite my now gluten free diet I have not thrown my Dreamfields away. If I should be allowed gluten again I will devour it in short order. To me Dreamfields is a good pasta choice whether you care about carbs or not, it's that good.

review/summary: WARNING NOT LOW CARB!!
review/text: This pasta tastes great... BUT shame on them, people are confused with the word unused, digestable,protected whatever carbs and think it is the same as low or net carb... it is not low carb, people with diabetes are reacting badly to it... and people who are trying to lose weight on low carb diet are not losing.. it has the same count of carb like regular pasta...<br />me personally got bloated after eating it and gained weight.. read reviews about it on netrition.com<br />or any where.. if it is really low carb it won't be cheap, check the prices of any other low carb products.. even the products that are made sugar free (made with splenda and sugar alcohol) don't dare to call themselves low carb... UNLESS YOU SEE THE WORD NET CARB on anything it is not low carb.

review/summary: My Lucky Day!
review/text: That was the day a friend told me about Dreamfields pasta.  I don't have to worry about blood sugar; my angle is the low-carb diet.  I tried the Dreamfields angel hair with the White Linen [odd brand name for a spaghetti sauce] marinara sauce from Costco; it too has a low carb count. And of course a generous hit of fresh parmesan. The result was delicious, low carb, and very easy.  I noticed no midnight starvation, luckily.  Everything my friend and these reviewers said about this pasta being indistinguishable from regular pasta is true. I'm going to look for the linguini so my husband can make his perfect fettucini alfredo -- his is the best I've ever had. Linguini will just have to do, as there is no fettucini -- and it will.

review/summary: Best pasta EVER!
review/text: This is hands-down the best pasta on the market for low-carb dieters. I tried it when I started the Atkins diet, and now every member of my family uses Dreamfields pasta - just because its so darn healthy! Especially my diabetic mom and a good friend, they were so happy (just like me) to be able to enjoy a good pasta dish without the worry (and FAT) from the real stuff. Trust me, I'm married to a very fussy Italian! :-)

review/summary: It's good.
review/text: This pasta is good.  It tastes like regular pasta when first made.  However, if you have leftovers it doesn't taste quite the same when re-heated and I read on their website that the digestible carbs are altered if the pasta isn't eaten in one sitting or if it's cooked longer than directed on the box.  I prefer Atkins penne to this...it's the best low-carb pasta I've tried so far, tastes great anytime, has more fiber, and the carbs are never altered. I like that you can buy Dreamfields at the grocery store, though.  I still buy it if I'm out of Atkins...if you follow the instructions to the minute and eat it in one sitting, it's a great pasta.

review/text: Took a chance, saw good reviews, bought one box of Angel Hair pasta.  Got it today.  Made regular ole spaghetti and had an awesome tasting meal.  Being on a low carb diet - pasta is a no-no but thankfully Dreamfields has the solution.  Shipping was a bit high for one box so I plan on stocking up on other noodles (lasagna!!) so shipping will be lower.
