review/summary: Unbelievably Delicious
review/text: I put this in Bertolli's Extra Light Tasting Olive Oil and it was amazing!  I did cut the amount of seasoning just a smidge though.  Everyone loved it.  Not one of the ingredients is stronger than the others and you can taste them all.  I found this at a store that let you taste test all the Dean Jacob's Bread Dipping flavors and this was the best by far.

review/summary: VERY DELICIOUS!!!!!!!
review/text: These seasonings (other flavors: Sicilian & Rosa Maria) there is also a Parmasan blend, but the first 3 are my personal favorites, are absolutely DELICIOUS!!! They are also very versatile, you can have them with olive oil for bread dipping or better yet, use them to cook chicken, ground turkey burgers, fish, just about anything you can think of. I've tried a few other seasonings at the supermarket but they are waste of money, you get a lot more seasoning and a TON of delicious flavor with the Dean Jacob's seasoning collection.

review/summary: Exotic?
review/text: If you think mud is an exotic flavor, then this is the tea for you. Otherwise, you might want to think twice. This tea smelled wonderful while brewing, but in the cup the taste is muted and muddled. There is some kind of spice there--I know because 1) it says so on the package and 2) I can feel the bite of something on my tongue, but I can't place what the spice is and it's aroma is barely discernible during drinking. It's like a mouthful of flat, flavorless... I don't know what. It was unbearable without sugar, and it didn't improve with it. I didn't add milk because I didn't want to waste milk. Take a pass on this one.

review/summary: THE best chai on the market & great packaging too!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE Bigelow's spiced chai tea.  It's the best brand on the market, and along with their vanilla chai, form 2 of the 3 brands of chai I keep on hand (or will even TRY these days.)  Too many times, I've tried other brands, only to end up throwing them out because of dreadful medicinal tastes.  I also love the foil packet packaging inside the box--it makes Bigelow tea bags much more portable!  This is a tea that I hate running out of.<br /><br />I'm a camper, and frequently participate in outdoor activities.  I'm also usually the camp cook.  Bigelow teas are my favorite to keep in my drink box to offer everyone a selection of tea--the foil packages prevent taste transfer, help keep the bags clean and dry, and are clearly labeled as to the variety.  I feel comfortable adding Bigelow teas to our backpacks too--the teas will be usable whether they are used this trip...or six trips from now.  Convenient, fantastic flavor, high quality, and Amazon offers a much better price than our local stores.  I love the convenience of "subscribe & save" too!

review/summary: Does not taste like a true Chai
review/text: This is a really nice dessert tea. It is reminds me of Celestial Seasonings' "Vanilla Hazelnut", but with a much stronger nut bouquet and flavor. It also has a very strong caramel type smell.<br /><br />Since I wanted a more authentic chai flavor, this particular tea does not "pass muster". My first thought upon smelling this was "does this have chicory in it?" It could also have the roasted carob found in the vanilla hazelnut tea mentioned above, but chicory is more likely. It should not be advertised as chai.<br /><br />Currently I brew two different chais together (Tazo and India Tea's Cardemom Chai) together. After that I  put the seeds of two cardamom pods, one star anise, a chunk of ginger and a little freshly ground pepper before adding milk and honey. I was hoping I could just one tea bag upon receipt of this order. I'll keep this, but my search for the perfect Chai in one bag is still on!<br /><br />This tea also seems very sweet. I don't know if they added Stevia or something similar, but I didn't need to add as much sweetener as I add to my other Chai concoction.

review/summary: My favorite so far
review/text: I have been looking for a cheaper way to get good chai than continuing to pay several dollars at a coffee shop.<br /><br />Most brands I have tried, including more expensive stuff, either smell funny or have a single spice that is too strong and stands out.  Bigelow's chai doesn't have any harsh standouts, and results in the unique even taste I liked about the expensive coffee shop tea.  On top of being my favorite strictly by taste, it's also one of the cheapest brands on the shelf.<br /><br />Two handy features:<br /><br /> - Each bag is inside its own envelope.  It's nice to be able to transport one or two bags without having to touch them directly with dirty hands.  Other brands leave the individal bags naked and have a nice sealed liner in the box, which is really handy if you plan on wandering around with an ENTIRE BOX OF TEA.<br /><br /> - Each bag has a dipping string/tab attached to remove the bag from your cup.  It's 2007 and some teabag manufacturers still won't spot us a 2" piece of thread.

review/text: This is like other lokum I have had in terms of the gel-like texture and inch-thick powdered sugar packing around the pieces. The rose aroma is strong, like a grandmother's old fashioned perfume and the flavor matches it exactly. Americans are not used to eating floral flavors, even in Europe you only see violet as candy, so rose is very unusual to our palates but very delicious and exotic. I recommend people try it.

review/text: I have never tried turkish delight before. Like others, I was curious about it after seeing The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe.<br />I really do love it. The rose flavor is an exotic flavor and takes some getting use to. After the intial thought of "I'm eating a rose flavored bath bead" it was really good. It is a little more goey than I would like it to be. I'm anxious to try the lemon flavor. Also, there is A LOT of powder sugar covering them. I had to put the cubes on a paper plate and then dust them off a bit. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try it. I would also recommend you only buy one box at a time. I thought they were smaller boxes my mistake. I think any adult who has a sweet tooth would like this tasty little treat.

review/text: This was our first experience with Turkish Delight.....my daughter had a Narnia Birthday party so, of course, we had to have some.  I went by color when ordering, and as theirs is red in the movie, ended up with Rosewater.  I did not expect it to taste like roses, or rose potpourri exactly though.  I felt like I was eating old lady perfume.  I give it 4 stars because the kids love it, oddly enough, as did most of them at the party, although the adults all seemed to agree with the 'eating potpourri' idea.  Maybe if we had grown up on it us adults would have enjoyed it more too :)

I ordered it through a turkish grocery website but figured the review here would be more helpful as it's the same brand. I love the smell because I like rose scented things, and the texture i thought was good, but the taste? It was, like other reviewers have said, eating rose potpourri. I just can't get past it. I'm sure it's an acquired taste but I don't think I'll ever get used to it. Even an hour later I could still taste it faintly and I keep shuddering lol. My 4 year old wants to eat the whole box. But then again, she's positive she's a princess so she should be eating flowery stuff. :P Maybe sometime I'll be brave enough to try a different flavor, but I'm afraid the lemon will taste like a lemon peel.

A can makes two servings, and one serving along with a moderate calorie sandwich makes a great lunch for someone losing weight, or maintaining weight. One thing I've come to appreciate about Progresso soups is that they are seasoned much like I season homemade soups. They have a variety of spices that make an effective combination. I'd appreciate it if they'd leave the noodles out, but there aren't so many that they disturb either the vegetable soup or the nutritional value. The rest of the package makes up for it.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Where have all the deals gone?
review/text: It's not the 7 buck deal I got in March 2012 and at over 13 bucks now it's actually much cheaper in the stores. I purchased the 20oz. pack of 3 so that was about 2.34 a box and close to what I was paying in stores so I went for the free shipping and bought two. I'm in a rural area and it's a long trip to the store so we go about once a month and having this deal meant I didn't have to look at several stores to find the best price. However, over 4 bucks a box is no deal. I gave this 5 stars because I like Raisin Bran; I could not see where it was made so no complaints about Mexico, the use by dates are mid-2013; the price was right and I was a happy camper. I would not purchase this again at this price for any reasons that I can possibly fathom. As a side note, check prices carefully in the food stores because I find that the larger boxes are often more per ounce than the smaller boxes and at one store the store brand in a bag was more per ounce than the Kellogg's.

review/summary: Not as fresh dated as I get at the Stores and made in Mexico
review/text: I just received 3 Boxes of Kellogs Rasin Bran as a Subscribe and Save purchase.  I like to check the "Use By Date" at the stores because it may sit awhile in our pantry before we use it.  I bought Kellogs Rasin Bran at Sam's Club last week, and it has a date for June 2013.  The boxes I just got from Amazon are dated for February 2013, so I will have to use them up first.  It is mid-Sept 2012 now, so there is still time to use the 3 boxes.  But dissapointed that they are closer dated than at the stores here. Also, the Box from Sam's shows Battle Creek, Michigan - and these from Amazon show being from Mexico. Based on this and other reviews here mentioning Kellog's ingredients being altered, I think I will change to another brand and cancel my Subscribe and Save.

review/summary: Raisins for breakfast
review/text: I've had raisin bran from various brands, from growing up on various cereal that popped up on sale, but I don't remember any of them having as many raisins as Kellogg's Raisin Bran! It seems every normal-sized spoonful has 5-6 raisins on average. It's enough to make me look up the health benefits of raisins, as I can't see a cereal this sweet as being very healthy. As suspected, raisins are full of calories, mainly from sugars. If you're looking for a very healthy cereal, look elsewhere. This one seems to be made for those with a sweet tooth, though I guess some may find that sweetness from raisins is better than sweetness from other ingredients (ex. high fructose corn syrup).<br /><br />My rating reflects my personal opinion and taste, more than the quality of the product. Amazon shipped them to me in a shape no worse than found at a local grocery store and the flakes are still very crisp and palette pleasing, with the sell by date 6 months away (Mar '13). It seems fresh enough. It's the ratio of raisins and flakes that bugs me; I guess I was hoping more for a bowl of Wheaties with only a handful of raisins, for 1-2 raisins per spoonful on average.<br /><br />As a warning for those who don't normally eat raisin bran, beware that this cereal is dense. 20 oz of this stuff comes in a similar sized box as some others' 10-14 oz boxes. If you eat a bowl of it, filled up the same amount as you would with something like Cheerios, this will leave you a heavy feeling in your stomach. I recommend mixing some of this cereal with some other cereal, to make it more palatable, with my favorite being Quaker Oatmeal Squares, though I imagine this goes well with many other cereals.<br /><br />Also note that these boxes currently do not have any Kellogg's Family Rewards codes, at least the three I checked do not. Maybe it might be a new program and Amazon still has old stock.

review/summary: It's Kellog's R. Brain, which most people already know, so buy on price if cheaper than store, but...
review/text: Not a huge fan of Kellog's Raisin Bran for a variety of reasons:<br /><br />1. Relative to other flakey cereals (Special K, Total etc.), the flakes are sometimes not always fresh (I don't know about Amazon's batch) and it really makes the cereal sort of gummy and yucky<br />2. In general, the flakes themselves, even when fresh,a re not real crunchy (admittedly, they are bran flakes, not pure rice, wheat or corn flakes, so they seem more like a bran fiber cereal) and they get mushy in milk pretty quickly.<br />3. Amazon used to have a four-pack for nearly the same price, so this is not a big savings anymore with the three-pack (pricey NYC stores typically always have Kellog's Raisin Bran on sale and it's usually $2.99/20 oz box).<br /><br />On the plus side, I DO like the raisins. They're plump and not sugary coated.

review/summary: Tastey and slightly healthy too.
review/text: I wouldn't go so far to say this cereal is bad for you, but with the amount of added sugar it isn't great. I suppose that is the only way you can make bran appealing to the masses though. Bran is the nutritious cardboard part of a wheat grain. I personally would like to see them reduce the added sugar and add more raisins for a natural sweetness. As far a a amazon rating though it is, in my opinion, a good (not great) tasting cereal and has a good bit or fiber and protein. Also it's price is great for to the door delivery and you don't have to wait for it to go on sale at your local grocery store.

review/summary: The great raisin bran debate: Post vs. Kellogg's
review/text: I switch between Kellogg's and Post's respective versions of raisin bran since each has its pluses. Post has the flake portion down pat - large flakes with a nice crunch. In contrast, the Kellogg's flakes are smaller and more fiber-tasting. (As an aside, the Kellogg's flakes work better than Post when using the cereal as an add-in for baking multi-grain breads or oatmeal cookies).<br /><br />But raisins are part of the equation as well. Kellogg's seems to have more raisins and, more importantly, they taste better - plumper and less chewy than the ones in Post.<br /><br />I usually get Kellogg's since I can live with their less than great flakes, and they usually cost less (good sales on Amazon, plus I can get the jumbo boxes at Sam's Club). But, if only these two companies would collaborate - flakes by Post, raisins by Kellogg's. That would be perfect

review/summary: Unacceptable ingredients
review/text: I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason:<br />Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels.  There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers.

review/summary: Contains GMOs! We say NO!
review/text: Kellogg's Raisin Bran contains unlabeled genetically modified ingredients and Kellogg doesn't want you to know this. They contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California to try to trick people into voting against Prop. 37, which would require that genetically engineered foods be labeled. Raisin Bran contains GMO Bt corn and GMO sugar derived from GMO sugar beet. Both were developed and patented by chemical companies. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide. It has been genetically engineered by forcing a foreign gene that makes its own pesticide into the plant DNA. Every cell of this plant is a pesticide factory. When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. Both the sugar and the corn have foreign genes for herbicide resistance forced into their DNA. The plants are made to resist high levels of RoundUp. The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp, a chemical called glyphosate, has been linked to birth defects, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and more. These GMOs have been snuck into our food supply without telling us. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled (including all of Europe, China, Russia, Japan, Australia, Brazil and India). In the US there is currently NO labeling law. The FDA does NOT require long term, peer reviewed studies to determine if GMOs are really safe. They let the chemical companies that patent these "foods" decide. How can this be when the FDA is there to protect us? WRONG. Just google Michael Taylor, Food Safety Czar and you'll see that he's setting food policy. When it suits him, he uses the revolving door to go back and forth between the FDA and the largest chemical company that is patenting and trying to monopolize our food supply.  Should people be eating this stuff? I wouldn't feed it to my pets. My family is boycotting ALL Kellogg's products.

My teenager will eat ONE bowl and be satisfied versus "inhaling" bowls and bowls of fruity loopy stuff. I enjoy it because there's 26 of the recommended daily 48 grams of whole grains per serving, it's all natural, no preservatives, a good source of protein, and a "good" sweet taste. Kids and grown-ups BOTH like this straight out of the box, as a hot or cold cereal with milk, mixed in yogurt, and sprinkled on ice cream!

I purchased this 6 box Pack a couple of weeks ago and 4+ boxes have been throughly enjoyed thus far.  If you like Granola and French Vanilla is a flavor you enjoy... you have to try this Granola!

review/summary: Not too fond of it.
review/text: The cereal had an impressive ingredient list, but the texture was a little off, and it's way too sweet.  The second ingredient on the list, ahead of most of the healthful ingredients, was sugar (organic cane sugar).  The cereal was so sweet, I felt like I was eating a dessert.

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: Nice seeds. Didn't give it 5 stars only because there were too many shells in each bag, which gets to be a pain. However, the price and wonderful taste of the seeds make the shells tolerable.<br /><br />Oh, if you're used to getting refrigerated, bulk, raw sunflower seeds, these are different. Since they aren't refrigerated, they are drier. I eat these like they are, but they're really good if soaked in water or other liquid for a couple of hours or so (I do this when cooking or baking with them.) The seeds are easier to digest when they're soaked anyway.

review/summary: Wife says not as good...
review/text: My wife doesn't like these as much as another brand we ordered from Amazon previously.  She says they are firmer and "bland."  To me, they taste just fine, and an unsalted, untoasted sunflower seed is, well, expected maybe to be somewhat bland, perhaps?  A seed with a little crunch is fine by me, and we'll buy these in bulk again if the price is right since finding shelled, unsalted seeds (which is what we want) locally is impossible.

review/summary: allergen free
review/text: For those allergic to peanuts and tree nuts, seeds from flowers such as these are a good, safe alternative--but not all the time.  Flower seeds too are often processed in a facility that manufacturers peanuts, leaving them unsafe to eat as well.  This brand, however, has no allergen warnings and solve that dilemma.  I use this in place of peanuts to make "sunflower" brittle.  I also use these in granola mixes/bars, breads, toppings for fruit crisps, etc., knowing my granddaughter will be able to enjoy them--safely.  When I bought these, they came in a 3-pack, now it's a 12-pack.

review/summary: I am an adult with GERD
review/text: I recently ended up with GERD and a really bad bleeding ulcer, due to stress and grief.  I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving.  Some types of baby food stay down,  where as other types cause me indigestion just as bad as adult food.  This specific sweet potato one seemed to ease my acid refluxing and indigestion and sooth my throat.  I'm not at the point where I can eat the whole container yet,  but this is a good start.  This also has a pleasant taste.  Some of the baby food is just bland and boring,  but this one is alright.  Not the best but still alright. Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems.  Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in,  and need to retrain your stomach and intestines.  Just be careful,  some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />By the way,  this doesn't have all the nutrients you would need to survive.  As a adult you'd need about 12-16 small jars a day and you'd need to make sure you get enough protein.  So be careful,  this is only a temporary fix for people with ulcers and GERD.

We go through peas so much in my house with my child and this is the only way we are going to buy them from now on. The box is very compact and I just remove the top and leave stored them right in the box. It saves a ton of room in the kitchen, rather than having them tipping over in the cupboard.<br /><br />One surprising thing we also discovered is that our cat who has a low appetite loves this simple pea baby food too. It has been healthy for my baby and a real treat for my pet. Good stuff.

review/summary: Good, Smooth Coffee - Make Sure You Check the Pricing per Cup!
review/text: This is a great tasting coffee - just so you'll know what I usually drink for a "taste" comparison, I've usually drink the Donut Shop coffee and Emeril's Big Easy Bold.  This one has a taste somewhere in-between, and is nice and smooth.  No bad after taste that lingers long after you've had your cup.  I actually like this version of Folgers vs. the Black Silk KCup you can also purchase here on Amazon.<br /><br />One thing to look out for on these, and all KCup coffee sold here on Amazon, is to carefully check the cost per cup by taking the total price and dividing by the number of cups you get.  The pricing for this variety seems to be fairly dynamic, and many times the large packages like this 80-count package may cost more per cup than the ones with a smaller number of servings.  Then, the next time you're ready to order, the pricing for all has changed and you're going through the math again.

review/text: After setting up our office <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSMPO">Keurig B60 Special Edition Brewing System</a> machine, our little band of misfits had to decide on what K-cups to purchase.  Yea, by reading my previous post on our "coffee club" you just knew that this was not going to be an easy matter and would take an act of congress to accomplish a joint decision.  So, we were each tasked with going to the store and picking up "your own dang cups".  Keep it in your "dang" desk draw and only share it if you could keep your "dang" opinions to yourself and not insult another man's "dang" coffee.<br /><br />Really, I do work with a unique group.<br /><br />I am a Folger's girl and was thrilled that I could find my own "dang" coffee and can now brew it any "dang" way I wish without having to "dang" well put up with another man's opinion.<br /><br />Folgers Lively Colombian is the perfect flavor for me.  Smooth, strong, full-bodied cup that is a perfect start to a day filled with overly opinionated people that just do not know what a good cup of "dang" coffee is.

Note:  This is personal preference, not the fault of Folgers.  I have dropped the size of the brew on my Keurig and it has helped considerably.  Unfortunately, I often forget to do that at 6:00 am in the morning - not terrible coherent without that first, fresh cup !!!<br /><br />If you like a milder blend, try this.

If you want coffee that is comparable to MacDonald coffee this is the closest I have found in the K-cup.

review/text: First of all: I agree with the other reviewers, way to expensive here on Amazon. You can save at least $10.00 if you pick it up a your local Sams Club, that is where I got mine. Sad to say since Amazon makes it so convenient.<br />With that out of the way ....Lively Colombian by Folgers should be categorized as a medium-dark roast to me. Not everyone has the same taste buds but I found it to be a wee-bit on the bitter side, even at the largest cup. Would I buy this again: yes! I don't mind it being a wee-bit bitter but in my opinion Colombian coffee should be bold & smooth tasting not bold & bitter. I know Diedrich Colombia coffee has that bold & smooth taste I prefer; there must be something in the word "Lively" that Folgers put on this box to indicate that it may be bitter. Like I said: not everyone has the same taste buds so if you are the least bit hesitant about the word "bitter" I typed here, I would suggest you get this k-cup in a variety pack first instead of buying this 80 count then regretting it later.
