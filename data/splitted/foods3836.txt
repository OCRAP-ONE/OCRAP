review/summary: Love it!
review/text: We have a trolley style popcorn maker and used popcorn oil and popcorn bought at the grocery store at first. We had many unpopped kernels and the taste was only okay.<br /><br />Then I ordered a case of Great Northern Popcorn 8-Ounce Portion Packs. This popcorn is great! We love the taste even three days after popping on the occasion when it lasts that long. We just followed the instructions on the package and all is well.<br /><br />I was a little concerned when I first noticed the oil was in a soft, but solid state. It melts quickly though. The only complaint I have is that it is a little difficult to pour it all in at once, but this is due to the layout of my popcorn popper.<br /><br />We have had friends over for football parties and they have requested more popcorn.

review/summary: Easiest Popcorn for a Crowd!
review/text: I work at the public library and we have family movie programs on a regular basis. There could be anywhere from 10 to 60 people watching the movie and I need to have the popcorn ready at a steady pace. We have one of the big popcorn machines on a cart and use Great Northern Popcorn's 8 ounce packs. The popcorn tastes great and the packaging is perfect for our needs.

review/summary: Best popcorn, best price by subscription
review/text: I ordered this initially just to try something less expensive than the whirly pop brands. I was really glad I did and I will continue to buy it. Everyone loves it and it is the perfect thing for the whirly pop popper. Buying it on subscription is the best way to go - decreases the price and eliminates shipping charges. This is a keeper.

review/summary: Really Great Popcorn!
review/text: We have a Princeton Popper which we bought from this same company, and have owned for close to a year.<br />They are really great people giving excellent customer support, standing behind their products.<br />With that said, this popcorn is really, really great, and you don't have to have a "popcorn machine" to use it. You can cook it on the stove in a big tall pot like you would use for sweet corn. My only suggestion is not to put the lid on the pot but to put a mesh splatter screen over it. This will permit the vapor to escape keeping the popcorn light and fluffy and not moist.<br />This popcorn is so good you don't need to add butter either. It's fine just the way it is which is better for our health too. I have two family members that have bought Princeton machines and this popcorn because they liked ours so much, and any time friends come over for a movie or just to visit, they always ask if I would make popcorn.<br />The 8 oz. cases shipped free through Amazon really don't cost any more per oz. than you'd pay for Orville microwave in a grocery store and is hundered fold better. Ever eat left-over microwave popcorn the next day?....Yuk, it's disgusting. And you're not suppose to breath the vapor when you first open the bag fresh out of the microwave, and you want to eat that stuff? Great Northern still tastes fresh and good for days if you bag it up. After your first bag of Great Northern you'll wonder why on Earth you ever keep eating that junk from the grocery store.

review/text: If you have been looking for the "REAL" theater popcorn flavor, you found it!<br /><br />Very good popcorn. If you use all of the package's ingredients, you might end up with popcorn on the salty side, but that can be adjusted by not using the whole content of the salt package.<br /><br />I have several people tasted this popcorn and they all agree that it tastes like movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I definitively recommend this popcorn.

review/summary: Nice flavor - but extremely salty.
review/text: I purchased the 2.5 bags for my  new Whirley Pop pan. I like the idea of the oil on one side and the popcorn on the other, very much like I remember the old TV Time popcorn from when I was a kid. I popped up the first bag, but I found there was way too much salt for me. The next batch, I clipped a small corner of the popcorn side off and removed most of the salt. Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt/seasoning is too much for you - it was very easy to remove. I found that the 2.5 size was perfect for one, maybe two people, but truthfully, I can eat all of it by myself while watching a movie.

review/summary: So fresh!!
review/text: My dog just decided one day she didn't want to eat the expensive premium food I had been feeding her.  I had already been buying Three Dog Bakery treats for her (which she LOVES!!)and so after exhausting every other idea trying to get her to eat her food, I picked up a few of these.  I mixed a little in with her dry food and she scarfed it right down and begged for more!! I decided to switch to their dry food as well and my dog couldn't be happier.  She enjoys her meal time so much more, when before she would actually crawl off and hide.  She is a spoiled little Jack Russell Terrier, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

review/summary: Kids Loved Them!
review/text: My dentist recommended this product for the children to use after school lunches and other times when brushing is not a option. My kids really enjoyed the flavor. Just pop two in their lunch boxes and they are good to go. The only warning given by our dentist was to use moderation (avoid adding extra sugar of any kind). If I had given the kids the box, they wouldn't have made the day.

review/summary: Delicious, but fragiles and NOT tooth-friendly
review/text: This product has citric acid as the second ingredient. Talk to any dentist about the damage citric acid can do to soften enamel and you will see why this product is NOT tooth-friendly as the company advertises. Yes, it's tasty, tastier than any other sugar-free candy out there, but the citric acid completely counteracts any benefit provided by the xylitol.  It's not a great idea to bathe your teeth in citric acid, and you can verify this by asking a dentist what happens if you suck on lemons too much.  The company needs to make a version that is NOT sour or just doesn't have citric acid in it.  Also, the other reviewers are right. 90% of the time, the containers arrive with mostly powder, not solid candy inside.

review/text: These candies have a great flavor, but they don't last very long.  They look like SweetTarts, only they're not as well compressed as SweetTarts are.  If you carry them around in your pocket, you'll probably have a lot of powder left in the tin when you eat the last one.  I'm still looking for a really good sugar-free candy without artificial sweeteners.  This one is close, but I think I'll keep looking.

review/text: I have been buying this for some time and a few cans<br />were dented.  The last shipment (which will be my<br />last shipment) was really bad.  Out of the 24 cans I would only use 7 cans.  Since these are overwrapped in<br />packs of six, the damage must have happened before the overwrapping was done, since there is no way the dents<br />and crushed cans could have happened during shipping. When I was buying this dog food at the supermarket there would be dented cans on the shelf, but I didn't have to buy them. I didn't expect cans to be so badly damaged when they were being shipped direct from factory.

It doesn't smell when you open the can, and the dense stuff can easily be mixed with gravy or other savory flavorings that the dogs will enjoy.<br /><br />Amazon ships this case using brown wrapping paper as packaging.  I haven't had any issues with dent or damaged cans.<br /><br />However, the price of this has gone through the roof in the year I've subscribed to it, at the tune of over ten dollars a case.  That is insane!  I can now buy this cheaper at pet food stores.  I cancelled the subscription and immediately was notified that this subscription is ineligible for reactivation.  That's a first!

The grapefruit is a very nice change from more common orange or lime marmalades.  It's finely shredded, and the consistency is a soft gel, not an unnaturally rubbery texture like products made with corn syrup and gobs of artificial gelling agents.  This is as close to homemade as you can get.

So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (1.5)- Adding the sweetener (.5 pkg of truvia) usually makes flavors stick out, and until I added the sweetener I didn't detect anything other than just black tea.<br />++Iced (2) -  So Iced with sweetener is the only way I find this tea to be enjoyable.<br /><br />2nd Steep (2) it maintains its flavor through a second steep but I'm still not impressed.<br /><br />Summary -  I really wanted to like this tea but it just didn't do it for me. The tea was very weak, perhaps I will try to double the strength in a few days and update my rating. to me it just tastes very bland.<br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) "steep" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain Lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea).<br /><br />*** I have spoken with the seller who has assured me the tea is not old. You cant make everyone happy flavor wise and this was just not for my palette, I have a feeling it may be due to tea having no sweetener added and I prefer a sweetness to my tea. I am very pleased with the professionalism of the seller  and I will be giving them the full rating.

review/summary: Sweet Leather for your dog
review/text: I was not impressed about this product (Made in China). Cheaply made and not very good quality. Outside was coated with redish brown sweet something which stained the carpet.  My dog first tried to lick the coating and then bit the "bone".  It was like hard leather, more than bone, and left a mess of shreds about as well.

He chews all the chicken off first, which I think helps keep his teeth clean, and then goes to work on the rawhide.<br /><br />GREAT product, but the packaging wasn't too great. The bones were falling out when I got them... a little concerning.

review/summary: Your GI tract will thank you.
review/text: I'll recommend Grape-Nuts whole-heartedly to anyone who needs a high fiber punch in a low-volume solution. This cereal is dense and probably should not be consumed in large volumes at a sitting. There is a LOT of fiber and iron in it.  Other than that, it would be the perfect breakfast cereal. Unlike other high-fiber solutions, Grape-Nuts is versatile.  You can eat it cold with milk or heat it up in the microwave with said milk and enjoy a tastier alternative to oatmeal. You can sprinkle it on yogurt for a texture explosion in your mouth. I've even made bran muffins with them, and they are delicious.

review/summary: I ate 2 cups of Grape-nuts today
review/text: I ate 2 cups of Grape-nuts this morning, on a bet that i couldnt, while wearing a St. Patricks day hat and fake beard.  My stretch goal was 10 minutes, though it took better than 20, and i was sabotaged by Dave who added more when i went to get water.  Realizing after the fact that this many Grape-nuts was representative of about 120% of my daily fiber and 360% Iron, not to mention 800 net calories or so pre-milk, i became slightly worried and have been slugging down water ever since.  I havent eaten Grape-nuts in a while, and must say, despite the extreme circumstances, i really enjoyed them, and will eat them again tomorrow assuming im hungry then.  They were tasty, slightly sweet, and not in need of any additives to enjoy.  Highly recommended.

review/text: Grape Nuts is the only cereal i have found (and believe me, i've searched) that contains NO sugar and yet tastes delicious. Oatmeal's pretty close but it takes preparation and needs at least a little butter and some added honey or maple syrup to be that good. But not Grape Nuts. I love them with just milk. They are beyond delicious and i love them i love them i love them. Sometimes, i even eat them for lunch, too. They satisfy my appetite and make me feel great. Look up their history on Wikipedia, it's interesting. YAY!!! for Grape Nuts. I hope they never become unavailable.

review/summary: No grapes or nuts, but 100% delicious compact nutrition
review/text: Grape-Nuts are one of the oldest ready-to-eat packaged cereals still on the market today. Introduced in 1898, Grape-Nuts followed the first breakfast cereal (Granula) by a few decades, but stuck around much longer. They pre-date Kellogg's Corn Flakes by nearly a decade. Like Kellogg's early cereals, Grape-Nuts were initially marketed as a natural health food. Made from wheat and barley, without added sugar, they still pack a great deal of nutrition into a compact space. Each half-cup serving of Grape-Nuts contains 33 grams of whole grain, 48 grams of carbohydrates, 6 grams of protein and 7 grams of dietary fiber. They're low fat (1 gram per serving) and contain no trans fats.<br /><br />Grape-Nuts have a sweet, nutty wheat flavor and are very crunchy; too crunchy for some cereal eaters. The nuggets are small and soften slightly in milk. Those who prefer softer cereal can make hot grape nuts by adding a third-cup milk and microwaving the mix for 30-60 seconds. More time produces a softer result. Those who like something sweeter than the natural 4 grams of sugar per serving can add raisins, chopped fruit, a teaspoon or two of sugar, or sweetened soy milk. Their compactness also makes them a good pick for travel rations or backpacking, and a full serving is quite a bit smaller than for a typical flaked cereal.<br /><br />Grape-Nuts are great for breakfast, an afternoon snack or a treat before bed, and you can sprinkle them on yogurt to add some crunch! Recipes for Grape-Nuts bread, bars, pudding, muffins, tabbouleh salad and many other items can be found on Post's Grape-Nuts website and elsewhere on the Internet. [�2010 hyperbolium dot com]

review/text: Couldn't pass up the deal (five 64-oz boxes for $18.36 including shipping) on my favorite cereal. Eight days from order placement to arrival on my doorstep, about half an hour ago. Expiration date is almost 7 months out. With one box destined for my in-laws, and another for a brother-in-law, I figure we can easily eat our way through the remaining three boxes before their expiration date (and I've already started that process).

review/summary: Good deal, good for you
review/text: I bought this 4-pack at about $12 or roughly $3/box.  If I've got a coupon and they're on sale at the local store, I can beat that price, but having them sent to my door "sweetened" the deal.<br /><br />I'm a border-line vegetarian and since I rarely eat meat, don't have that traditional source of iron in my diet.  Whole grain foods, like Grape nuts, help make up the deficiency, in this case a half cup providing 90% of the RDA of iron.  The fiber is also noteworthy, with a half cup providing 7g or 28% of the RDA, as is Folic Acid with 50% RDA.  A healthy list of other Minerals and Vitamins are represented in lesser quantities.<br /><br />This cereal is hearty, dense, crunchy, and tastes "healthy".  I'm not going to lie and say it's delicious or anything like that!  It'll give your teeth a workout. I like to throw on raisins or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YR7A9Q">Bob's Red Mill Shredded Coconut Unsweetened, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> to make it a little more palatable.  Sometimes I grind it in the coffee grinder and add to baked goods I make for additional nutrients.<br /><br />The Sodium is higher than I'd like at 290 mg per half cup (with milk 15% RDA), but the sugar is low at 5g per serving.  Ingredients: Whole grain wheat flour, malted barley flour, salt, dried yeast.<br /><br />The 4-pack arrived undamaged and the expiration date was just under a year away. If the price stays the same, I'd buy more in the future.

review/summary: A BIG fan here  (low fat, tasty, very filling, excellent price/oz ratio, 1 yr future expiy date)d)
review/text: My title says it all.  I began appreciating this the older I got and the less enthusiastic I've become towards chemically-flavored or too sweetly flavored cereals (it has a nice, malty flavor to it, as well).  Yes, you do need decent teeth if you're eating this cold with milk (it sounds like you're chewing gravel), but like others noted, this can also replace hot cereal, since it's so easy to put this in the microwave with no-fat milk or almond milk.....it modifies into a really satisfying, soft and chewy oatmeal. You can also add a little bit of it to other less substantial cereals to make them more filling.<br /><br />And although it doesn't look like much in the bowl, about a third of a cup goes a long way. It's VERY dense and therefore very filling......each tiny box weighs a lb and a half, and that's not sugar weighing it down, either.  It's like the black hole of grain cereals ;-)<br /><br />This is close to $5.00/box in NYC, so using Subscribe and Save and having this delivered to my door makes this is a great deal.  AND it had an expiry date a year into the future, so no stale cereal here. Great job, Amazon.

Like most packaged mixes, it is a bit salty; you probably should be cautious if you are on a low sodium diet.

You'll notice the difference even before tasting! Pasta sauces are full of chunks of tomato, not just puree, as some of the cheaper brands use. The Tomato Basil sauce is full of fresh basil leaves and garlic chunks. There are no fillers, artificial ingredients or preservatives. These sauces are available in most NY supermarkets, but it's nice to see them on Amazon so that people living in other parts of the country can enjoy them.<br />Since discovering Victoria brand sauces, I have not used any other brand. There line is far superior to most others!

review/summary: Wonderful food
review/text: Our Frenchie LOVES this food.  She still wolfs it down enthusiastically even though she's been on it for several months now.  Her coat is shiny, she's energetic, and her bowel movements are solid (gross, but necessary information!).  Our 25 lbs girl eats 1.5-2 cups per day (depending on activity level) and her weight looks good.  Shop around for the best price.

review/summary: my maltipoo loves this.
review/text: I had rescued a Maltipoo at 7 weeks old. This puppy was a hot mess. I was not prepared for puppy and Fromm is not sold where I live. So, I bought Blue Buffolo puppy food. The dog was not eating and and the vet and I were doing all kinds of things to get her to eat.<br /><br />I already feed Fromm to all my other fur family so when I got home that night from buying supplies and picking her up at the vet. I ordered Fromm puppy.<br /><br />She loves it! I am confident that she will be a happy and healthy dog and this will be partially due to her steady diet of Fromm.<br /><br />No. I do not have any affiliation to this company. I do see the results of what their good food has on my pets.<br /><br />I also like it is an American company that is actually making it's food in America and not outsourcing to other countries like China.

review/summary: Terrific Puppy Food!
review/text: This is by far the best puppy food I've tried for my family's 9 month old goldendoodle.  She had some stomach issues (diarrhea and gas) when we first brought her home and transitioned her from the mail order food she ate from the breeder.  We tried numerous formulas and eventually moved to grain-free food (also by Fromm) which corrected her issues.<br /><br />She does not require grain-free food however which is more expensive than regular puppy foods so I started looking for an alternative once her digestion became balanced and regular.  This is the first food we tried at that point and no looking back!  Our pup is healthy, has tons of energy, soft, supple fur, and no more digestion issues.  On top of this, she loves her food and never leaves a piece behind!  We will switch to the adult formula in time for her upcoming 1st birthday!<br /><br />I just happened to find the Fromm line in my locally owned pet store and then did some research before buying it; I personally love that there are so many recipes made by Fromm so if I'm looking for variety I do not have to switch brands.  Also the products are made in the USA with healthy ingredients, which is important to me considering so many pet product issues that have been found in imported foods.  I do not work for Fromm and I'm not affiliated with the company but I am super grateful that we found an affordable puppy food that keeps my puppy healthy and satisfied.  Thank you for this quality item!

Alas, the produce that arrived had passed it Best By date by two months!  What a disappointment.  I guess I'm better off paying full price for a fresh product.

review/summary: 1 out of 8 did not like these
review/text: I've purchased 4 boxes of Bobo's Oat Bars in the Chocolate variety from Amazon in the past month.  An acquaintance had told me how delicious they were, so I took a chance and purchased my first box before I embarked on a trip, planning to take some along for the journey.  Unfortunately for my wallet, every person but one to whom I gave a bar loved these, so I sent some a box to enjoy.  Prior to my first purchase, I did not realize these are soft, sort of brownie like in texture, a little sweet in a molasses sort of way (no molasses in the recipe, though), crumbly, and with two servings in a single bar.  Fortunately, I placed a bar in a small resealable plastic bag for the airplane trip, so I was able to break off a little piece any time I felt hungry.  That bag was a saving grace because when a bar was gone, I replaced it with another and you won't believe how often I pulled out that little bag.  I ordered the first box as a gift after I put a little bite into my father's mouth while he was busy enjoying himself at a slot machine and I realized that he needed to keep these on hand for him and Mom to have on the days they go out.  For those who have few teeth, these are edible because of the soft texture, yet they provide an enjoyable flavor.  Hiker's took these along for a day trip, not worrying about the double serving per package, happily eating the entire bar.  As they put it, they felt like they had a brownie along for the trek, much more enjoyable than other bars they'd taken in the past.  One sister has enjoyed these on days when she's been unable to break for lunch at work, having them with coffee or tea and some deep breaths.  Without eggs, butter or flour, they are terrific, even though Earth Balance has never been my favorite flavor.  I'll admit that I was expecting a firmer bar with visible chocolate chips, but after the surprise of a crumbly moist baked good with a not very sweet cocoa flavor, I was hooked.  I will gladly try the other varieties when I can find them for a lower cost than over two dollars per bar.  A retail value of about thirty dollars is too high for a dozen bars, so I've deducted a star from this review.  The one friend who did not love her Bobo's Oat Bar thought it tasted like cardboard and she claimed to have forced it down at work.  She loves the SOYJOY bars which I do not care for, so I guess the world is balanced.

review/summary: It's a mystery (with just a hint of flim-flam)
review/text: "... organic dark chocolate chips (organic sugar, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin added as an emulsifier, organic vanilla) ..." - from the ingredients list, BOBO'S OAT BARS, CHOCOLATE<br /><br />Several weeks ago, I reviewed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGW714">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Banana, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>, to which I awarded four stars based on its excellent oat flavor and "mouth feel." However, it suffered the loss of a fifth star because "the ostensible banana taste was so subtle as to be virtually non-existent."<br /><br />Because I love chocolate, I decided to give Bobo another shot with the chocolate version of her oat snack.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is on the bar's ingredients list - as chips, no less. Buts it's a complete mystery to me where the essence of chocolate is lurking. Moreover, there isn't a chocolate chip in sight; I pulled the bar apart and examined it carefully. Granted, the bar has a darker shade of color than the other ones of the brand I've tried, so that at least implies chocolate is present. And, there's a faint nuance of some other flavor underlying the taste of oats, but, if anything, it's suggestive of molasses.<br /><br />Mind you, I truly like these bars for the reasons previously stated. And I'll be sure to enjoy the remaining eleven of the dozen "chocolate" ones I purchased. But, as near as I can determine to date with the three types I've eaten, to claim there's any flavor present other than that of oats is a complete fiction and I've had to resist the impulse to award three stars or less for blatantly false advertising.

review/summary: This is NOT smoked salt!
review/text: This salt is NOT smoked. Read that again. It is a 2 pound bag of white salt that has a fake hickory smell. It is small crystals, about the size of table salt crystals. My guess is that they tried to infuse flavor into the salt rather than smoking it. The hickory flavor is very faint, and very fake tasting. You are much better off buying real smoked salt, such as Gourmet Hickory Smoked Sea Salt by The Spice Lab Inc. I am not in any way affiliated with The Spice Lab - I bought their salt simultaneously with Faerie's Finest in order to compare the two. Not only is it inferior to The Spice Lab, but Faerie's Finest is the worst smoked salt I have tasted.

review/text: This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5") and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy. I will be purchasing other blends in the future to also try.

review/summary: Mild/Hot Italian Sausage seasoning
review/text: We followed the directions closely for a 10 lb. mix of 1/2 venison and 1/2 pork. (We did mix the seasoning directly into the meat, then added a bit of water.) We then let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  We fried some patties up the next morning to taste test.<br /><br />The pepper seasoning came through, not excessively so, but it did linger a bit.  I have been known to like things hot (although my tastes have mellowed with age) and I would rate this between mild and medium.  I have tasted commercially prepared breakfast sausage that tasted hotter.  It definitely makes this a great sausage for using in spaghetti and other italian dishes.  By itself, the sausage is very flavorable.  We plan to pack 1/2 into casings and bulk store the rest for cooking Italian dishes.<br /><br />I do agree with one reviewer, it is a bit salty tasting and could be toned down a bit.  But, it is within the limits for a spicy sausage and will be fine used in other Italian recipes, IMHO.<br /><br />I would buy this again, but back off of the amount to mix into the meat (due to the salt) and add other Italian seasonings.

review/summary: A product of nature so expect...
review/text: some differences in every can. The taste is excellent. The crunchiness is very good and firm. Very addicting flavor and nuttiness. Only caveat is some cans will have lots of wholes some less as after all this is a product of nature and man can only do so much. Overall, very good peanuts and excellent price at Amazon.

review/summary: Poor customer service
review/text: I would agree with the other poor ratings on service for Royal Oak - very poor customer service from Royal Oak. We ordered, this year, the exact same product as last year. When it arrived, the nuts were not the same product, and they would not refund or pay shipping for the return. Also, they only operate the few weeks that peanuts are 'in season.' Otherwise, emails and phone calls are not even acknowledged.

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT!!!
review/text: I have psoriasis and was looking into things that help. This is a perfect product. Electrolytes calcium chloride, magnesium chloride and potassium bicarbonate (NOT SODIUM BICARBONATE!!!) Really helpful with inflamatory issues. I drink it and use topically for a skin soak. GREAT PRODUCT!!! I was looking for the pH online and there seems to be some misinformation or old information. I tested the pH of the product Glaceau Smart Water and what I've got is just under 7 pH around 6.8-6.9 pH. So good pH near neutral. If you have psoriasis or any inflamatory issues please do a web search on magnesium bicarbonate The Ultimate Mitochondrial Cocktail! You'll be giving this water a try! Good taste as well.

review/text: I can be picky about what water I drink and Smart Water happens to be one brand that I really enjoy. This price is pretty good for what you get.
