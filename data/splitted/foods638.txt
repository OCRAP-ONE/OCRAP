review/text: This ginger beer is really good. It is not as aromatic as some of the others which is one of the reasons I like it. I usually buy it for about a dollar a piece at the local grocery store. Can't beat that anywhere.

review/summary: Overrated, Overpriced
review/text: Reed's is probably the most well known brand of premium ginger beer on the market, but it is a mediocre beverage by itself and as a mixer. Even the Extra Ginger doesn't pack much of a ginger punch. I would give it 1 star, but it's better than Canada Dry and uses doesn't use HFCS. I prefer Natural Brew Outrageous Ginger Ale for drinking by itself or as a mixer and Gosling's as a mixer only, although Gosling's contains HFCS.

review/text: While certainly not as awful as Ginger People's ginger beer, I don't recommend it.  I love a good ginger beer, and this is all that my local grocery store carries and I still won't buy it.  To be fair, there are different styles of ginger beer and taste IS subjective.  But I can't help but feeling that something like Cock and Bull or Barritts is MUCH better and more "authentic".  (Although they are not nearly as natural.)

review/summary: Worse than regular beer!
review/text: I have been searching for a good ginger beer, trying to find something that might compare to Bundaberg Ginger Beer, and was EXTREMELY disappointed with Reed's.  I was looking for that sweet gingery flavor, with a nice strong bite, and found Reed's to be nothing more than a bland drink with a lingering burn, NOT a bite, that resembled heartburn more than the gingery spice blast of a decent ginger beer.  Reed's was rubbery tasting, and tastes similar to a cheap non-alcoholic beer.  I literally couldn't finish my first bottle.  I pride myself on being able to eat and drink just about anything... so to be unable to finish this drink says a lot.  Oh Bundaberg, why aren't you sold in US grocery stores???

review/text: We found these wonderful treats in Scotland a few years back. Since they're 95% dried fish, our terriers went nuts for them. (The tiddler size is perfect for smaller dogs.)

review/text: I have had cats for over 50 years, and this is the best litter I've ever used.  I currently have three cats (including one 20-lb guy who can urinate till the cows come home) and find this litter absolutely wonderful in controlling odor. I have switched litter brands over the years every time something "better" comes along.  Now I just pray that this one will never go away.  I've been using it for about a year and am thankful I was convinced by some of the online reviews to give it a try.  Best decision I ever made where cats are concerned.

When my<br />friends come over to my house, they always tell me that you can't tell that I even have cats.  There is no cat litter box odors lingering in the air.  One of my friends said that her sister has a cat and you could always get a strong scent of the cat litter box when you would walk into her house.  My friend asked me what cat litter I used so she could share with her sister.  I told her it was scoop away plus crystals and that it was the best stuff.  She shared the information with her sister.  Her sister started using scoop away and she was so pleased that she uses nothing but scoop away.  I know my cats love it and so do I.  It clumps well and it has a nice fresh clean scent.  You won't be sorry if you switch over from you present litter to scoop away.  It's the best.

Very glad that Amazon is now carrying it with $0 shipping after $25 spend.  The crystals absorb all the odors.  I have tried other blends of Scoop Away including multicat and fresh scent as well as Arm & Hammer and this one is superior by far. I wouldn't use anything else!

review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best "bang for the buck" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/summary: Very Good...Not the Best
review/text: These salted Season kipper snacks are almost as good as the non-salted, but not as good. There's no saltiness that gets in the way of the herring flavor, but somehow the full herring flavor doesn't come through the way it does with the non-salted version. Of course, if you prefer salted herring, this would be the best for you, although the salt certainly does not dominate. For me, I hardly notice it. That may be good or bad for you. But ordering this by the case from Amazon costs less and is more convenient than buying it at the grocery store if you use a lot of it--and with all of the omega 3's in this, you should use it a lot. A painless way of getting a lot of omega 3's.

review/text: We tried to get kippers on subscribe-and-save, but reviewers on the products we looked at mentioned that the pull ring frequently broke off the can, making it impossible to open without a separate can opener.  Not what we wanted!!<br /><br />So we tried these -- which are a win!!  My husband loves them.  He says the taste is excellent, and the price is terrific, too, because there are 24 per case -- 6 more than other brands, he says.  And he has had no problem whatever opening the cans, which was what motivated us to try these in the first place.<br /><br />Motto:  subscribe and save is fabulous, but sometimes something not on subscribe and save is even better!  :)  And many, many thanks to reviewers of the other products who alerted us to the problem opening those cans.

review/summary: A Happy Dog is a Green Dog
review/text: My wife and I share our home with the Three Muske-Terriers: A male Westie, a male Cesky and, the Empress-of-All-She-Surveys, a female Scotty. The Empress is alergic to wheat, (along with corn and soy), so I had my doubts concerning Pet Greens Roasted Chicken Recipe w/ Wheat Grass Dog Treats - wheat grass after all is just "juvenile" wheat. But apparently not to worry! We're half way through our first bag and no allergic reaction, (you haven't lived until you've seen a crazed Scotty in the middle of an allergic frenzy chewing on her tootsies). Now, putting aside her allergies, the Empress will eat almost anything - and so will the Cesky. But the Westie gives new meaning to the term "finicky" - and Asta gives these treats five barks - I mean, stars. So what's up here?<br /><br />The treats are mostly roasted chicken meal, supplemented with dried chicory extract, organic ground wheat grass powder, lecithin, salt, cultured whey and garlic, preserved with "mixed tocopherols," (I'm not a chemist, but I think that's a fancy name for vitamin E, sourced from vegetable oil). The wheat grass doesn't contain any wheat glutten - which I think is the reason it doesn't trigger the Empress' allergies. Wheat grass is an excellent source of any and all of the nutrients contained in fresh vegetables.<br /><br />The treats are small "jerky-like" rectangles - no more than an inch by 3/4s of an inch, and maybe 1/16 of an inch thick, (they may be more appropriate for small to medium size dogs - a large dog would want three or four at a time). They're great for a quick reward and at only about 4 calories a piece, there's not much danger that your dog is going to put on unwanted pounds, (however I wouldn't suggest that you carry them loose in your pocket or purse - they smell strongly of garlic - I keep 'em in a zip lock baggie).<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the ingrediants are all natural, but only the wheat grass is organic - if you are interested in organic treats, I suggest that you check out those made by Wagatha or Robbie Dawg.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I think that Pet Greens offers both a change of flavor and a change in texture from most common dog treats. The Three Muske-Terriers are scarfing 'em down - your furry buddy probably will too.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Very happy with this powder. I sue it when I want to add richness to soups, stocks, stews, whatever. A little bit adds a subtle amount of umami and richness (not necessarily identifiable by most as mushroom flavor), and if you use more the mushroom flavor is more pronounced. It doesn't take much to really enhance whatever you put it in.

review/summary: Spicy and delicious!!
review/text: This sauce has a great Mexican taste beyond its peppery fire, and the bold color, even though created by dyes, is just plain fun to look at. The splash of red on fresh veggies, lettuce, and other dishes is a treat for the eye as well as the palette. A little salty and acidic, its bright flavor goes great with finished Mexican dishes if you want to kick them up, as well as in soups, beans, chili, and added to salsa when you think it needs a little heat. This sauce is not incredibly hot as some are (the kind that work better as dares, really, or can only be taken in a very diluted form), but it's not for the babies either.<br /><br />It's just right for most people, who like some spice, and putting it on the table lets you make milder dishes, and let the individual diners decide how spicy they want it; likewise, it helps you make those Mexican dishes spicier and tastier if you want to cook with the sauce. The price is great--just over a dollar per bottle, but the large quantity works better for restaurants than individual use.

review/summary: Best Yet for Gluten Free Bread
review/text: I have tried many recipes for gluten free bread. Most of these recipes claim to be the "best I have ever tasted," or "Can't tell from regular bread." Nonsense! Soggy, dry, crumbly, tasteless, or weird tasting is more like it. One recipe from Australia turned purple!. So, I didn't have high expectations for my latest recipe made with white bean flour. Surprise! The gluten free bread made with the white bean flour is my most successful bread so far. No one would mistake it for regular bread, but it is light, toasts well, and doesn't crumble. I will be ordering more white bean flour.

review/text: My dog loved this food and I set up a subscription for it.  After two bags, I can tell significant weight gain.  My dog is a large bully breed mix of some unknown variety!  He is not a very active dog and I do need to watch his weight as he gains easily.  This food also made him gassy, which is unusual for him.  I love the convenience of the subscription service - and he loves this food (but he loves food period).  So back to lugging home bags of Science Diet Weight Management!  He is less gassy on that and it definitely controls his weight.

review/summary: Dogs Inhale this Food.  Great Ingredients.  Great Results.  Highly Recommended.
review/text: After switching my cats from Iams to Castor & Pollux, we decided that it was the dog's turn.  Our big dogs (100lbs & 110lbs) had been eating Iams large breed for about 3 years.  Even though Iams is considered a premium food, our concerns were:<br /><br />(1)  the second ingredient is corn meal and one of the proteins is chicken by-product meal (Chicken by-product meal consists of the ground, rendered, clean parts of the carcass of slaughtered chicken, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs and intestines, exclusive of feathers, except in such amounts as might occur unavoidable in good processing practice);<br />(2) Our dogs were putting on weight despite the fact that they are active, high energy dogs; and<br />(3) An  olfactory-related concern - when resting, the dogs passed gas - a lot of gas!<br /><br />The gas got us.  Even though Castor & Pollux is a more expensive dog food, we decided that it was worth a try.  Forty-five pounds of dog food later, I'm happy that we switched because the dogs love the food, their coats are healthy, they are active and seem to be slimming down, and, best of all, the gas issue is no longer an issue.<br /><br />Since this information isn't listed on the Amazon product page, and since ingredients are a main consideration when purchasing pet food, Castor& Pollux Large Breed ingredients are (from the back of the bag):<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brewers Rice, Ground Whole Grain Barley, Oat Groats, Turkey Meal, Chicken Fat Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), Dried Carrots, Dried Bananas, Dried Apples, Fish Meal, Dried Egg Product, Brewers Dried Yeast, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ground Flaxseed, Cultured Whey, Monocalcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Salt, Chicken Cartilage, Dried Papayas, Dried Blueberries, Vitamin E Supplement, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Oxide, Choline Chloride, Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, L-Carnitine, Niacin, Copper Sulfate, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganous Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Vitamin K1 Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (source of Vitamin B6), Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Folic Acid, Cobalt Caronate, Yeast Culture (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae), Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longibrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract and Fermentation Solubles.<br />Each bag has a Best if Used by Date, and comes with an Unconditional Guarantee from the manufacturer.<br /><br />Our final decision is to stick with this food.  Our dogs love it & we love the results.  Highly Recommended.

We switched him from Eagle Pack Large Breed to Castor & Pollux due to the availability of Eagle Pack in our geographic location and price.  After eight months on this feed, I have no negative feedback on the product.  Otis's elephant-sized poos are firm and he loves the stuff (I suspect he'd eat just about anything though). His hair coat is shinny and energy level is sufficient.<br />*Otis approved review*<br />JB

review/text: This dog food's ingredient list definitely makes you feel better feeding it to your dog, but I do notice ours are really gassy after eating it.  Not sure why that is.  They have been eating it for months, so it isn't just the transition to new food.  Maybe all the veggies?  I also notice that they do not digest the carrot pieces at all.  But a natural food is way better than what they used to eat, so we are sticking with it for now.

review/text: Chicken meal can be those cute little chicks that would have grown to be roosters. (Excess at the hatchery so the little buggers get ground up -often alive- for animal food). It is not those guys then it is poultry processing byproducts and not something I want for my pup. It smelled delicious - very wholesome. Didn't smell like dog food usually smells when you buy something from local petshop. Also price went up when I ordered it via a subscription.

review/summary: Too much oil, but not as bad as the Barry Wasabi Peas
review/text: Like the same vendor's Wasabi peas, these peas are use Yellow 5 and Blue 1 dyes to color them. That is a needless addition which no one needs. They also fry these with what they term 'vegetable oil' which according to their package adds about 1.5g of fat per 1 oz serving. Their Wasabi peas are said to use Palm Oil and add 3.1g of fat (almost 1g of saturated fat) per 1oz serving, so I wonder what 'vegetable oil' really means for these peas. Other products from this vendor have nutrition information that is completely wrong (like 0% for everything), so I wonder what really goes into these peas. They are salty and crunchy, but it would be nice if they did not have a bunch of dyes in them and there were clarity about what oil and how much really is in them. Fresh wokked English Peas will be a whole lot better for you, if not a convenient snack at the office...

review/summary: Refreshing !
review/text: Most wonderful tea - aroma is out of this world. It is a medium bodied tea which brings in all the health benefits of pure Green tea and naturally imparts fragrance and distinctive flavor of the Jasmine flower. The  triangular mesh bags allows large leaf teas to be used and to brew better. A great refreshing tea after a strong tasting or rich food.<br /><br />Great gift idea for tea lover!

review/summary: Boo, plastic cylinders.  Gatorade loses its enviro-karma.
review/text: Dear Gatorade:<br /><br />Biggest fan of the G2 powder pack!  I have bought hundreds of these boxes in the last 18 months!  Tastes great, less filling!  Boxes stack neatly in the pantry!  No more boxes???  G2 in my store now comes in a slippery plastic cylindrical tube (for more money).  Doesn't stack in the pantry.  Yeah, it's still Gatorade G2 powder, but it's a pain in the posterior.  Packages teeter-totter on the shelf and fall all over the place.  Why do companies like yours screw up a good thing?  Did you feel you needed to make your product look all spacey-agey and better than the other box powders?  Have you tried to put this on your own pantry shelf?  I gave this 2 stars only because it used to be a perfect product.  I've reluctantly moved on to Propel.

review/text: These are dry biscuits that my dog likes a lot. I expected them to be soft; but they are dry like dry dog food. They are easy to crunch for my dog. My dog is about a hundred pounds and these biscuits work good as training treats which are easy to handle and use. My dog likes them; so I'm glad that I bought them. I had used the soft varsions of Natural Balance training treats (chicken and beef ) about a year ago with good results; I had to cut those up into smaller sizes where as these biscuits are at a good size now for immediate use.

review/summary: More for Less
review/text: I bought this product because my daughter had a hard time with all the other formulas except Enfamil Gentlease.  I had to quit breastfeeding due to some medicine I was taking and did not want to pay $50.00 every two weeks for two cans of Enfamil formula.  I had used a formula by the same company with my first daughter (it is the same as the Babies R' Us brand) and knew that the quality was great and dependable.  Also, it had all the same ingredients as Enfamil Gentlease.  So to me it is a matter of do I want to pay around $25.00/ 24oz just so I can have something name brand or do I want to pay $16.00/ 24oz have all the same benefits of Enfamil Gentlease at a much cheaper price...Well, go figure I decided to save money!  I love this formula, it mixes well, she loves the taste, it is nutritionally complete, and with all the things you already have to buy for baby, why not save a little money when every little bit helps.

But after looking at the back and seeing that the second ingredient is sugar I decided this probably isn't the kind of thing I want my baby to get used to. I don't want him to get used to sugary snack foods at such a young age, I'm sure there will be enough of that when he's older. I wish Happy Baby would come up with a yogurt snack with no or very little sugar, I would buy it than.

review/summary: Delicious first baby finger food !
review/text: These are the first snacks and finger foods I ever gave to my daughter. I was so scared of her choking on anything that I thought I would wait till she's 1 or longer... and then I came across HappyMelts Yogurt Melts and I totally felt in love with them. They melt in her mouth quickly and they are delicious. I've tried all 3 of them: Mixed Berry, Strawberry and Banana and I have to tell you they are all different.<br />Mixed Berry - purple, very flat oval shaped, very easy and quick melts, very sweet<br />Strawberry - pink, very hard acorn shaped (like little Hershey kisses), chunkier and melts not as quick, not as sweet<br />Banana- yellow, softer acorn shaped (like little Hershey kisses), chunky but they melt quickly<br />I thought there was something wrong with all strawberry ones, as they seem to be really hard, but I guess that's the way they are. Mixed Berry is my baby's favorite and I love them too :)

My eight month old son immensely enjoyed them, and I looked at the ingredients and was really surprised to find sugar listed second, right after the cultured milk. It is organic sugar yes, but still added sugar- and I'm bummed as this was not something that I wanted to introduce to his diet yet. My fault that I was swayed by advertising, and didn't read the back.

review/text: I have 2 boys, 5 and 8 and they love Happy Melts! They have been on a kick with Banana Mango but love all the flavors. My 5 year old was asked to bring the snack to school last week and we brought these to share. All 13 of the kids in the class loved them and asked for seconds. My 8 year old is an extremely picky eater and he loves these as well.<br />  My favorite thing about them is that they contain probiotics (helps maintain a healthy balance of good bacteria in the intestines and boost your immune system) and prebiotics (which keeps the good bacteria healthy). I have checked other brands and Happy Melts is the only product to have both of these. I also love that it comes in BPA packaging and does not contain anything artificial. I wish I could give this product 10 stars!!!

I like them too, and have been known to pop one in my mouth when I'm putting them on his tray.  We were out the other day, and our local grocery store doesn't carry happy bellies, so I picked up a bag of Gerber melts.  How different could they really be?  As it turns out, very.  Baby ate the Gerber ones okay...but I tried one and almost spit it out.  It tasted like cardboard. These ones actually taste like strawberry yogurt.  You can't go wrong!

review/text: My 11 month old loves these melts - she's been eating them since she was about 7 months old.  The only problem - not really a problem just an observation - is that once her fingers get wet the melts tend to stick to them and she has some difficulty getting them from her fingers to her mouth - she generally ends up with several stuck to her head and behind her ears (not unlike the rest of her food I suppose).  She also likes the berry flavors - I think they're pretty tasty too but all the other adults who've taste-tested found them foul.  Oh well.
