review/summary: My cat will eat any treat I give her...
review/text: but not this one.  My 17+ year old cat is not finicky when it comes to treats.  She never met one she didn't like till I tried to pawn these off on her.  She actually ate the first one I gave her and has repeatedly refused any others.  (Perhaps she knows this treat is good for her?)  However, I left one for her just in case she changed her mind.  It got very hard in a very short period of time.  I could not even break it apart.  Even straight out of the bag these are very difficult to break apart and I am assuming it would be difficult to chew.  I have tried these off and on for several weeks and she refuses to even taste another one.  In the trash they go.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: I appreciated the solo review on this multivitamin.  I searched around amazon for a quality senior cat multivitamin.  I ordered this one just as a test to see if the older one, Mouse, would eat it.  They passed the test.  Flying colors.  He has a sensitive stomach and he, also, can be picky at times.  Yet, he seems to love this multivitamin, which is awesome because he is 10 years old and he could really used the extra good stuff.  I give this item a 5 out of 5, as well.

review/summary: Labradorable once again
review/text: I have a 12 yr old lab who for the last five years or so has had hot spots, ear infections, a dull, thinning, coarse coat with constant shedding, hot spots and episodic vomiting. I tried IAMS, Eukanuba and other high priced foods. The vet said cook eggs, boil hamburg, try hypo-allergenic shampoos, even steroids. No change. I fell upon this at Walmart and began using it 8 months ago. She looks great! Her coat especially is thick & soft & huggable. No more hot spots, no ear problems, and she's even welcome in our bed again. The only time she vomits is when I cheat and give her table foods. I even think her hearing is improved.

review/summary: Great food for sensetive dog
review/text: My mix-breed lab suffered from terrible skin problems, especially in his ears, for 2 years.  After a lot of money spent at the vet, we finally identified his problems as food related allergies.  Tried all the expensive "over the counter" foods from pet stores...nothing worked.  THe only thing I could feed him was either lamb or venison based food I bought from the vet at a ridiculous premium.  I saw this at Walmart and decided to give it a try.  My dog has been loving it for 2 years and is in better health than ever.  All skin problems gone.  Also, on the positive side, it seems to make more compact poop...less to pick up (yay!).  I strongly encourage anyone with a food sensitive pet to give this stuff a try.  Price is high, but reasonable compared to high-end foods.  Also, we have had good luck with Natural Life cat food for adult cats.  Poop is much less stinky than with other foods (Iams, vet food).

review/summary: Saved my dog's life!
review/text: Shortly before Thanksgiving last year, my 7 year Staffordshire's health took a turn for the worst. His liver was inflamed, he was going in the house and could not keep food down. Actually, he had been throwing up his food for years. His dad went the same was just 2 years earlier and I couldn't bear the though of putting him down. So I was on a quest to save his life and Christmas. We took off the commercial dog food and I started cooking for him a mix of brown rice, ground meat, veggies, eggs, & oatmeal. He loved it and started to get better within a few days, slowly but surely. I also added a daily supplement of brewer yeast, wheat germ and kelp with a little milk thistle to help with the liver. He really started to put the weight back on and a tablespoon of olive oil was great for his coat. As you can imagine, this can get very time consuming but in those early days it was worth. Well I discovered Natural Life in Wal*Mart and both dogs (got another puppy last year)do very well on it. When my budget allows, I buy 2-3 bags at a time. last week we gave them the regular stuff and the loose stools came back almost immediately. I am going to grab a couple of bags tonight after work. This is the only thing I will feed my dogs from now on.

review/summary: Great for Skin Allergies
review/text: I have a 3 year old lab mix who was constantly itching and scratching and had a dull, coarse coat despite eating only high-end dog food.  Then 2 summers ago she developed a huge hot spot and lost all the hair on her back end!  I tried her on this food and it worked AMAZINGLY well.  No more itching, beautiful shiny coat.  When all the stores around here stopped carrying it, I tried her on some other single-protein/single-carb foods, some even more expensive than this brand, but her itching returned.  This is the only food for my dog, even if I have to pay shipping to get it!  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, makes for fewer, less stinky poops, and  she doesn't eat as much of this food as she does many others.

review/text: This is easily my favorite of the "Complete Meals" collection; the beef varieties always taste more homemade and have a better texture than the chicken ones. It's nice to be able to prepare quick dinners in the microwave on busy days, and this one couldn't be simpler. To make your dinner really gooey and delicious, sprinkle a cup of shredded cheddar cheese over the dish in the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, whether in the microwave or the oven. This is also a fun option for a hearty Mexican dip--just bake, open a bag of chips (Frito scoops are great), and enjoy!  &lt;=]

review/summary: Hard to find item.....great value.....excellent quality
review/text: First of all, I would like to comment on the previous review for this item.  The customer gave it rave reviews but said that the gum came with a "grainy coating" that's horrible.  Of course its horrible.  Its a special type of sand!  YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT THE SAND, YOU HAVE TO RINSE OFF EACH PIECE BEFORE YOU USE IT.  The sand is a testiment to the excellent quality of the product.  For over 3,000 years, the gum has been harvested the same way.  The trees are scared and the "sap" drips down to the ground.  The ground is covered by harvesters with a special, clean, white sand to keep the "sap" from becoming dirty when it hits the ground.  After it hardens into "teardrops", it is then collected.<br />Mastic Gum kills bacteria that cause plaque and other dental problems.  Whitens teeth.  And it tastes absolutely natural....similar to the way patchouli smells.

review/text: You really get a lot of pieces in this tiny jar! Some are big, some are small, so you can decide how much you want/need. They are coated in some horrible grainy powder, however, so I rinse off the piece before I chew it. The flavor is mild and really gets your saliva flowing. This has been a major part of my dental health plan and so far, so good. The shipping is more than the actual mastic though, which is insane and it wasn't even packaged so great or anything as to warrant such a high shipping price. Makes you wonder. Anyway, I give it 4 stars because it is good, pure mastic gum which is hard to find, and you do get a lot of it for your money.

review/summary: Mostly Loved
review/text: I have four indoor cats and one outdoor kitty and all vote on the quality of the food they receive from Amazon.<br />All five say that they IMMEDIAATELY loved these Sardine Cutlets from Tiki Cat. They say the taste was good, the consistency was fine and the amount of fluid was adequate. (They all enjoy a bit of a drink along with their wet food!)<br />But "our Mom gave them to us too often. This is a rich food and we do not want it everyday. It kind of reminds us of how humans love their chili dogs. Humans just seem to go ape for chili dogs now and again. They load them up with chili, sauerkraut, onions (ugh!), pickle relish, and sometimes even cheese. Then they eat and eat. Plus, they stuff in some of those ruffled chips. Then they rub their tummies and say how great those chili dogs were, BUT, it is a WHILE before we see them go out and do that sort of chowing down again!!! That is how it is with us and the SARDINE CUTLETS. We can really chow down on them, but then we need a break. About three weeks seems to be right and then we have a go at them again. Those cutlets are lovely, but they are NOT an everyday food for us fur people!"<br /><br />And that folks, seems to be exactly how my kitties feel about the Sardine Cutlets. If I give them some every two or three weeks, and it seems every three weeks is the best, they have a wonderful time eating Sardine Cutlets. If I give them another can right away, they just walk off. So, therein lies the "chili dog" analogy. They LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them once in a while, but too often is TOO OFTEN. So, I buy a case and it lasts me quite a while: 2 or 3 months. But, when they are in the mood, LOVE THEM THEY DO!<br /><br />Since this is not an everyday food that they like all the time, all five have agreed that this is a four star item. EVERYDAY, ANYDAY foods get 5 stars. All are agreed on this vote and they say "Thank you very much for your attention to our opinions. We only tell you Amazonian friends the truth and the truth is that the Sardine Cutlets are a four star food feast, BUT they are Wonderful now and again for your feline people, so do order them. Just do not feed too often. Thank you."  from<br />Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty.

However, this bigger sized bag (as apposed to the small ones you find at the grocery store) are a tad bit softer/fresher. As far as the taste goes, the orange ones are pretty good, and none of them taste bad, but they just aren't awesome. I recommend Annie's brand (particularly the Berry Batch) or Ocean Spray (the Berries and Cherries is really good). Both of those brands have an amazing soft texture and don't have to sit there chewing forever as you do with the Welch's.

The fruit flavor bursts in your mouth, leaves behind a sweetness in your mouth even after chewing and swallowing.  I bought these since my blood sugar drops rapidly and these are quick to grab and easy to chew.  You can taste the difference of each flavor but I like eating about 3 mixed flavors together.

review/text: These rice cakes have very little flavor and are very crumbly. I have thrown away the equivelent to 2 from all of the crumbs. The flavor is barely there and tastes more like a rice cake than the flavor says. This flavor is slightly better than the Honey Nut flavor but still nothing but crumbs.  I will go back to the Quaker brand, they are worth the extra money.

The plum taste and smell is pleasant. It's a great night time relaxer and I have a cup every night before going to sleep. I think it helps me sleep better.

review/summary: Nerds, The Candy of My Youth
review/text: Whether or not you like Nerds probably depends on when you were a child. I was not yet in high school in the early 80s and the sweet, tangy taste was a salve that help take my mind off homework, bullies and girls. After bus dropped me off at school, I'd run up the hill to the candy truck and buy a box or two. The grape and strawberry where the originals and my all time favorite. Eaten one at a time or in an overwhelming mouthful, I just loved 'em.<br /><br />Nerds were the "Candy of the Year" in 1985. They're thickly glazed with carnauba wax that gives them their hard crunch, and a flavored gloss. The center of each candy is composed of one or more complete, tangy sucrose crystals. If you were patient enough to let the coating dissolve in your mouth, then you could take it out and see that the crystals were clear. I was rarely so self retrained though, and would usually suck on their fun texture for a little while then just crunch away.<br /><br />The box has two openings at the top, one for each flavor. It was always a mystery which side I'd finish first, since I went back and forth between the two. I tried them again recently, and though my taste buds have evolved over the years, I found I still love them. It doubt they're very healthy, but that's not the point, is it? Candy has no point, it is just to be enjoyed! :)

review/summary: A Tiny Box of Memories
review/text: When I was around 8 years old my family took me and my younger brother on our first trip to Cape Cod Massachusetts, since then we went up once every summer for a week or so, those first few years we would take a pop up camper to a camp site by the beach. The campsite itself had two memorable things, the first was a play ground my brother and I would spend time at, and the second was a small candy shop down by the end of the road leading up to the camp site, it was in this candy store that I had my first box of Nerds.<br /><br />My brother and I looked all over the candy store with the wide eyed wonder of the literal kid in a candy shop. The one thing that caught my eye was the small pink and purple box of candy up by the register. Since our mother only let us buy one thing each this is what I chose, and my brother (always copying me) chose the same, which we enjoyed on our way back to the camper. Of all the tastes on that trip, the marshmellows we toasted over the campfire, the seafood we had in the local resturants, my first bite of buttered lobster, the wind and saltwater on the beach, it was that little box of candy that my brother and I shared on the way back to the camper that stands out to me the most.<br /><br />Many years later in high school I met one of my best friends working at the local FYE, his name was Andrew and we first started talking over one of the jumbo boxes of Nerds, striking up a conversation about how you got almost a pound of candy with the box of Nerds, and how other candy boxes skimped out and filled it with mostly empty space. For most of my high school years he and I would hang out at the store, exchange stories, shoot the breeze, ect, usualy over a box of Nerds.<br /><br />Ive now been out of high school for almost four years, Andrew and I have lost touch over the past few years, and my brother died almost 7 years ago. After all this time these tiny little candies still bring back all the happy memories from my childhood and teen years. Bravo Wonka on this exellent product.

It isn't good for a daytime facial moisturizer- you'll look seriously shiny- but your skin will look great the morning after if you use it as a nighttime moisturizer.

review/summary: Great oil
review/text: I would have given this 5 stars, but I love the smell of coconut and missed any mention of this being de-fragranced. As I was purchasing to make my own mustache wax, I thought the coconut would lend it a great scent.<br /><br />Oh well, aside from my minor inconvenience, I have to say it's great stuff. Mixed up a bit with some beeswax to control the handlebars and I have to say, it's never been softer. That it's food grade means I've very happy to have it near the mouth, which I worry about with some of the other formulations out there.<br /><br />If you wanted to try it alone on a mustache, it's lots of fun in cold weather to feel the oil suddenly solidify at the first blast of cool air. :)

review/text: I have natural hair & I heard that coconut oil is great for retaining moisture. This product truly did the trick. The coconut oil arrived in liquid form bc of the hot temps outside but returned to solid form after a few hours. To use it in liquid form all you have to do is put the container in warm water for 30 minutes. I applied the oil to my dry hair & let it sit for a couple of hours. After I rinsed the oil from my hair, I shampooed & deep conditioned. My hair was soft & moisturized for about a week. I love it. Must for naturals!

review/text: The product itself is great! I use it for my lobes and to help keep them healthy.<br />But when I got it in the mail it had melted and was all over the box. It looked like the seal hadn't broken too much when I looked at it. These are in glass jars too, so I checked for cracks, but it was in good shape. It think the heat of it being in a mail truck probably had something to do with it, so I wasn't too worried. I've had no problems after that, and use it everyday.<br /><br />Overall a good product and I recommend it to anyone!

review/summary: Not as Chocolaty as I Expected
review/text: A fellow reviewer mentioned these moon pies at the amazon forum so I decided I'd take the chance and order the mini-moon pies. I was expecting them to taste much more like chocolate but the coating is fairly mild. The cookies in the pie taste a bit like shortbread instead of graham crackers and they are a bit salty. The marshmallow fluff in the center is not overly sweet.<br /><br />If you are looking for something mildly sweet and a little salty then these might appeal to you. I made them taste more like chocolate by taking the moon pies and placing them on a plate. I then spread melted chocolate chips on them and let the chocolate set. This made them quite delicious.<br /><br />Ingredients: Enriched wheat flour, corn syrup, sugar, partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil, Partially hydrogenated coconut oil, defatted soy flour, Dutched cocoa, cocoa, gelatin, baking soda, soy lecithin, salt, artificial flavoring, sodium sulfite.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Creamy strong and needs white wine
review/text: Epoisses is not well known.  For those of you who know what washed rind cheese is, this is one of the greats.  For those of you who do not, this is a class of cheese that is strong.  So do not serve it as the only choice for the uninitiated.  Better to serve at least the classic three choices, one sheep, one goat and this for the cow.  You know, half a Noah.<br /><br />If you are trying it for yourself for the first time, here are a couple of points:<br /><br />- take most of the top crust off, gently with a sharp paring knife and fork.  Not deep.  The crust is soft.<br /><br />- let the cheese come to room temperature (this is a creamy almost soupy cheese and looses most of its taste if cold and firm)<br /><br />- serve with a small spoon, no bigger than an espresso spoon.  (caviar spoons work.  in a pinch, the handle of an ice cream bar works.  The point is not to have big glops extracted)<br /><br /> - good on bread.  Bath Oliver crackers are good.  Water crackers or cream crackers.<br /><br />Wine is essential.  The first time I had this cheese, I had a shmear on a piece of bread.  Wow, the cheese was extraordinary.  Then I had a mouth wash of white wine.  Then the cheese opened into the transformational moment of perfection.  True Sartori.  So always serve with cool white wine,  The fat and alcohol mate to explode all the hidden flavors.<br /><br />My choice is a Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru.  But since I cannot pay for my choice, I am reduced to mere extacy  with a good chalky, flinty Frascati.  For American wines, the new style of lean, un-oaked chardonnay works.  You might better reach for a Fume Blanc otherwise.<br /><br />If you are interested but not quite comfortable, then go for the plain Epoisses, not the creamy.  It is a gateway cheese, as we pushers say.<br /><br />Finally, this is a fair price to pay.

review/text: If you love Girl Scout Thin Mints you will crave these little gems.  I am not a huge sweet fan but I could eat the entire box in one sitting.  The downside is I think you can only get them during the holidays.  Not sure if I will make it until then!

review/summary: More Addicting than Thin Mints
review/text: Absolutely delicious. I received them as a gift this past Christmas and was hoping to get them for myself. Rich chocolate with an amazing texture and great real mint flavor. They were the best when kept in the fridge/freezer, a little crisper and the cold set off the mint and chocolate. I definitely recommend them, and would buy them for myself and as a gift for others. Wish I could get them year round, but it is probably best I don't or I wouldn't fit through the door. :)

review/summary: Cat Loves Tender Slices
review/text: This is the only flavor my cat will eat.  She goes<br />crazy over this flavor.  I think because it is easy<br />to eat instead of a big chunk.  This looks like little<br />square slices of beef.  It smells good too.  Whenever<br />I open a can of this, she comes running!  She's meowing<br />at me repeatedly if she sees the can in my hand, and I<br />imagine that she is saying "Hey, hurry up and open that<br />can! I know what you got there.  You can't fool me.<br />Gimme that yummy food!"  But of course, she's saying<br />that in cat language.  Because I love her, I can totally<br />understand what she's saying.  What cat lover doesn't?<br />We definitely have that connection with our cats, don't<br />we?  To her, Tender Slices is the ultimate gourmet meal.

Thinking she got into something unrelated to the food, I continued to feed this to my other dog. Within 2 days my other dog got sick as well. The result = 2 sick dogs + a vet bill. The remaining cans went in the trash immediately.  I would NEVER recommend this dog food to anyone.

My family is Indian and we are used to making yogurt at home. Store bought plain yogurt is usually too flat for me, but this plain kefir has the right taste, similar to the yogurt I miss from home.<br /><br />The bubbly feeling might take some time to get used to, however. It's very good cold, with a tiny bit of salt, like plain/salt lassi.

review/summary: Recommended in the 17 Day Diet Book
review/text: If you're looking for a great, nutritious liquid yogurt type product, you might like to try this lowfat kefir.  I learned about kefir in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451648650">The 17 Day Diet: A Doctor's Plan Designed for Rapid Results</a>.  A nutritionist recommended having protein for breakfast and combining protein with fruit.  I love to make fruit smoothies with this: one banana, one cup frozen berries, 1/2 cup kefir and 1/2 cup berry juice.  The protein keeps you from getting hungry.<br /><br />I also love to buy this in fruit flavors when I don't have time to make a smoothie in the morning.  I've tried the peach, pomegranate and raspberry and they are delicious.  They are probiotic with 10 different kinds of bacteria and naturally cultured.  Kefir provides 25% of Vitamin D, 30% Calcium and 11g of Protein.  It's a great breakfast, lunch or snack option.  A cup is about 140 calories.

review/summary: It's all what you're used to!
review/text: I happen to enjoy Lifeway's plain, low-fat yogurt.  Doesn't at all seem sour to me!  You can make fruit smoothies with it and have a healthy low-fat meal/snack that is filling, tastes great, is inexpensive AND good for you all at the same time!!  If you enjoy plain, low-fat yogurt, with fresh fruit, you will enjoy this as well.  Best bet would be to try and find it in your local health food store first, or a Super Wal-Mart may have it, before you buy the carton.  When making fruit smoothies with it, I add frozen unsweetened fruit (1 cup of fruit to 1 cup of Kefir) in a blender, you can add sugar, agave nectar, honey, truvia or whatever you wish to sweeten it, a little flaxseed oil and blend.  It's DELISH!!!

review/summary: Kefir keeps me healthier
review/text: For breakfast, about 3-5 times a week, I take one of those 2-cup clear plastic "take-out" containers (the kind that can hold soup without spilling) and fill it with 1 cup or more of grapes or other fresh fruit and then pour 1 cup of the lowfat plain kefir on top.  To add texture or nutrition or variety I might sprinkle a tablespoon of slivered almonds and/or a tablespoon of fresh ground flaxseed on top.  I take it to work and eat it with a spoon, the same way I would eat a yogurt.  I'd rather "eat" my kefir than drink it because eating is more satisfying and there's less prep/clean-up time vs. making a smoothy.<br /><br />Sure, the grapes are high in natural sugar, but they make the whole combo tasty, satisfy my sweet tooth, and are still a lot better than eating processed sugar, in my opinion.  I like but avoid the sweetened/flavored kefirs for this reason.  Adding flaxseed is my way of painlessly sneaking in some seriously healthy stuff while keeping the meal "easy on the palate."<br /><br />Frankly, I'm lazy about food prep and not entirely health-conscious with my diet, but I do try to stay on the lookout for foods/recipes that meet all of my three criteria for the IDEAL food, and kefir is one of them:<br />  --Tasty<br />  --Healthy<br />  --Quick & Easy<br /><br />I've even noticed that my mouth and breath feel "cleaner" throughout the day after I've eaten my kefir breakfast.  I think my oral and digestive health are better when I consume kefir regularly (every day or even every other day).

That way it is a super healthy and amazingly tasty treat instead of just yogurt or yogurt with a lot of sugary fruit.  I order this all of the time now and will never go back to any other sugar-free jams.  This one tastes better than even the regular full-sugar jams.  Lots of chunky fruit inside, not a colored jelly goo.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these jams.  I am a HUGE fan of xylitol and stumbling across this stuff has made me very happy!

Now they're gone, hence the internet search.<br /><br />When I purchase, I just recognize the bottle & grab it, after making sure to get the right flavor.  It wasn't until I started researching on the internet today, that I realized that this last bottle is the sugar free version.  Couldn't say what I had before, but this does not taste sugar free.  24mg of sodium & that's it.  ZERO everything else, but TASTE.  That is 100% goodness.<br /><br />The flavor is concentrated, so it doesn't take much to flavor your coffee.  Maybe a teaspoon or so, after adding the sugar, so a bottle can last a long time.  Don't use sugar to get the french vanilla taste without the sweet. Don't know why you'd want to do that tho'.....

review/summary: Hamlyn's oatmeal
review/text: Hamlyn's Scottish oatmeal is steel-cut oats, not the rolled oats (like Quaker's) most familiar in North America.  Steel-cut oats are the equivalent of cracked wheat, with each oat cut into three or four hard pellets (groats).  The groats are prepared by simmering them in a 50-50 mixture of milk and water until soft, a process that takes longer than cooking rolled oats, but results in a porridge with better flavour and texture.  There are supermarket brands of rolled oats, which can be prepared in the same way.  However, the Hamlyn's seems to be cut into somewhat smaller pieces, so that the groats are tender at about the same time the oatmeal is done.  The larger groats in other brands of steel-cut oats are often still unpleasantly hard when the porridge is done.<br /><br />Hamlyn's is hard to find in North America, and I was glad to find it on Amazon.

Yes, there are some people who have not acquired a taste for seaweed (my daughter for one). But for anyone who likes sushi, they would probably LOVE these seaweed snacks.

review/summary: Truly strangely addictive
review/text: I discovered these in a local health food store when I began searching for seaweed products as a way to add some iodine to my diet. The store carried lots of products, but most were processed with nasty canola oil which I try to avoid as I do all the high-PUFA oils. Then I found SeaSnax which use olive oil!<br /><br />I bought some and the rest was history. Now I buy them in bulk from amazon because the price is much better. Yes, they do have a slightly fishy odor and flavor - but I *like* that. You may not like them as much as I do if that bothers you. But for me they are the perfect snack - great taste, a nice crunchy mouth-feel, low in carbs and calories. No matter what your eating goals or eating style - low carb, low cal, low fat, vegan, etc. these snacks can fill the bill, but you *must* like that slightly fishy taste and scent. However in my case I do!<br /><br />I eat these so often that it's great amazon has them in bulk like this, although my most recent purchase was a 6-pack and not a 12 as I wanted to buy ALL the flavors, not just the plain, so I bought 6-packs of them all. But I'll certainly be ordering again soon. These are one of my favorite food finds of the year.

review/summary: Three reasons NOT to buy this product
review/text: We really wanted to like this product, it seemed so sensible, lo calorie and healthy, but:<br />1. They taste NASTY. If you didn't grow up with this flavor, e.g. fishy tasting, you're probably going to react like everyone in our household -- YUCK<br />2. The portion sizes are very small. It's just @3" X 3" pieces of toasted seaweed and not a lot of them at that.<br />3. Probably the most environmentally wasteful way to pack a product these days. Plastic tray holding the "snack" wrapped in more plastic. With all the promo about how healthy the product is what's with the packaging?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy some bulk bin unsalted roasted nuts instead.

review/summary: Too fishy...
review/text: I ordered the SeaSnax on the reviews that claimed they were strangely addictive.  I've eaten a few of them so far, and it keeps tasting like I'm eating the bottom of the ocean.  I won't order them again.

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: If you like honey, you are going to love this one. It is incredible, awesome and gorgeous. It is so good, you are not going to want to 'waste' this honey over toast bread. I eat it with teaspoon ever day and night, sometimes put a tiny bit of it in my home-made oatmeal reduced in organic milk and stir it together. Oh my god, it turns my oatmeal to the best recipe on Earth! I have not yet received a single negative or even a so-so reference from any of the people around me who has tasted this honey.<br /><br />A shopping tip: Due to its unique and wonderful taste, and the pretty package, it makes one of the best gifts for honey lovers. Two of these together makes a better Christmas gift than useless & cheap electronics or textiles.

review/summary: The perfect honey with a lot of taste for a change!
review/text: This honey is of great quality!<br /><br />It comes from the "Pays Basque" region of Southwest France in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain.<br /><br />I have traveled many times in this region and have tasted a lot of food specialties in the many open air markets that you can find in almost every small towns in France.<br /><br />You can really taste the many flowers used by the honey bees. It has a very hearty taste, great to eat on hot toast for breakfast. I will buy more!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Exceptional Taste!
review/text: This honey has a very sweet and unique taste to it. It has a thick and creamy composition, and possesses a smooth rich flavor unlike any other honey that I've tried. Interestingly, though much sweeter than other brands, it still has the same calorie values - 60 calories per 20g. The honey is packaged in a sealed container, which is placed inside the decorative metal pail. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves honey.

review/summary: Practically Perfect In Every Way!
review/text: This honey is the best honey we've ever eaten. Silky smooth we eat it on toast, off the spoon,  a little bit of heaven. Relatives clap when they open their gift and see we've given it to them as a present.
