review/summary: Best Sports drink out there
review/text: I tried Greater Than for the first time a few months back and haven't gone back to any other sports drinks.  The taste is really spectacular.  Most plain and flavored coconut waters taste disgusting and the taste is acquired.  But Greater Than tastes great, no taste acquiring necessary at all.  Plus all of the ingredients are all natural which is great.  I really pick this over Gatorade everytime now, the quicker recovery after workouts is 100% noticeable.  It's also an amazing hangover remedy that's better than straight up coconut water because it won't make you gag when you drink it.  The product is definitely worthy of 5 stars, I wish I could rate it higher than that.

review/summary: Best coconut water
review/text: I live in Chicago, so I see Greater Than everywhere. You can find it at most high-quality grocery or health food stores in the city.<br /><br />Greater Than is different from most coconut waters - It actually tastes good. I've heard about the health benefits of coconut water, but most of them taste terrible. Greater Than tastes like a refreshing sports drink without the sugary aftertaste. It has some calories and natural sugar in it, which is perfect after a workout. You get the benefits of a sports drink without all of the crap that's typically added to them. I also like that it doesn't have any artificial chemical sweeteners.<br /><br />If you don't live in Chicago, or can't find Greater Than in your area, you should order a case on Amazon and give it a try.

review/summary: House blend perfection, excellent 'small bags' packaging
review/text: The house blend has a well-balanced taste that goes well with the frothed milk in the cappuccino and makes quite enjoyable espressos too. This is actually pretty competitive in price with the 32-ounce bags that you can find at some of the big discount stores and it has the advantage that, having 3 bags, the coffee can be kept fresher. The combined 36 ounces should be enough for some 30+ Venti equivalent, only stronger.<br /><br />Briefly:<br /><br />- one month or so of daily cappuccinos or double-espressos or daily Venti-size coffees<br />- coffee stays fresher as when compared to the big discount stores 32-ounce bags because it comes in THREE sealed bags<br />- the house blend happens to be my favorite<br />- price is only slightly higher than what you can get in a discount store but the 3-bag packaging makes up for it<br /><br />As of June 30, 2009, it was not available as a subscription item. I would subscribe without hesitation if it was.

review/text: House Blend is great for a morning cup and for those who like their coffee mild.  It's not too strong, yet has a very nice aroma and taste.  You could make a batch and then save the rest later for Iced Coffee like I do.  Just the right amount of "coffee" flavor for those who like their coffee mild.<br /><br />Taste is very subjective, so if you never tried this flavor before, go to Starbucks and order a cup and then decide if you want to invest in 3 full bags.  I like it and order it frequently and that's what I did.

review/text: My coffee machine is a grinder, so I love the fresh beans. It smells good when it's brewing and the taste is rich and not acidy. I got 25%, buy 3 get the 4th free, so it wound up being less expensive than if I purchased it here, and I got it delivered right to my door. Someone else rated the coffee with only one star, not based on the coffee but on the price she paid. I think that's an unfair rating and not reflective of the products quality. You don't have to buy it if you think it's over priced, but if you check your prices and buy it right, it's better than most of what else is out there.

review/text: If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally.

review/text: This is definately one of the best Hickory Liquid smoke brands on the market. Right from the moment you open the cap on the bottle you will immediately appreciate the finest, true hickory smoke flavorings ever developed. The liquid smoke is very concentrated so start with a small amount diluted with water according to your taste.  Add a little more for future marinades if the first attempt is not enough hickory smoke flavor to statisfy your taste buds. Great for adding hickory smoke flavor to marinades. According to the company web page, item has a hint of mesquite flavor . I could not ascertain by smelling that it was there. It was not on the advertisement.

review/text: Lazy Kettle Liquid Smoke calls itself "the standard in All Natural Liquid Smokes." I wouldn't dispute that.<br /><br />Being on a restricted diet and unable to eat commercial barbecue sauces, I wanted to make my own and still have it have some "smoke" flavor. I was looking for a liquid smoke that's not loaded with artificial junk and chemicals. I found it.<br /><br />I use Lazy Kettle Liquid Smoke not only in my own barbecue sauce but in stews, on hamburgers and steaks cooked indoors, and I've tried it in some Mexican dishes and marinades (as suggested). It imparts the flavor I was looking for, without the junk.<br /><br />Like with all such concentrated flavorings, you do need to be careful not to overdue it. (If four drops are very good, 10 drops are not necessarily better!) Because you use a small amount at a time, one bottle lasts a long time, thus it's quite cost-effective.<br /><br />If I have any real criticism it might be a wish for some kind of bottle -- possibly even with a dropper -- that allows for controlling exactly how many drops you use at a time. The current bottle isn't bad, but -- like with hot sauce bottles -- sometimes you get a few more drops than you intended.

review/text: Smoked chilean pepper. Tastes great in many applications. I add it to pastas, potatoes, salads, sprinkle on sandwiches. It also makes a wicked dip mixed with cream cheese. For reasons beyond my understanding, it is impossible to find in stores, even in Latin specialty markets. Thank god for Amazon!

review/text: This spice is really delicious. It is not terrifically hot, but it ads a little heat and a lot of flavor. I added it to a mushroom alfredo dish and it gave it a beautiful color and flavor. Its a little pricey so using it as an on the plate addition makes it go farther.

review/summary: Good merken, but tame
review/text: This spice has the smoky pungency of merken, but it is tame. The "real stuff", purchased at open-air markets in southern Chile, is far stronger. Perhaps the spice fades quickly. For whatever reason, it is not as strong as can be bought in the land of the Mapuche, but it will give some of the distinctive flavor of merken to a variety of dishes.

review/text: I have seen this product at gourmet stores but their prices are too high so I checked with Amazon and sure enough, their prices are more affordable. I tried it with my baked chicken and it was delicious. The aroma is wonderful but it doesn't have a lot of salt so I sprinkled a little on the chicken. Merken is certified organic. No more sauces for me, this is more than enough. Enjoy!

review/summary: A superb taste that builds on into your recipes!!
review/text: Merk&eacute;n is a prepared spice with ethnic roots that brings to your recipes the unique complexity of their individual flavors and aromas of earth and smoke. Meats such as tuna, lamb, pork or duck (to name a few), will be enhanced with this delicate spice with sweet nuances of jam or fruit, that will be, without doubt, a joy to your senses.<br /><br />Capsaicin is the molecule that causes the hot sensation of red peppers and has become today an indispensable tool in pharmacological pain research, painful as it is, its effect remains an analgesic response. In addition to reducing the transmission of pain, capsaicin also increases the production of the enzyme collagenase and prostaglandins, reducing both pain and inflammation. This pepper also produces discharge of endorphins as a defense against painful episodes. These various analgesic effects and perceived effect of tolerance to pain, will also provide an excellent flavor to your meals.<br /><br />Creole sauce and other healthy condiments made with merk&eacute;n add flavor, not only taste. In this case, it is merk&eacute;n that provides flavor to foods and also provides the opportunity to improve your health. The Merkaba is the result of adding salt to smoked hot peppers, roasted and ground, with its seeds provided. This product is known as "natural merk&eacute;n". Also produced is a special type that incorporates roasted coriander seeds and ground red pepper or other spices to the ground. The usual ingredients in merk&eacute;n are: Ground pepper and pepper seeds, toasted coriander, salt and oregano.<br /><br />Traditionally, the Merkaba (or medk&eacute;n merqu&eacute;n) is prepared by each family for the personal use of it. The process is slow, green peppers are harvested and then allowed to ripen to take a strong reddish later naturally sun dried and then smoked for a period of about half an hour on native wood fire. Then they are placed in waiting hang grinding. Before they were ground in stone mortars, now it is done with special electric hammer mills. Once reduced to powder or flakes, it is mixed with coriander seeds and salt.<br /><br />Salt must never exceed 20% of the total content of the preparation, the chili should represent a maximum of 70% and the rest, smoked and roasted seeds of cilantro, oregano, etc. Its aroma and flavor makes it the ideal condiment for meats, stews, poultry, fish, vegetables. Even a simple puree, which you want to add some Mapuche mischief.<br /><br />Pepper Properties, the main character<br /><br />When Christopher Columbus discovered America in 1492, he found that one of the qualities of the new continent was the richness in spices that it offered. The pepper (Capsicum Annuum L.) is a vegetable that has its origin in tropical and subtropical regions of America, mainly in Bolivia-Peru area, where seeds have been found in ancestral forms for more than 7,000 years and spread to the Americas and then the rest of the world. Chili stands out for its high content of ascorbic acid value, which is even higher than that of citrus. Chili peppers have a value almost 10 times higher vitamin A than regular peppers. In the placenta and septa of chili peppers are glands or receptacles rich in alkaloids (capsacinoides), among which prevails capsaicin, which determine the degree of pungency of the fruit.<br /><br />A remarkable property is that it works against pain. Capsaicin is the molecule that red pepper hot and today it is an indispensable tool in pharmacological research of pain, painful as it is, its effect remains an analgesic response. From this discovery the pharmaceutical industry continues trying and trying to modify the molecule so that not only produces irritation but analgesia. The intention is to produce a similar molecule, more useful and less irritating than the original product from chili. In addition to reducing the transmission of pain, capsaicin also increases the production of the enzyme collagenase and prostaglandins, reducing both pain and inflammation in men.<br /><br />The pepper also produces discharge of endorphins, as a defense against painful episodes. These substances as well as various effects of analgesics and pain tolerance, cause euphoric effects. Hence, the hypothesis is that endorphins are the ones that carry the pleasure of eating chili and are the starting point of research seeking ways to prevent pain.<br /><br />The Merkaba is therefore used as a welcome ingredient in a wide range of menus, enhancing the flavor of food.

review/summary: Bright Pink Milkies
review/text: I purchased this to go on my daughter's candy buffet at her wedding reception. The candy itself was very good.  Much like M & M's...However, the shipping packaging was inadequate and the candys were chipped and broken.  Did not make for a very nice looking container of candy. I also purchased white and silver ones as well and they too were damaged in shipping.  Would probably not purchase again.

review/summary: Don't waste your money!
review/text: I've never offered a product review and am usually easy to please. Truly! However, these "milkies" arrived looking nothing like the picture on the Amazon site.  The pink was more "gross neon" than the color on the website.  More importantly, many of the candies arrived broken and looked really cheap and unappetizing.  Since this candy was supposed to be part of a candy buffet, I couldn't use them because they looked so bad.  Unfortunately, I also couldn't return them (although they never left the package) because Amazon does not allow for "food returns" (eyeroll).  At any rate, these "Koppers" are nothing like the picture nor like the M&M's they're supposed to imitate.  Save your money or use another company.

review/summary: The proverbial mixed bag
review/text: I love coffee flavored candy, so I figured this would be right up my alley.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Coffee Candy is the best of the three. No filling, nothing fancy, just nice rich, yummy, coffee flavor.<br /><br />The Latte Candy would be my second favorite. These have a sweet, milky center. It tastes nice, but has a slightly chalky texture.<br /><br />The Espresso Candy wasn't so great. These have a gooey coffee center. The flavor is good. I didn't like the texture of the filling. Another issue with the Espresso is that many of the ones in my assortment were broken, making them a sticky inedible mess inside the wrapper. The Coffee and Latte flavors were all unbroken.<br /><br />I have no regrets ordering the assortment, but in the future, I'll stick to ordering the Coffee candy and pass on the Espresso and Latte.

review/text: I had prior experience with Bali's Best Coffee and have always enjoyed it. Consequently, I was eager to try Bali's Espresso and Latte Candy. However, I found the espresso to be disappointing. It has the taste of strong but stale coffee although another person might have a different reaction. I have not yet tasted the latte. Overall, I think United and Kopico are better than Bali's.

Not only does it break up in your mouth, but the texture of the center goop is nauseating like a blob of snot. It breaks into sharp shards first, then you get the gross inner surprise...bleh!!!

review/summary: The Best Snack EVER?!?
review/text: I don't think I've ever seen so much health packed into one small, ready-to-go and easy-to-carry-around packet. (I have a couple in my glove compartment, and I've been keeping one in my briefcase too.) And I didn't see anything particularly unhealthy added (like salt, extra added sugar, unpronounceable chemicals, etc.*) I'm not an expert on the topic, but I wouldn't exactly call this an "energy bar" per se (like for "instant energy" with tons of sugar, caffeine, electrolytes, carbs, whatever). Rather I'd just call it a simple snack, something to hold you over, fill in the spaces between meals, that kind of thing. Plus, give you some healthy chia and acai!<br /><br />Personally, I've had the bad habit of going all day with just one meal later in the day. I didn't realize it at the time but this put my body into a starvation mode and actually made me put on fat and gain weight, even though I was eating very little. I've been told by health and medical professionals -- and have read -- that it's best to have about five or six small meals or snacks throughout the day. So my problem has been finding GOOD, healthy snacks ... as opposed to junky snacks like Cheetos and potato chips, that kind of thing. Yes, these are a bit on the expensive side, but I'm thinking that one or two a day would be perfect.<br /><br />That's my story and I'm sticking with it. Also, I'm going to order another box right now. :)<br /><br />Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, d'uh ... they taste good too!<br /><br />*Okay, I lied. There's apparently a tiny pinch of sea salt in there at the tail end of the ingredient list. The total sodium listed is 45 mg. I'm guessing it's part of what's needed to hold everything all together, I dunno.

A small amount adds the Indian spice and tang I crave.<br /><br />Remember its better to start with too little and add some more than to over do it.<br /><br />I wish Patak's website offered more uses and recipes for this stuff, I need to do some more research to find other good things to do with it.

review/summary: Similar to eating a really spicy citrus wet wipe...
review/text: I had the opportunity to try this product when an error was made in my order for Patak's Hot Mango pickles and several jars of these Hot Lime pickles arrived instead.  (The design on the jars is almost identical.)  Since I absolutely love the Patak's hot mangos so much, I opened up one of the jars of hot lime.<br /><br />I wished I hadn't.  The closest thing I can compare the experience of eating spicy pickled lime rinds was eating a chili-dipped citrus wet wipe.  UGH!<br /><br />I suppose that if you have already developed a taste for eating lime rinds AND for really hot stuff, then this may appeal to you.  Otherwise, steer clear.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I wholeheartedly recommend this most delicious tea.  I started drinking herbal teas for the health benefits, but this tea is so good I would drink it whether or not I were health conscious.  The Rosehips come in a bulk form (i.e. they aren't in little tea bags), but I've discovered that does not affect the making of the tea at all.  They just sink to the botton and it is easy to drink.  The taste is very much what one would expect of an herb that is so rich in Vitamin C, which is  a taste I have to admit, I love.  The taste is pure and and delicious.  I definitely recommend this one!

review/summary: Good Price
review/text: These are the only rose hips I've had in my life, so I don't have any standard of comparison.<br /><br />Tastes good to me, though.  I became interested in these because of joint/gum problems and hearing that vitamin C could help with that.  I figured that bioflavonoids/other compounds may be important for absorbing vitamin C and I'd probably be better off getting it from a whole food than from a supplement (not that there's anything wrong with supplements - just my way of thinking!).<br /><br />Anyway: I mostly use these for making 'soaked tea.'  Or just iced tea?  :D  Basically I just put a good amount of these in a bottle filled with a couple cups of water (around 3-4 tablespoons), shake it up, stick that in the refrigerator, then shake it up really well the next day when the rose hips are softened.  That's when the water takes on a rich orange/light amber color and noticeably thickens up (maybe from the pectin that I'm assuming is in the rose hips?), and also tastes great.  Shaking it really well helps to disperse all the flavor - keep that in mind.<br /><br />I eat the rose hips too (after soaking overnight) and they taste good as well, but a little strong eating a lot of them.<br /><br />I've made tea with them, and I enjoy that a lot, but I thought that heating it up so much would destroy a lot of the vitamin C.  If you're drinking it for enjoyment, it doesn't really matter what you do, and the rose hip tea I made with these rose hips tasted great.  You have to use a good amount of rose hips to get that tangy/sour flavor; for making 1 cup I'd at least use a couple tablespoons, but that's just me - everyone has their preferences.<br /><br />Overall I think it's very pleasant and refreshing, though I prefer it unheated, and just "soaked and shaken."  I make kefir and adding these to the 'ripening under airlock' phase can make an interesting brew.  There's a lot you can do with these things, so don't be afraid to get creative.<br /><br />As for this specific brand, as I said, it's the only one I've tried, so I don't have a standard of comparison -- but I'm satisfied with these, think they taste fine, and they were sold for a great price.  No complaints here :)

review/text: I am a big fun of rosehips. I love to put a cup of WHOLE berries into my 64oz thermos and drink it all day. No mess, only great taste! And at the end of the day, I just wash the thermos and shake all the berries out. I was excited to get a whole bag of Organic rosehips. I even read the reviews, and one person said that it was the whole fruit, not crashed. When I opened my bag - I first though they mixed up my order and sent me a bag of crushed chilly peppers! On the second look, it did smell and looked like rosehips - but CRASHED. I am kind of disappointed, I will have to filter my tea each time now.

review/text: I've been ordering this product for several months and the quality seems to be pretty consistent. Makes a pretty tasty "tea" (or whatever you like to call it) - not too "acidic", not too "watery". We use the Thermos (any brand will do) vacuum-insulated beverage bottle to "brew" it overnight (to extract the maximum amount of taste) then just drink it slowly during the next couple of days (the water stays relatively hot in such bottle even after 24 hours).

review/summary: This tea's different
review/text: I'm definitely a fan, I don't dislike the tea, but it's very different from what I expected.<br /><br />I suppose having any expectations would be silly since I haven't tried this tea before, but somehow in my mind I had imagined it to be a light and refreshing tea overall.  I found it to be neither.<br />The tea's almost... broth-like, I often feel as if I've eaten a small meal after having a large cup of this tea, it's seems quite filling.<br /><br />It's heavy, flavorsome, robust, but these flavors soon diminish to give way to some quite fragrant undertones for its aftertaste.<br /><br />If you're interested in trying something new, I'd recommend this tea, it's like nothing I've tried before.<br />From experience, it's hit-or-miss, I've given it to both of my roommates, one loves it, the other couldn't even finish her cup.  Same goes for anyone else who I've given it to.  But, in my opinion, it's tasty, although not something I'd drink daily.

review/text: This is a wonderful tea. I use about two tablespoons to a pint (2 cups) of water, or maybe a little less if I'm making a large batch. I boil the water, then add the rose hips and boil them for about ten minutes, then strain the good stuff through a filter. I pour the deep red tea into reused quart-sized glass juice jars and put it in the refrigerator as a quick beverage. Supposedly you can eat the cooked rose hips, but I found them to be full of stems, seeds, and other unpleasant bits. Most of the flavor gets boiled out of them anyway, so they taste like cardboard :P but the tea is awesome.

review/summary: Makes good tea
review/text: I don't really have anything to compare this with, but am satisfied with what I got. I ordered the organic rosehips to serve as a natural source of vitamin C after I discovered that almost all man-made C (ascorbic acid) these days is grown using corn, and almost all corn is GMO (genetically modified by the evil Monsanto).<br /><br />Since vitamin C is a fragile vitamin, I wonder how much is still contained after heating the rosehips for tea. I also ordered the camu camu powder and wonder the same about it: does it retain its high percentage of Vitamin C after the drying and powdering process? There doesn't seem to be any information on this. I am looking for higher "therapeutic" doses of vitamin C that you can't get from eating citrus fruits and C-containing vegetables, so hope these two products will provide that.<br /><br />As for appearance, the dried rosehips in the bag are pieces (not whole) with a very small number of short stems. I have no problem with this. And the bag is big; should last for years (I keep it in the freezer).
