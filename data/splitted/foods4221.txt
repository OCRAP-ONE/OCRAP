review/text: When you look at the nutritional value, it is based on 1/4  cup cereal and it isn't bad.  Carbs are acceptable for those who need to count and sugar is borderline.  However, the preparation directions were for a double serving which caught me off guard.  While it tasted fine, it gave me too many carbs and sugars and being diabetic, this was upsetting.<br /><br />Hodgson Mills should be consistent with serving size and preparation.  I looked at 2 other hot cereals from them  that I use and they are using serving for the preparation so there is no confusion.<br /><br />I emailed them but so far no response.

It is $3.12 at Walmart and even with taxes 6 cans of this will come out to be less than $20 (compared to $26.60 at Amazon)

review/summary: Multi-Grain Cereal with Great Nutrition
review/text: Nestum is a wholesome cereal for infants or growing children, as well as adults with eating challenges. It is not too sugary<br />and provides much needed protein and  vitamins and minerals.  It can be mixed with water, milk, soy milk, or juice.<br />I add mashed fruit to mine, as I am an adult with eating challenge - having my upper jaw and teeth removed by surgery.<br />Nestum is also a good snack when prepared in small quantities.  If an adult has little appetite, Nestum can help, and be<br />nutritious at the same time, encouraging better appetite. I hope more grocery stores and vendors will carry a large supply of NESTUM 5 CEREAL FOR INFANTS.  The cereal in the can does not "go bad" when in the cupboard for a few weeks, which is a plus, since children and adults like variety.

review/summary: Generally effective bug repellent
review/text: I had found quite a few organic sources on the web which suggest the usage of cinnamon as a natural bug repellent. Unfortunately purchasing the tiny 4oz bottles of cinnamon would get very expensive very fast - so when I found this 5lb monster on Amazon I was thrilled to give it a shot.<br /><br />I sprinkle the cinnamon liberally around the perimeter of my house and so far, so good. I live in Texas where fire ants are a pretty big problem - I have seen the ants circumvent the trail of cinnamon on several instances. They do "crossover" from time to time if there is a food source they're trying to get to, but generally speaking they tend to stay away from the stuff. I have a raised garden bed in my backyard where I also used the cinnamon in combination with food grade diatomaceous earth and together they work pretty well at keeping away the various ground crawlies that like to munch on the tomatoes and cucumbers.<br /><br />The cinnamon solution isn't perfect by any means, but it does work as a deterrent. As a plus, the smell of cinnamon is much nicer than the various toxins in the bug sprays. I do resort to the bug sprays indoors and when the bugs get out of hand outside (ie: mounds everywhere), but it's a start and I do believe that it has cut down on the number of multi-legged invaders. Your mileage may vary, but this 5lb jug is a great price to experiment with.

review/summary: Cinnamon
review/text: My coworkers and I purchased this cinnamon to create gingerbread ornaments with our students.  We mixed the cinnamon with applesauce (something we've done for years) but as we mixed we discovered this cinnamon to have many pieces of white fibers mixed in!  The white fibers looked like tiny, white strings.  We continued on with the project because we knew we would not be eating it but soon we discovered, the cinnamon didn't even work for the ornaments.  The ornaments crumbled apart once they were dry rather than sticking together.  Lets just say, I'm so thankful we did not purchase this cinnamon to bake with or to eat!!  We were so excited to the GREAT deal on cinnamon but in the end it was not worth it.  We have had to repurchase cinnamon at our local grocery store.

review/summary: Black Forest Berry Honest Tea is Great!
review/text: I ordered the 12-pack of Black Forest Berry Honest Tea from Amazon. The seller, Nutricity, really packaged this well. It arrived in a big box with all the bottles surrounded and protected by lots and lots of bubble wrap. Even the FedEx delivery guy rang the doorbell to make sure we got the package. I can see why President Barack Obama loves Black Forest Berry Honest Tea, and has it handy at the White House and his Marine One helicopters. I have tried his other favorite Honest Tea drink - Green Dragon tea, but I think the Black Forest Berry Honest Tea tastes better. Anyways, the Black Forest Berry tea isn't too sweet or too bland. It's just right. It's not super sweet like the Snapple drinks, even though my family adores Snapple's Papaya Mango "The Amazing Race" drink - that drink is truly amazing! But Honest Tea's Black Forest Berry is not bland like some other bottled tea drinks. Honest Tea's Black Forest Berry contains purified water, organic cane sugar, organic Fair Trade Certified hibiscus, organic blackberry leaves, organic berry blend flavoring, organic blueberry powder, and organic raspberry powder. I like the fact that Honest Tea uses organic ingredients. What caught my eye in the list of ingredients is the organic Fair Trade Certified hibiscus part. I've been reading a lot about hibiscus tea from Amazon reviewers and what Dr. Oz said, how hibiscus lowers high blood pressure. So, that's cool. And I remember reading that about Ambassador Organics Egyptian Hibiscus tea, a product that is selling well on Amazon. Ambassador Organics is a company ran by former Ambassador Carol Moseley Braun. Both President Obama and former Ambassador Carol Moseley Braun used to be politicians from Illinois, where I was raised. It just shows that a lot of people like to drink tea, and it's really great how they're supporting Fair Trade Certified and organic products. Honest Tea's Black Forest Berry tea is gluten-free and has 60 calories per bottle. I also like the fact that underneath the bottle lids, there are six-word memoirs from Honest Tea employees and normal people like us Amazon customers. If you want to try submitting a six-word memoir, go to Honest Tea's website - [...]. On the bottle, Honest Tea's co-founder, President, TeaEO, Seth Goldman, says that his three boys like to drink this caffeine-free bottled drink after dinner. When it comes to bottled tea drinks, if you want a flavor that is not too bland and not too sweet, like in the story, "Goldilocks and the Three Bears", when Goldilocks settles on the porridge with the right temperature - I consider Honest Tea's Black Forest Berry the "Goldilocks" of the bottled flavored tea drinks.

review/summary: My Italian Husband is Hooked on this Pasta!
review/text: My husband and I went on a low-carb diet to lose weight last year. Once we were done losing, I started looking for good foods to help us maintain our progress. This came up on Amazon, but I was very hesitant...having tried every grocery-store-version of reduced-carb or reduced-calorie pasta, my "pasta-snob" husband has not been a fan of egg pasta in the past. The plain (egg) Carba-Nada Fettuccine is Fantastic! He had NO CLUE it was healthier than regular pasta, and in fact, asked me where I'd gotten it because it tasted really good. A few weeks ago, some very good family friends were in town, and we had plans to get together for dinner so we brought some of this pasta with sauteed shrimp and a light lemon-parmesan sauce. These friends are super-foodies and career restauranteurs including an amazing Italian restaurant. They loved(!) it, too!<br /><br />Note: Even if you're not on a low-carb diet, check the nutrition info. This pasta is a lot healthier (my opinion based on the stats) than the other dry pastas we used to buy, compared apples-to-apples...even compared to whole grain / whole wheat pastas! Here's an example:<br />Al Dente Caba-Nada Egg Fettuccine v. "Brand Name" Whole Wheat High Fiber Thin Spaghetti<br />Serving Size: 2 oz (56g) dry<br />Calories: 140 v. 210 (That's a 50% difference!)<br />Total Fat: 1g v. 1.5g<br />Total Carbohydrate: 24g v. 41g<br />Dietary Fiber: 6g v. 5g<br />Sugars: 0g v. 2g<br />Protein: 12g v. 7g<br /><br />The ONLY negatives are: (1) If you run out, you can't just run to the store to grab more (I haven't found it anywhere in our area), and (2) it's a little pricey compared to other dry pasta, but it's still downright *cheap* to make a meal for my family with this pasta.<br /><br />It's now on our Amazon Subscribe-&-Save list so we never run out. I'm back today to order some other flavors. Can't wait to give them a try!

review/summary: Finally - a decent serving size!
review/text: As a recently diagnosed diabetic trying to eat very low carb, I though pasta was out of my diet but the Carb-Nada products put pasta back on the menu. The taste is much, much, much bettter than the Dreamfields pastas I tried and the serving size for Carb-Nada pastas is 1 1/2 cups - enough to actually fill me up.  Highly recommend this product - but it is overpriced on Amazon, you can get it for $6 less at netrition.com

review/summary: Very Delicious
review/text: I just became a daily coffee drinker in the last six months after trying the coffee brewed in a Keurig machine at a friend's house.  I bought my own Keurig and started trying different flavor varieties.  The Mocha Nut Fudge is very good, with a flavor that is very subtle and natural tasting, which I like.  I think all of the Green Mountain and Gloria Jean's coffees have a natural tasting flavor, and I highly recommend all of them.  I served the Moacha Nut Fudge to guests at a brunch, and they enjoyed it also.

review/summary: Good Product, used them for years, i don't know about these other guys
review/text: we have used these on our farm for over 15 years, and they aren't hard to set.  i was a little concerned when i read the reviews, thinking that they had changed the design or something, but when i got them in they were just like the old ones i have. they maybe don't set like you think they would but they do work, and the good thing about these traps as compared with others, is they have a more narrow design, which is nice since not all gopher holes are big enough for some of the other traps we have used in the past. i recommend this product (except made in china) and i just wanted to balance the reviews, this is a 5 star item as far as getting the job done is concerned.

review/summary: Excellent Trap!
review/text: This trap has several improvements over the older Victor model. Setting the trap is different than the old model but not difficult..the instructions are on the package. It has an "O" ring to attach the cord so that the cord does not interfere with the trap's mechanism, it has a hard coated paint so it doesn't corrode (corroded traps don't work as smoothly), and most important for me is that when set, the trap is smaller around than the older model. This makes it more effective in tight tunnels made by smaller gophers. We trap over 100 gophers on our ranch every year, I have 18 of these traps. Without them my pasture would look like a mine field.

review/summary: Five Star Pasta
review/text: Gia Russa is the best whole wheat pasta I've ever had, and I've tried quite a few.  Roman rigatoni is my favorite because of the cut, and the way the righe (stripes or furrows) are arranged diagonally.  This might just turn out be an aesthetic preference, but I think it actually affects the texture and taste of the pasta.  The rigatoni are chewy without being tough.  Because they're whole wheat there's less chance of overcooking by accident.  I lived in Rome but never had Roman rigatoni until I found Gia Russa at my local supermarket.  They stopped carrying it, though.  So finding it on Amazon is a real boon.<br /><br />Try their other pastas, too.  I just had a bowl of the whole wheat angel hair with garlic, olive oil, parsley, and romano cheese.  Again, the quality is so good that you can fudge a little on the cooking time.  I don't like white angel hair, and like to cook it less.  But this is divine.<br /><br />One of my favorite sauces, especially delicious with Gia Russa whole wheat pasta, is from Mark Bittman who writes for the New York Times.  It's cubed butternut squash, minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and chopped fresh tomatoes, cooked in olive oil (of course).  Saute the garlic and pepper flakes first, then add the other stuff.  Cook until the squash cubes are soft but still have most of their shape.  Add parsley and/or parmesan or romano.  Fabulous.

review/text: We could not find whole wheat rigatoni in any grocery store in our area. We looked up whole wheat items online and found that this product might be a great choice. It turns out that it is!!  We have already cooked several boxes and it has a wonderful taste! We also enjoy other whole wheat products, trying to be eating healthy. The rigatoni is a very good choice if you love pasta and want to be eating healthier. We will most likely order this product again and probably try something different also.

review/summary: Good whole-wheat Italian pasta
review/text: Any adult will prefer a rigatoni, especially slant-cut penne rigate and a shell conchiglie rigate, over spaghetti, fettuccine and other shapes of pasta, especially if its made in Italy. Italians demand that the extrusion dies have the grooves in them; compared to American dies which leave smooth surfaces. The ridges make sure that the sauce sticks and coats the bland, high carb macaroni, since it is the sauce that gives the dish flavor.<br /><br />While I've heard that the Italians actually buy Canadian and US wheat, process it into pasta and then ship it back to the States, only the Gia Russa brand claim to use Italian wheat grown near Napoli, in southern Italy. After cooking, however, it is still fairly bland tasting. Their packaging copy claims "flavor produced is a rich nutty quality--reminiscent of whole grain bread." Not here by me...but the raw pasta has a nice medium brown color.<br /><br />That said and considering American adults increasingly sedentary workstyles and desires to eat healthy with whole grains, my prior experience with American whole-wheat pasta (esp Hodgson Mill, Ronzoni Healthy Harvest, Creamettes 3-color rotini spiral-shaped) is that they don't have the technique and experience in making great pasta (it cooks quicker, but falls apart more easily, not a wide-band al dente stage). Consequently I only shop Italian-made whole-wheat pasta; having come across this Gia Russa and Racconto brands while buying it in a Wisconsin-based supermarket, not finding it at the Minnesota-based megabox incumbents.<br /><br />I still fondly remember my couple years shopping the Philadelphia metro Italian markets, where aisles and aisles where dedicated to at least 3 competing Italian brand's full pasta lines along with aisles of olive oil by the gallon tins. But it was impossible to find whole-wheat back then.<br /><br />For the last half decade, I've bought de Cecco whole-wheat spaghetti, the only whole grain pasta stocked by a St Paul, Minn Italian run liquor store with a smaller Italian meat, deli, and pasta-oil-spices section. I bought it even if it was more than triple the price of regular white pasta.<br /><br />In developing ways to make more tasty pasta so you don't have to eat as much to feel satisfied, I have turned to making a chicken, beef or pork bone and onion, ginger and chili stock to boil the pasta in, adding a couple minutes extra cooking time due to the grease slowing down the hydration process to the al dente stage. Toss in a few whole garlic too near the end before using a pair of tongs (or chopsticks) to fish the pasta out of the soup (could use a double boiler if not adept in fishing). I may add some sliced eggplant or broccoli spears to round out a one-pot meal. Add some fresh-grated parmesan or reggiano to top it off and your dish is up.<br /><br />Another variation on this theme is to add soup to a bowl of pasta or noodles to make a Ramen-like snack, tasty without the MSG and at a fraction of the cost of the packaged artificial soup and pre-fried alimentary paste. For a variation in healthy noodles, there are the Korean wheat styles made with added buckwheat, or acorn, or barley. One of the tricks with high-buckwheat noodles turning into a gooey tasteless mess is rapid firming-up in an ice-water bath in the sink. Surprisingly it works. then serve at room temp or quickly dashed with hot soup.<br /><br />I'm still looking for a Canadian Rizopia Wild Rice spaghetti to be sold in Minnesota's traditional tribal monopoly "Injun" country!

review/text: I was hoping it would be good but unfortunately the taste was awful. I am originally from Rome and I tried cooking it a few different ways and using strong sauces to cover up the taste and texture - to no avail.  I hope Gia Russa will go back to the drawing board on this one and try a better recipe. There are a lot of whole wheat pastas out there that taste better.

review/summary: Great changeup for Macallan fans
review/text: Balvenie is an old distillery that still does everything the only fashioned way.  Their copper stills are shaped differently than other distilleries and they turn all of their malt by hand (a rarity).  The Doublewood is made the traditional way of being aged in bourbon casks.  They age for 12 years and then they move them into casks that were used for sherry.  They age them there to the taste of the master distiller (averaging about 9 months), then bottle this nectar up.  This is the same method as Glenmorangie Lasanta, but with less smoke and peat and sweeter.<br /><br />Doublewood is a fruitier, lighter scotch with very little smoke in the flavor.  There is a strong hint of honey, followed by some caramel and spices (like cinnamon).  The best way to describe this to my friends, and they all agree, is that it tastes like Macallan 12, but with cinnamon added.  I love Macallan, but I love this more!  I also love that it comes in a slightly shorter bottle so it stores a little easier than the wine-size of Macallan.

review/summary: adult chocolate
review/text: I've tried several high-cacao content chocolate, and most of them are not very tasty. There's usually a waxy quality and the chocolate doesn't really seem to melt in my mouth. And the "intense" chocolate is often kind of bitter. Bitter and waxy.. what's not to like about that?!?!<br /><br />Midnight Reverie is a great mid-morning or mid-afternoon chocolate when you don't want something really sweet. The flavor is warmly intense, balanced chocolate that melts very nicely in your mouth - not too fast. But even if you get excited and chew it up - it still melts. And the intensity is not bitterness.<br /><br />I was happy to see no hydrogenated oils - which are in some of the other Ghirardelli filled dark chocolates.

review/summary: Do You Like Dark Chocolate?
review/text: If you like dark chocolate, this is a tasty and affordable version of it.  My brother brought this bag of wrapped dark chocolate squares as a gift.  The 86% cacoa wasn't too bitter for me.  It is a lovely, smooth, rich intense flavor that melts in your mouth.  The squares are thin and individually wrapped.  Each square is about 60 calories.  It's not high in sugar and nutritionists now say that dark chocolate--an oz per day--is good for you.  As a friend reminded, chocolate is a vegetable; it's a bean!<br /><br />Supposedly, the darker the chocolate the more healthy and the less calories and sugar.  I love a square of this chocolate after a meal and will be buying more of this 86% Midnight Reverie flavor.  It's a great hostess gift to give.

review/summary: Ka&ntilde;iwa is Similar but Different from Quinoa
review/text: Quinoa is, in my opinion, rather a miracle food, that has resolved many of my long-standing health problems. But this is not about Quinoa, but rather Ka&ntilde;iwa. Some refer to Ka&ntilde;iwa as "baby quinoa", which is an easy way to understand it. It is very similar to quinoa in the ways it is handled, processed and cooked. It is not just small quinoa, though, but a distinct breed. Ka&ntilde;iwa = Chenopodium pallidicaule while Quinoa = Chenopodium quinoa. You see? Different.<br /><br />There are important differences in processing and use. For processing, Quinoa when harvested is covered with a bitter unpleasant tasting compound (saponins). These make it easier to grow since it is pest-resistent, but requires special processing to remove the saponins. Ka&ntilde;iwa does not have this issue, which means you don't need to check how the grain was processed prior to purchase. For use, the ka&ntilde;iwa is more finely-grained than quinoa. Quinoa is larger and after cooking similar in size to uncooked rice. Ka&ntilde;iwa is smaller, which gives it a smoother texture. The question is really what texture you prefer. Nutritionally, they seem to be similar, although we haven't studied these very long and need more nutritional research. Specifically taking advantage of the fine texture of ka&ntilde;iwa, I like to use it in custards, breakfast dishes, desserts, cream pies, and similar foods, since it works well in creamy textured foods while adding protein and fiber and making the dishes more nutritious. I tend to use quinoa more in salads, pilafs, tabbouleh, and similarly textured dishes.

review/summary: Tiny seed like cereal- delicious superfood -great for crockpots
review/text: Cooked up excellently in a crockpot - just be sure to have enough water and if you want a more toothsome end product, don't stir. The grains are tiny, like chia seeds, but they are firm and held up well with prolonged cooking (i.e. 2+hours on high in crockpot). On the stove top, it might be more difficult to monitor. Texture wise the grains were firm albeit quite tiny, (again in size think chia) and as for the flavor- not as robust as quinoa IMHO but I have to admit I'm not a devotee of quinoa since I don't like the saponin residue that seems to linger on the grains (probably me not washing it enough though). Kaniwa is easier to prepare since it does not require any rinse - throw it in a bowl/pot and you're good to go. I love this and the fact that it offers people another healthy gluten free option. However, I wouldn't eat this as a breakfast cereal. While not distinctive in flavor like buckwheat or kashi, I think I would prefer it as a lunch/dinner option, a complement like wild rice to an entree or perhaps stuffed/mixed in with another main course dish.<br />In short, whether you like quinoa and/or other ancient grains, do give this a try. The taste is nutty, earthy (not grassy) and yes, delicious even plain. Plus, it's a nutritional powerhouse esp. good for vegetarians if the healthfood labels are accurate: 7 grams of protein for a 160 calorie (1/4cup) serving, iron 60%! You really can't go wrong! :)<br /><br />PS When opening the package, be very careful!! You do NOT want to spill this. It took me forever to suction up all the tiny seeds that escaped from a small hole I'd inadvertently made when opening the package.

review/text: I am very pleased with Wellness food.  My Basenji does really well on it.  His coat is nice & shiny and he seems to like it.  He doesn't require a special diet but, I can tell a difference now that I have switched his food to the Wellness Super5 Mix.

review/summary: Made my dog ill.
review/text: Thought I was doing a good thing for my doxie mix by getting one of the better brands as listed on dogfoodanalysis but boy was I mistaken. Gradually made the change from her old food to the new and she hates it. She has thrown up twice so far. I will be taking my loss and throwing the rest out. Back to her old food. It may be great for some dogs, just didn't work for mine.

review/summary: Made both my dogs vomit and eat less.
review/text: We switched to this food from Purina One because the ingredients are advertised to be of much higher quality, and we wanted to improve our dogs' diet. We made a smooth transition to this food by slowly mixing it in with their existing food, as vets recommend. Once the transition was complete, they were vomiting their meals several times per week, which they had never done before the switch. We continued to feed them this food for about a month to see if it changed, and they still have problems keeping it down. I often see them eating grass to induce vomiting as well, so I think its giving them a stomach ache. They also got to the point where they just didn't want to eat the food at all sometimes, which I've never seen them do. We switched to Newman's Own dog food now, and they're eating much better already.<br /><br />I wish I had done some research on this food before purchasing it. Type "Wellness dog food vomit" into Google, and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.

review/text: Wellness Super5Mix is a high quality dog food. Yes, it costs more than the junk you can buy in Wal-Mart, but as with most things in life, you get what you pay for.  Wellness keeps my beagle regular with no indigestion or diarrhea. I've tried switching to cheaper brands, but they leave him gassy, listless, and constipated. My dog isn't crazy about the taste. Of course, he'd prefer canned or, even better, table scraps. But he does eat the Wellness, and it keeps him healthy.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: A sub-par version of store bought Wellness
review/text: We've been buying this exact formula of Wellness for our Cocker Spaniel "Lucy" for over a year now.  We thought that it would be worth purchasing on Amazon since it was priced almost identically and it would be more convenient than going to Petsmart since it would be delivered to our front door.  We didn't receive the food for well over a week after we ordered it so we were forced to buy a small bag at the store until we received the food.  No big deal...we figured next time we'll just order it a couple of weeks in advance so that Lucy's food supply isn't as low and we have plenty until we get the next bag.  After feeding her two meals of the bag we got from Amazon, Lucy started having violent diarrhea.  I'm familiar with the fact that changing foods can cause an upset stomach with dogs but this is the exact same food we have been feeding her for a very long time.....or so we thought.  We knew that the only thing that changed in Lucy's diet was the fact that we ordered the food from Amazon.  So we went and bought another small bag of the same stuff from Petsmart.  Much to our disappointment, there was an obvious difference in the appearance of the food.  The bag from Amazon had chunks that were misshaped, very porous and even smelled different.  Our conclusion was that Amazon received the reject bags at a discount and sold them as the same product.  We then stopped feeding Lucy the Amazon bag and switched her back to the store bought bag.  Immediately her bowls improved.  Although we were refunded for our purchase we had to jump through a few hoops that weren't worth the time we wasted to do so.  Please reconsider before you purchase this food.  Wellness is an Amazing product and we're proud to feed our little Lucy the best food that we possibly can but this is not up to the quality that Wellness is known for.  I'm going to post pics of both the Amazon bought food and the Store bought food so that you can see the difference.

review/summary: NOT a cure-all if that's what you're looking for
review/text: My dog has severe allergies as well as a sensitive stomach. After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble.  Well, let me say...I'm disappointed.  It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching.  The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my "stomach of steel" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.<br /><br />While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this. Could it be just my dog, sure. But all in all, if you're looking for a magic cure, sorry to say this isn't the one it's hyped to be.

review/text: I have had my German Shepherd on Canidae (chicken) since she was a puppy and did wonderful. Well, Canidae had a recall last winter & I had to switch her, so I tried Wellness (chicken).  I have to say, I am really disappointed with this dog food. Besides her not really liking it, her breathe smells bad, has very loose to diarrhea stools, and she has been licking her paws & shaking her head like her ears are bugging her ( which she never has done before and that is a sign of allergies). I noticed the chicken formula is back on the market and I will for sure be switching.

He is now vomiting on the Wellness replacement - and we're seeking yet another alternative - but, it won't be from this company.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED
review/text: I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. But I just thought I'd try to give everyone a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/text: The idea is great. Save trips to the store and is cheaper than the stores but when I opened the bag, it smelled funny and color is much lighter than the ones that I bought from the stores. My two Labradors actually turn their heads away from the kibbles. How do you return the opened bag with loose kibbles ? So I tried to feed the kibbles to the dogs and they were having diarrhea or very soft stool and I'm not happy with that type of situation at all. The Wellness dog food is good but something about shipping makes me wonder.... Anyway I went to the local pet store got the same kibbles and my babies are happy ever after.

review/summary: Good Going In, Bad Coming Out
review/text: After losing a dog at the age of 9, we looked into providing our pets with a better quality dog food just in case the Purina Pro Plan they had been eating was even partially responsible for her early death.<br /><br />The Wellness dry foods were one of the brands we tried. We took the effort to slowly introduce the food and gave it a good 4 months before finally giving up.<br /><br />Our dogs did not seem to really like this food. I am not sure if it was the taste or if it was the terrible gas or diarrhea it gave them. It would sit in their bowl for hours before they finally gave in and finished it.<br /><br />After much thought we decided that we would rather our dogs enjoy their food and not suffer from daily diarrhea than force them to eat this food, even if it might extend their life a little.<br /><br />We settled on Science Diet brand. They gobble it up at every meal and have returned to normal bowel movements. I realize the ingredients are not as good as Wellness brand, but I feel better about their quality of life.

Not only did I scarf that one up, I poured myself another heaping bowl of this dry goodness (by the by, it's even better wet).<br /><br />  Here's the really crazy thing about Wellnesss Dry, I don't even like sweet potato.  I don't know what spices they put in this, but kudos (kudogs?) to the chefs at Wellness.  They have provided a product that is good enough to double as munchies at my next party.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention how full and shiny my hair looks.  Keep doing what you're doing Wellness!

review/text: Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference!

review/text: I have three dogs, a minpin, a lab, and an aussie pup. My min-pin got sick recently. It was pancreatitis and kidney problems. His liver was a mess too. After he got out of the vet hospital (800 bucks later) they wanted him to eat a prescription food that they sold. He hated it. Would NOT eat it.<br /><br />I got the Wellness through a reccomendation and it has been a life-saver. My minpin is healthy now. His liver is fine, as are his kidneys and pancreas. He looks years younger with his shiny coat. My lab and my pup are looking fabulous as well.<br /><br />Whats ironic is that I WAS feeding a supermarket wet food and it was costing me 90 bucks a month to feed these guys. Now, it's cheaper, they are healthier and they LOVE it. I have never seen dogs freak over dry food like they do over this.<br /><br />If you can afford it, I highly recommend this product. It saves you money in the long run and makes your pets happy and healthy.

review/text: My black German Shepherd has allergies to corn & wheat, which seems to be the primary ingredients in most dog foods.  We suffered with her for years, cooking chicken, hamburger, rice to keep her healthy until we found the WELLNESS products.  They have turned her into a beautiful, not scratching or licking youthful dog.  We are also now feeding our lab and corgi the same foods with similar results.  Thank You Wellness!  (Incidentally the foods sold by the vet as hypo-allergenic had either corn syrup &/or wheat germ in it.  We read all labels now, all the way thru the fine print!)  Another added benefit for the larger dogs is the incorporation of glucosamine & chondroitin into it, saving additional vet bills.

So i put her on another food all the while hoping the Wellness formula would change a tad so i could try her on it again. I transitioned her onto the new Wellness about two weeks ago and she is doing fantastic!!

review/text: I was concerned about the effect "regular" dog food was having on our dogs. We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  "high-end" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!

review/summary: GOOD FOOD!
review/text: I have used this product for five years now for both of my shelties. They like the taste, there coats are much smoother and it has lessened the number of seizures my female gets and there severity. I will continue to use the fish and sweet potato food regardless of price.<br />Update:<br />On Thanksgiving day of 2010 my female sheltie passed away. This broke my heart, she was my best buddy. I can't help but think her Whitefish and Sweet Potato food had something to do with giving her a very long healthy life. She lived to be 17, and was playful up to the end. My vet agrees that this food and good exercise was instrumental in extending both my shelties lives. I now have a new sheltie puppy and a rescued 6yr old sheltie female. Needless to say they are both on Wellness brand Whitefish and Sweet Potato food. There snacks have always been Blue Dog Bakery products supplemented with fresh baby carrots.

review/summary: My dog will only eat this brand
review/text: My pug had stomach problems and I have tried every food out there.  The only thing that worked was Science diet until I found this one.  Its more natural and my dog does enjoy eating it more and have not had any problems since I switched a couple of years ago.  Love this brand.

review/summary: The best so far
review/text: Due to allergies on the part of one dog, and pickiness on the part of the other, I've switched to natural dog food over the past year.  Of them all, my dogs love this stuff the best.  It has a nice smell and texture, and is more easily chewed by the elderly dog.  Relatives who hadn't seen the dogs for a few months immediately commented on the healthier appearance and renewed vigor of the dogs.

review/text: This is all I feed my baby. She is a 12 year old Boston Terrior. She has allergies but this is the only food I have found that does not break her out. It is easy to digest and keeps her wieght under control. She likes the taste and it has the great stuff for her skin in it. If your dog is having skin problems I hightly recommend trying this food. It is the BEST!!!

review/summary: No more gas
review/text: Boxers are known for being susceptible to gas. My Boomer is aptly named, but since switching to Wellness dry with about a third of a can of Wellness canned food, fed once  a day, he stays slim, energetic and blessedly flatulance-free. I also note, over a few months, that skin bumps are disappearing. I've tried several top brands, and this seems the most healthful.

review/summary: Extremely healthy for you dogs!
review/text: I highly recommend ALL Wellness products!! My Shih Tzu's were plaqued with severe allergy problems,, Spent $$$$ after $$$$ at vet for relief for them, nothing seemed to work.. I did extensive research on dog food and found out the mainstream brands are all crap, nothing but by products, additives, nothing natural about any of them.. Did research on Wellness and Blue Buffalo, look them up, you will find out for yourself.. Their products are all natural, no additives, no preservatives, 100% meat from animals that are NOT fed growth hormones, etc.. My dogs have been on this food, both wet and dry and they are thriving and the picture of health, bright eyes, shiny coats, full of energy and NO MORE allergies..

review/summary: this cured my dogs allergies!
review/text: I have a Shih Tzu that will be soon turn 3.  I had her on a grain free Chicken diet until several months ago when she started having allergy problems.  Her constant licking and scratching drove me thru the roof.  My vet put her on a very expensive pill (like $60 a month), and recommended to me that I find her a diet with one "novel" protein.<br /><br />So, I went on-line and did some research.  Wellness was always something I was curious about.  I went on their website and found out that I could get some free samples.  After speaking with their customer service rep, I was informed that this Whitefish and Sweet Potato formula was their number one food recommended for dogs with allergies.  So, the company mailed me two trial size bags of this kibble.<br /><br />Well, it worked.  I've had my dog on this food for about 5 months now and she's completely stopped her licking and scratching in about a month.  I slowly weaned her off of her prescription allergy pill as well.  My vet is very, very impressed.<br /><br />I would give this food 10 stars if I could!

review/summary: Best Dog Food Ever
review/text: After bouts with Pancreatitis in both of my schnauzers (neither are overweight, but have major sensitivities to fat content), this is the only food I can feed them without worrying if it's right for them.  It has no corn, which is fantastic--unlike other cheaper brands.  It might be $10 more than you're used to spending on dog food, but it is worth it.  They are your family and deserve to eat as well (or better--haha) than we do.  I love my dogs more than anything which is why I will only feed them this.  (They love it too!!)

review/summary: Package and shipping issue
review/text: I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged.  I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any "I am sorry for your inconvenience" or any other type of apology.  I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked.<br />The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy.  I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again.  If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: For your overweight dog.
review/text: I have a 3 year old poodle the vet told me she was a little on the heavy side. I was recommended these dog food. She loves it and ive noticed that she has already dropped some pounds. The only con it is a little pricey. But if your loooking for a good deal shop here. Pets mart and Pet co will charge you 7.00 or more in shipping. Amazon gave me free shipping you can not beat that!!! and usually the stores wont carry such a large bag. Def a good product if your dog is unactive and overweight.

review/summary: Happy Chihuahua
review/text: My long haired chihuahua is overweight. Her ideal weight is approximately 6-7lbs, however she currently weighs approximately 9lbs (this is my fault, I overdid it on the treats). She loved her Wellness brand super5mix adult formula for small breeds kibble, but I recently noticed the small breeds weight reduction version being sold at PetSupermarket, and decided to switch her over.<br /><br />I was worried she would not like it, as I had once unsuccessfully tried to switch her over to the other Wellness Super5Mix weight control kibble (purple bag, normal sized kibble). Surprisingly she took to the taste of the Wellness Small Breed Weight Control kibble almost immediately. I didn't even need to ween her off of the Wellness original kibble, just gave her the weight control formula and she liked it, no problems with her digestion. The color of the kibble is slightly less brown than the original adult formula, but she did not seem to notice a difference at all. She likes the small size of the kibble, and recently I have noticed that she has lost about 4 ounces... not much but it is a start. Hopefully with exercise and some restraint by me, she will be within her normal weight range, but I am happy I made the switch and will continue to purchase this brand.<br />TIP: My dog is a picky eater, so I sometimes mix a bit of water into the food which causes the food to give off an aroma, which draws her to it. It also makes it easier for her to eat because it softens the kibble. It's also good because it keeps her hydrated... Just an FYI.
