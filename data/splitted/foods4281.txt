review/summary: Big Squeeze Needed
review/text: How can you have something fruit flavored without calories of any type?  In this drink it is because you have a lot of chemicals and vague "flavors" that you can add to water and in one squeeze you'll have the equivalent flavor of  fruit punch in this case.  Except that squeeze needs to be a big one to actually make the water taste like fruit punch instead of just water or water with a chemical edge.<br /><br />Normally I only drink water between meals and at meals either 100% fruit juice or skim milk so I'm not expecting a sugary drink.  However when I tried a small squeeze of this additive it made the water taste horrible, a very strong and difficult to describe chemical taste.  It took me several attempts to find an amount, about 5X the simple squeeze, before the water had a positive fruity flavor.  What this means is that one bottle ends up not flavoring nearly as many drinks as it claims.<br /><br />If you really dislike the flavor of water, something I really can't undertand, and using this will get you to drink more, sure give it a try but just know it is unlikely to last as long as the package claims.

review/summary: Want to squeeze your vitamins? Now's your chance.
review/text: I don't drink energy drinks at all. No Monster, no Red Bull, no Bawls, no Monster Bull Bawls...none of that. Usually I stick with water and occasionally go with plain milk, but I requested Vitamin Squeeze Energy just to try it out. And you know what? This stuff isn't bad. I'm a bit confused on how much the serving size is actually supposed to be, since it simply states "one squeeze", but it tastes like a watered down fruit punch of sorts, with way more nutrients. That's a big plus, yet the usual artificial sweetener taste bugs me, and the burning question of just what they all really threw into this mixture.<br /><br />Fill a glass with water, squeeze this stuff into it, and you're good to go. No measurement is given- everything you need to know is essentially shown right there on the front of the label. It's nice to see that you get 120% of your daily dose of Vitamin C when using this, but again, it's hard to tell if you're getting more or less than that since everyone's "squeeze" is different.<br /><br />If you enjoy energy drinks on a regular basis, I'd recommend this as a somewhat healthier alternative. For some weird reason, I prefer this over good ol' Hawaiian Punch.

review/summary: A Product Without a Need
review/text: After drinking a full 16 oz. bottle of Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch I would much rather wash down a vitamin C tablet and a few "NoDoze" with some nice cool clear water. The only reason I can think of to buy something like this would be to provide vitamins and energy in a form that was so pleasing it would encourage you to drink it. This product fails on that account. The flavor is not horrible, but is not something I would seek out. I put the recommended two "squeezes" (whatever that is) into a 16 oz bottle of water and started drinking. I kept adding the concentrate a little at a time trying to produce a decent fruit punch taste. Mixed at twice the recommended strength it still tasted weak and vaguely chemical.<br /><br />Again, at twice the proscribed mix, I noticed no "buzz" from the caffeine either. With so many similar products out there, it seems to me that a company wanting to compete in this market would concentrate on flavor, aroma and appearance. It takes no skill to put some chemicals in a liquid and bottle it. Turning that liquid into something people might want to consume is another thing. I think Vitamin Squeeze needs to keep working on it.

review/summary: Too sweet, but might come in handy in emergencies
review/text: I have mixed feelings about this drink concentrate. On one hand, it really is easy to use, and dissolves qquickly in water - without even needing to stir. However, on the other hand, it tastes like children fruit punches - with extra sweetener.<br /><br />It basically is a mix of several vitamins, lots of chemicals, red dye, and artificial sweetener (sucralose/splenda). Half of these things are good for your body, while the rest is not so much.<br /><br />I would keep some in case of emergencies - a quick fix of vitamin C drink when necessary. But, I would not regularly consume it.

review/summary: Nice taste, lasting energy, but gives me a lasting headache.
review/text: I like the effects of this drink, however, it gives me a headache that I can't get rid of.  I made it just like the directions said, I even weighed it out in milliliters, and measured one cup of water to it.  At that measurement, it is a little weak, but still good.  It gave me great energy, that lasted for 4 hours or more.  It's not the kind of energy that the energy drinks give me, where I'm all jittery and feel weird.  The second time I mixed it, I used more, about 3 times as much and it made me way to energetic and it felt like I was on speed.  If you are sensitive to caffeine, you need to be careful with this stuff.<br /><br />Pros---<br />Nice taste, tastes just like Hawaiian Punch.<br />Gives lasting energy.<br /><br />Cons---<br />Lid leaks, no matter how hard I screwed it on.  Don't get this on your clothes, or it will never come out.  I got it on my counter and had to use bleach to get it off, even though I wiped it right up.<br />Can be really strong to people who are sensitive to caffeine.<br />Tastes like a child's fruit drink, which some adults may not like.<br />Loaded with artificial ingredients and artificial red dye, but you most likely know that if you read about it.<br /><br />I am giving this 2 stars because of the headache issue.  I would like this stuff, if it didn't give me a headache.  So, if you are looking for a water enhancement that gives you lasting energy, you don't mind that the lid leaks horribly, and you like the taste of Hawaiian Punch, then give this a try.

review/summary: Leaks, Stains and Irritates! Vitamin Squeeze Needs Improvement
review/text: I was excited to try this because I drink mostly flavored water and I work overnight. I am always in needed of caffeine. I liked the fact that Vitamin Squeeze would help me get in my daily dose of Vitamin's. Unfortunately, Vitamin Squeeze was a huge let down. First of all, it says that you only need one squeeze. I tried what I determined a squeeze to be and my water verily tasted flavored. I added the proper amount (about 5-8 squeezes) to get the coloring of what a fruit punch flavored drink should look like.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze tasted like watered down, but sugary Kool-aid. I actually liked the flavor and continued to drink it. I definitely felt a slight energy increase. It was not enough to make you buzzed, but enough to notice a difference. My biggest problem then came when it was time to take the Vitamin Squeeze home (I first tried it at work). The lid was completely closed and it LEAKED everywhere! On top of that, the red dye in Vitamin Squeeze stained my hand and my desk. I was able to get the stains out, but not happy with the crappy container that this product comes in. I also do not like that fact that IT HAS TO BE REFRIGERATED and you have to shake well before each use. For me, this takes away a lot of the convenience factor. I want something I can take with me places.<br /><br />PROS:<br />*Makes water taste better<br />*You get a larger container for your money<br />*Contains Vitamins and Electrolytes<br />*Sugar, Carb and Calorie free<br /><br />CONS:<br />*You have to add more than you do with similar drinks<br />*It has to be Refrigerated<br />*You have to shake well before using<br />*Has a slight after-taste<br />*You have to limit intake due to Vitamins (too much is bad for you too) and caffeine<br />*The bottle is not secure<br />*It stains<br /><br />Overall, this product has more Cons than Pros. I will not be purchasing any Vitamin Squeeze and I recommend you try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOQKA">MIO Black Cherry, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> instead.

review/summary: Fine product, lousy packaging
review/text: First of all, don't store it right-side-up as pictured. The opening's on the bottom of the container, and it leaks.<br />Secondly, set your beverage in the sink before adding this flavoring to it, especially if you already stored it "right-side-up" and it's leaked into the lid.<br />Third, have a paper towel or kitchen rag ready to clean up the bright red drops before they stain anything.<br /><br />That settled, though, the product inside is actually pretty good. It has a decent flavor, no bad sugar-free aftertaste, and no calories. I do like it.<br /><br />Besides, storing it up-side-down in the fridge and knowing to add it to beverages sitting in the sink solve the mess problem, even if they don't keep leaks from wasting the product itself.

review/summary: Vitamins Please!
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch flavor is delicious. It's in an easy to hold, flexible 12-Ounce container with a flip top. The Fruit Punch flavor is fortified with Vitamin C; 120% of the recommended daily total and taurine which is an essential nutrient said to be necessary for retinal health and found in animal protein. If you're a vegetarian like I am this might be for you! I take it with me to work and add it to my after noon glass of water for a quick pick me up.<br />On the plus side: The color is a vibrant red, there is no nasty after taste. The flavor can be as rich and full as you like, there are no calories, no jittery feeling and no crash. It includes electrolytes which sometimes need replenished due to aggressive work outs or fluid depleting illness. Also the container is double that of the MiO water enhancers.<br />On the down side, it leaves an odd residue on the inside of plastic bottles, so if you are one that likes to reuse them, you won't want to keep the bottle for long. Also because it does that, I'm less inclined to use this product in my stainless steel drinking bottles. If you use it at home, the residue washes off easily with the slightest hand scrubbing. But I noticed it was still present after the dish washing cycle finished. I will say it may have been my dish machine soap not being top grade. If you are all about portability, it's a bulkier package than the MiO.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product due to the convenience of having vitamins on the go, as well as on color and flavor.

review/summary: Strong Syrupy Flavor, Zero Energy
review/text: First, you have to gnaw your way through the "certified frustration free packaging," I recommend a steak knife.  Second, you squeeze one dose into eight ounces of water.  Stir and hold you nose as you drink.  Ok, you don't actually have to hold your nose, but the super sweet flavor will go down a bit easier that way.  Finally, wait for the energy to kick in.  Myself, I tried this four days ago, and I'm still waiting.  Pure gimmick, nothing else.  I'm sure it's all full of vitamins as it says, but it certainly isn't full of energy.<br /><br />On the plus side, it has zero calories, sugar, and carbs, so it won't make you fat as you sit there listlessly.  I also have to say that the squeeze dispenser is pretty cool, and there is no mess afterwards.  Nevertheless, I mixed it into 12 ounces of water, and I could barely swallow the thick, syrupy mixture.  The flavor is overwhelming, and nowhere near pleasant.  Give this one a pass.

review/summary: Unnatural & Artificial
review/text: Back in the day I used to love the single use Crystal Light packets that you would pour into a 16.9 oz water bottle and drink. I also used to drink soda, high fructose corn syrup, and a bunch of terrible-for-you preservatives and artificial flavors. Since then I've come to realize the health risks associated with artificial colors and flavors and added chemicals in our food and drink and try to avoid them when possible. Since these pour in drink flavors have become popular I've been looking for one that was natural and good for you. This one isn't it.<br /><br />First you have Sucralose, (best known for Splenda), which is actually not a zero calorie sweetener (2-4 calories per serving or squeeze in this case, but the FDA doesn't require labeling of calories for less than 5 per serving). But calories isn't the problem with Sucralose, it is the possibility of glycemic load, which it does impact although very little per packet. But if you drink this throughout the day you are messing with your sugar. (See nutritiondata.self. com and look it up). Why not go natural with a Stevia extract? Same sweetness, no glycemic load and not a chemical.<br /><br />Also, Sodium Benzoate is a preservative that when mixed with Ascorbic Acid (which is also in this,) forms Benzene a carcinogen (read: poison.) Google it. The people feeding us this poison say it is in such a small dose that it is safe. Poison... safe?<br /><br />And there are more, but one thing you should definitely know is that the ingredient list here at Amazon doesn't show all the ingredients on the label. Consider artificial color Red 40, which "According to research conducted by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a possible link exists between food dyes and childhood health disorders such as hyperactivity, behavior problems and even pediatric cancer" (Live Strong). Also included Gum Acacia, Glyceryl Abietate and Chromium Polynicotinate (which is actually good for you and helps prevent diabetes). Why hide the other ingredients? (Why even have them all?)<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are looking for a natural flavor enhancer to add to water, like I was, then this product will let you down.<br /><br />Oh, and it tastes like Kool-Aid.

review/summary: One Way to Get Your Caffeine
review/text: Water "enhancers", or "energy" drinks are all the rage now. So this new one by the stand alone company of Vitamin Squeeze, is entering a crowded market. Claiming to be an all natural flavored product, the list of ingredients on the bottle is pretty long (longer than the ingredients listed on both Amazon and the companies webpage). Vitamins A, B3, B5, B6, B12, and C have been "added", along with Taurine, Magnesium, electrolytes, and caffeine. Each serving squeeze flavors an 8 oz glass of water, and there are 24 servings in a bottle (or perhaps not - see below).<br /><br />To put this enhancer in perspective, a typical 1oz serving of espresso packs a punch of 40 to 75 mg of caffeine; 40 mg is what this water enhancer provides in an 8 oz glass. The added benefit with the squeeze is that you don't have to add calories via cream and sugar, and you've got a few vitamins thrown in as well. Another plus, is the convenience of simply squeezing in the flavor and caffeine.<br /><br />However, taste wise, the fruit punch tastes like sugar free gum. So yes, it's got that weird phony aftertaste that makes you screw up your face after drinking it. Another problem comes from the squeeze method per serving. One full squeeze delivers much more than is recommended, so each bottle comes no where near 24 servings.<br /><br />All and all, I'm going to stick to coffee and tea for my caffeine, and truly natural juices for my vitamins.

review/text: I thought this might be a good way to get the best of both worlds: water plus vitamins. However, the taste was so awful, I couldn't do it. It tasted like bad Kool-Aid. I tried it four times just to see if I could get past the taste for the benefits, but it was a no-go. And on the fourth try, I squeezed the vitamin mix into my water and the vitamin bottle started leaking all over my hand and the counter. I didn't get it all wiped up and it dried super sticky. Makes me wonder just how much sugar was in it! I think I'll go back to the old fashioned way of taking vitamins.

review/summary: Kool - Aid with a KICK.
review/text: This is unlike the concentrates that I've ever tried. I like the taste and ease to use. It has concentrated sugar that adds a real nice flavor. As you can tell in the ingredients listed on the product page it has vitamin C listed third, behind water and critic acid. Also a natural form of caffiene, B3 and B6. These provide a pick me up to me after consuming a couple of 8 oz glasses with ice. The bottle is enough to last me about a month, when drinking about 8 oz a day on average. it comes in handy when I run out of soda or don't want a cup of coffee. The amount of natural caffiene is low and does not give me a nervous or jittery type feeling. I use a little less than the suggested amount because of my taste due to the fact that I prefer less sweet drinks.<br /><br />The price is good, and the Subscribe and Save brings it down another 15%. The bottle fits easy into my hand and the cap is sturdy enough to hold upside down and shake without spilling a drop. I would recommend this product as a semi energy drink or a replacement for Kool-aid, as it does have some valuable vitamins.

review/text: A few years ago we figured out that on our trips to Disney we could just get free cups of water and add these types of mixtures to them.  I like the Ocean Spray ones and the kids like Crystal Light.  We've also tried Mio and were reasonably satisfied.<br /><br />But this is the best one I've tasted and the squeeze bottle is more convenient than indivual serving pouches.  I especially liked that the punch doesn't overwhelm with sweetness.  It's a grow-up taste, not a kid one.<br /><br />The vitamins are just an added benefit.

She's tried almost every brand/flavor of water additive on the market - from Crystal Light to Mio - she's tried just about all of them.  So when I'd received this product...I thought she'd be the perfect taste tester.<br /><br />She used Vitamin Squeeze (fruit punch) with both bottled distilled water as well as bottled spring water...and enjoyed it with both.  She described the taste as "a pleasant fruity flavor" but warned to stick with a single squeeze serving - otherwise the flavor became quickly overpowering.  She added that she liked the fact that essential vitamins were added to the water.  All in all - she enjoyed this product BUT also felt that, despite the decent flavor, it really doesn't stand out from the crowd of water additives.

review/summary: Don't Waste Your Time Or Money!
review/text: The main reason I got this drink mix was I'm trying to cut back on my soda consumption. I'm trying to drink more water but get bored with it after consuming so much sugar with soda. I thought this would be a great way to liven up my water.<br /><br />The added vitamins were just a bonus. I couldn't prove if they were really in the mix or not or even if I noticed anything related to them.<br /><br />I did notice that it had sucralose and could sure taste it. The first thing I tasted was that fake sugar. I'm sorry dieter, how the heck can you choke that stuff down? There may have been an after taste of fruit punch, but if there was, I really couldn't taste it.<br /><br />The ad said that it has energy in it. Just like the vitamins, I didn't feel any different or energized after I drank the mix. I did get a major headache, which is from the sucralose.<br /><br />I would never buy this product. But I'm sure there are people out that that will not have a problem with the sucralose or flavor being nearly nonexistent. If that is what you are looking for, you will want this mix. Otherwise, don't waste you time or money.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: Tastes like Crystal Light
review/text: I used to buy Crystal Light all the time, the kind that had vitamins and stuff in it, and this tastes like the citrus or tropical or something fruit punch flavor which I rather like. I gave up Crystal Light a long time ago in favor of water, I figure who needs to be consuming sucralose, but lately I've been making these concoctions of vitamin C powder and/or MSM powder, the juice of a few limes, some liquid stevia and sometimes an Ester-C packet and I thought I could add this in place of the Ester-C and the stevia and then I'd have a tasty beverage WITH caffeine in it but still with the vitamins.<br />So, I made my concoction this way, and it tasted fine. The one thing I was unsure about was the serving size. The bottle says "one squeeze", and I think a squeeze could end up being quite a lot of the bottle if you were quite zealous about it. The side of the bottle says that a serving is 1/2 ounce, which I originally calculated as two tablespoons, but on further reflection I realized my math must be off and it's one tablespoon, but originally I put two tablespoons in 8 oz of water and it tasted about the right strength to me, so that's about how much I was using. I'd think with one tablespoon it would be a bit weak, but this means I only got 12 servings out of my bottle and not 24.<br />Compared to my usual concoction, a glass of this stuff has almost no vitamin C. It does have 120% of the RDA, but compared to what I usually have that is laughably little. It also says it has 40mg of caffeine in a serving, so I tried drinking a bunch of it in an afternoon, but it didn't make me feel a caffeine buzz or anything.<br />Anyway, I've used almost all the bottle and won't be seeking it out when it's gone. The flavor is basically good but I'm not into all that sucralose, artificial color and it kind of rubs me the wrong way that it says "each squeeze into water adds more flavor and nutrition". Like it's some kind of health food product or something. Ooooh...nutritious! Why have fruits and vegetables when you can just have vitamin squeeze energy drink!?

review/summary: This would be a great product if it had no caffeine.
review/text: This product is very easy to use. Just squeeze into your water. I like that you can control the amount of sweetness. If you like your drinks sweeter, just add a bit more. The fruit punch flavor tastes just like Kool-Aid's fruit punch flavor. It is zero calories. One serving is one squeeze. It contains 24 servings per 12 ounce bottle.<br /><br />Each serving contains:<br />40 mg CAFFEINE<br />Vitamin C  120%<br />Vitamin B6  40%<br />Vitaimin B5  40%<br />Vitamin B3  40%<br />Vitamin B12  40%<br />Chromium  10%<br /><br />Once the bottle is opened it does need to be refrigerated. It also says that it should be used within 30 days after opening.<br /><br />The sweetener used in this product is sucralose.<br /><br />I think a big drawback of this product it that there are 40mg of caffeine per serving. I try to limit the amount of caffeine in my diet, so this product is not something I will be using again. Also, this makes it something I would avoid giving to kids.

review/summary: A good fruit punch alternative
review/text: The Vitamin Squeeze is a great alternative to buying regular bottles of fruit punch: it's sugar free and concentrated so a small bottle goes a long way. It contains some vitamins, which is probably why the manufacturer feels entitled to pompously claim "Nutritious" on the label. I think it's more than a bit of a stretch, but I suppose it's better than guzzling gallons of HFCS-sweetened fruit punch. I would rather see a version free of food coloring and sweetened with Steevia, but this is a step in the right direction. It tastes pretty good although people used to sugary drinks will probably hate the sucralose aftertaste (they'd hate Steevia even more!)<br /><br />Worth a try if you like fruit punch.

review/summary: Just OK.
review/text: We use a lot of water additives in our house, the main ones being Crystal Light and Mio. I was hoping this Vitamin Squeeze fruit punch would be a tasty change of pace, since it also has added vitamins. It's decent, but not as good as I was hoping. I tried it with differing amounts in a few separate bottles of water, and found that in order to taste good I need three small squeezes per bottle. My wife was the same when she tried it, and we both decided that it still tastes vaguely like watered down Hawaiian Punch. Not terrible, but not really tasty and certainly not as good as the Crystal Light packets we use most often, although the trade off with the added vitamins may be worth it.

review/summary: Lacks flavor, hard to figure out the exact right squeeze!
review/text: 3 Stars for me is an It's OK product. I don't love it and I don't hate it. Here the flavor is not the best (though it's not as bad as some others I have tasted). I appreciate the vitamins though and if one did not eat well this would certainly help with assuring at least basic amounts of vitamins in the system. I'm not an expert on how our bodies use vitamins or usable sources but in layman's terms it seems all right.<br /><br />I found it tolerable when I could squeeze the right amount but it's a bigger bottle and 1. a little unwieldy to cart around 2. hard to get any real measurement on. It is too easy to put too much or too little. I dislike tinkering - which is why I tend to favor the packets..I know exactly what the product tastes like and how to use it. No muss no fuss. I found at work when I was getting ready to get ice and water I naturally grabbed a packet instead of this.<br /><br />I didn't notice I felt any better (or worse) after drinking it - no better energy or disposition. In short it is o.k. but in an arena with a lot of options this one needs to go back to R&D for some fixing before it's ready for prime time to be a viable competitor. Whether it is something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040Q10TA">Crystal Light Metabolism + Green Tea Peach Mango Drink Mix On The Go 10-0.08 oz packets (6 Pack)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4CCSQ">MIO Liquid Peach Tea, 1.62-Ounce, (Pack of 4)</a> the other options available are much better packaged with better flavor and user experience.

review/summary: Tastes Great: Probably a Waste of Money
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, is 12 ounce container of fruit flavored liquid vitamin-rich concoction that you add to water.  Each bottle is supposed to make 24 servings, but it's impossible to gauge how much you are squeezing out of the bottle each time.<br /><br />The inner seal tab broke off when I pulled on it, and I had to stab the seal with a knife to get the bottle open. Then I squeezed into the bottle of water I was going to add the supplement to, and a red stream of Vitamin Squeeze shot across the counter top - missing the bottle all together.  Not a good start.<br /><br />I started over, and made sure my aim was directly into the bottle of water.  One squeeze?  No real fruity taste.  Two squeezes?  I'm drinking fruit punch.<br /><br />Besides vitamin C, there's nothing in this "energy drink" that makes it worth the ridiculous price.  Add the fact that it's messy and way to hard to tell how much you are squeezing out, I'd pass on purchasing this item.<br /><br />Tastes good; but better to just spend your money on real fruit.  That way you get vitamins, fiber, and the satisfaction of eating real food.

review/summary: Middle of the road
review/text: I've been using water enhancers for a couple of years and I started with the powdered varieties that had to be stirred up to dissolve.  I then began using Mio when it came out.<br /><br />"Vitamin Squeeze" takes the enhancer game a step higher, by adding vitamin C, caffeine, and taurine.  It touts itself as an "energy drink", but I honestly didn't feel any bump in energy when I used it.  It has about half the caffeine of a cup of coffee.  The fruit punch flavor is tolerable, but has a "chemical" after taste - it's difficult to get artificial fruit flavors right and this could use some work.  The artificial colors and flavors remove it from the "healthy" category.  "Vitamin Squeeze" also requires refrigeration after it's been opened which is a little inconvenient for me at work, but not necessarily a deal breaker.  The flavor isn't overly intense; one squeeze gives a hint of fruit punch flavor but if you like a stronger flavored beverage, a lot more than one squeeze will be needed.<br /><br />All in all, it's a passable water enhancer, but I wouldn't want to rely on it as a vitamin source or even as an energy drink.

review/summary: Good alternative energy drink
review/text: I like that this has sucralose and not nutrasweet in it.  It takes one squeeze to flavor a glass of water.  It has several vitamins, specifically focused on energy - like the B vitamins, and it contains caffiene.  I much prefer this to the little vitamin drinks, and it is a better deal.  I like that it is zero calories.  The taste could be a bit better, but really, no energy drinks are all that good, and I feel better if my teen wanted to drink some of it occasionally than the other brands of canned energy drinks that I see his friends with.  I think it's good that you get the water with it - a lot of times a bit of hydration, aka water, is an energy booster in and of itself, and helps you think better.  It's a generous sized package in a handy size.  There's a lot to like about this, but I'd try some of the other flavors.  This one wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly what I'd call good - it's a long way from a real punch juice drink, but it's drinkable enough to down pretty fast when you need an energy burst.  I wouldn't use it as a regular water enhancer though.  I'd rather just put some mint or juice in my water if I wanted that.

review/text: This is an energy drink concentrate in a squeeze bottle. Unlike what you might expect the squeezes are not measured, so you can squeeze as much concentrate as you want with each squeeze. The flavor is very mediocre. It was more like cool-aid than a punch flavor with any actual fruit in it. It purports to be good for you (it has vitamins added) but I seriously doubt there is any usable nutrition in this product. It does have caffeine and taurine, so in high enough doses it can be used as a stimulant. While it was drinkable I didn't detect any real thirst quenching capability. In short, it just seems like another product trying to jump on the caffeinated sports drink bandwagon.

review/summary: It's decent - okay taste, and some vitamins
review/text: If you're going to be out-and-about with a bottle of water, this might be a good addition just to give it some variety and taste.<br /><br />I gave this a three-star review when I first tried it. I thought it was okay, but nothing special. It tastes fine. Other reviewers have noticed a bit of an aftertaste, and I agree. I wouldn't say it's unpleasant, but it's present.<br /><br />But, over time I've used the whole bottle, and it's grown on me. It is pretty refreshing, and adds a good boost to a normal glass of water. So I went from "okay" to actually liking it. So I boosted it to four stars.<br /><br />The flavor does avoid that chemical taste that some of these enhancers seem to have.<br /><br />The vitamins are a benefit, though I'm never sure if the benefit offsets the chemicals and sucralose ingredients.<br /><br />I noticed no extra 'energy,' but I don't really notice when I drink a soda either. It's just sort of 'there.' Which is better than being jittery, and since this has taurine, like Red Bull, I was wondering about that - did not happen, though, and that's good. Ultimately, 'energy' is subjective and difficult to define from person to person.<br /><br />The drink does at least some of what it says it will do - it gives flavor to water, and apparently does provide vitamins. It tastes pretty good, and adds some life to boring tap water. But, if you're caffeine-sensitive, it's probably best used in morning and early afternoon.<br /><br />As I said, I've updated this as of July 15, from my original three stars to four stars.

review/summary: Better than Mio
review/text: There is a lot to like about this drink. The flavor is rich but not too sweet. The size of the bottle is larger than its competitors The drink is touted as an energy drink and has 40mg of caffeine, about the same as an 8 oz can of Coke. The issue with this is that people tend to squirt different amounts in their water so the serving size as well as the caffeine intake is subject to this.<br /><br />The other issue I have with all of these drinks is that you must use the bottle up in a month once it is opened. This drink, unlike Mio, must be refrigerated after opening so you cannot carry it around with you. It is also too large to carry around in a normal sized purse.<br /><br />The drink also claims it has 120 mg of vitamin C in every portion. The daily recommended intake is 70 mg so drinking this should fill one's quota-I would hope.<br /><br />All in all there is a lot to like about this drink and very little to dislike.

review/summary: Vitamin B does give you energy. This product is not misleading.
review/text: It always astounds me when reviews for a drink mix complain about artificial flavors and sweeteners. That is pretty much a given.  The product comes from a grocery shelf in a container. Why are there expectations that the product should be the all-natural equivalent of picking a piece of fruit off of a tree? To begin with, the flavor is fruit punch. When has that ever been a natural flavor?  Please.  Those concerned with this issue wouldn't be near any aisle containing this type of product.<br /><br />If you want all natural...drink lemon water.  Flavor and vitamin C without anything artificial.<br /><br />Stepping off the soapbox now.<br /><br />I thought that, compared to other brands of liquid water enhancers, this has been my favorite.  I DID contain vitamins so the labels are not misleading in any ways.<br />The taste was fantastic.  It didn't have a nasty aftertaste. I had no difficulty getting the correct flavor vs water ratio.<br /><br />The only complaint is that one squeeze does not fit all. Depending on your grip, you could be using well more than one serving in your water. While this makes it easy to adjust to individual tastes, it also makes the product wasteful.  I found that my water tasted wonderful with very minimal amounts of product.<br /><br />Final impression: I liked this product. It was nice to have some vitamins with my artificial flavoring and sweetener.  I liked the fruit punch flavor (which is not usually a favorite of mine) and would buy this product in the future.

Basically it just seems to me like a lot of other "water enhancers" on the market except Vitamin Squeeze has, well, vitamins thrown in to make it "better for you."  So far I'm not impressed and downed a good five servings of it without necessarily feeling more energized.  In fact I was more sleepy than normal the first day I tried it and it did little to nothing for me in terms of perking me up.  I think I'll just stick with my regular water since I know that's not loaded with the questionable "Natural" flavors as mentioned in the ingredient listing which is beyond suspect.  Skip this one as there's no benefit in my mind.

I followed the directions of one squirt per eight ounces of water, and was rewarded with a light flavor that was not overpowering.  I imagine that you could increase your squirts if you wanted more fruity goodness, but one squirt seemed about right for me.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze was a good eye opener for the morning, and it made me feel good to know I was getting all of those vitamins!  This is a nice product that is easy to use and is one that I will be purchasing in the future.

review/text: Tastes like fruit punch ... the same as most other fruit punches I've had in my lifetime (a little bit of artificial aftertaste, though). You can tailor the taste to your preferences ... although one squeeze per 8 ounces of water is recommended.<br /><br />The big deal is the added vitamin C (with some good amounts of vitamin B also added); I guess good for kids who survive on junk food not fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />Within reason (diarrhea) you can't get too much vitamin c. Also at $6.00 a small bottle is a bit expensive; however this has the usually added stuff like caffeine, taurine, the aforementioned vitamins and also electrolytes ... so in that regard this potion is the equivalent of many super expensive energy drinks. It's up to you to decide what is necessary, if you are trying to have a replacement Crystal Light/Red Bull/Gatorade combo ... go for it - see how it works for you.<br /><br />Keep in mind the bottle has a total of 960 mg of caffeine about 8 cups of normal brewed at home coffee.

Perhaps some people will be ok with that. I wouldnt mind it IF the product gave me some energy as it states. I felt no difference. I use 6 hour energy drinks and  Mio to compare the product too and both those products (although tastes may not be the best) worked very well giving a boost of energy. This bottle is alot bigger too, and only a squeeze is suppose to do the job. Like any product as such I would recommend trying it out once as it may be ok for you or it may not.<br /><br />I personally like the smaller portable bottles. Another thing it needs to be used within 30 days of opening...... something to keep in mind so your forced to use it on a daily basis or it will go bad.

So, minus one star for no energy....I would give it a star for letting me sleep MORE, but that's not how it's advertised. ;-) With that said, I find the taste to be very good. I need to drink a lot for several reasons, and this makesthe water taste much better. I don't really taste a bad after taste, but there is something (I just don't mind it). As for the squeeze being the perfect amount....hmmmm....I don't see how that is as I control the squeeze, and I can squeeze longer or shorter and different amounts come out each time. Either way, it is a good taste and not over the top. I don't need a lot to give my water bottle a better taste. This is 3.5 stars for me, just not enough to bump it to 4....mainly because it doesn't live up to it's energy status and the "squeeze," is in no way accurate. If you are looking for something to flavor your water, this is it....just don't think it will energize you.

review/text: This is a sweet-tasting additive for your bottled water. Just one to two squeezes, depending on the number of ounces of water, and you have added extra vitamins and flavor to plain water.  I felt this was a bit too sweet. It has no added sugar, and zero calories, but does contain an artificial sweetner. It also had a slight medicinal taste. I tried adjusting the amount I put in, but it either tasted like nothing or too sweet.  The directions say the bottle must be refrigerated and used within thirty days. Unless you used this several times per day, I doubt you would use this up in a month. Maybe if more than one uses it?<br />I just think I can get my vitamins from the food I eat and my water from water. I would not buy again.

review/text: This is not nearly as concentrated as the MIO water flavors that you also squirt into your glass or bottle of water.  But, you get a lot more of it (12 oz) and one 1/2 fluid oz. squirt has 120% daily requirement for vitamin C and no calories.  The fruit punch tastes good, however I like my water to be very weakly flavored so I probably put in about a 1/2 squirt giving me 60% of my daily requirement for vitamin C.<br /><br />It's mainly advertised as being a source of vitamin C, but there are more things beside vitamin C in it:<br /><br />Vitamin C - 120%<br />Vitamin B6 - 40%<br />Vitamin B5 - 40%<br />Vitamin B3 - 40%<br />Vitamin B12 - 40%<br />Zinc - 10%<br />Chromium - 10%<br /><br />The plastic bottle is a good shape for your hand to grab it easily and squeeze.  This might be a good way to get some needed vitamin C without having to eat a lot of citrus or swallowing vitamin C pills.  And, if you like your water flavored but are particular like me, about how much flavor is in it, then this is a good way to control it.

However, I can't get used to the very bitter vitamin-y aftertaste, and the more I think about it, this tastes like watered-down nasty cough medicine.

review/summary: tasty, east to use
review/text: The only mixes I have added to my water before are powdered and need to be shaken a lot. Not with this one. It is a good sized bottle with a flip cap and a no-drip spout. You just squeeze the liquid into your water bottle and then barely even have to shake it to mix it up. It make take some tasting to decide how much of a squeeze you want to get the right amount of flavor. Also, it says one squeeze per 8ozs of water which is less than your usual water bottle. It has caffeine in it but not a lot, more like soda than coffee. I liked the flavor though I thought it was a bit light so I would add more. As for the energy part, it is hard to tell. I'm tired all the time because of chronic insomnia and other sleep problems. I take Adderall to help with this and it only works a little. So this product didn't stand much of a chance giving me energy. but it might for most others. I liked having vitamin C and B vitamins added to my diet as most vitamin pills upset my stomach, as do high caffeine products. Overall, I think this is a good product and reasonably priced.

review/text: I really can't rate the effectiveness of the vitamins, but it does give me a small boost if I add enough to the water.  The biggest draw about is it's convenience and the taste.  It actually tastes pretty good, not overwhelming but just enough.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: This was better than I expected it to be. I was really worried that it was going to have that terrible aftertaste that a lot of drinks without sugar in them tend to have, and while there is a little bit of that aftertaste, it's not that bad and it certainly didn't stop me from drinking this.<br /><br />I like that there are vitamins and electrolytes in this, but I did not notice any "kick" from the supposed energy that this is supposed to provide.<br /><br />Someone else mentioned in their review that they added this to crystal light, and I think it would be interesting to try adding this to sprite.

review/summary: Tastes alot like kool-aid!
review/text: It may do everything the company claims this product will do, but I just couldn't get past the flavor. With "a few drops", it tastes like watered down Kool-Aid. If you go ahead and put in more to give it more flavor, it just tastes like really strong kool-aid - cherry flavor, that is. If you like Kool-Aid, maybe this product is right for you. If you are like me and gave up Kool-Aid many years ago, you probably won't like this either.

review/summary: Not Very Flavorful
review/text: I hate the bland taste of water alone, so I was very excited to receive the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch from Amazon Vine.  After trying the water enhancer, I was left far from satisfied.  Even though this drink packs a large amount of Vitamin C, as well as other nutrients, it is lacking in flavor.<br /><br />I was impressed with the packaging of Vitamin Squeeze.  Unlike some other liquid water enhancers, it comes in an easy to use and mess-free bottle.  Adding the right amount of the drink is simple, and there are no unwanted drops of left over liquid straying behind.  However, for me, this was the best part of the product.<br /><br />I do not like my water enhancers to taste like sugary kid drinks; however, I do like it to do its job and enhance my water with some flavor.  Vitamin Squeeze not only leaves a yucky aftertaste, the flavor itself is almost bitter, while I was expecting a sweeter taste.  In fact, the taste was so weak, I would have preferred to drink the water alone.  I did try this product multiple times, adding more of the drink, yet no matter how little or how much of the liquid I added, there was much left to be desired.<br /><br />I would not purchase Vitamin Squeeze; therefore, I would not recommend it to anyone else.  If you are looking to supplement your daily intake of water and/or Vitamin C, I would stick to a daily vitamin and powered water enhancers.

review/text: I like the flavor of this and it's nice that there are some vitamins in it, too.  This brand is better than the MIO in my opinion, you have to use much less of it to get a good flavor.  My only issue with it is that it says a squeeze will flavor your water perfectly.  Uh, no.  A squeeze of it puts so much of the flavor enhancer into the water that it almost burns my throat.  It's perfect when I actually measured out the ounces, a full ounce for a bottle of 19 oz of water was perfect.  I used the little medicine cups that come with baby medicine to measure it.  LOL

review/summary: My new squeeze..
review/text: I am trying to kick my soda habit.  I have not been too successful thus far this year but I am having much more success with this water enhancer.  I think the taste is just enough for me but it may be a little too sweet for some.  One quick squeeze gave me all the flavor I needed for a glass of water.  I do think the bottle is a bit leaky when shaken.  It has 40mg of natural caffeine and 10mg of taurine so I will not be adding it to my kid's water as they do not need any "oomph".  It did seem to give me a little boost of energy which I need to see my kids off on the bus at 6:30am.  Overall, a viable soda alternative for me and I will be replacing my usual cup of soda with this enhancer.

review/summary: I Want Healthy Vitamins, Thanks
review/text: Make sure you understand the description, and maybe you won't be disappointed.  This is a caffeinated energy drink.  There are vitamins added to it (nice touch, but having Sucralose for the sweetener along with as much caffeine per serving as a can of soda kind of kills the health aspect of it).<br /><br />The taste was pretty good if you don't mind the artificial sweetener aftertaste, and my disappointment was really caused by this combined with the caffeine.  I was hoping for something yummy to add to my water to help me stop drinking soda.  It doesn't exactly help a caffeine addiction to keep drinking caffeine.  When I read the description, I thought that the energy function of this was supposed to be vitamins...not caffeine.<br /><br />I gave low stars because this was misleading to me and NOT what I wanted.  Just know what you're getting and if it's what you want, this isn't so bad.  Still better for you than the other energy drinks or soda, just don't expect something healthy.

review/summary: Slightly medicinal, with a lingering aftertaste.
review/text: About this product, it must be said: I didn't have very high hopes. I'm not into the whole "flavored water" thing (my choice of flavored water being Diet Coke), and I think the energy beverage craze is a joke (you want high energy levels? GET MORE SLEEP!), and so ultimately this product, at least for me, comes down to one thing: taste.<br /><br />In that area it's merely ok. It tastes kind of like Kool Aid fruit punch, only not quite as good. It also has a vaguely medicinal taste about it, and as I mentioned in the headline, a lingering aftertaste. Whether that taste is good not depends on how much you like the flavor. As it is, I'm wishing I had some Diet Coke around.<br /><br />This isn't by any means a bad product, but I'm fairly sure that you could get the same effect with sugar-free Kool Aid or the like, and probably spend a lot less money. Or, alternatively, get a good night's sleep, drink plain water and eat an orange. You'll have pretty much the same outcome.

review/summary: If you're a fan of sugar-free fruit punch, you could do worse.
review/text: I'm a fan of MiO "water enhancer" so when I saw the possibility of a MiO replacement that's been vitamin-enriched, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Like MiO fruit punch flavor, Vitamin Squeeze (henceforth, "VS") is a "zero nutrition" product - no calories, fat, sodium, carbs, sugar or protein. Unlike MiO, there are additions of vitamins and minerals including vitamins B3, B5, B6, B12, and C, chromium, magnesium and zinc. It also contains 40mg "natural caffeine" per serving which is slightly more than a can of Coke or Pepsi. In comparison, MiO is caffeine-free.<br /><br />I can't honestly say that I had any reaction to this as an "energy drink" a la Red Bull or 5-Hour Energy. The caffeine content gave me a similar high as a caffeinated soft drink but nothing more exceptional than that.<br /><br />Both VS and MiO offer 24 servings per container but while MiO manages to pack this into a refrigeration-free container of less than two ounces, the VS product requires refrigeration after opening and comes in a 12 ounce bottle. I assume the additional mass is the result of the vitamin and mineral supplements that are part of the VS offering. There's an obvious mixed trade-off here; on the one hand you'd get the benefit of the supplements, on the other hand it's a larger bottle that requires refrigeration.<br /><br />But the question remains: How does it taste? I find that it tastes exactly like every other sugar-free fruit punch product I've ever tried. In a blind taste test I was unable to distinguish between VS, MiO, Crystal Light, "Great Value" (Walmart's house brand), or Wyler's Light fruit punches. Whether you like those or not, the VS product will virtually match those expectations.<br /><br />There is one other thing that I found odd with this product and that has to do with its packaging. Inexplicably, the VS bottle expects to be stored upside-down. I could understand this if the VS product were syrupy but it's not. So you store it upside-down, then turn it rightside-up to uncap, then upside-down again to use, then rightside-up again to recap, then upside-down again to store. Very weird.<br /><br />Therefore, this gets four stars. On the pros list I include the vitamin and mineral content and a "not bad" taste. Cons include mandatory refrigeration, larger bottle size, and (on a much smaller note) a very weird bottle configuration.

review/text: I have a need for higher levels of Vitamin C.  Sometimes, I find a desire to have it in something other than the standard tablets.  Although the flavor of Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is strong, it did leave a slight aftertaste.  It is hard for me to judge the actual potency, put it seemed just as good as any other generic pill, but more flavorful.  The downside for me was that it stained my finger and the two drops that got on the countertop also stained it.  That would not deter me from using it again in the future.

review/summary: Vitamin Squeeze
review/text: I'm used to seeing those MIO bottles around, so this bottle was MUCH bigger than I was expecting. It's closer to a medium sized bottle of mustard, just to give you an idea.<br /><br />I didn't like that I really had to experiment as to how much "a squeeze" consisted of. "A squeeze" could mean a split second or several seconds. I'm still not sure, to be honest, exactly how much of the stuff I was suppose to put in a glass.<br /><br />I actually kind of liked the taste. I HATE the taste of fake sugar. It always leaves an aftertaste that I can't take. I had to put a good bit of this stuff in a glass of water to make it slightly bad tasting. It's not overly sweet, which I appreciate. I think others might not like that, though. I prefer my flavorings to be very mild tasting. Others might prefer really sweet, which would not be this one.<br /><br />Overall, if you like mild flavors, give this one a try if you're willing to experiment a bit with now much to put in a glass. If you like really sweet, go with something else.

It has a fake chemical taste which overpowered any fruit punch flavor.  The first sip was bad, but I took another in the interest of writing this review and... even worse the second time around. So bad, in fact, that my tongue and lips started to tingle and I had to rinse my mouth out.<br /><br />I'm beyond perplexed that others would speak so highly of this product.  I'll drink my water straight, and get my vitamins (and caffeine) elsewhere.  I don't recommend this water enhancer.

review/summary: Terrible after-taste
review/text: I was excited to try this, particularly now that summer is here. I am not a big fan of plain water, and it's portability would make it nice for taking to playdates, picnics, etc. So as soon as I got the bottle, I tried it out. I was terribly disappointed.<br /><br />There are a couple of issues I have with this. The first is that the bottle just instructs you to squeeze - no amount is listed, and you can squeeze a crazy amount at one time. I realize this is so people can make it to their own taste, but a baseline would be nice.<br /><br />By far the worst part of this energy drink is the after-taste. I couldn't even finish my glass the two times I tried it. I figured maybe I just needed to adjust the flavor after the first time, so I waited a few days and then used less in the cup. The initial flavor wasn't bad (watered-down fruit punch, basically), but the after-taste was nasty. I can't even bring myself to drink any more.<br /><br />I think I will be sticking with other tried-and-true water additives.

review/summary: Tastes Weird, but Not in a Good Way
review/text: When I smelled the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, I really couldn't wait to try it - it smells like Hawaiian Punch!  Anything that smells like Hawaiian Punch can't taste bad, right?  I squeezed it into a glass of cold water - still smells faintly of Hawaiian Punch...should be good.  Then I tasted it...not even close to tasting yummy.  In fact, it has this weird "not quite sugar, but trying to pretend to be sugar" weird salty vitamin aftertaste taste.  In short, if you open a bottle of Centrum vitamin pills and sniff it, that's what it tastes like - just slightly fruit punch flavored.  It just doesn't taste good.<br /><br />I tried giving Vitamin Squeeze Energy drink a fair shot...I mixed it with ice water.  I added more for more fruit flavor.  I added less to see if I could tolerate it in small doses.  The results were all the same...the taste is just yuck.  After drinking this stuff, I vowed to take my vitamins in quick to swallow pill form, and drink Gatorade or something else if I'm itching for a flavored water.  Taking vitamins shouldn't be this bad!  Not recommended.

review/text: I have tried many water flavorings and additives. So far none are worth it. This one actually smells really good. Like a srong cup of cherry koolaid. So I was hoping for the flavor as well. No such luck. One squeeze to 8oz just tasted like it poisoned my water. 2 squeezes darkened the color and made the aftertaste worse. 3 squeezes gave a light fruity hint of  flavor but the bitterness and aftertaste overwhelmed it. Since it tastes like cough syrup I did not try 4 squeezes. I might mention the aftertaste is like diet dinks with artificial sugar that makes the roof of your mouth feel caked up. So I did drink tons of good old fashioned plain water to get rid of it. So it really does make you drink more water but not for the reasons it claims.

review/text: Okay, so this must be a sort of hybrid Gatorade/Monster/Sunny Delight offspring.  It contains lots of Vitamin C, other vitamins, 40 mg of natural caffiene, taurine (10 mg), and electorlytes, and you mix it all into a glass of water.  Convenient, very.  I hated it but my teenage son loves it.  It tastes like Kool-Aid to me, but he likes it when he goes on a walk, mixed in his water.  One bottle has 24 servings to mix in (goodness, what would happen if you didn't read the instructions...yikes!), so this little bottle could conceivably last awhile.  And, it's better than buying 24 separate bottles of vitamin water (too much plastic!).<br /><br />So I'm rating it good for convenience and the idea itself, but a better flavor would be nice.  At least it's not gritty like some water supplements...because this is liquid, it blends very well.  Wait.  Okay, bumping it up to a four star.  This is pretty handy!

review/summary: Tastes okay, but too weak, and bottle LEAKS!
review/text: First of all, this thing is packaged like Fort Knox.  It has an outer plastic sleeve that you have to cut through and remove, and then (an important point that you might not realize until you've been squeezing and squeezing unsuccessfully) you have to remove the cap and cut off a membrane covering the mouth of the bottle (it has a pull tab, that that was unhelpful; I had to use a knife).  That right there should remind you to treat this stuff like medication; don't leave it where children can get a hold of it!<br /><br />The item description says, "Specially designed cap delivers the right amount in one squueze with no drips or mess," so I figured you squeeze until it stops.  Fortunately, I added the Vitamin Squeeze before the water, so I could see that it had squirted out a LOT.  A serving size is supposed to be 15ml, which is about three teaspoons (one tablespoon).  But it had squirted out about a quarter cup!  Okay, maybe the cap isn't so "specially designed" after all.  I opened the cap to pour it all back in, but the liquid had leaked down around the threads of the cap, and proceeded to drip down on my hand and the kitchen counter.  And let me tell you, this stuff stains!<br /><br />I wiped off the bottle, rinsed out the cap, replaced it, then measured out three teaspoons into 8 ounces of water.  It tasted very weak, so I kept adding more until it tasted okay.  Flavoring 24 ounces of water took half a cup! This tasted okay, but then I realized three shocking points:<br /><br />(1) The beverage I just created contained 320mg caffeine!<br />(2) It had used a third of the product to produce one bottle of beverage!<br />(3) This put my 24-ounce drink at a cost of $2!<br /><br />So, while Vitamin Squeeze doesn't taste too bad (think: fruit punch with a chewable vitamin tablet dissolved in it), and I'm all for slipping in a little caffeine, this product has too many drawbacks:<br /><br />*It's too hard to open.<br />*It uses too much dye.<br />*The bottle itself is poorly designed.<br />*The concentrate does not have enough flavor per recommended serving (and, thus, to reach an acceptable flavor, you get far too much caffeine).<br />*The cost per serving is way too high.<br /><br />I won't be buying this again.<br /><br />UPDATE 3-30-12: I went to make myself a drink with this today, and when I picked up the bottle to shake it, it went everywhere!  My kitchen looks like a crime scene!  My hands are stained, the floor is stained, the rug is stained.  I know the lid was on tight, and I washed off the bottle yesterday, so this was definitely fresh leakage (it leaks into the cap when stored, as designed, on the cap, and then when the bottle is turned over, it pours out from under the cap).  I know other reviewers have noted that the lid leaks, but I had no idea how bad.  This is a SERIOUS issue.<br /><br />UPDATE 5-15-12: I wrote to the company to ask about my concerns, and no one ever got back to me.  I'm VERY wary of a company selling a "health" product that has non-existent customer service.

It is sweetened with the artificial sweetener sucralose which turned me off immediately since I generally avoid all artificial sweeteners. (I think they're yucky chemicals I don't want in my body or my kids' either). But I decided to try it anyway. Before I could do so, my 10 year old asked if he could try it, and his verdict was, "It tastes like drinking a glass of liquid benadryl." I tried it myself, and I'm sorry to say I totally agreed with him. I do not understand why anyone would want to add this stuff to a perfectly good glass of water, so I can't recommend it at all.

review/summary: A Major Drawback!!
review/text: This bottle reminds me of the kind of catsup that stands on its top.<br /><br />So, I take the plastic off of the top, and try to take off the inner seal, but it did not remove the way they showed it should come off, so I had to take a knife and go around the bottle opening to take it off.<br /><br />Then things really went downhill from there!!<br /><br />So, I put the top back on and shake the bottle as directed.  I opened my water bottle. It doesn't say you cannot do this, in fact on the bottle itself it does show 2 kinds of water bottles, both with their tops off.<br /><br />Then the liquid squirts out of the bottle, onto my counter, which by the way you will need Soft Scrub or some kind of cleanser to get the liquid off of your counter, because it will NOT just wash off with a sponge, because I tried that first.  It did NOT work! The stain was still there, before I used the Soft Scrub to remove the stain.  Good thing it did work, because Iam a renter, and it left a huge stain!  Why this enery drink would even leave a stain that cannot just be wiped up with wet sponge is a mystery to me, which also makes me question what could be in this drink to make it even do that? That's the big question!<br /><br />The liquid squirted out onto this dish that I keep on my counter which I use for fruit, bread, etc.  Needless to say, the liquid was on the dish, and got into the bread/plastic, so I had to throw that away too.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor.  It's terrible!  It tastes fake,artifical,leaves a weird taste in your mouth, kind of like Hawaiian Punch, but worse!  Good thing I did not use alot of it in my water bottle!  I couldn't even get through the whole bottle, in fact after only a few sips I was done wanting to even drink this drink!<br /><br />I don't know if this company makes other flavors as well, but I won't even be using this bottle, it will be thrown in the trash, where it belongs, at least to me.<br /><br />I thought this would be like Mio, but no, not in any way!!<br /><br />I rarely say the word "hate" period.<br /><br />I have been a member of the Vine Program for several years, and in that time I don't think I have ever said that word as a Vine member, nor in any review that I have given on Amazon, and I have been a customer on Amazon's site since 1998, that is how much I hate this product!!<br /><br />I can't think of one good thing to say about this product, sadly!<br /><br />I would give it a minus one if I could!!

I was under the (false) impression that this was made with natural ingredients. Since when is sucralose a natural additive? It is a synthetic sweetener that causes cancer and dementia in lab rats. It made our mouths taste absolutely dried out, and, soon after, my mom developed a bad headache. Awful!!!!!

review/text: I love the idea, a flavoring for water. I try to drink a lot of water and usually add a large splash of pure, unsweetened fruit juice (Trader Joe's Cranberry, Pomegranate, Blueberry, etc.) to a large glass of water.<br /><br />This product has the look and taste of Hawaiian Punch but since there is no sugar, to me the artificial sweetener is over powering and off-putting. Given that the current medical understanding is that daily vitamin supplements do not help and maybe harmful, the only reason to drink this product would be for the Caffeine it contains.<br /><br />Back to the real thing for me.

review/summary: Needless entry to a crowded market
review/text: With the rush of `flavored water' drinks on the market I decided to give "Vitamin Squeeze" a try. I will admit to a level of apprehension but thought it could be really good. There are a lot of them.<br /><br /> Opening the cylinder the concentrate was a light red color that looked like Hawaiian Punch and had a faint scent like Kool Aid. OK I thought, so far so good. I poured out a small glass of water. Following the directions added a squeeze of the syrup.<br /><br />It had the color of Hawaiian Punch  but was cloudy, still had the same scent. So far so good. Then I tasted it. there was a faint fruity taste but also a chemically taste that was less pleasant. "Maybe I didn't use enough." I added another squirt hoping it would increase the flavor. It did. Unfortunately the wrong flavor. The fruit flavor had faded entirely, overwhelmed by the chemical flavor. In short, bleah!<br /><br />The label says "Nutritious & Delicious." Well they may have gotten one of those right but to quote John Lithgow in the movie "2010"  "If it has to taste like this, I don't care if my electrolytes are balanced."

review/summary: Good tasting drink additive but a bit of a miss on the energy part
review/text: The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink additive has a fairly good flavor. It doesn't have a bitter aftertaste like some of the other energy additives. However, it gets 3 stars because I really didn't notice an increase in energy at all. It does have a fairly high caffeine content so I assume that is where the energy is supposed to come from. For those that are sensitive to caffeine this will probably give you an energy boost but not the equivalent of an actual energy drink.  I think if you are looking for a low calorie vitamin additive this is a good choice for you. If you are looking for an energy boost you might want to try something else.

review/summary: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink - Good Ingredients, Short Shelf Life, Poor Packaging
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQMC">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> is a good product that is a nice alternative to taking multi-vitamin tablets or drinking Vitamin Water and the like.  For those that believe in taking multi-vitamins, one serving a day is about the equivalent of one tablet for the most common vitamins, such as vitamin C and the various B vitamins.  The serving size of � floor ounce per 8 ounces of water is about a teaspoon.  The taste was stronger than I was expecting, and the fruit punch flavor tasted more like a tart pink-lemonade to me.  This is similar to Crystal Light, but I found this product to have less of an artificial sweetener aftertaste.  Your mileage may vary as taste is entirely subjective.<br /><br />PROS<br />++ Large bottle brings down the per serving cost of the product<br />++ One serving equal to one tablet for the most common vitamins, such as vitamin C and the various B vitamins<br />++ Less artificial sweetener aftertaste than Crystal Light or Mio, at least for me<br />++ Added caffeine and Taurine may give some people an energy boost<br />++ More economical than competing drinks like Mio and Vitamin Water<br /><br />CONS<br />-- Recommended shelf life is only 30 days<br />-- No clear area to see how much is left in the bottle<br />-- Bottle cap made of fragile cheap plastic and could be prone to leaking<br />-- Bottle is too large and requires refrigeration, so it's not ideal for travel<br />-- Still ridiculously expensive when compared to generic multi-vitamin tablets<br /><br />WARNINGS<br />++ Refrigeration recommended after opening<br />++ Not for children!  It says so right on the bottle<br />++ Some are more sensitive to the taste of artificial sweeteners than others, so try a sample first<br />++ Multivitamins are not for everybody, so consult your physician if necessary<br />++ Too much vitamin intake can be bad, so portion control is necessary<br />++ Contains Taurine which is animal derived<br /><br />The product is not vegan friendly, because it contains Taurine which is animal derived.  Will the added caffeine and Taurine provide an energy boost beyond the product's nutritional content?  Your mileage may vary here as well.  I suspect this will not have a noticeable benefit to those who are used to consuming 40 ounces of coffee per day.  But it may replace the caffeine craving that many people satisfy with sugary sodas.<br /><br />The packaging is large, designed to make 24 portions.  It is re-sealable, and they recommend you refrigerate after opening.  But the cap seems like it is very breakable, particularly for a bottle designed to be stored cap-side down.  The signage is on a plastic label that surrounds the bottle, but there is no clear area to see how much product is left in the bottle.  Even with refrigeration, the recommended shelf life is only 30 days.  So this product will work best for those who have at least one serving daily.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This is a good product that provides another alternative for those looking for vitamins or a caffeine boost.  The shelf life is not very long.  And the packaging could use some improvement.  But the product itself is better tasting than I expected, and it will definitely appeal to some people.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Surprisingly Pleasant
review/text: For flavor, I felt like this was a big step up from the similar product <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> that I've reviewed in the past. That one had a pretty strong artificial sweetener overtone to it, while this is much milder. It's sort of vaguely fruity tasting without being identifiable as any particular fruit in the way things referred to as 'fruit punch' tend to be.<br /><br />It's not exactly super health food, but if you prefer your water a little flavored and you'd like some caffeine and a few vitamins in it, it tastes nice enough to be a good choice. Obviously, on the other hand, if you really don't want caffeine and can't stand the idea of consuming artificial flavoring and that kind of stuff, go elsewhere. (I'm sort of confused by the people who've reviewed it and say they don't like it because it contains caffeine. It's not like the caffeine is a surprise someone sprung on them. They talk about it right on the front of the bottle...)<br /><br />For the size and the fact that it needs to be refrigerated after being opened, this isn't going to compete with a product like Mio, though, for being something you can keep in a bag and take with you everywhere to use during the day. I also felt like the cap felt sort of flimsy and like it didn't want to go back on right. It might just be my perception, but it seemed like it might be easy to break it off.<br /><br />On the whole, vitamins and nutrients are still best gotten from whole foods. On the other hand, if you want some vaguely fruity flavored water that happens to have caffeine and a few built in supplements, it's worth a shot. It might not hurt to find somewhere you can buy 1 bottle first to try instead of the 4 they have here, so you'll have less to figure out how to get rid of if it happens not to suit your tastes, though.

review/text: Okay, this is something you would really have to want in order to use it. However, for myself, I don't think this is a product that I would go out of my way to obtain. The flavor is... well... not what I was expecting! It has an aftertaste that I don't think I could get use to.<br /><br />I gave it a couple of tries, in four 16 oz. bottled waters, and it was hard to want to drink it down. But by golly, I got them down.<br /><br />There is alot more to go, but I think I'm going to pass on the rest of it. It does require refrigeration after opening. So there the rest of it will sit.<br /><br />It is clearly marked on the rim "Not For Children". I can truly appreciate that, and I'm glad to see them owning that. I see way to many children under 8 years old chugging down these types of beverages.<br /><br />As far as sports beverages and vitamin replenishment, I think I will just stick to my good ol' trusty water and fruits & veggies.

review/text: Has a strange "chemically" taste that is really not identifiable as any sort of real fruit.  The instructions say to squeeze once per 8 oz. but, I can squeeze harder or softer and a different amount will come out so it is hard to know how much you are getting.  The product label design seems like it might be for kids with the bright colors, playful fonts, fruity flavors, and product name.  What is "natural caffeine" anyway?  Does that mean it is safe for anyone?  It needs to be refrigerated after opening.  You can't take it around with you and add it to water you might get from a fountain or someplace.  The appealing part of these water "enhancers" is that you can usually take them with you to use if you are out and about or camping/backpacking.

review/text: If you need to add something to make your water palatable, vitamin squeeze energy drink is a good option.<br /><br />It's tasty, and I don't usually prefer "fruit punch" flavors - it's not too sweet and definitely tastes fruity.<br /><br />I am fairly sensitive to caffeine (can't drink coffee in the afternoon, am wired by just a little bit of energy shots) and did not find this kept me up, which is good. But I also did not notice an energy boost.<br /><br />Storing it in the fridge makes it less portable, but I like how it doesn't warm my water like other products. It is large and since you can add less than the full amount, I was able to use it for a long time.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone who drinks plain water without any problems, but if you are prone to dehydration and looking for ways to drink more, this might help.

review/summary: Fair- not super...
review/text: ...but I guess it does the trick. I have a VERY high tolerance for energy drinks, so it's obviously difficult for me to evaluate the energizing properties of them. Fortunately, I was able to share this with some of my friends, and we discussed the strong and weak points of the product as we finished off the entire bottle (haha).<br /><br />My buddies assured me that the energy-boosting performance of Vitamin Squeeze was comparable to some of the other energy additives on the market, like Mio; probably a notch below something like a Monster or a large Red Bull, but comparable to a Coke. The big selling point here is the fact that Vitamin Squeeze claims to derive its energy properties from its vitamin C content and its natural caffeine.<br /><br />As regards the taste, it's okay... it's pretty much what one would expect: tasty, but obviously not as gustatorally satisfying as the aforementioned Coke, or anything sweetened with sugar/corn syrup. The trade-off is the better healthfulness and the vitamin/mineral gains. It doesn't taste BAD- kind of like Kool-Aid, but not quite as 'sugary.' On some level, we just have to accept that a healthy product is going to be different from what we're trying to replace in our diets.<br /><br />Overall, though, it's probably the best water-enhancer I've tried (I've sampled a few others, including several flavors of Mio), and if my friends' testimonies are accurate, it also supplies a decent amount of energy. For someone looking for a decently healthful energy-boosting water enhancement, it's worth a try.

review/summary: Not bad, but not great either
review/text: Pros: It offers a decent amount of vitamins per serving and has zero calories. (Note that it does contain 40 mg of caffeine per serving so if you're sensitive to caffeine you'll want to pass on this, or make sure you don't drink it in combination with other caffeinated drinks.) One bottle lasts a long time since it makes 24 servings.<br /><br />Cons: The packaging could be better. It's hard to get it to squeeze properly - either nothing comes out, or you get a gush all at once. Although the bottle is designed to be stood cap-down, it leaks a small amount when positioned in that manner. It needs to be refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />Taste: It's just OK. It doesn't have much of a "fake sugar" aftertaste, but it also doesn't have much of a fruit taste either. It's not offensive, but it's not all that appealing either.<br /><br />I'll use up the bottle I have, but this is not something I'd pick up again.

If you are wary of these artificial sweeteners, then stay away, otherwise, approach!

And whatever you do, don't spill any because it's kind of sticky and messy. My son was all excited when he saw it and together we experimented.

review/summary: Just a mess all the way around.
review/text: I love energy drinks. This one is kind of a mess in every way. First, it leaks,or at least mine did. It leaked when I 'squirted' it into the glass (from the cap itself, not the intended spount within the cap) and it stained my towel I used to clean it up with. Then it leaked when I turned it upright, so I tried storing it in the fridge and it leaked either way. Blah! It could have been just this bottle, but I only have this bottle to review :)<br /><br />Typically, most 'one squirt is enough to make 8 oz' bottles tend to give the same amount at every 'one squirt'. Well, this one is very much like a bottle of dish soap, one squirt could really go on a long time and you could squeeze the bottle while squirting and practically empty it. In short, I don't think the measurement part is any good at all.<br /><br />The flavor is just okay. I would compare it with most name brand fruity kids' drinks, with a hint of chemical flavoring. Yum, right? Not really. As I mentioned, I really enjoy energy drinks with Taurine etc and this was nothing like them, much more like fruit juices that don't contain actual juice.<br /><br />Lastly, I tried this on my day off. I made my drink kind of strong because I tasted it as I went and wanted it to be less watery flavored. An hour later, I took a nap. No problem. No energy, not even the awake feeling I get with a cup of coffee.<br /><br />All in all, this is not the drink for me and I can't see myself buying it for any reason.

review/summary: More Like Vitamin Squeeze Enemy
review/text: I had read a few of the reviews on Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch flavored water enhancer before I first tried it.  I noticed a couple said it was on the sweet side.  My experience seems different than most of the reviewers, so I am not sure if I got a "bad bottle" or what<br />One serving is � ounce squeezed into 8 ounces of water.  The bottle is 12 ounces so you should get about 24 servings.<br /><br />Ingredient-wise, one serving of the  Fruit Punch flavor (1/2 ounce) has some vitamins in it, primarily Vitamin C (120% of the RDA), followed by 40% RDA of B3, B5, B6, and B12.  It also advertised 10% RDA of Chromium and Zinc., but it's also got 40mg of caffeine serving, so less than a Red Bull but more than some other drinks, including some sodas.<br /><br />I've tried this product with a good squeeze into an 8 ounce glass of water and more than one squeeze in a larger glass (about 12 ounces).  It tastes weak to me. .  I have used "water enhancers" before, usually with good results in both use and flavor.  I also think I've mastered squeezing things from a bottle, so I'm assuming I was "operating" it correctly!  I do not like things overly sweet, so I don't think its my taste being off.<br /><br />I've tried it a few times, shaking the bottle before squeezing, trying "a little more", a little less water......it's very weak, sort of like if you took a few teaspoons of a fruit juice and mixed it in water.  I found the only way it offers any taste of any sort is to use a very loooong squeeze of it into an 8 ounce glass of water.  I can only describe it as tasting like a severely watered down Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.<br /><br />I actually tried putting it into the glass before the water, just to see how much I was using in order to get some taste.  I found I was using far more than the  � ounce.<br /><br />I also ran into an issue with the bottle itself.  The drink was leaking from where the bottle meets the screw on cap.  I checked it several times to ensure it was screwed on properly.  There is what appears to be a (cardboard? foam?)  "washer" in the cap.  I made sure it was seated, to no avail.  Removing it didn't help either.<br /><br />The leak presented a major drawback as it time I used the bottle I ended up with red dye on my hand, and/or counter, floor, in the fridge, etc.  I ended up having to discard it before it was empty due to the mess it was making.<br /><br />So, again, I am not sure if I got a bad bottle, but I hope I did, because otherwise this stuff is awful.  I do want to note again that many of the product's reviews are good, so my experience may be isolated, but going by the bottle I used, I'd steer clear of this product.

review/summary: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink
review/text: I was looking forward to a water additive that actually provided energy too.  It's an internal struggle to avoid soda but I can't seem to give up caffeine in the mornings.  So enter vitamin squeeze, something that claims to give me energy and still be somewhat healthy, all making me drink water at the same time.<br /><br />I have to say, I didn't really get any energy kick from this drink.  It was like drinking regular water in that regard.  Sure there are some vitamins in there.  I was pleased to see that there was a lot of Vitamin C and Vitamin B's in there.  I don't really eat a lot of foods that contain those so it was a nice supplement.  And it was still 0 calories so you weren't adding much there either.  The rest of the ingredients I wasn't as fond of though.  The sweetener in this is Sucralose, and while I know there's a lot of controversy about the fake sugars, I'm just not a fan, and tend to avoid it when possible.  It has a strange aftertaste to me as well.  A lot of the other ingredients were the hard to pronounce type as well, and even though some of it was the vitamins, I like to see natural stuff in what I'm drinking.<br /><br />The taste was ok.  Kind of like watered down kool-aid, which I haven't had in forever.  So it made me feel a little like a kid again.  You're supposed to use one good squeeze per 8 oz of water.  But I find myself using twice that as I like a stronger flavor.  And as said before, it still tasted a little weak, although it did give the water a nice red color pretty quickly.<br /><br />One side note on the packaging.  It's easy to squeeze but I've been having trouble with it leaking around the cap.  I've tried tightening it to no avail, so I have to keep this drink packaging upside down.  Not a big deal at all, but if you don't and it does leak, it will stain any light surfaces around it.<br /><br />I wouldn't probably buy this again as I don't like the ingredients, but for someone who's not as concerned about such things, this may be a good drink additive.<br /><br />Review by M.

review/summary: Cough syrupy, metallic taste :(
review/text: Since I can never remember to take a daily multi-vitamin, I thought this would be a great alternative.  Multi-vitamins generally do not have a taste to them and this product definitely has a taste and for me, not a good one. I tried 1 squirt and I tried 2 squirts to make it more palatable, but nothing worked. I still got the cough syrup taste with the metallic bite. Ugh. I always drink bottled water, but I could not drink a bottle with this product in it.  Just could not.<br /><br />I also am not a fan of Splenda and I won't even put red dye in the sugar water I make for the hummingbird feeder so I am not about to choose to ingest a product that contains Red 40.<br /><br />For some this product might work - for me it did not!

review/summary: Not bad at all for a fruit punch
review/text: I have become fond of squeeze-in flavors for my cold water on the rocks (I like it cold, cold, cold), and though you have to keep this one in the refrigerator after opening, it's more coldness, so it's not bad. I'm over there getting my tray of ice cubes, anyway. I do feel that an extra soupcon of vitamins helps me out, and since I control the squeezing, I can make the drink as fruity and sweet as I like, or not. Fruit punch is not usually my favorite flavor, but this is pretty good, and of course, I can mix it. My boyfriend adds rum ;-)

review/summary: Artificial taste, typical stimulent based energy drink
review/text: This bottle of fruit punch flavored Vitamin Squeeze sat in my refrigerator for a while.  I usually drink filtered water and I don't typically like to add anything to it.  But the Vitamin Squeeze product seemed like a good thing to try, not only for the flavor it adds to water but for the small array of vitamins this product adds.<br /><br />When I finally got around to trying it, I wanted to judge it based on flavor and health benefits based on the ingredient list.  For flavor, I did not really care for this product.  The sucralose gives it that unmistakable artificial taste, and the first word that popped in my head when I tasted it was "fake."  It tastes cloyingly sweet and artificial, like those bottles of "healthy" fruit punch you see in the juice aisle.<br /><br />For the health benefits, I am always somewhat skeptical of any product that claims to increase "energy" yet contains no carbs or calories.  And like most "energy" drinks, one of the ingredients is "natural caffeine" mixed with an assortment of B-vitamins and an amino acid.  In my opinion, this product might increase your energy levels temporarily, but much of that effect comes from the stimulant properties of caffeine.<br /><br />The real test of a product like this is "would I drink it again."  And the answer for me is "No."  I found the taste very artificial and I don't like using sucralose-containing (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6JPQQ">Splenda</a>) products.  (I switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8Y892">Truvia Natural Sweetener</a> a long time ago).  I am also sensitive to caffeine, and drinking any caffeine containing product after a certain time leaves me with insomnia.  Personally, I would prefer skipping this product and continuing to drink plain water, taking a vitamin supplement for the extra vitamins.  So overall, I do not recommend this product.  The only reason I upgraded from 1 star to 2 stars is the fact that this product does contain some beneficial vitamins, unlike most ready-made, highly sweetened fruit punch drinks.

review/summary: Can't be good for you
review/text: This stuff tasted like cough syrup, but actually tasted kind-of good if you don't use too much. Yet, to get the vitamin benefit, you have to use quite a bit and it really is like cough syrup and way to sweet for my liking.<br /><br />A light squeeze only give you 10-25% of your daily B vitamin and a double-portion (yuck) will give you your daily. That SUCRALOSE stuff is used in all the "vitamin" drinks now, but really...it's not good for you.<br /><br />Your better off pop-in a high-dosage multi-vitamin and drink plain water...

review/text: Short version:  It's tastes weird<br /><br />Longer version: My first impression of this stuff was negative. They make a big deal about it making no mess, but when I first opened it it squirted little drops on my counter, leaving read stains that took some effort to clean. Do not get this stuff on your clothes.<br /><br />Next came the taste. It's not so much fruit punch as punch in the tongue. It's somewhere between ok and nasty. Yes, it has vitamins in it, so you can't compare it to normal fruit punch, but still. Yuck.<br /><br />So if you absolutely need some sort of vitamin drink in your life, I'm sure this isn't the worst one out there. But I will not be drinking it in the future.

review/summary: Very refreshing as a workout drink .... Instant energy
review/text: This has been my regular workout drink after any cardio workout.  I take a sip of this drink every 10 mins and keeps my body going without any dehydration and tiredness.<br /><br />How to use:<br />  Note that this is a concentrate, Squeeze 2-3 'squeezes' into a bottle/glass of water and enjoy.  Best with a couple of cubes of ice<br /><br />Compared to Gatorade :<br />  * Gatorade contains BVO (brominated vegitable oils) which is banned in many countries for causing cancer<br />  * Plus Gatorade does not have the vitamins & minerals like this one does.<br />  * Easier to store and mix with readily available water<br /><br />Taste:  think of it a mix of orange and raspberry juices, I loved it, my wife hates it.<br /><br />What is not good:<br />  Opening the inner sealing is very difficult, I found myself driving in car on a hot texas summer day and when I wanted to use it, after struggling to pull the seal with my hands, I ended up using a utility knife to pierce through the seal<br /><br />  Artifical sweetener - sucralose is relatively safe, but it is best if avoided

review/summary: Easy to Use, but Nasty Aftertaste
review/text: I received the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink in Fruit Punch through Amazon Vine. Thankfully, I didn't pay for it. My first bad experience with the "Lift n' Pull" safety tab that wouldn't budge. After taking scissors to it, I finally got it open without making too much of a mess. There doesn't seem to be any harmful ingredients, and no calories, carbs, sodium, etc. But there is "natural caffeine" and vitamins. With so many chemical ingredients listed, I doubt the "natural" part of it. With a short squeeze it only diluted the water and barely had a taste, so I sqeezed a bit more in. It tastes a bit like a citrusy-fruit punch. Not too bad. But then the after taste hit me, and I can't get the nasty sickly-sweet taste out of my mouth. I think I'll stick with the sugar-free drink mixes from Crystal Light. They taste better. And I'd rather stay away from the caffeine.

review/summary: Gratuitous Industrial Design for A Good Product
review/text: I'm not sure why it makes sense to put vitamins in a squeezable package. It reminds me of the 4 or 5 blade razors that are prevalent today- do we really need such technology? Probably not, but if it helps you get your vitamins, I suppose it's not a bad thing. Aside from the package design, the drink is fine and the concept of adding this to your other drinks is great. I never even thought to do this with my powder vitamin packages. The squeeze makes accurate portioning difficult, but all in all, this is a worthwhile buy.

review/text: I enjoyed the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink a lot more than I thought that I would.  It has no calories or carbs, but does contain a decent dose of vitamins and enough caffeine to give you a boost, but not so much as to make you overly jumpy.<br /><br />I like the taste of the product.  It does taste like fruit punch with a bit of a "diet drink" taste, but I suppose that's to be expected.<br /><br />The packaging is different, but works well.  How much of a squeeze you give the bottle is up to you, depending on whether you want a stronger or weaker tasting punch.  Each bottle lasts quite awhile.<br /><br />But I did enjoy the product and I do recommend it.  5 stars.

review/summary: Helps me get in my water "quota"
review/text: I am not a fan of drinking water, however because of dehydration issues, my doctor is always on me about drinking more.  I have tried lots of other water "additives" from mio drops to crystal light powders, and everything in between.  I have not had much luck with many other flavorings, because I do not like the chemical after-tastes that many of them have.  With that said, I was pleasantly surprised by these vitamin squeeze drops.  First, the bottle is huge, it is so much larger than the mio (and similar products) bottles that are also available.  I was pleased to see that there was no caffeine or sugar in it, and it also has lots of vitamins.  Most pleasing was the fact that when I drank water with it, there was no nasty after-taste.  As for it being an "energy" drink, I did not notice any marked increase in my energy, but that was not an issue for me since that wasn't what I was looking for. However, since I did not notice an increase in my energy, I was not able to give this item 5 stars.  On the other hand, it has really helped me to increase my water intake, which makes me, my kidneys, and my doctor very happy.  I will continue to purchase and use this product.

review/summary: Extra Energy? Where?
review/text: As a new mom, I could use some extra energy and when I saw this, I thought it would be perfect for me. One of the pros is that it has lots of B vitamins in it with no sugar, carbs, or calories so you can use it even when dieting and it's not unhealthy for you like all those sugared up energy drinks like Red Bull. I also liked that it added flavor to a bland glass of water, but the flavor was not quite fruit punch, but more like a bitter cough drop, so it wasn't tasty to me. I couldn't get past the after taste either. Aside from bad flavoring I liked the easy squeeze container so there's no measuring/mixing like with powdered style flavorings - I could squeeze it right into a bottle of water and use as much or as little as I wanted.<br /><br />What I didn't like about it besides the taste, is that it DOES NOT give you extra energy. I felt no bursts of energy or even a mild increase. Bottom line is it gives you a weird flavor and some vitamins but don't look to have the energy of the Energizer Bunny from it.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: I was surprised that I actually lliked Vitamin Squeeze. I am usually not much of a fan of fruit punch flavored drinks, plus I was unsure of any odd taste or aftertaste. Other "drop" type drinks that I have tried have not been so pleasant.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze tasted pretty good, had no odd taste and no aftertaste. It reminded me of Hawaiin Punch, which I haven't actually bought in at least 15 years just because of the sugar content.<br /><br />This product is sweet and fruity enough without any sugar.<br /><br />The downside was that I did not actually notice any energy. I drink energy drinks and also use a few different brands of energy pills off and on - so maybe I am used to a higher level of "energy" ingredients?<br /><br />I liked Vitamin Squeeze for the flavor, and vitamin content, but would not recommend it for an energy drink based on my experience with it. Perhaps though someone who does not use "stronger" energy products regularly would have better results with this product in that regard.

The bottle says 1 "squeeze", but a squeeze could be a lot if you want or very little.  I didn't enjoy the taste very much, and it kind of reminds me of cough medicine.  However, if you add a good amount in, it improves the taste slightly.  It's got zero calories, zero sugar, and zero carbs.  Great for those who are always on the go.  I don't get any "burst of energy" from adding this to my water, if you are sensitive to caffeine, you might get a different effect.  Give it a try.

review/summary: Ok, Kind of "chemical' Tasting
review/text: The bottle is very large and you'll get a lot out of it.  Intensity of flavor is to 'taste' - I think that's why they measure by 'a squeeze' rather than anything more scientific (also, for convenience).  By the end of the bottle, I was able to quickly figure out how much of a squeeze I wanted to get it to taste the way I wanted.<br /><br />That said, the flavor does taste very 'chemical' like. I'm not sure if they want me to feel like I am getting vitamins or if they were going more for a 'sports drink' type of flavor.  My husband, who is a fitness nut, didn't mind the flavor at all.  Me, I found it very off-putting and far too fake.  I would have preferred more of a crystal light than a Powerade flavor.<br /><br />The bottle is very convenient - makes it easy to fill up a normal water bottle, add my squeeze, and then off I go on the bike or trip. I just wish I liked the taste better.

review/summary: Kids love it
review/text: This is definitely a bigger hit with the kids in the house than the adults. It's a fast and easy way to make a quick drink that's got more flavor than water, but not as sweet as Kool-Aid. It's a fun way to add a boost to a bottled water, or a little something to a plain glass of water, without the need for packets of powdered mixes. As with most all concentrated drink mixes like this, you have to watch not to get any on fabric or it will stain, a bit of an issue with kids. My kids like it enough to ask for it as a drink (partially I think because they can make drinks with this themselves), but it's not so great that it will replace the other favorite drinks in the home by the adults. These are a fun idea for taking along on trips as well, since you can skip all the packaging bulk and just take one of these and some reusable drink containers that you fill up with water. Great for those camping, RVing, on long trips or just for keeping in the car to add a shot of flavor to a bland bottled water.

We like water in our house and drink it a lot.  This doesn't have the same flavor as some of the other artificial flavor boosters, it isn't sugary, it is more of a subtle fruity hint in your water.  It's pretty nice.
