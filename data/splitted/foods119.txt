review/summary: Really delicious and not too sweet
review/text: Although I'm not gluten-sensitive, I love granola-type bars, and so I was eager to try these out.  They are very tasty and not too sweet!  Besides being gluten-free, these are also wheat-free and dairy-free. Most of the ingredients are also organic.<br /><br />The shape and size is almost like a cookie, and the consistency is soft, so if you like harder granola bars, you might not like these.  The oat and coconut tastes are dominant to me, and the chocolate taste is a bit lighter.  The chocolate chunks are also not too large, which I like since it means that I can keep these on hand in my car or purse, without having to worry about them melting.<br /><br />As for nutritional facts, each bar has 180 calories, 9 grams of fat (13% of your daily value), with 2 grams coming from saturated fat.  There are 23 grams of carbs, 2 grams (10% of daily value) of fiber, and 8 grams of sugar.  This makes them pretty comparable to other bars like Luna Bars and Larabars.<br /><br />Overall, I really like these and am glad I gave them a try.  I will definitely purchase more.

review/summary: I would not buy it
review/text: There is no one with celiac or gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance in my family, so I cannot really speak for the value of this product for them.  As for me, I don't think this is worth the money.<br /><br />Here are my test results:<br /><br />My 2 year old grandson loved them.  The 6 year old rejected them handily.<br />I only tasted them lightly for reasons I will list below.<br />They are gluten free and non dairy if you need that.<br />They contain organic ingredients if that is what you are looking for<br /><br />But:<br />They have 8 g of sugars and these sugars are very heavy on the fructose.  Both agave and coconut sugars are 60 to 90% fructose.  Now, I choose not to argue with anybody who wants to defend fructose.  I am fructose intolerant so I dare not to even try eating these because of that.  I have read a lot of scientific literature about fructose and I have my opinions and the corn council has theirs.<br />They have 180 calories per 40 gram serving which is too much for a snack for my purposes.  Yes, eating half would be only 90 calories, but half is barely a bite.<br /><br />Here is the kicker:  they have only 2 g of protein per serving so they would not be a good exchange for a meal.<br /><br />I tend to buy a far cheaper store brand version of Quaker oats granola bars. Ounce for ounce they have about the same amount of sugar and fat, far less saturated fat, and about the same number of calories, except they come in smaller 100 calorie packages so I only eat that one. I find them filling enough to be satisfying. The grandsons love them and everybody is happy.

review/summary: Best GF Bar I've Ever Tasted
review/text: Being gluten intolerant it was really nice to see that Pamela's has put out a GF type clif bar (best analogy I had for it). Oddly enough, it does taste like a lighter version of a clif bar (which are usually very dense). Mind you, it would take two of these to fill me like a clif bar does.<br /><br />It's about 2/3rd's the size of a clif bar, it's loaded with oats (this is the first thing you taste) and chocolate chips (which is about the last thing you taste). They are moist and chewy like a soft cookie. About a medium sweetness compared to a regular cookie.<br /><br />Per bar: calories (180), fat (9 gr), carbs (23 gr), fiber (2 gr), and protein (2 gr).<br /><br />Ingredients: GF oats, organic agave, brown rice flour, white rice flour, sweet rice flour, tapioca starch, xanthan gum, organic chocolate chunks (organic natural evaporated can sugar, organic cocoa paste, organic cocoa butter, non-GMO soy lecithin/emulsifier, gluten-free organic vanilla) coconut sugar, monounsaturated safflower oil, organic eggs, almonds, coconut, chia seeds, natural flavors, sea salt, baking soda, xanthan gum.<br /><br />They do note on the packaging that there may be traces of milk, nuts, peanuts or soy because of what they're processed on.<br /><br />Overall, they're pretty darn good.  I do taste a bit of baking soda (but I think that's me, I'm pretty sensitive to it) at the end of a bite, but the oats really are the main taste.<br /><br />As someone who eats gluten free would I eat these if I was out and about and had to take a break quickly?<br /><br />Yeah, I would.<br /><br />They're like a soft, oaty cookie, easy to take, good ingredients, and they do taste quite nice. I'll buy them again easily.<br /><br />If I had to pick between a clif bar and Pamela's Whenever Bars. I'd take Pamela's.

review/summary: satisfying but sweet
review/text: This product has many claims, making it appear healthy. A quick look at the nutritional information, however, shows somewhat otherwise. Each bar is 180 calories, which is a good mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. Total fat, though, is 9g, with 2g saturated fat. Fortunately, it provides 2g of fiber and 2g of protein. Everybody's needs are different, but this product is just outside my range of what I consider a "healthy snack".<br /><br />Most of the ingredients are "organic", which is a plus. They are also sweetened with agave and coconut sugar. However, for my personal taste -- and I have quite a sweet-tooth -- this product is too sweet for me. Perhaps it's the chocolate, or one of the other sweetening ingredients, but by the time I finish the bar, I'm reaching for something to drink to cut the sweetness. The benefit of this is that the bar is a good candy-substitute if you are craving a sweet treat in the afternoon hours.<br /><br />The texture is good -- this bar is like a heavy oatmeal cookie. There's nothing hard or crunchy in it. It's very soft and chewy.<br /><br />If it weren't for what I characterize as an extreme sweetness, I could give this product a higher rating.

review/summary: For a reasonably healthy snack, these were fine.
review/text: Overall, this product was fine.  It tasted ok --not GREAT-- but ok, and I felt that I would probably give this another shot to see if it is something that I'd buy more regularly.<br /><br />Note: This product says it contains 180 mg of Omega 3 Fatty Acids.  This is good, but not as good as you'd think.  180 mg is the amount you'd get by ingesting 1/3 of a single capsule of flaxseed oil.  You'd have to eat three bars to get the same amount as a single capsule of oil!)<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ HAS FIBER -two grams of fiber, to be exact.  This is the same amount of 2/3 of a slice of whole wheat bread).<br />+ ORGANIC -this is always a good thing<br />+ NATURAL SWEETENERS.  I really like the idea of using an Agave sweetener, instead of something artificial such as Aspartame.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- 9 grams of fat.  Not a big deal, as it really only is the calories, but if you are watching your fat, too, then it is good to know.<br />- Not as crunchy as I'd like.  Very chewy, and not at all crisp... kind of gummy, even, but not gross.<br /><br />Overall, as a healthy alternative to something like a chocolate bar, I think it is a step in the right direction. Worth a taste because they made a great effort, but it probably won't rock your world.  I give it four stars for what it is trying to be, and for being ok tasting --not chocolate chip granola bar good, but decent.  HOWEVER, if you need a gluten free product (which I didn't, and which this is) then I would REALLY give this a shot.

review/summary: Healthier replacement for a candy bar (180 calories)
review/text: Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever bar is what I would call a dessert bar, a healthier replacement for a candy bar.<br /><br />It comes in a cardboard box containing five individually wrapped bars. The first one I opened had a smell/aroma of coconut upon opening. I didn't notice the smell on subsequent openings.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, the cardboard box touts 180mg Omega 3, 9g whole grains and 0g trans fats. The standard nutrition facts box says, per bar, you get 180 calories, 9g of fat (2.5g saturated), 15mg cholesterol (5%), 130mg sodium, 23gb carbs (2g fiber, 8gb sugars) and 2g protein. It has traces of iron and calcium.<br /><br />Despite the oat-y taste, I actually liked this one and would consider it as a reasonable healthier replacement for mass market candy bars.

review/text: Sure it says 'Oat' bar, but make no mistake these are indulgent and amazing. Proabaly better for you than a candy bar though. Just not a health food really. But I dont care. When youre having a down day or have earned the extra sweets this is now what I crave. Theyre that good. The right amount of sweet, the right amount of chewy. I do really love Coconut though, and enjoy the oat taste so if you dont, your mileage could vary. I havent looked at any other reviews yet, but I cant imagine anyone not loving these, assuming the price isnt an issue for you.

review/text: Coconut is the dominate flavor and texture in these cereal bars. If you don't like coconut then avoid them. The picture also shows chocolate, which is in there for sure, but it is overpowered by the other flavors.<br />The bar itself isn't very appetizing looking. It looks like a wad of granola trail mix was mixed with oils or butter then squashed. This is also about what it tastes like.<br />The rest of the box will get eaten as soon as all other snacks have been eaten and they are the only snack left.

review/summary: The search for the best snack bar continues
review/text: There are many other reviews that go into great detail regarding calories, ingredients etc.  I will not repeat that info here, but will limit my comments to taste/value/"worth it" factor.<br />I thought these tasted just ok.  They would never be my first or second tier pick for a snack.  They are too small for meal substitute and contain too many calories for a snack for anyone watching weight.  I found the mouth feel of these to be unpleasant.  The taste is ok...none of the individual ingredients shine.<br />p.s. Someone with a chip on their shoulder has gone through the reviews for this product and given almost everyone of them an unhelpful feedback--and this includes a huge variety of detailed reviews.  I like to believe this is not someone from Pamelas as they are a good and reputable copany.  But, in all my reviews and looking at other reviews I rarely see this happen...weird...and if this person has the energy I feel sure tney will slam this one also.

review/summary: Great for a treat but not "whenever"
review/text: Hands down, this is the best manufactured gluten free bar I have ever tried. However, it's definitely more like a dessert or a cookie than an energy bar. It's soft, chewy, and fragrant with coconut. The primary flavors are of oats, then coconut, then chocolate chips. I don't taste the chia seeds (which are the new "in" item of health foods). Each one is slightly over 1 oz, which means it's pretty small. In addition, it's also non-dairy, if that is a potential allergic issue.<br /><br />Per bar: calories (180), fat (9g), carbs (23g), fiber (2g), and protein (2g).<br /><br />I sometimes have used Clif or Luna bars as a quick snack or meal replacement because of the added vitamins. I would not do that with this one; it's too sweet. It's sweeter than the standard Clif or non-iced Luna bar. I might incorporate this as an occasional treat, but would definite not recommend it for "whenever".

review/summary: Reminds me of a cookie
review/text: When these came home, I was less skeptical about what I was getting. The name says it all, oat, coconut and chocolate, in a bar form. Sounds more like a cookie to me. Tasted a lot more like a cookie than a bar that was healthy for me. Which is good. I want to taste my food and know it's healthy, than not want to taste my food while knowing it's healthy. There was plenty of chocolate in the bar for me and it wasn't concentrated in chunk or random chips. The chocolate pieces used had melted nicely, so the chocolate was very prevalent throughout.<br /><br />I definitely could taste the coconut, but it was a more fresh flavor than say something you'd buy in a bag at a store. It also did not overpower the rest of the bar. Coconut is a powerful ingredient. It's good to know it was used in moderation. The oats and the cookie part of the bar lend well into reminding me of a great oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I could take a bite and got plenty of the cookie texture I want more of, with bits of oat and smaller but still flavorful coconut.<br /><br />I think it'd work well to think of these less as a bar (like a healthy food bar) and more of a great tasting, small cookie.

review/text: This is a tough product for me to review because at first taste I thought, "hey these aren't too bad," but the second time around I thought, "these are not good!" and then the third time I thought, "there're not as bad as I thought they were last time."  Hmmm.  So my conclusion is they're not too bad, but not that good either.  Each bar comes in an individual package and tastes pretty fresh.  The bars are kind of mushy, with a non-descript brownish color and soft rectangular shape.  I don't know that I really tasted much coconut flavor, and the chocolate chips certainly gave it a boost in taste.  I would not buy these or eat them as snacks, but I do not typically buy snack bars or power bars because on the whole I don't find them all that appealing.  I am always willing to give these types of bars a chance and would LOVE to be won over, but unfortunately these ones didn't do it for me.

I just wanted to say, that most of the fat, in these bars, is the 'good' fat - so, it is actually healthy, for you!  The good fat, comes from the coconut, chia seeds, and I think almonds, also have some good fat in them.  You are getting the good stuff - the Omega-3 fatty acids.  I know there is a good amount in them, because I am always picking the leftover chia seeds, from between my teeth, afterward!<br /><br />Well, that is what I wanted to say.

review/summary: Not Yummy to my Hubby
review/text: My husband is the driving force of healthiness in our household and insists we eat as clean and organic as possible. Normally this kind of snack would be right up his alley, which is why I got them. But he didn't care for the taste. He told me they were alright but kind of plain and told me not to get them again as there are tastier snack options out there for his packed lunches. Saying that, I have to also mention that he either ate the whole box over time or he threw them out because they weren't in the snack drawer the other week when I cleaned it out.

review/summary: I love these!
review/text: Tried these for a Gold Box deal and LOVE them!  They do have a bit of a crumbly texture, although they seem to hold up well in the package.  And if you don't like coconut, you might not like these.  But to me, they taste like yummy cookies!  I don't eat gluten free or dairy free so I can compare these to other bars that can't make those claims and tell you that these are good.  Soft and sweet (and a natural tasting sweet, not artificial), just the right amount of chocolate chips if you're eating these as a snack to not feel like a treat.  Great ingredients.  I will definitely buy these again!

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: These bars were pretty good but visually speaking, very unattractive!  I was a little hesitant to bite in.  This could be because I am phobic of "healthy" foods that try to pretend to be tasty.  So many of them just aren't.  They really aren't.  This particular product was actually pretty good.  Even my husband tried one and liked it and he doesn't like coconut as much as I do.<br /><br />The chocolate Chips helped I think.  But this is really a nice treat and I am happy to say a tasty one that you won't regret eating!

review/summary: Tasty, but brittle...
review/text: My family went 'gluten free' for about six months earlier this year, so finding new GF products is somewhat exciting...!  I really liked the mixture of coconut and chocolate chip, it led to a different, but satisfying flavor.  The cookies did seem a bit brittle though.  I hesitate to call them 'grainy', because they didn't have a grainy texture when eaten, but they did crumble fairly easily.  I prefer chewy cookies, but I understand the limitations of cooking with largely organic ingredients.  Just a heads up... Still, the taste is great.

review/summary: Even my coconut-hating children liked this one
review/text: Yum. Just yum. I've eaten a lot of energy bars, granola bars, various cereal and other bars. Overall I enjoy most of them, so I'm a pretty good target audience. I'm predisposed to being okay with pretty much anything that uses chocolate, so when it's nutritious, too, that's a pretty big bonus.<br /><br />I loved the texture of these, the feel of them in my mouth. And I love oats. Wonderful, wonderful oats. The combination of the satisfying texture and tastes blended well and were very tasty.<br /><br />And, as I wrote in the title, even my kids enjoyed them, and none of them is a fan of coconut. They're a pretty picky crew. The energy bars I eat revolt them. Granola bars? Those are great because they're loaded with sugar. Who doesn't love sugar? So when I handed them these bars I had no idea what to expect. The verdict: not only no complaints, but some raised, appreciative eyebrows!<br /><br />Definitely, no doubt, if I find these in the grocery store I'll buy them. They're great to keep around for those times you're running from activity to activity, meeting to meeting and don't have time for anything resembling a real meal. And it's a lot more nutritious than a candy bar. Good stuff. I'd buy other products by Pamela's, too. And looks like they have a good selection. We're fans!

review/summary: Anytime, tasty, but really small
review/text: These taste really good, and they are moderately low-calorie. They are also wheat-, dairy-, and gluten-free, which is wonderful for those with allergies.  Unfortunately, I could probably eat all of them in a single sitting; they are smaller than the average bar! Of the 180 calories per bar, 80 of those calories are from saturated fats. In the list of ingredients it states "chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment."  I'm not sure what that could mean to someone who is allergic to milk, but I probably would not want to take any chances.  The normal retail price of a package of 5 Whenever Bars hovers around $3.90.  Even at the Amazon.com price, a 6-pack (total 30 bars) would cost $19.62, which breaks down to $3.27 for 5 bars<br />When this package is empty, I am not likely to buy more.

review/summary: Very good, wish they were lower fat
review/text: I tried these and had my kids try them.  The kids thought they were okay - I was really surprised they weren't more enthusiastic to try out a chocolate chip cookie bar.  They actually didn't even finish what I gave them.  I, on the other hand, really liked them.  Bummer that I couldn't finish mine either, because I was put off by the fat content.  Admittedly, I do not eat like a completely normal person - I'm always mindful of fat content, which these bars contain 9 grams and 2 grams of saturated fat.  So even though I loved the coconut, almonds, dark chocolate chips, and the grainy, chewy texture, I really wish I could find these in a lower fat version so I could actually eat and enjoy them!

review/text: I had no reason to buy a gluten-free bar, but the reviews won me over. These are incredible! They taste great -- chocolatey with hints of coconut -- and they actually stave off my hunger for more than twenty minutes, which no snack bar has ever done. Even shortly after eating something like a clif bar I'm ready to gnaw someone's arm off. I'll eat one of these before I go for a long run; it doesn't weigh me down, but I have something in me so I don't feel nauseous afterward. I bought these on sale, but I think I'm going to take the plunge and buy them at the non-sale price. That in itself is an amazing review coming from me.

review/text: After finishing off a box of these over Labor Day weekend on the road, my husband and I agree that these are tasty snacks.  I will buy these again.<br /><br />I'd categorize these as soft and crumbly after the first bite.  It's predominantly an oatmeal-chocolate-coconut taste although I will admit I thought the chocolate felt more like raisins the first time.  These are not so heavily sweet, either as many standard granola bars are. Best of all, there's no chalky aftertaste.<br /><br />Each bar has 180 calories, a nice pick-me-up after my morning cappuccino.

review/summary: Great cookie BUT.......
review/text: This is a great tasting large dense chewy oatmeal and coconut cookie. The BAD news is it's 180 calories and 9 grams of fat with only 2 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein. I would of thought they would have made it a little  more nutritionally balanced since it seems to be marketed as a "bar" so if you want a large cookie then this is the product for you. I just wish they would have packed a little more fiber in it.

review/text: I have a family member on a gluten-free diet, and can't wait to tell her about this product.  It's a decent substitute for cookies, cookie bars or cereal bars, most of which she must avoid.  It does have a rather "pasty" consistency to me, but the full flavors of chocolate and coconut make up for that.  They are a bit pricy as cereal bars go, but worth it for those in search of a tasty gluten-free - and fairly nutritious - snack.

Make sure if this is something you would take with you that you can keep it somewhere protected or you will have a crumbly mess when you open the wrapper.<br /><br />Price wise it is pretty comparable to what is out there.  You get 5 bars per box and six boxes per order, 30 bars total.  With Amazon subscribe and save you can lower the cost even more.  If the gluten free, wheat free and non dairy aspects are important to you then these are recommended.

review/summary: Taste Great, But The Cost Is Ridiculous
review/text: These are the oat chocolate chip coconut bars. These are a soft, cookie-like bar that is wheat and gluten free and have no dairy in them. They also have Omega 3 fatty acids, whole grains, and no trans fats.<br /><br />The bars taste pretty good, although I couldn't really taste the coconut in them. They had a hint of chocolate without being overpowering. The oats were a rolled oats but it was not over powering like some granola bars. The bar is about two inches by three inches and a prefect little snack.<br /><br />On the downside, the bars are really crumbly, almost like there is nothing really holding them together. Because of that, I had to keep them in a container to carry them in my munchie bag.  The bars are real small and are 180 calories. And finally, for five bars, the regular price on Amazon is listed as $30 but they are now discounted to $24.<br /><br />Although they might taste good, I will not be buying these. That is way too much money for three or four bites of a very crumbly cookie.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.

review/summary: I'd Buy It If I Could Find It
review/text: Generally speaking, I am a big fan of chocolate, but not of coconut (unless it's milk), but this blend of the two made for an especially satisfying treat, especially after a long, aerobic workout.  It's a good, sinful treat that can be enjoyed anytime, whether it is while watching one's favorite episode of Psych, or as a reward for finishing that extra mile when jogging.  Two of these treats were knocked off that way.<br /><br />I had one of these treats with my lunch.  At that time, I found they tasted even better when chilled, as the one I ate with lunch was in my lunch bag in the fridge.  The bars have good texture and consistency- either at room temperature or chilled, and are quite filling, especially with water.<br /><br />I gave a couple to two of my acquaintances, and they both raved about the treat.  Also, the one I brought to work and left casually on my desk mysteriously disappeared- perhaps it grew legs and walked off?!?  In the interests of minimizing workplace theft, I strongly suggest you keep these treats under lock and key.

review/summary: Not so great
review/text: These weren't awful, they just weren't good. The combination of flavors is actually nice because you can't go wrong without chocolate and coconut, but the texture just ruins it all. I do understand that often gluten free baking has its obstacles to overcome, but these bars feel like they want to be cake-like but wind up powdery and almost tough at the same time. Basically, they have the sort of texture one imagines a "gluten free" product would have (although it doesn't have to be this way!) And while I love almonds, their presence only adds to the unpleasant feeling this bar has in the mouth.<br />Luckily, I'm not gluten free, but if I were I imagine these would be nice in a pinch though I wouldn't seek them out just to have around.

review/summary: Tasty enough, but I need more protein
review/text: I don't suffer from Celiacs Disease or any other dietary problem, so from my average-person standpoint these bars are pretty okay.  I feel that they are kind of high in calories and very low in protein for me to be eating "whenever".  I'm more of a Zone Bar or Atkins Bar kind of person in that I need the high protein punch of at least 10 grams, a lot more than the 2 grams provided with this bar.  The part of the taste that stuck with me was the oats.  I love oats but I kept feeling them in my mouth like it was plastic or something hard.  I just felt it was a little too "oaty" for me.  I love coconut, but I didn't even notice it.  I'm sure someone who hates coconut would definitely notice, but the overall taste was quite sweet, so it just mixed in with everything else.  These bars withstood the heat test - the box was sitting in my mailbox for at least four hours in the South Texas heat in the middle of July.  I did stick them in the fridge when I got them, but when I ate the bars they were not melted or deformed in any way.<br /><br />I like the ingredients in the bars - lots of organics, real food products and not many undecipherable ingredients.  I would say if you need wheat-free, gluten-free and/or non-dairy snacks, give this a try you may really appreciate it.

review/text: They're called "Whenever bars", but one would probably do best to reserve these for dessert. With that being said, these delicious little treats are packaged individually and are portable enough to go anywhere. And so, in that sense, they can be eaten "whenever". They are also advertised as gluten-free and wheat-free, as well as having 0 grams of trans fats.  But these bars are by no means going to make it into The Evolution Diet. They are by any standard artificially extreme foods. They are artificially extreme, and, at the same time, extremely delicious. Just run off the extra fat tomorrow, and you'll be all right.

review/summary: Wish there was just a little less sugar
review/text: I'm never sure if manufacturers cater to Americans who have a sweet tooth, or if Americans have a sweet tooth because they become acclimated to the  food they buy being sweet.  Each of these bars has 8 grams of sugar.  I realize this isn't too bad when compared to other products in this category, but my personal preference is for less sugar.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a great product...especially for someone who loves coconut and chocolate together.  I am not sensitive to gluten, but I do opt for gluten free products when I can, so that's another plus for Pamela's Whenever Bars.  Good news for a small bar (1.41 oz)-- there are 9 grams of whole grains and 180 mg of Omega 3 Fatty Acids.  And these bars taste great!  No one would suspect they are healthier than a cookie or a lot of their competitors.<br /><br />For the environmentalists, the box is made of recycled materials, and utilizes soy ink.

review/summary: Delicious coconut taste, gluten-free oats is the first ingredient
review/text: These Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars are very good to me. They are the size of a thick medium cookie, are slightly chewy, and are very tasty despite the fact that they do not taste sweet at all.<br /><br />Although coconut is lower in the ingredient list, the cookie tastes mostly like coconut and I didn't taste the chocolate at all.  However, since I like coconut very much, I enjoyed these bars.<br /><br />The first three ingredients in order are gluten-free oats, organic agave, and a rice blend. As for the rest of the cookie's name, chocolate chunks is the fourth ingredient and coconut is the tenth ingedient. The cookie contains eggs and almonds as well. The package claims that you get 180 mg of Omega 3 Fatty Acids and 9 grams of whole grain per bar.<br /><br />Each bar is 180 calories with 80 calories from fat. Nevertheless, these are certainly a better choice than a candy bar and are gluten free. I really like the taste and chewy texture of these bars even though there was absolutely no chocolate taste to me.

review/summary: Okay, but not great
review/text: I have a confession to make:  I had one of these bars and a cup of coffee for breakfast, and it was actually not bad.  But the Amazon stars say "I love it" for 5 stars, "I like it" for 4 stars and "It's okay" for 3 stars.  So, I give it 3 stars.  I personally felt the coconut flavor was stronger than the chocolate flavor and I'm not a big coconut fan, but I am a chocolate fan.  It wasn't terribly sweet and I rather think I would have liked it a little better if it had been sweeter (but not too sweet - I'm kind of picky that way).  I liked the oats and the "gluten free"-ness of it.  I don't eat gluten, so that makes bread/bagels pretty expensive.  These worked out best for breakfast, although I think I used it as a going to bed snack a couple of times.<br /><br />So, just for fun, I got some nutritional information from 1) Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip bars 2) some unsalted, dry roasted peanuts and 3) some non-gluten gingersnaps.<br /><br />1) 1, 1.41 oz bar  -had 9g fat, 15 mg cholesterol, 130 mg sodium and 2g of protein.<br />2) 1 oz (40 nuts)  -had 14g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 0mg sodium and 7g protein.<br />3) 5 cookies (30g or 1.06 oz)  -had 6g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 85 mg sodium and 2g protein.<br /><br />I think that each of these snacks might serve at one point or another.  If you are looking for high protein, then neither the cookies or the Pamela's bars would do the trick, confirming that the Pamela's bars would be more of a snack than a meal.  So don't eat one of these with coffee for breakfast.  Ever.

They are great to have around for a low calorie, sweet treat.

review/summary: Delicious , Nice soft texture
review/text: I really was expecting some nearly straw-like hard thing. I was expecting NOT to like it.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, it was actually very good with quite a few nice flavors-coconut, chocolate, oats, etc. that all came together well.  (And I'm like Mikey on the old Life cereal commercials-I don't like these things usually.)  But, I was looking for something tolerable to eat on the run or at the desk. It certainly is tastier than that.<br /><br />The nutritional analysis is pretty good.  At 180 calories and  9 grams of fat, it probably is most appropriate as a snack substitute, commuter or travel tidbit, or as a meal component with your tea, coffee, milk & fruit. If you're hungry & want something good, healthy, and quickly, this is a good choice.<br /><br />No trans fat, but be aware it is not low-fat.  No Vitamin C, minimal calcium but a good source of fiber and whole grain.  Good source of Omega 3 Fatty acids, low source of protein (2 g).<br /><br />So enjoy it as a healthy, tasty source of fiber and Omega 3 Fatty Acids, but you should look elsewhere in your diet for protein, Vitamin C, Calcium-not significantly fortified there.<br /><br />But, hey, it's much better than a standard cookie and tastes just as good or better!

review/summary: Very tasty, but not really a health food
review/text: Because they are both gluten-free and wheat-free, these soft, chewy bars seem to be trying to masquerade as health food.  In truth, however, these "bars" are barely distinguishable from cookies--perhaps a slightly more wholesome version, as they are relatively low in sugar (8 grams) and filled with other beneficial ingredients (e.g., 180 mg Omega 3s, 9 grams of whole grains, and 2 grams each of fiber/protein).<br /><br />BUT, being a cookie bar isn't necessarily a bad thing!  Although each bar is a bit high in calories/fat (180/9 grams), especially for the smallish size, the individual packaging of the bars assists with portion control.  And perhaps more importantly, the taste of these bars is excellent!  As promised, they are moist and chewy, very similar to a cookie that you would purchase from a bakery (or even something homemade).  Biting into the bar, you can taste flakes of coconut, pieces of nut, and small bits of chocolate.  Overall, these were definitely a yummy treat!<br /><br />I suspect that these bars will mainly appeal to those looking for gluten-free snacks, but others will enjoy this product as well.

review/summary: Recommend you give it a try!
review/text: Some of these "healthy" snack products taste like the box they come in.  "SoyJoy" comes to mind.  Ick.<br /><br />However, Pamela's gluten-free oat chocolate chip coconut "bars" are quite tasty and satisfying.  The cover of the box lists it as wheat-free, gluten-free, non-dairy, with 180 mg of Omega-3 fatty acids, 9 grams of whole grains, and no trans fat.  In small print on the side we also find that this company donates to celiac sprue and autism organizations.<br /><br />And it is indeed, as the box also claims, "moist and chewy."  The major downer about the product is merely its consistency, as it comes out of its packet as some kind of misshapen, ill-defined lump rather than a literal "bar," and as such it doesn't hold together very well, but that's nitpicking.  Just eat it while it's still in the wrapper and there's no mess.<br /><br />Ingredients include gluten-free oats, rice flour, organic chocolate chunks, coconut sugar, organic eggs, & almonds.  Well worth a try if this description appeals to you.  Enjoy!

review/summary: A healthier snack bar
review/text: This "whenever bar" contains organic ingredients and is wheat and dairy-free. It does contain eggs and it is sweetened with agave nectar, which is really not so good for those sensitive to sugar. To me this item tasted like "health food" cookies I've had in the past - pretty tasty but not really that healthy for you since they are high in sugar content and contain cooked oils. I wouldn't use these regularly myself but I found this much better than products that are full of refined ingredients like hydrogenated oils and corn syrup.

review/summary: A Good for You Snack
review/text: My days on the university campus are long--they start with office hours at about 7:30 until 10, and then classes until 2 or 3:15.  Office hours later until about five.  I usually carry my own lunch to eat in the office or on the run.  No quiet breaks for me, I usually have students in the office.  When my blood sugar starts dropping, I don't have much time to wait, so a little bar like this serves really well to give me a little boost.  I prefer not to have chips or cookies or crackers, as I need to watch both sugar intake and salt intake.  I'm not gluten-intolerant. That said, I enjoy these little bars by Pamela's Products.  It truly is good for "Whenever."  This particular flavor is soft and very much like a soft-baked oatmeal cookie with chocolate chips and coconut in it--but without the gluten!  The flavor is natural, not very fake-berry flavored or peanut-butter-covering-up-the-flavor-of soy-protein flavored.  It's probably five or six bites for me, and a couple crumbs will fall off as I nosh, but that's okay for me, now that I know.  A bit high in calories (180), but the number of carbs is low (23, before fiber content figures in), so it's a pretty safe treat when you have blood sugar considerations.  It's a darned tasty treat.  I will look for them at my grocer's in the near future, as the long school year gets underway.  Thanks, Pamela!

review/text: I was surprised by the flavor of these bars, and while they seemed a bit small at first, I found them to be pretty filling. They were very popular with my family, and the box was empty almost as soon as I opened it!<br /><br />Calories are ok, about what I'd expect, and even though I'm not a fan of coconut I did not find it bothersome. I tasted more chocolate than anything else, and you can't complain about that.<br /><br />I would definitely buy them again, though I might have to hide them for myself next time!

However, people like me who don't have these restrictions enjoy them just for the great taste! As a big fan of oatmeal, coconut, and chocolate, I know that many products containing these ingredients are not good for me. That's why I'm thrilled that I discovered Pamela's products. I can enjoy what I love without a guilty conscience! Instead of picking up a candy bar, I have a Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Bar instead. Delicious!

review/summary: A chewy, not too sweet snack
review/text: I like this bar because it is healthy without tasting blah! It's nicely chewy and not as dry or tasteless as some "health" bars tend to be.  A nice combination of grains, coconut and chocolate make this a bar to reach for if you want a quick, easily packable snack that is not unhealthy. With that said, the calories are rather high: 180, and it includes 9 grams of fat, so you couldn't really call it a low-cal snack. I've often had one for breakfast as a kind of meal replacement when I'm in a hurry, with a glass of OJ and felt it satisfied me for a few hours, until lunch time. I like that it's gluten free, even though I don't actually have a gluten allergy that I know of.  But I think it's great that those who do have gluten intolerance are getting more and more choices.Bottom line: this is a nice snack, fairly healthy, and not a bad choice as a quick meal substitute.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I was a little skeptical when ordering this product. With everything it had going for it I figured there had to be a catch. Wheat-Free, Gluten-free, Non-Dairy - I wasn't expecting much in the way of flavor. I was pleasantly surprised that, while it seems subdued, there is flavor and it's alright. I can taste the chocolate & the coconut predominately. As it states on the box, they are "moist & chewy". I wasn't a fan of the texture at first but by the time I got to the 3rd bar it was fine.<br /><br />What I didn't like is that one bar has 180 calories (80 of which come from fat). So much for a healthy "whenever" bar.<br /><br />15mg of Cholesterol, 130mg of sodium (yikes), 23g Total Carbohydrates, 2g of dietary fiber, 8g of sugar, 2g of protein.<br /><br />It also states that there are 180mg Omega 3 fatty acids, 9 grams of whole grains, & 0 grams trans fats.<br /><br />The numbers above are for 1 bar which = 1 serving.<br /><br />This product contains coconut, eggs, soy, and almonds. It is processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts, other tree nuts, soy, and milk.<br /><br />So this isn't something I would personally chose to get again. They're alright in terms of flavor but they just seem to have too much of a downside when inspecting the label.

review/summary: Surprisingly delicious
review/text: My husband and I are backpackers...so we have carried a variety of bars with us while we are out hiking.  This includes Quaker bars, Luna bars, Cliff bars, Zone bars, etc. So, because I like to change it up, I thought I would give these bars a try, even though they don't carry the protein I am use to.  Additionally, I liked the claim of these bars:  These bars are gluten free, are a good source of fiber, have 9 grams of whole grains per bar, include 180 mg of omega 3 fatty acids, and are sweetened with agave and coconut sugar.<br /><br />The bars themselves come packaged in your usual packaging, and this design is quite attractive as far as designs go.<br /><br />When I saw the bar itself, I was a little skeptical.  It looked more like a moist, waxy, lump of ingredients than the solid "granola" bar I was use to.  However, I continued on ahead in the tasting adventure.  Additionally, they are decent sized and the numbers of carbs, sugars, and fat are comparable to smaller bars--so I feel like you are getting more bar to eat than other brands for the same nutritional intake.<br /><br />As far as taste?  I've got to admit.  I was amazed at the taste.  These bars are delicious!  They have more of a fresh quality about them than your usual granola bar.  The combination of the oatmeal and the coconut work well together.  You taste those two flavors over the chocolate.  It's hard to explain---but I give an A + to taste, texture and size.  Texture is very soft and chewy, so easy to eat.  (Other bars have made my jaw ache from chewing).<br /><br />I would purchase these bars again and I'm excited to try additional flavors.

They are very chewy and the selection of ingredients are combined as to not dominate the other. The coconut does leave an aftertaste. I was surprised how tasty these are considering they are gluten free. As one reviewer stated, they do stick to your teeth and it's good to have a drink handy to wash it down with. These are tastier and healthier than your typical cereal bar even if they are a bit higher in calories. Good product.

review/summary: Better than Average Bar
review/text: Let's face it, eating an energy bar is not the same as real food.  However, this bar is a step above the norm and I recommend you have it available for those times you need a boost and no time to cook.  The Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Bar has a nice coconut taste with a touch of chocolate.  A tad on the high side with 180 calories but certainly no higher than many. 180 mg. Omega 3 Fatty Acids, no transfats and 9 grams whole grains.  Add Gluten free, dairy free, and wheat free and that makes this a particularly appealing bar for those with such allergies or sensitivities.  And Pamela's Products (the maker) donates to Celiac and Autism support organizations.  So not only does the bar have nutritional value it has human value...a winner all around.  Definitely give them a try.

review/summary: Tastier than expected!
review/text: Often, foods that are targeted toward being free of an undesirable ingredient end up being heavy with other ingredients to make up for it - anyone remember the "fat-free" craze that gave us sugar-heavy, calorie-laden foods?<br /><br />I was concerned that these would have a cloyingly sweet flavor to make up for the lack of wheat and dairy - I was pleasantly surprised to find just the opposite.  Actually, my first bite immediately took me back to the days in the 80's when my mom tried to find healthier ways to make cookies without sugar.  Sorry to say, Mom's experiments didn't work out well... but with only 8 grams of sugar per bar, these would make Mom proud.<br /><br />I found enough chocolate to tip the scales from "unsweet" into "just right".  The almonds, coconut, and oats give a great texture that took a while to chew up, making the eating experience more satisfying.<br /><br />These were really great warmed up!  I ate my first one straight from of finding the package in my mailbox (summer + Texas = baked mail), and it was like eating a fresh cookie straight from the oven.  I had to stop myself from eating another one right away!<br /><br />Just for fun, I tried another one chilled.  This was also pretty good - the softness of the bar plus the cold made it a nice treat on a hot day.<br /><br />At the current Amazon price, it works out to about $.76 per bar, which is a fair price for a snack with less sugar than your average granola bar, and better ingredients, too.

review/text: I'm always on the lookout for healthy snacks for my family. Seeing how chocolate chips and coconut are a combo I can't resist, I had to give these a try. Wow was I surprised. These are actually really tasty. The big test was offering the kids a taste of this new cookie. They loved it and immediately ask for their own to chow on. I caught my 4 year old sneaking one out of the package thinking she was stealing dessert. The ingredients on the side are all things I can pronounce and I didn't notice a single thing I would be afraid to feed my family. Bonus points for containing some organic ingredients AND being packaged in 100% Recycled Paperboard AND printed with Soy Ink. I love "greened" products! I also love that it contains Omega 3 Fatty Acids. I've tried incorporating more Omega 3's into our diet and it has been surprisingly difficult. These will make a great afterschool, pre-game, or on the go snack to toss in my purse. Only complaint is the bar was falling apart when I took it out of the wrapper. Not sure if that is a product flaw or if it happened during shipping. Either way this is a  product, and brand, I look forward to trying more. Yay for healthy snacks!

review/text: These bars have the texture of a soft cookie, and taste a lot like a chocolate chip muffin with coconut.  They are very tasty.  Also, if you love "natural" ingredients, you will likely be happy with these.  The drawback, however, is that they are 180 calories with only 2 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber. 80 of the 180 calories are from fat.  No wonder they are so tasty!  So these are something I would eat when I am not really trying to have a meal substitute, and am throwing dietary caution to the winds.  They are, however pretty filling and for that reason a great snack.

I would have never guessed that they were gluten free because I've tried gluten free food and this was nothing like that. This bar was a perfect afternoon snack that was chewy and light. I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor that wasn't overpowering. I had eaten the entire bar before I knew it and found it kept me going all afternoon too. I think I might have found a new hiking snack! Yay!

review/summary: Could Be Bigger
review/text: Pamela's Gluten Free Whenever Bars are not bad for a quick bite on the go, but may leave you feeling a little unsatisfied and hollow.<br /><br />Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut is a good flavor combo- soft, chewy and pretty tasty- but there's more oats than chips or coconut.  Wheat free, gluten-free and non-dairy, they're good for a whenever snack- just as advertised.  The box indicates there may be traces of soy due to the manufacturing process.<br /><br />The energy boost is a little light, with 23 g carbs per 40 g bar.  That's not much better than a piece of fruit.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in these in that they're a bit on the small side and the product description is misleading: the box only contains five bars, not six.  They're ok, but I'll agree with another reviewer in that I'd still take a Clif bar over these.

review/summary: As Always Pamaela's Products are Fantastic.
review/text: I received these on a very hot day 97 degrees. They felt very squishy so I let them sit a day before trying.<br />Oh my goodness, they are so moist and just the right mix of coconut and chocolate, almonds. The bar is big enough to be a good small meal if you eat 6 meals a day 3 snack size and 3 small regular. They are soft and a bit chewy.<br /><br />I know I can trust Pamela's products to be gluten free and of the highest quality. I highly recommend these, they taste like a home made cookie that Grandma made. Super yummy.

review/summary: I will never use 1800flowers ever again
review/text: I will never use 1800flowers again.  After paying roughly $450 for 3 arrangements for my grandmothers funeral, I felt the arrangements were poor in design with poor flower quality.  The company can blame this on the florist but I believe it shows the relationship that 1800flowers has with its florists and it's not a good one.  The card was hand printed with very poor handwriting, most of what I wanted on the card wasn't easily read and that was true for all three arrangements.  Nothing about the arrangements would even tell me which florist was responsible for fulfilling the order.  Another testament to a bad relationship with its florists.  Never again will I ever use or recommend 1800flowers.  No family member of mine, no friend I can convince, will ever use them again.

review/summary: Great Pancakes
review/text: I go through stages where i seek out different alternatives to regular mass market products and look instead for artisinal or just somewhat unorthodox alternatives.  sometimes it works out and other times i end up with a cabinet full of stuff that noone in the house will touch.<br /><br />this time it worked great.<br /><br />this mix is an excellent change from the standard big brand pancake mixes (haven't used it for waffles).  the flapjacks have an excellent consistency and taste great.  i've actually noticed the whole family uses less syrup with this mix than our old stand by which produced pancakes that weren't much more than syrup delivery vehicles.  the cakes are moist and delicious.

review/summary: Amaaaaaaazing Pancakes!! Best Pancake mix EVER.
review/text: These pancakes are the absolute best. They are so light, not dense like a lot of whole grain pancakes. I don't know how they do it but I'm hooked. And they almost smell like malted milk when they cook, sweet and toasty. And so easy. Don't have any milk or soy milk or eggs in the house? No problem, since you only need water. Great to pack if you are traveling and staying in a place with a kitchenette. I hope they make this mix FOREVER!!!

review/summary: Not much flavor but ok
review/text: Krusteaz has been my favorite pancake mix for years.  My husband likes fluffy pancakes though and seeing that other reviewers said these were fluffy and delicious, I decided to give it a try. The mix looks like buckwheat pancake mix as you would expect from whole grain and it did come out nice and fluffy.  Husband and kids absolutely loved it. For once there were no bits of pancake left on their plates.  The only thing I didnt like about it was that, to me, it tastes like oatmeal in pancake form. Since my opinion is outnumbered in this house I will probably be buying this again for my guys.

review/summary: Perfect Waffle mix
review/text: We had been looking for a healthy waffle mix that tasted good, along with being made with natural ingredients. Most of the mixes I would find, either did not taste good, or full of ingredients I prefer to avoid. This has been the perfect mix, along with the Proctor Silex waffle maker we also purchased from Amazon.<br /><br />We have found that 1/2 cup of mix and about 1/2 cup of water is the exact mixture for this waffle iron and six minutes is the idea cook time. Now that we have figured that out, we just mix, pour, and time the cooking process. We have started adding a few things like fresh blueberries, Watkins flavorings and other fruit to give them some variety without adding a lot of calories. Keeping the calories in check was a goal we had too when deciding on this mix.<br /><br />If you like waffles and looking for a good alternative to the normal mixes, this is it. Also a big plus is all you need is water and no other ingredients. If you are a backpacker or camper, this can be an advantage too.

review/summary: Bought these on a whim, now we can't get enough!
review/text: In all honesty, I initially tried these flapjacks out of convenience.  I was having a bunch of people over for Christmas morning breakfast, and forgot to buy waffle ingredients at the grocery store.  I instantly came to Amazon, and with being a Prime member, knew that I could receive these the following day. Amazon only stocks limited pancake/waffle mixes, so I chose to try the Kodiak Cakes and I am SO GLAD I had.  As I write this review, I am back to order my second and third pack of 3.  My kids LOVED them (I added chocolate chips to the mix, and we made waffles) and since they are whole grain, they are incredibly satisfying and delicious.  Can't say enough about these--they taste homemade and I am intrigued to try the entire baking mix line from this company.

review/summary: The only whole grain pancake mix I'll ever buy.
review/text: I'll keep it brief.  First, I usually don't like whole grain, multi-grain, or whole wheat pancake mixes.  I bought this mix to put in a breakfast gift basket I was putting together and since I had to buy a 3-pack I decided to keep a box for myself.  Christmas morning when the cakes were on the griddle the whole downstairs was filled with the gentle aroma of butter milk and honey.  The texture is a little more than a regular pancake but in  a good way.  And the flavor.........oh my they're good.  Little butter, little Highland Sugarworks maple syrup and I was in heaven. The only negative I would point out is that if you use even parts mix and water it makes the batter a wee bit too thin for me.  No biggie, I just reduced the water by about 1/4 and all was well.

review/text: You never know with mixes of any kind, particularly ones that you don't see in grocery stores, at least not much in Tennessee.  This makes excellent pancakes.  Made waffles once, and it did not do quite as well.  Generally, waffles take more oil than pancakes so that could explain it.  Also,it was first use of waffle iron and that may have contributed to mediocre results.  But pancakes are great.  Great ingredients, great taste, and ease of preparation.

review/text: I've been using Krusteaz mix for a while which is OK but nothing special. This mix seems to have everything going for it - great flavor, texture and healthy ingredients. The honey makes them sweeter than other mixes so I use less syrup. One cup of mix makes two 10" pancakes which is enough for two people. Pancakes are not as good as scratch made buttermilk pancakes, but it's soooo easy to use and I don't have to figure out what to do with all that extra buttermilk.

The kids love it and it's healthier than most brands found in supermarkets, a total win-win.  It fills you up quickly so a box lasts longer. I've also tried the Kodiak Frontier mix - it was also good, but we like this Buttermilk version better (and smells so good).  The only thing is, I can only find it here in Amazon and nowhere else, great price though $13 for 3 boxes, will buy again.  The Frontier version is easier to find - Safeway and local supermarkets.  Hope Amazon doesn't stop selling the Buttermilk version.

review/summary: I will never eat regular pancakes again!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: First when I opened the box the smell was divine. The pancake batter before mixed w/ water smells like fresh baked sugar cookies. Then I added water and poured it into my waffle maker/grill. Cooked up fine with no graininess or lumps. I didn't follow the directions of 1 cup water to 1 cup mix. I just added water and stirred until I  got my desired consistency. My waffles looked like any other waffle. I poured my syrup and it was to my surprise delicious. Very light flavor. Not bitter or too sweet. I expected a strong bitter taste when I saw wheat flour and a gritty or graininess b/c it's organic but it's a smooth texture like ihop pancakes or regular pancakes. The vanilla and the honey in the mix give a nice mild taste to it without making the pancakes too sweet. I think the buttermilk they use makes the over all product not taste like cooked grain mush as well. I would definitely buy this mix again. I got the 3 pack for $11 through amazon's subscribe and save. I've heard 1 box can run you anywhere from $6-8. I'm not a big breakfast person, but will look forward to these 4 breakfast. My friend is a southern and he makes chicken and waffles with this mix , but he uses tofu instead of chicken though since he's vegan.<br /><br />p.s - be careful using oils such as olive and coconut that over heat to easily when using waffle maker or even on the stove. I wasted a whole box on pancakes that would turn hard as a brick on the outside and still be mushy and uncooked at the center.

review/summary: Not as shown and who is Sheryl?
review/text: I was disappointed when I received this bonsai desert rose for a number of reasons.<br /><br />First, the packaging.  I have mail ordered other bonsai so was disappointed at how much dirt came out during the unwrapping process.  I would highly recommend you unwrap outdoors, perhaps on grass where you don't care about the dirt.<br /><br />Second, the bonsai I received is not the one shown, or even really much like it.  I was hoping for the gnarled, twisted root and trunk look in the picture.  What I received was basically a fat trunk, no gnarls, no twists.  There are feeder roots coming off the trunk almost 3 inches above the dirt level.  The base does not seem firmly rooted in the pot at all.  In fact, if you grasp the trunk, you can easily lift the entire rootball out of place, without disturbing much of the surrounding soil or decorative pebbles.  Almost like it was just shoved into the pot for shipping to me.  It was advertised as suitable for a beginner, but I am going to have to do some quick research and see about repotting it more securely into the pot.  Far from what I was hoping for.<br /><br />Third, the plant ccame with a sheet of general instructions, not specific to this type of plant.  The first paragraph tells you how vitally important a humidity tray is for the plant's well being.  Why not add $7 to the price and include the darn thing rather than making me call in a separate order and pay for more shipping.<br /><br />Fourth, who the heck is Sheryl?  I made this purchase based on another review which mentioned how nice Sheryl was to deal with on a problem.  This shipment came from Lou's Bonsai--no Sheryl in sight.  Not that it really matters, but it seems odd.<br /><br />I have been bitten by the bonsai bug hard and intend to purchase more, but I most likely will not buy another bonsai from this seller.  There are other sellers available on Amazon and over the internet that will ship you exactly what you see in the picture, rooted into their pots appropriately, etc.  I gave the review two stars because the plant itself seems basically healthy.

review/summary: Not as pictured AT ALL. False listing!
review/text: I agree with the other review. Beware: the plant is not as pictured or anything like it. I purchased this Desert Rose for my dad because he fell in love with the one in the photo and the description (~15 years old desert rose). The Amazon shipping weight says 21lbs, mine was UPS 3lbs. I was totally disappointed as I paid $95 with shipping just to get a desert rose that does not look like it's 15 years old. The caudex on the plant I got was only ~2-3" wide and the one in the photo looks about ~6-7"+ wide.<br /><br />I contacted Lou immediately (I also have no idea why the seller's name is Sheryl when the actual seller is LouBonsai) and he is great at responding. He told me he would ship me a new plant and I kept emailing to make sure it's not just ANY desert rose, but SPECIFICALLY the one similar to the photo. However, their responses were brief and not descriptive about what they are sending (i.e. the response was "BIGGER AS I WAS TOLD"). I felt as if my concerns were not answered. Lou said he was going to send me a new plant with a tracking number on 7/23 but I heard nothing. I had to email him on 7/25 to ask, they provided one and said I was able to track it the next day. It's 7/27 now and the UPS tracking number still says that a label has been created but package is not dropped off yet. I'm a very disappointed customer at this point.<br /><br />It would be nice for them to list the actual plant they are selling because it's definitely not the one I received.<br /><br />2 stars for responsiveness.
