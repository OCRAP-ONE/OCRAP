review/summary: candies are small; bag is huge
review/text: I didn't realize the "midgees" are the little bitty Tootsie Rolls, so the bag didn't look as big online as it turned out to be. You have to eat 2 or 3 midgees at a time, so that's annoying, and the bag is so huge I started giving away sandwich bags full of them to everyone at home and at work.

review/summary: getting smaller all the time
review/text: It's a tootsie roll, but there's not much of it.  These are very small, almost tiny.  I didn't notice the "Midgees" label when I ordered them.  I like a little more toostie roll than this.  So, you end up eating three or four instead of one or two.

review/text: Yes, these are Midgees, which means smaller sized Tootsie chews. A few satisfy both the need for chocolate with less 'fat' and the crave to chew. But I can't put too many of them out because they are addictive...simply yummy.

review/summary: That was a good product
review/text: I was looking at many different companies that have the whole wheat pearl couscous (israeli couscous), and I found that ROLAND is the most qualified company, and even 10 lb is a bit big quantity, but I don't regret because I saved money and the product last for a long time, also it is healthy and can be used mainly for breakfast and dinner, and as a quick recipe, broil what you can eat in the water (don't put too much) till it is absorbed, then add some milk (organic is preferable for complete healthy meal) then heat it,now you have three options, enjoy it as it is, add some salt (organic), or some honey (organic) if you want it sweet, instead of honey you can use maple serup (organic). ENJOY

review/summary: Good taste
review/text: This has a good taste. I had never had these before, so I didn't really have anything to compare it to. It has a good taste, but not the spicy taste you normally find with many Indian foods. The thing I like about most Tandoor products is that the ingredients taste fresh - I know what I am supposed to be eating and I don't have the look at the package to remind me of what is "supposed" to be in the package.<br />This isn't a product I would want alone for a meal - but having it with a variety of Indian dishes makes for a very fun meal.<br />These dosa's are individually wrapped - which means I can just eat one at a time and take them out when I am in the mood for one. There are times I will just take out one and heat it for lunch.<br />Overall a really good product if you enjoy a variety of Indian foods.

review/summary: The best honey for your money
review/text: This stuff is great - I usually eat it right out of the jar.<br /><br />My roommate picked some up in New york and I think it took us all of two weeks to run through the first jar.<br />It's great in smoothies, tea, with raw cheese (mmm!), and with peanut and almond butters. I feel totally fine giving it to my daughter as a sugar replacement because it has nutrients and isn't processed, and she likes it too.<br /><br />I'll also mention, anecdotelly, that I used to have some pretty severe food allergies. Now, there's some research that suggests that eating raw, local honey may help boost your immune system and reduce your allergies to natural plants in your area. I wouldn't put all that much stock into this concept, except that after I finished my first jar of this honey, I found that I could eat apples again! And Almonds! and raw veggies and even Hazelnuts, which I used to be REALLY allergic to! It had been over a decade since I had been able to eat these without itchiness, swelling, and nausea. It might be coincidence, but it happens to be the only thing I changed in my diet or lifestyle. Who knows?<br /><br />Regardless, this stuff tastes great and you should get it for the taste alone if nothing else.<br /><br />Enjoy!

I was also allergic to dust and other pollens, and for some reason I can now eat these acid fruits without getting an upset stomach, my allergies are gone and I can easily eat pecans and nuts and digest them without a problem.<br /><br />My gastritis and ulcers are gone, and I don't know if I should attribute it to this honey, but I am one happy man!!!

review/summary: Among the best!
review/text: This honey is among the best I have had. It was the first raw honey I had ever tried and, quite honestly, if I had tried a different brand first I may not have continued to purchase raw honey. The reason I purchased it was the price; however, I purchased it at a discount store so it was much less than retail. I got the 2 lb jar for only $10.  The store I got it from only gets it in stock when it is another store's overstock so I'm SOL now.<br />I have tried several other brands since this one but none are close to the quality you get with this one. The only one that was comparable was a creamed honey from Trader Joe's and that one was only $3 per lb but I'm not positive it was raw. Wee Bee has a thick layer of propolis, wax, and pollen on top and after mixing it in the first time it becomes easier. I have saved the little bit left for wound healing because it's so difficult to find anything as good as this! The propolis from this honey works better for me than Manuka!

review/text: This was my first "raw honey" experience, so i can't really compare it to other honeys, except for the processed store-brand stuff. Wee Bee Raw Honey is much sweeter and tastier than processed honey. It also is semi-solid; its consistency is similar to cold butter. On the top layer of the honey, you'll find these specks of, what I believe are, honeycomb, propolis, bee pollen. It tastes much better than what it smells like.

review/summary: Better than YS
review/text: I'm a honey addict and I purchase as many organic RAW honeys as I can. They're a staple of my diet and have helped me maintain my weight and never gain a pound. The very first organic raw honey I ever tried was by YS organics and I was unimpressed. I stopped buying from them when I found better options (also, I was pretty mad when I found out I unknowingly ordered the non-organic YS honey jars -- I didn't realize there was a difference.) YS honey is cheap, and you get a lot more of it for your buck, and I would probably still buy it if I didn't do research on metal lids and plastisol food liners (plastisol contains PVC; it's bad for you.) I now try to find glass jars with safe plastic lids, and this one fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />This just arrived at my door via a Vitacost purchase. I immediately tore through all the bubble-wrap and opened the jar to find a lovely 'capping' or 'crust' as some call it. I dug into the crust and tried it, was reminded of honey comb chewy-ness and then proceeded to dig in further to try the very smooth and firm raw honey beneath the crust. It tastes like an improved version of YS honey. While very similar, the texture is better and so is the flavor. I found YS to be cloyingly sweet, and this one is slightly toned down.<br /><br />I would recommend this over YS. If you are on a budget then buying the big glass jar of ORGANIC YS is the smarter option. I do not like YS lids, so I will not be buying any YS honey during hot months.<br /><br />Lighter honeys are not my favorite. I prefer a dark honey for the flavor and UMF benefits, but dark honeys come from far across the world and you can never be too sure what happened to it between harvesting and packing. I really appreciate knowing where this honey has been. I don't have to worry about it being thrown into an aluminum barrel and shipped off to a packing company where it would be heated before it could be put into jars.<br /><br />This is a great honey, and you should definitely try it.<br /><br />I'm sorry if the pictures I posted are blurry. I have shaky hands that are bad for taking pictures with!

review/summary: THE best honey
review/text: This honey is truly raw! I've purchased honey from farmer's markets, but even they heat it to filter out "impurities." However, Wee Bee Honey has a layer of wax, pollen, propolis, all the good stuff that has naturally settled on top of the honey!<br /><br />Also, the texture is delightful! Very creamy and not too crystallized.<br /><br />I love this stuff!! After eating this honey, I don't really want to eat other honeys!!

review/summary: Interesting crust--very sweet & light underneath
review/text: I got mine at a local co-op for about half this price.  The "crust" of pollen, propolis, and beeswax is interesting stuff--kind of funky.  I like it, though it has a teeny whiff of the barnyard to it.  As for the honey underneath, I agree with the reviewer who found it too sugary and not flavorful enough.  (Still beats the jars off of ordinary, generic, ultra-filtered, super-heated, "dead" grocery store honey.)  Though I enjoy eating this by the spoonful and will go through it quickly--I prefer the stuff I can get from local beekeepers; it's more flavorful (even the lighter, milder varieties) and a lot cheaper, too.

review/summary: Too Much Like Wax
review/text: The Honey is more like wax which may be the way all natural honey is I never tried it before. If you use it in a hot cup of tea it is quite nasty as the wax is just everywhere and you can taste it and see it floating.<br />I understand it is raw honey but for practical purposes I would not tell anyone to buy it. If you just take a small amount to eat it off a spoon it does taste different than other honey but again, the waxy stuff sticks to your teeth and that is the general opinion from the rest of my family.

review/text: I was not thrilled with this product. It's got a weird texture, very spongy, and a strange taste, bland yet odd. I'd imagined thick slabs browned in a pan with maple syrup, but it was too gross for me to want to eat a big piece. I diced it instead and added it to fried rice ... still gross. The rest went in the garbage. There are A LOT of better fake meat products out there - or you can just make your own. A homemade seitan log is much tastier!

Over the last 3 or 4 years, he has slowed down and can't seem to get up as quickly as he used to or bound up the stairs after me.<br /><br />Based on a friend's recommendation, I started feeding Happy Hips to Blue -- about 6 a day -- he gobbles them up and seems to have a lift back in his steps.  I can tell when I have forgotten to give them to him.<br /><br />This is a great way to help out your aging 4-legged best friend.

I have two large dogs, one who is very finisky about what he'll take as a treat and two very large neighborhood dogs that come over at night to get a "treat".  The strips are approximately 6" x 3/4 of an inch and are relatively easy to cut/tear in half if neeeded. The bag is large enough for two or three a day each withhout me having to stock up.  Although a whole bag between two dogs, all at once, is not good.  I don't know if it helps the hips at all on the monsters, but it certainly gets the tails going!

review/summary: Great company, good food... but could be better
review/text: First off, I have very little doubt that Newman's Own wet cat food is an excellent and healthy choice to feed one's cat.  Feeding a cat a quality food, even if expensive compared to other catfoods, is worthwhile and if it prevents one health problem might even pay for itself.  For those reasons, and because I support Newman's ideals in general, my cat has had the pleasure of enjoying many cans of Newman's food.<br /><br />However, in comparison to other cat foods in this price range, my cat does have a couple of complaints.  I should mention that my cat LOVES to eat, it is his primary motivation in life.  Need him to take a pill?  Just coat it in wet food and drop it in his dish.  But, because he likes to eat so much, he must also have controlled portions - 1/3 can, twice a day.  And that leads to his first complaint.  Open a can of Newman's, and there is a lot of empty space, around the food and even large open cracks in the food.  There certainly isn't the volume of solid food in a 5.5 oz can of Newman's compared to the competition.  The second complaint: Newman seems to love his brown rice, which is ok, but he keeps the grains big and whole.  My cat loves food, and cleans his dish every time... but he usually eats right around those big grains of rice.<br /><br />Basically, my cat isn't getting as much food from a can of Newman's as from his favorite brands (Nature's Logic and Innova EVO), so we'll be cutting Newman out of the rotation.

review/summary: Mazie, like Life's Mikey, is very, very particular
review/text: Mazie, my incredibly persnickety feline companion, is mad about Newman's Own canned cat food. Although I'm living on a necessarily frugal income, I know that buying Newman's Own products for both my cat and dog makes good sense in every way. I recently lost two other beloved pets to old age and disease and believe now that a better diet would have saved them a lot of physical pain and me a great deal of emotional turmoil and sadness. As my own diet becomes more organic and I reap the health benefits, I know Paul Newman and his daughter are on the right track for pets as well. I'll gladly skimp on less important things to know that my four-legged kids are eating right and animals around the world are being saved by the Newmans. It's truly a win-win situation.

review/summary: Marvelous improvements in only 3 weeks!  Great cat food!
review/text: I want to share some amazing, and important, changes since switching to Newman's Own canned cat food.<br /><br />I decided to switch my 2 indoor adult kitties from the convenient (for me) "dry-food-always-available" to (I first thought) a raw meat diet, and chose Newman's Own canned food for the transition.  I'm so happy with this, and so are the boyz, that I'm staying with it.<br /><br />The first 2 days they whined and nagged for their old dry food.  I crumbled a few bits of dry into the canned for a couple of meals and that did the trick. If you're transition from dry to canned, don't be discouraged if they don't go for it immediately! Now they're settled into a 3 times daily 1/4 can, which I may try to transition into 2 feedings.  I found the chicken and turkey versions at WalMart for $1.36/can, it's the only place in my town to get it, so will look at ordering online.<br /><br />Here are the immediate benefits:<br />1) My older kitty, Skidmore, used to have chronic hairball and constipation problems.  The younger cat, Dewey, is more dominant, and seems to make Skidmore groom him, so Skidmore spent about half his life not being able to eat or keep it down, then yarks up a hairball, then eats so voraciously that he barfed that, so I had to constantly monitor what he was doing and take food away for part of the day after he had just a little.  He was miserable. Since I had to remove ALL the food, they both would be upset and constantly after me.  However, since starting the Newman's Own canned food, Skidmore only barfed once the 2nd day, and since then I see no evidence of hairballs!  He eats and keeps down the 1/4 can portions with no vomiting!  They both leave for half an hour or so and come back to finish each meal, but it isn't sitting in their dishes very long.<br />2)  Dewey (sorry if this is gross) always came running at the sound of wretching so he would get an extra warm meal.  So he became somewhat overweight, with a fat pad around the tail.  I see he had no interest in scarfing up the canned food, the one time Skidmore barfed it up.<br />3)  I noticed the fat pad around Dewey's tail is gone!  But since rapid weight loss puts cats at risk for fatty liver or pancreatitis, I started feeding him a little bigger portion to slow that down.  Basically now, both of them now let me know when they need to eat, and I try to accommodate that since I'm home much of the day.  It's worked into a 3x/day pattern mostly.<br />4)  LITTERBOX!  Poop quantity has decreased dramatically, because they're absorbing the nutrients and not passing all the fillers and animal by-products.  Skidmore is no longer constipated, no more straining to go.  Dewey used to have the most rank-smelling stools, and now there's basically NO ODOR!  Also, Dewey used to have what I called "dead-rat-breath" but that's gone now, too.  I had even taken him to the vet a couple years ago to see if there was some stomach problem, but there was none.  It was just the crappy food.  So there's an example of how I COULD have saved a vet bill with higher quality food.  (They did suggest (and sell me) the Science Diet stuff but it made no difference.)<br />5)  My biggest joy is knowing Skidmore is getting the nutrition he needs, and seeing him relaxed and playful all the time, not just in the periods between hairballs.<br /><br />This stuff is definitely worth the price, and I thank the Newman's for their commitment to quality nutrition for all of us!

review/summary: Picky cat with stomach problems, problems solved
review/text: My cat gets an upset stomach on almost everything. When she wasn't keeping down her most recent food at all, not eating because she couldn't keep it down, and we didn't have money for another visit to the vet just to have them put her on prescription diet, I called to see what they gave them to treat the problem, and Hills was recommended. But after researching Hill's on the internet, I found almost no difference between Hills prescription diet and other cheap cat foods, so the search began...<br /><br />About 7 hours later from searching all sorts of brands and reviews and information on the internet, I still had exactly no idea what to get, so I wandered into the local grocery store. After looking at all of the ingredients on the bags and cans, (and finding out from a woman nearby that man dogs and cats get very sick from red food dye in the different foods- good thing to know), I settled on Newman's Organics even though it ranked among the most expensive per can. Why? Whole foods, no fillers, organic product...<br /><br />Got the food home, had prayed about this, literally, because I was very worried about my cat. As soon as I opened the can, and put it in the dish, she tested it out by licking it at first, and then, much to my delight, ate for the first time in days. Amen. I was so glad. Now lol we open up a can, and wow, lol she seems to say, hurry up already, put it in my dish! LoL.. we combine the Newman's own with Purina One dry food alternating the wet and dry every other feeding, but she has felt better. She has boundless energy. Her coat in just a week, has gotten very soft and sleek, not greasy, but wonderfully nourished. She is acting like a kitten again. And I know her new foods don't have the fillers (or the red food dye) like the old ones did. She wouldn't even touch friskies, regardless the flavor, it made her sick, (lol exuse the pun) as a dog.<br /><br />I really feel like I am feeding my cat quality product with newman's and my cat feels so much better. I don't know that she has puked once with this stuff. And she loves it. I got mine at Wegman's grocery. If you have a local store that sells it, you may want to buy just one or two cans to start to try. But I know, my little one is hooked on these now. And I love feeding them to her, lol, it makes her day each time the can comes out of the fridge. So that makes my day :-)

I also bought another variety in the same 5-lb bag size. I've already roasted about a pound of each and am very happy with the results. The green beans seem very fresh and the proof was in the coffee I brewed.

review/summary: Watery and flavorless
review/text: We bought these beans hoping to find a successor to the Brazilian Santos green beans we formerly purchased from the defunct Zach & Dani's. These beans are a far cry from what we expected. While roasting, the aroma seemed fine and the finished beans smelled pretty similar, although it was clear from the excessive husks produced that, in fact, they roasted very differently. However much these beans differed from Zach & Dani's Brazilian Santos in roasting pales to how they differ when brewed: the brew is irredeemably watery, the flavor virtually non existent--even the aroma is weak.  We suggest re-labeling these beans "Brazilian Postum."

review/summary: OVERPRICED HORSE BEDDING.
review/text: This is the same exact thing as horse bedding/wood pellets. From a feed shop, you can get a 30-40 lb bag of wood pellets, aka "Feline Pine," for 7 dollars. What is Feline Pine charging you?<br /><br />UPDATE 10/11/2012: This wood pellets have worked very well for my cat but now, like other reviewers are facing, my cat won't go number 2 in here, although he is still using it to urinate, but I think he's urinating less frequently too now. I'm definitely worried. I think the hardness of the pellets are whats causing him to not use his litter box as much, although he has still never gone outside of his box either. Luckily, he is an indoor/outdoor cat, I let him out for 4-5 hours late in the morning and I've seen him use the bathroom outside almost every morning, so at least he's not holding it in. Going outside is also whats contributing to his reduced use of the litter box, but even on days he doesn't go out, I don't find much in the litter box. Either ways, this problem needs to be addressed now. While googling, I came across how gardeners are having a difficult time keeping cats out of their mulched garden beds and that sparked an idea...I think mulch would make a fabulous substitute for these wood pellets. I will use the mulch the same way I use the wood pellets - litter box, johnny cat liner, 5" deep layer of mulch and update. Either ways mulch is as dirt cheap as wood pellets, the only thing is it might hold the smell of urine a little more than the pellets so I'm probably looking at replacing the litter more frequently. Still, at the insignificant price of a ginormous bag of mulch, this is not an issue.

review/summary: Use it right & this stuff rocks!
review/text: Feline Pine Original (disintegrating pellets) is best used with a sifting sandbox (2 piece [...] The VanNess brand seems to have holes too big which let Feline Pine pellets through.  It may be designed for sifting out poops).  The bottom piece is a standard litter pan.  The top piece has a sort of grate-like bottom which allows the used/disintegrated sawdust to filter through into the solid bottom box, where it collects away from the fresh litter and kitty's paws.  When liquid does go straight through, it is absorbed by the sawdust underneath and can be scooped out to further eliminate odor (I use a plastic spoon).  After a bit of maintenance tedium through the change from another style of litter, my cat is happy & healthy, there is no litter-box odor, and we have nothing to do with the strip-mining & landfilling of traditional clay litter.  [no new trees were destroyed to make this product]

review/summary: Great litter!
review/text: I have two cats that use a big litter box. I've tried them all, the clumping, the pretty smelling, the corn, the crystals and the newspaper and this one is the best for this main reason. IT DOESN"T TRACK ALL OVER THE HOUSE. I was using regular litter and it was fine until one morning I woke up and there was pile of litter by my head that had fallen out of my cats paws when he jumped up. Gross! I like feline pine because of the odor control and because it doesn't get stuck in your cat's paws and end up on your furniture.

review/summary: Works for me combined with a clumping litter
review/text: After much trial-and-error with natural litters, I found that Feline Pine doesn't work at all for my cats by itself. However, I've been using it in combination with a natural clumping litter for a couple of months now and it has been satisfactory, though I'm not really sure if the Feline Pine is much of an improvement over the clumping litter alone.<br /><br />When my experiment with World's Best Cat Litter utterly failed on all counts (hated the smell, clumping was terrible, cats didn't like it) I moved on to Nature's Miracle clumping corn-based litter - but it tracked everywhere in the house. Since the cats adapted well to a complete changeover from WBCL to NM without problems, I started a brand new box with Feline Pine alone. That was a mistake. My cats were utterly confused by the texture, resulting in one refusing to use the box entirely. The other cat went in the box, but didn't cover her mess. So I dumped the box and started again - with 1" of Feline Pine on the bottom and 2" of Nature's Miracle on the top (as the Feline Pine bag suggests). The cats gradually mix it up as they dig, and what doesn't get clumped up in the Nature's Miracle gets absorbed by the Feline Pine so it seems to be a good combination for odor control, though my husband says he can smell it. I end up scooping 1x to 2x a day and top off the box with the Nature's Miracle so there's always a good 2"-3" of litter at all times. After two weeks - which is about when all of the Feline Pine pellets have dissolved into sawdust - I dump the box, scrub and sanitize it, and start over.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm not sure that the odor control or tracking is any better with the combination of the two litters than with Nature's Miracle alone. But I'm sticking with it for now, since the Feline Pine does seem to help extend the litter, and since I don't use it exclusively, one bag lasts a long time!<br /><br />** UPDATE - after I finished the first bag of Feline Pine I didn't bother buying another one. If anything, I think mixing this with the Natures Miracle just undermined the clumping of the latter. So no more Feline Pine for me. I wish it had worked for us, but it didn't. Nature's Miracle is the winner so far of natural litters, though I hope one day some genius comes up with a better one!

review/text: I've been using this litter for years.  The cat and I agree that this is the best litter - hands down.  My cat is quite picky and simply will not use many brands of litter until there is no option.  This litter was one he immediately approved of.  I like it because it doesn't track and because it disintegrates which for me is a big plus.  Two paws up for this.

review/summary: Didn't work for my cat
review/text: I'm extremely frustrated right now. We adopted a cat 3 weeks ago & her previous owner gave us her litter box with clay litter. After doing much research, I decided to give Feline Pine a try because it's natural. I even tried doing it gradually with her old litter as the instructions suggested, but it did not work for our cat. She wouldn't use it to poop and just didn't poop one whole night. As soon as we brought out her old litter, she used it right way. And this morning, she also tried to eat the pine pellets and then vomited! Not good. This is a great idea & I'm very disappointed that it did not work for our cat as I was very excited about this product.

On the plus side, it doesn't smell at all like ammonia, which is a giant relief to me, especially since the little is in our bedroom.<br /><br />Shipping was a mess because the first one said delivered but never arrived.

review/summary: Awesome litter--Easy to Use!!
review/text: I just got through reviewing another brand of litter (Arm & Hammer Essentials) that I used when I ran out of Feline Pine and it was awful.  Trust me, I'm stocking up on Feline Pine because it's in another league.  First, it's not scented or perfumed in any way.  It has a slight cedary smell that is pleasant and your cat likes and is drawn to.  Second, it has large "pellets" that disintegrate when your cat pees so you can tell if they are using the box (that's important if you are concerned with urinary issues and want something natural.)  Also, if your cat has recently had surgery and you are concerned about litter getting into the stitches and impeding the healing process, try this Feline Pine or Wheat Scoop, both are natural and easy to use and will not hurt your cat.  Finally, with this litter you don't have to worry about your cat breathing in harmful dust particles that cause respiratory issues and allergies.  It is expensive litter, don't get me wrong--but I have learned over time that it's worth the cost because it is safe, easy to clean up, and your cat likes using the litter box more with Feline Pine so there tends to be less bathroom "problems".  This is not powdery and won't coat every surface with dust.  It is "chunky" and pellet-like, won't get in your animal's eyes and cause irritation, and does seem to absorb odors effectively.

review/summary: Good Idea.
review/text: This product is a good idea but unfortunately it did not work out well for myself or my cats. I take in feral kittens and I love our planet so I was trying to do a 2 for 1 with this litter. Figured these cats would like to do their business on something more 'Earthy' since that is what they would be used to. Wrong. They used it once. It smelled and they never used it again. Pellets cannot be 'reused' like carbon litter can. Once these get pee'd on its all over, seems like it would get expensive and smell after a while.<br />I really, really wanted to like this, I really wanted to use it but I just could not. I give it 3 stars cuz it least it is a good idea and if I run out of litter I will use whats left in my closet.

review/text: This is by far the best cat litter!  My 18 week old cat loves it.  I originally selected this litter because it was non-clumping.  Sheba is learning to use the Litter Kwitter toilet training system which requires non-clumping litter.  She will not kick this litter out of the toilet tray and there is absolutely no smell associated with the pellets.  It's great!  I highly suggest it to anyone using the toilet training systems as well.

review/summary: Best Cat Litter!
review/text: I have two cats, so I really needed a litter that would control odor, and I wanted something safe for my kitties and the environment. Feline Pine is the BEST litter I could find by far. Even if you are not interested in being environmentally friendly, this is a great litter.<br /><br />It took a little while for one of my cats to get used to it. At first I switched them completely over and one of my kitties started going outside the box. I went back to the old litter and started gradually mixing the pellets in for about two weeks. Now both my cats use only the Feline Pine without any problems. It completely masks the smell of urine, and is pretty good at masking the smell of poop. It lasts awhile too since you really only have to scoop the solid waste until the pellets turn to sawdust.<br /><br />I had previously tried Nature's Miracle and World's Best Cat Litter.  Neither of them dealt well with odor. Nature's miracle clumped nicely, but it smelled soo bad! It stunk up our whole house. The WBCL had a slightly less offensive smell, but the clumping capabilities were not as good as NM. Feline Pine doesn't clump, but it doesn't need to since you don't scoop out the urine. With some litters, like WBCL, urine seeps to the bottom of the pan and creates a sticky, smelly residue; but, with Feline Pine the urine doesn't even get to the bottom of the pan since it is absorbed immediately by the pellets.<br /><br />It's just a really great litter, and it's not as expensive as a lot of other natural brands.

review/summary: Not Great Litter, Not Great for Multi Cat Households
review/text: I tried this awhile back, and noticed other folks reviews.<br /><br />The cats don't like it (I have 3, ranging in age from 7 to 17).  At the time, I had 2 to 3 litter boxes.  The cats don't like to scratch pellets.  The litter box STOPPED BEING USED.  It seems kitties still like to scratch, dig and cover what feels natural - which is dirt.<br /><br />I had to finally mix clay with the Pine.  While the Pine did mask odors somewhat (helps if you use more than one litter box in multi-cat households) - scooping pee was impossible (since there is no real clumping action - the pellets stay as pellets).  And with the lack of digging by cats - the poop went straight into the scooping bag.<br /><br />I myself can't carry over 20 some pounds, so I highly recommend clay unscented litter - if ordering from Amazon - consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VNKNXW">Ever Clean Extra Strength Cat Litter, Unscented, 42 Pound Box</a>.  If you scoop daily (or at the very least - every other day), your house won't smell, and the cat litter will last longer.<br /><br />Unscented is best for cats (since the scented particles can be licked by cats off their fur - and the chemicals are so so).  And, while many cat owners use covered litter boxes (I USED to), its more convenient for the owners than the cats.  Cats end up not using the boxes from the smell on the lids, and they also end up spraying pee back on themselves.  So my house doesn't smell like cats (as noted by visitors), even though I have open cat litter boxes.

review/summary: Useless
review/text: Picked up a bag of this on recommendation from the lady at our neighborhood pet store.<br /><br />This litter consists of large sawdust pellets that are too big to fall through the scooper, and as soon as they get wet, they disintegrate into damp sawdust that smells rather piny and neutral, but is impossible to scoop because it doesn't clump whatsoever. This is the opposite of how I want my litter to act. The dirty stuff falls through the scoop, while the clean stuff gets stuck in it?<br /><br />I don't think my cats like the damp sawdust either. They ended up peeing on their bed even though this litter was "clean".<br /><br />I'll be going back to my nice-smelling corn-based litter that actually acts like proper litter.

review/text: I will admit that it masks urine odors very well and that's nice, but the litter itself smells so strongly that we've only been able to live with it for one day. We keep our litterbox in the bathroom, and in such a small room, the smell is too much to bear. It's like hot gravel mixed with wood chips mixed with cat poop because it doesn't mask that smell.<br /><br />In addition, the pellets break down very quickly. When I checked this morning, part of the top layer of the litterbox in the very front was a fine powder. We bought this in hopes it would be low tracking - but I'm already seeing the shredded pellets around and about.

review/summary: You love cinnamon?
review/text: Then you'll love these Ice Breakers. A strong but not too strong cinnamon taste in combination with a hint of fresh mint. In addition no sugar so that you can simply enjoy them. I love them :-)

review/summary: Angel Hair rice pasta- wonderful!
review/text: I agree with the reviewer of the rice spaghetti and I like the linguine too. This pasta is wonderful. Great taste and texture not soggy or gummy. I was pleasantly surprised since I have tried several other rice pastas. I don't miss gluten at all when I eat this pasta.<br /><br />I just wish it had free shipping (and certainly not twice the product's price for shipping!) or could be bought with the 'subscribe and save' option. I have to find it in certain stores that I can't get to very often.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I have tried several pumkin flavored coffees, & found none that could come close to Green Mountain's fall seasonal offering of "Pumkin Spice".<br />However, I find this one equally as good.  I will always buy this one since to me, there is little difference in flavor, if any that I can detect, (not to mention it is about one half the price).  Thanks Amazon for offering this.  I absolutely love this coffee.

review/summary: Mmm...mmm.....good!
review/text: I agree with the reviewer who compared it to Green Mountain's version.  It's not exactly the same, but it's pretty darn close.  And for the price, you can't beat it.

review/summary: perfectly pumpkin
review/text: Overall, I think this pumpkin coffee is excellent. I've only tried this one and Green Mountain pumpkin spice. Timothy's feels a lot smoother. Green Mountain's version tastes like someone was cleaning out their spice rack and dumped it into the coffee. I will definitely buy the Timothy's pumpkin again (and again).

review/summary: Not worth it...
review/text: I bought this item after reading a previous reviewer who claimed this product was a good as Green Mountain Coffee's seasonal pumpkin spice blend.  This version was terrible!  It did not taste anywhere near my favorite from Green Mountain.  It was so disappointing.  And it was one of the weakest, most watery tasting coffees I've had yet in a k-cup.  I would not recommend this product at all.  You are better off finding a different flavor, and waiting for the next offering of pumpkin spice from Green Mountain.

review/summary: Not one of Timothy's Best
review/text: I found this to be one of Timothy's least flavorful coffees.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the pumpkin flavor was slight.  I also found that it had a 'watered-down' coffee flavor...and I did make it in the 'small' cup option.<br /><br />German Chocolate Cake is my favorite so far and Winter Carnival is a close second.
