review/summary: Excellent choice for my finicky feline!
review/text: Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her. I've been ordering on Amazon since it's been difficult to find it in my local pet stores lately.

review/summary: Cats are obligate carnivores
review/text: Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go.

review/summary: Great cat food
review/text: After my cat was diagnosed with renal failure, he refused to eat any of the canned versions of his vet prescribed food for kidney disease although he would eat Hill's Science Diet k/d dry food, but he was vomiting it up regularily. Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot's Stew. My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken, turkey and salmon varieties. Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots, peas and green beans, but he does eat them. I really like that Spot's Stew is an all natural cat food with no by-products or fillers, and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys.

review/summary: Dog Food Masquerading as Cat Food
review/text: My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally "stew," with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer.

review/summary: Cats review
review/text: I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed.

review/summary: My cat loves Spot's Stew, and I know it's good for him.
review/text: I've seen other reviewers say their cats wouldn't eat the vegetables in Spot's Stew. Before deciding for or against this product, try just a couple of flavors from Petco or Petsmart first. My cat goes ga-ga for all of this product, including the vegetables. Every cat's different. I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh! I wouldn't ever want my furry loved one to eat skin - that's like feeding a human infant McDonald's, no offense to McD's.

review/summary: Wow! Cat Food That Seems Yummy!
review/text: Wow! I have the pickiest cats in the whole universe.  The only wet food they eat is Spot's Stew Chicken.  I can get them to eat the Chicken/Beef flavor if I add some shaved Bonito but with three cats Slinky, Jester and Regal, only Slinky and Jester scarf the food down.  They will eat the chicken without the Bonito but Regal is another story.  She won't eat it at first but might come back later and eat some.  She will ONLY eat the Chicken and does not like Bonito so with her, it gets a little more tough.  However, this food is a wonderful consistency, smells good (to me the human) and I assume to the kitties as well because they LOVE this stuff.  For the vegetables, I don't know if cats really need them however, I mush them up with the meat and they don't notice.  If I miss mushing some, then yes they try to eat around the peas/carrots.  All I can say is thank goodness for this food.  I spent lots of money and time trying to find something they would like.  I also feed them a mix of Halo dry Sensitive Formula Turkey and Purina Dental Health.  In order to prevent urinary symptoms, I give my cats only fresh bottled water every day that I put in bowls all over the house.  With the good water, the good food and lots of petting, I have the happiest cats in Arizona!  Thank you Halo!!

review/summary: Chicken and Beef
review/text: I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe. Whenever I put it out at feeding time, there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot's Stew in them. With 5 kitty mouths to feed, the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot's Stew, so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied. Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting, those poor things that had to "settle" for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew. I have been so pleased with it, that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners.<br />But, at our house, WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines!

review/summary: Picky felines love this canned food
review/text: My two cats somehow never figured out how to use their teeth to bite into their food--given dry food, they'll just use their tongues to lick it up and swallow the kernels whole, with an occasional bite with the teeth to crunch on food that's already been delivered into their mouths.  For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.  Anyways, thank goodness for Spot's Stew, otherwise my teeth-challenged cats would never have been able to enjoy wet food!

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.

The other one though continued to chow down, and again left the veges, but came back later and ate most of them.  The next serving -what do you know -neither of them wanted it anymore.  I don't get it -I've never had cats like something so much one day and the next day be turned off from it.  I'm very disappointed, I wanted them to like it, knowing how good it is for them.

The experation date was a month out (which means the product was quite old because cracker jacks have a long shelf life). The product inside the boxes was so hard and stuck together - wach box had a hard rectangular mass of carmel corn.<br /><br />I did send an email when it was late and the apologized for the late delivery.<br /><br />Terrible order experience overall.

review/summary: Is this syrup made with formaldehyde presently?
review/text: I'm preparing for my 3rd Master Cleanse and well found this 'interesting'...I don't think the present Maple Valley Syrup, the one recommended in Burrough's book, is formaldehyde-free any longer. Please see recent email (below) that I sent to Maple Valley after I received my purchase directly from them. NO WHERE was I able to find that it's formaldehyde-free. The website uses Burrough's 1976 quote (or was it 1940?)from his book but I couldn't find any other mention of the syrup being made without formaldehyde stated anywhere else. Organic - yes but nothing else.<br /><br />Email sent to Maple Valley:<br />Hello - I'm curious- Why do you not clearly state (and LOUDLY claim) on your receipt, on your bottle, in your brochure or on your website that you do not use formaldehyde. You quote Stanley Burrough's statement in his book of why he recommends your specific product:<br /><br />"From page 17 of The Master Cleanser by Stanley Burroughs:<br />"... maple syrup is a balanced form of positive and negative sugar and must be used, not some 'substitute... The maple syrup has a large variety of minerals and vitamins. Naturally the mineral and vitamin content will vary according to the area where the trees grow and the mineral content in the soil. These are the minerals found in average samples of syrup from Vermont: Sodium; Potassium; Calcium; Magnesium; Manganese; Iron; Copper; Chlorine and Silicon.

review/summary: Hands down best popcorn you can get outside of a theater
review/text: I often wonder if I am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn.  Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy.  Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet.  Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.<br /><br />Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi-plex (though I really like target popcorn too).  You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers.<br /><br />Each pack contains 5 pouches of product. Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty). For those that like additional butter, you can add it after popping.  While I cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded, it does do a good job of filling up my 32-cup Tupperware Thatsa bowl.  Thatsalotta popcorn.<br /><br />The unit cost is $1.66 per pouch, which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn, but you just cannot compare the quality and taste (and when compared to theater popcorn, it is a fraction of the cost). Orville Redenbacher has nothing on Wabash!

review/summary: Mmmmmmm,  popcorn!
review/text: Great popcorn!  I'm a repeat buyer too.  One pack makes just a teeny bit more than my Whirly Pop can hold with the lid closed.  The kernels pop big and have a great flavor.  The hulls are farely tame for big kernels. My only suggestion for Wabash Valley Farms would be to boost the butter flavor just a smidge.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but popcorn popped on the stove top is so much better than microwaved.

review/summary: This is as close to movie theater (or disneyland) popcorn as you can make at home!
review/text: I have ordered this product twice.  The box contains 5 packets inside, and each packet contains the liquid oil, the flavored salt, and the popcorn kernels.  Easy to make and surprisingly good, far better than any microwave popcorn and I have tried many brands.  You can make this in a large cooking pot with a lid.  They suggest you use something called a "Whirly Pop Popper" but its not necessary to buy that.  I have a gas stove, so so I set the heat to medium, pour in just the the oil first, let it heat a few minutes, then I drop in the salt and kernels.  Cover and gently shake a few times during popping and enjoy.  My family agrees this is the real deal.

It is light, crunchy and well delicious! I tested the brands with family and friends and we are all in agreement. I would like to note that some bags appear to be more salty than others, but I know I can always leave out some of the powder that is part of the kit.

review/summary: A tasty and soothing tea to share with friends
review/text: I am ordering this tea from Amazon for the third time. I previously ordered in 2009 and, again, in 2010. In both of those cases, the product came in a package of different design that contained 25 bags per box. I paid $21 in 2009 and $25 in 2010 (for six packages, in each case); thus, the price has not changed significantly in the past few years.<br /><br />Two days ago I found a lonely box of this tea hidden in the back of my cupboard, and, while it bears an "enjoy by" date of May 2011, it is still tasty as of this writing in February of 2012.<br /><br />I agree with the other two reviewers: this is a nice tea (and one can also enjoy it as an iced tea). It has a wonderful flavor, and seems to have a soothing effect on my aching knees... so much so, that, after feeling the positive effects of this tea for the first time, and believing that that "healing" effect might be a result of the eleuthero, the second-listed ingredient, I actually bought eleuthero capsules to use as a daily supplement. As they did not seem to be as effective in easing the pain in my knees, I am reordering the tea and skipping the supplements.<br /><br />According to Good Earth's own blurb from my previous purchases, this tea contains no caffeine... how they manage that with green tea, I am not sure. I am also not sure why they feel the need to add natural flavors (containing soy lecithin) as the third ingredient.<br /><br />Besides the benefit of what I believe to be this tea's "healing properties", it is just a wonderful tea to enjoy with friends after dinner.<br /><br />The old container was made from 100% recycled materials. I'll give an update on the new container.

review/summary: the bad and the great
review/text: First, 2 of the cans in the order were dented.  Amazon was very good about shipping out a replacement, and one of those cans were dented as well. There was absolutely no damage on the amazon boxes, I can only assume that the damage was pre-shipment.  However, with Amazon's great customer service, it just takes a little more effort to get a complete order of undamaged cans.<br />Second, there is added sugar in the ingredients. If I had known this before ordering, I would not have ordered this brand.<br />Third, they are absolutely delicious.  They beat out the taste of canned flame roasted red peppers hands down.  These peppers are small and packed full in the cans.  This can contains more peppers than a 24 oz can of normal red peppers (flavor wise, this can may have more flavor than a #10 restaurant can of normal flame roasted red peppers)<br />Ordering through Amazon, this is less than half the price of buying in the specialty shops, not even including the cost of gas. I thought I would be using them for 1 special occasion dinner but after trying them, I'm sure we will be using them on a regular basis.

Adding as much as $1.24 to the total cost of a case.<br /><br />Now the Petsmart case costs $13.96. Since we've agreed that the Amazon case purchased via Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" costs $14.02... That means there is only a SIX CENT DIFFERENCE PER CASE between Amazon's price and California Petsmart and Walmart prices.<br /><br />Plus, you also have to PAY FOR GAS if you go to Petsmart or Walmart. Plus, the extra travel time to and fro. Plus, you have to drag all that cat food to your car from the store and then drag it from your car to your house.<br /><br />MY Amazon Fancy Feast is DELIVERED TO MY FRONT DOOR BY A UPS DELIVERY PERSON.<br /><br />I'll gladly pay a EXTRA SIX CENTS for DELIVERY TO MY DOOR.<br /><br />If folks follow your thinking-- they'll spend A LOT MORE MONEY for their cat food!<br /><br />Think it through! Fancy Feast is a PERFECTLY FINE DEAL HERE!

review/summary: The only food my aging cat will eat
review/text: My 16 year old cat had been on dry food since I adopted her from the shelter 13 years ago. A couple of years or so ago she became very finicky and refused her regular brand. I then switched her to an 'all natuaral' version by the same maker. She did fine on that for awhile then out of the blue she'd have nothing more to do with it. I decided to give wet food a go. As she's becoming more&more picky in her golden years that was a hit&miss ordeal. Seems as fast as I'd  stock up on her favorite variety of a brand she'd decide she didn't want it anymore.  Every other day I'd have to trek out to the store(in the harsh Michigan winter no less)to find something to feed her. I finally decided to pick up a few cans of Fancy Feast at CVS. I had steered clear of FF because of the  high price of those tiny cans. Since I was desperate to get food into kitty I caved. I bought every different variety my local CVS had on the shelf. She didn't want the flaked variety. She wouldn't touch the shredded meals. She loved the food in the gravy,actually she only loved the gravy. Finally I opened up a can of the Salmon and prayed for the best. To my relief she inhaled every bit of it and meowed for more. I moved on to the Cod,Shrimp,&Salmon and got the same positive response. She flipped over the Ocean Whitefish flavor.<br />Hallelulah! I'd hit paydirt!!<br />I don't have a car at present and the trips to the store in a quest to find these 3 flavors of Fancy Feast got tiresome. I decided to use Amazon's Subscribe&Save option. What a life saver that is. I placed the order and received kitty's food in a couple a days. The next month I got an email saying the order was shipping and it arrived a few days later. The service is convienent and the price I pay through Amazon is a few dollars less than I was paying per case at the store,not to mention I didn't have to trek off to the store and haul the food home. It came right to my door without fail.<br />The one problem I ran into is my dear feline friend decided she no longer cares for the Ocean Whitefish or Cod/Shrimp/Salmon flavor. The stray cats outside can't thank her enough for her pickiness lol.<br /> She still loves the Salmon flavor and the Salmon&Shrimp feast. Sadly Amazon doesn't offer the latter on the Subscibe&Save plan so I had to cancel my order here and order through Petco. Petco costs a little more but as we cat owners know we have to do what the 'boss' tells us to do ;)

review/summary: My cat love it (This one has no wheat gluten)
review/text: First thing first, I have noticed this is the only package/favor from Fancy Feast doesn't contain wheat gluten, while other favors have it list as #3 or 4 product on the list. I am not sure whether this is the reason why they only list out what's in the can for this favor but not the others. In case you are wondering what's in other favors, you can go on Fancy Feast website and you will find it on there.<br /><br />I was feeding my car with Natural Balance, she was loving it at the beginning but got tired of the tast pretty fast. Four months into it, she stop eating them, and threw water on it (I am not sure whether she think it was too dry, or just hate it). Now, I feeding her with half a can of Fancy Feast and half natural balance dry food, and  so far she is loving it.

review/summary: Great canned cat food.
review/text: My 2 cats are pretty picky, but they gobbled this stuff up. Both of them have sensitive stomachs, & I haven't seen this up on my couch or carpet yet, haha. It's very easy to mash up or cut up and it's not too stinky. My cats really enjoy the taste as well! Amazon has a great price too. I believe my local Costco has it for a little bit cheaper, but other than that, this is a great canned cat food for a great price on Amazon. Oh, I didn't give it a full 5-star even though I wanted to because I did notice that there is "so & so BY-PRODUCT" in the ingredients. I'm not 100% comfortable giving food like that to my pets so I sadly had to dock of a star.<br /><br />A couple of interesting tips I'de like to give out about cat food is:<br /><br />- Cats are carnivores. They need actual meat. Canned cat food comes closet to that. It's been proven that feeding cats wet food will improve their overall health & personality by a great deal. I have to admit that there has been less vomiting, healthy poops, & much more fun & interactive play time with each other & myself. I give half a cup of dry food with half a can of canned food to each cat everyday. [:<br /><br />- A lot of people have misinterpreted that cats need to graze on food all day. This in fact isn't true at all. Cats are more closely related to their wild cousins; wild cats like lions, cheetahs, cougars, etc, don't eat everyday either because of an unlucky catch or other natural related things. The same theory applies to our domestic feline friends. Feeding cats once a day is plenty for them. Plus it keeps them in shape so they don't over eat!<br /><br />(I read this in an old National Geographic. I'm also a graduate biological anthropologist).

review/summary: Misty LUVS Fancy Feast Gourmet
review/text: Misty is about 1 1/2 years old and came from a large family.  As usual with cats, Misty is very picky.  Since I started her on Fancy Feast Gourmet she would rather go hungry than eat anything else. And sometimes she won't eat her dry food!!!  There was one time when she went a day and a half without eating ANYTHING!!!!  I had put another popular food in her bowl but it just sat there while she meowed at me.  Dumb me!!!  She is my angel as well as my pet.  She woke me up one time when I stopped breathing - she literally crawled all over me.  She isn't beautiful except to me - she has gray fur all over except for one hand-sized white round spot on her tummy. It is worth it to me to give her the best.

review/text: Fancy Feast Gourmet Seafood variety pack<br />My kitties love FF Classics since they came on the market. A few times I tried another style, like flaked or grilled - no change they'd eat them. Also the medley kind are not appreciated.<br />But don't think that they're finicky... Anyway, all my cats grew up on FF Classics and lead a healthy and happy life.<br /><br />Very good price with the 15% discount for Subscribe and Save.<br /><br />Edited 08/17/2011<br />In addition to TaiPan's reviews: One might be interested that in the latest Consumer Report the price of the FF was enclosed. They didn't mention that you can save some bucks by ordering on-line. At Amazon.com Subscribe and Save you pay now $ 0.549 per can. The cheapest mentioned in the August report was $ 0.54 at Walmart. But as pointed out before, there is the sales tax to be added, plus driving to Walmart (mine is 15 miles away from home and not my usual shop), you have to carry the pack to the car and up to the relative floor - who thinks it isn't easier to shop at Amazon ? And hello, YES, my UPS guy smiles...<br />And of course I disagree that not paying sales-tax is illegal! Where does that come from ???

review/summary: help for diabetic cats
review/text: Just found out that my wife's cat has diabetes.<br />Vet prescribed insulin and modified diet.<br />The FF "Classic" varieties - at least every 'classic' I've checked so far, are the closest to a RX diet I can find.<br />More proteins and far less carbs than most animal feed.<br />Similar fat content to other canned foods.<br />Vet has yet to weigh in on this, but she was interested when I gave her a comparison breakdown of RX food vs FF Classic and a couple of other mass-market brands.<br /><br />I wish there was more info available online.<br />Nutrition info, for starters.. I can get that from Mfr,  but I know that formulations change - sometimes 2-3 times in a year.<br />Today's formula may not be what I am grabbing from the shelf, or what is shipped to me.<br />Also, the amount of food -  FYI, these are smaller, 3oz cans  and the recommendation is 3 cans per 10lbs of cat each day.<br />  (I'm more of a dog or other larger animal person.. so 3oz cans are tiny to me.)<br />Looking at it another way, if you have a ~12lb cat, or lighter but active (or pregnant, or &lt; 2 years old), then this 24 pack is one week or less of food.  Buy more, or consider adding treats, dry, or other foods.<br /><br />Debates on price - well, I can get this "on sale" considerably cheaper ( 20% less) than Amazon with frequent local sales, coupons, coupon doubling, etc.<br />Amazon price is comparable to everyday price where I normally food shop, and I shop every week, on the way home from work.<br />I only pay about 3.5% sales tax, so tax & gas aren't a big issue for me.<br />I am a member of Amazon Prime, that makes free 2-day shipping & no tax pretty convenient.<br /><br />Good product, price is good enough,  and Prime makes it convenient.  It fits my current needs with a diabetic cat.<br />Food is gross to me, and I eat nearly any human food, even 'delicacies'.  (Think of this stuff as"pink slime" with color & scent)<br />  If I were rating on appeal we wouldn't have gotten this far.<br />The cat seems to like it.  2nd cat with several teeth missing also likes it - very water-soluble, nearly dissolving without stirring.<br />More info would be the 5th star.<br /><br />.. debates about pricing belong in another forum, or maybe over coffee in your local *mart.

review/summary: Cat loves FF
review/text: My cat is very picky with her food. We used to feed her dry food with an occasional treat of wet food but now we are changing it to dry food in the morning and a can of wet food in the evening. Fancy feast classic is in pate form which my cat prefers. We usually get these in fish or seafood flavor, as she gets her chicken from the dry food. We have tried other brands and textures with my cat, and this is the one that she likes best. The pate is easier to eat for her. She hates the ones which have chunky pieces and will refuse to eat them. The smell of the food is strong too which cats like. This strong smell came in handy for us when we were trying to pill the cat. We crushed the pill(we checked to see that it was safe to do so) and mixed it with ff and she gobbled it up without any hassle. FF is my cat's fav food!!!

review/summary: Our cat loves Fancy Feast
review/text: We have a 11 year old indoor cat who looks forward to her Fancy Feast every afternoon.  She eats dry food, but we give her half a can of Fancy Feast to add some extra calories to her diet.<br /><br />We've tried several other brands of canned cat food, only to have her turn her nose up at them.  For some reason she really likes the Fancy Feast.<br /><br />From my standpoint, all canned cat food is stinky stuff, but I'm writing the review for our cat who thinks it smells great.  She likes the Ocean Whitefish and Tuna variety the best, with the salmon and shrimp varieties both coming in second.<br /><br />I like getting this product on Amazon because I get a 15% discount for signing up for automatic delivery.  Plus the shipping is free.

review/summary: FANCY FEAST @ LESS THAN 1/2 THE PRICE
review/text: I have an old kitty who won't eat anything but Fancy Feast.  Sara, my kitty, is 17 and developed the OLD CAT SYNDROM of not wanting to eat ANYTHING.  I tried every "stinky" (More aroma than the organic cat food) cat food there is, and something was wrong with all of them.  The texture wasn't right, too chunky, she didn't like the taste, just old persnickity cat tricks trying to make me beg her to eat.  Than I discovered Fancy Feast, at $1.00 per 3 OZ CAN!!!  She LOVED it.  It was a pate', the texture was great and she could actually smell it.  I try to get 2 cans a day in the cat, at pet food store prices, that's $60.00 a month.  We have 3 other cats and a big dog, so that option would'n fly.  So I turned to Amazon.com, and behold, there I found Sara's Fancy Feast for less than 50 cents a can with the SUBSCRIBE and SAVE program.  We're all happy now.  The coolest thing that I noticed about how Fancy Feast affected my Sara, is that her coat is lustrous again.  Sara's coat was getting kinda dull and her grey fur had turned brown and coarse, I just thought that this was due to ageing.  She is now mostly grey, and her fur is soft again. Coincidence?  Maybe, but I like her looking good and being excited about eating again.  Not bad for an old kitty.

review/text: The box arrives, perfectly intact. Delicious morsels of mystery meat tightly packed in lovely recyclable cans. With the familiar sound of the pop of the can, followed by the tearing of metal, my four-legged felines come running into the kitchen. The concert begins as their little voices sing for attention and soprano voices harmonize for their first meal of the day. Their eyes light up as I turn around with a bowl in each hand, they soon commence with the ritual to stand up on their hind legs. For this effort, they are presented with just the right sized portion of a tasty treat. The singing has stopped and is replaced by carnivorous groans, tongue smacking and at times an odd purr of happiness. I guess they like it!

review/summary: Cat loves it, I hate the smell
review/text: My one disclaimer is that my cat is not a picky eater with regards to cat food. He does, however, refuse to eat human food with the exception of anything milk-based. With that said, I have fed him all kinds of brands, and I feed him a mix of wet and dry food on a daily basis. Dry food is left out to keep him from starving (he does control his own intake instead of gorging), and a 1/2 can of this product is given a day as a treat, which he loves.<br /><br />The brand recommends you feed 1 can for every 3 pounds of weight (if I remember correctly) which seems ridiculous, but not an issue for me, as they are just used as treats for my cat.<br /><br />My only beef with this (and I guess all cat foods) is that it smells terrible. However, again, my cat seems to like it, so what can I say?

review/text: When I first adopted my indoor cat, he was ill and refused to eat for several days. After using prescription food for initial weight-gain, I started feeding my cat FF on the vet's recommendation. He said it was one of the strongest smelling wet foods available and would probably lure my cat into eating more. It worked! I have been using this brand for the last 5 years as a treat. My cat enjoys 1/2 a can a few times a week along with Iams dry food as a reguar diet. We have not had any weight or health issues since.

Fortunately, this group has its listing of additives and byproducts down the line from the real food, and .... as mentioned before .... they like it. It is hard to get four little individual personalities to agree on anything, but they will eat this. I add it to the Natural Value base as seasoning and they go for it. So far so good.

review/summary: Junk food, but I'm sure it's delicious.
review/text: This is the equivalent of donuts for cats.  I've never met a cat who doesn't like it, but if you look at the ingredients, it is so bad for them.  The carbohydrate level is way above the need of any cats.  Cats don't digest carbohydrates, so technically do not need any in their diet.  And if you look at the "meat" in the food, it's all fillers and by-products.  But the folks at Fancy Feast sure know how to make delicious cat food.  When my cat had her cancer and wasn't eating anything, even she would lick the gravy of Fancy Feast.  So if you can afford it, please only use this as a once-in-awhile junk food.  I mean, you wouldn't eat a dozen of donut every day  would you?  I would only use this food to add in small amounts to healthy, but not as palatable, food so my cats will eat it.

I tried them on the other flavors like turkey and beef but they would usually leave it. I mix a little dry food with these flavors to stretch it out. I also keep plenty of water available because they drink a lot after eating. It must be salty and even though I rated this 4 stars (I like it), the rating is from the cats. I haven't tasted it personally. I was buying this at the grocery store, but since the price in the stores has recently gone up, I'm saving over $12.00/ month on this food using Amazon's subscription service...enough to pay for the 18lb bag of dry food which lasts 2 - 3 months.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B3FIC">Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food, 3-Flavor Seafood Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>

I'm not sure why everyone likes to pretend it's some kind of candy for cats- the ingredient list is far superior to any dry food you can feed them, including your extra carby "holistic" options.  My cats like all three flavors in this package, but I worry about feeding it to them too often with the rising mercury levels in fish.  I end up getting one seafood variety pack for every three cases of the other "Classic" varieties of Fancy Feast.<br /><br />I actually can find this pack for 10.87 locally at my grocery store so I buy it there, but comparing it to pet stores, this is great deal when using the subscribe and save option.<br /><br />I used to pay a bit more for Call of The Wild dry food, a wonderful high protein option for those of us concerned with convenience, but I finally decided my furbabies liquid intake was a bit more important than my desire to free feed.

review/text: My cats like the food but my wallet does not like the continually climbing prices.  For the first year I bought this the price was pretty stable but it is now going up every month or every other month.  Tooooooooo expensive.  :-(

review/summary: Kitty Crack?
review/text: My cats will vote with their feet if I do not provide a dinner-time snack of Fancy Feast.  It is a rich, obviously delicious, cat food with (check the label) good, healthy ingredients.  I feed wet food as a treat twice a day along with kibble.  Cats get their water from the wet food and living in a desert environment, I consider this essential for their well being.

review/text: There is no need to go to supermarket for catfood that often anymore. In fact it's even cheaper than retailers can offer. The only thing I wish - if catfood came in in smaller box, it such a waste of paper.

review/summary: Meow!
review/text: Meow!  Meow,meow, meow!!  MEOW!!  Meow?  MEOW! MEOW! *hiss, hiss* MEOW!!  *Purring*<br />Yes, this is the communication from our cat, Alyssia.  She is so happy to get this food and meows for it.  However, our other cat, Henry, tries to take it away from her and she gets a little angry.  I help her out and she purrs with delight!<br /><br />This is so worth the few extra cents for me.  Free shipping and no sales tax, but no hassles to go shopping.  It's a good deal for me, my family and our cats!

review/summary: Fancy Feast cat food
review/text: I wanted to try Fancy Feast because it is one of the products that have a high % of water in it, which my cat needed for his flaky skin.  And it worked!  He constantly drank water before, now he has cut that down.  Nice variety too.

review/summary: Not A Bargain Here
review/text: In Florida andNew Hampshire (where we live) FF sells for 45 cents a can, $11.98 a case. There is no way I would pay more through Amazon for this. I love and use Amazon all the time, but not for this. Check your supermarket and Petsmart first. I rate the food a 5 but the cost is a 3.

review/summary: Good choice for low carbs
review/text: A friend's research to find a good food for her diabetic cat revealed that the choices specifically in the FF Classic are lower in carbs than most on the market. Her cat's diabetes resolved and she attributed it to the FF Classic.<br />Can't beat the price through this seller and shipping arrangement!

review/summary: my Mocha seems to like this
review/text: I have a lovely snowshoe siamese named Mocha and she loves this.  she isnt a big eater....as in she likes to eat little bits here and there with all types of food offered to her.  I feed about 1/3 a can of this and sometimes mix in fresh cooked meat or fresh green vegetables for her nightly meal.  i do want her eating fresh food as i believe any processed food isnt good for anyone--man or animal.  Mocha isnt a fan of fresh food, unfortunately...and loves dry kibble.  :(<br /><br />Anyway, as stinky as this classic fancy feast is, she seems to like it.  she will either devour the whole serving i give her or will eat a bit at a time until it's all gone in the AM.<br /><br />Of all fancy feast foods, these classic types are the 'better' ones if your cat is diabetic (do google search) as this has more protein (13% crude protein) compared to grilled version.  I havent tried those tuscany, mediteranean newer ones yet though.  however, these classic fancy feast versions are really stinky to the human nose compared to other versions.<br /><br />i myself do subscribe and save (SS) cause i save so much more this way.  i notice in grocery stores, the sale price for fancy feast is usually around $10 excluding tax.  So doing the math, SS saves alot of money.  I also do an online reward program that allows me to get $25 in monthly amazon gift cards for free so really, i get this for free.  yay!  thanks amazon.

review/text: yes they are more expensive, but my cats love them. They don't always like all the  flavors, but I think it is the best quality can cat food out there. BTW, I give them mostly dry, natural cat food, which cuts down the overall cost

review/summary: My FF cat has ALWAYS preferred this
review/text: My Fancy Feast cat has always loved the classic best!  He can be anywhere and all I have to do is yell "FANCY FEAST" ...he is at his bowl in a flash.  Perhaps he knows his pic is on the can :)  Anyway I tell him it is...the resemblance is close.  I've tried the grill and the shredded stuff.  It is apparently not as yummy because my "Feather" (white fur-ball of a cat) picks at those versions.  Feather is going on 14 yrs of age so it must be healthy.
