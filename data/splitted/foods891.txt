review/text: I'm a big fan of green tea but I don't even think Bigelow Green Tea is real green tea. I drink it all the time at work since it's free but I think I might start to bring my own tea to work. The color is brown and the taste is the same as chinese tea. Do yourself a favor and buy Green Tea from an Asian grocer or try Yamamotoyama brand. Those really have a distinct flavor and it is actually "green." Don't be fooled by Bigelow.

review/summary: A Formula for Death
review/text: Green tea may be a valuable part of the diet for many people, however, consuming green tea is either a knowing or unknowing choice of suicide by those of us who need blood thinners. Because of its vitamin k content, it reduces or eliminates the affect of blood thinners such as Coumadin, Plavis and even low dose aspirin. Vitamin K, present in extremely high quantities in green tea, promotes coagulation and consequently the formation of clots. Clots kill through stroke and heart attack.<br /><br />If you have either been prescribed blood thinners of any type or a family history of vascular problems, green tea should be regarded as a powerful and potentially deadly poison.

review/summary: Surprizingly delicious
review/text: Using Pau D'Arco tea for my occasional eczema and/or candida flair ups always works well.  But I hate going to the health food store to buy it, so I thought I'd try this.  It is wonderful!  It has Chai tea spices and natural chocolate flavor which tastes delicious without sugar, which is a no-no when flushing out the candida.  The package came a few days earlier than scheduled, which was also a nice surprize.  But best of all, it really works.  After one week, my most stubborn rashes are almost clear, and I think I should probably keep drinking this tea after it clears up completely.

review/text: This is my absolute favorite spread.  My son and I are really into blueberry lately. It is so yummy!  Cascadian Farms' quality is impeccable and ths spread's taste and texture is the best out of any other organic brands. Just the right amount of sweetness at 10g of sugar per tablespoon serving.<br /><br />BUT THE PRICE WITH THIS SUPPLIER IS OUTRAGEOUS!  $29.40 for 6 jars is $4.90 per jar, plus $11.10 for shipping is another $1.85 per jar, that's $6.75 per 10 oz jar? are you kidding me?  At the grocery store, I pay $3.69(in 2011), per jar even in blood-sucking New Jersey, where prices seem to be higher than anywhere else. 10 oz is 15 tablespoons per jar.  We go through a jar every 1-2 weeks. I was hoping to buy in bulk and save on my grocery bill. I'll keep searching for a lower price.

review/summary: This is NOT OLIVE pomace oil
review/text: On the website, the Genco packaging labels this as Olive Pomace Oil. What arrived was labeled in small lettering on a stick-on label, "Rape Pomace Oil," an oil made not only from rapeseed (canola) inferior oil, but from the leftover pomace of even that.  Although I bought this as a low quality oil acceptable for making olive oil soap, it is unsuitable even for that purpose.<br /><br />I was sadly misguided by all marketing sources leading me to this purchase. Please be careful, because this is priced almost equally with lower grade olive oils, which it is not.

review/summary: It's edible, but I would only use it for deep frying....if at all.
review/text: Olive oil is a slippery subject....<br /><br />There are LOTS of different types of olive oil, usually differentiated by:<br />Extraction method<br />  Pressing (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)<br />  Cold pressed<br />  Hot pressed<br />  Solvent extraction<br /><br />Pomace is what's left of the pressed olives after the final pressing.<br />Pomace is the lowest grade of oil which is edible (and some pomace is inedible.)<br /><br />Edible doesn't mean tasty. The vast majority of knowledgeable olive oil consumers wouldn't consider eating pomace grade. Generally the worst of the plain olive oils has considerably more flavor than pomace.<br /><br />Where you aren't looking for flavor, then pomace is possibly appropriate, but it should be much cheaper than plain olive oil. It is appropriately used as you would sunflower, corn or other neutral flavored cooking oils.<br /><br />Many in the USA like extra-virgin oil, but most Europeans prefer virgin, as it has more of the olive bitterness. Most in the USA have palates which are trained to dislike anything bitter. Most in the USA have been raised on vegetable oils which have little or no flavor (the advertising  boasts about this fact.)<br /><br />If you want an oil which won't affect the flavor of your food much, then this is an o.k. product.

Compared to the extra virgin olive oil they sell this product is not as tasty.  Would recommend you spend the extra bucks and get the pure stuff.

So, it's a big deal for me to find cookies I can eat and that are actually tasty. These aren't a compromise because of food sensitivities. I'd eat them even if I could have whatever I wanted. I'm not supposed to have chocolate so I do feel a little icky after a few but these are so rich I can't have more than 2-3 in one sitting, anyway.<br /><br />They do break kind of easily and that was a bigger issue getting them from Amazon, but they're $1 less/box than the local store and they taste just as good broken, so I will continue to buy them from Amazon.

These bite sized treats are perfect for training rewards or as 'just because' treats.  The size is appropriate for the smallest to the largest dog.  The quality is good.  The dogs seem to enjoy them.  The price is right in the 20# boxes.  The only down-side to these purchases was that on both occasions, the large plastic bag that contains the treats was not closed with a twist tie or anything of the sort.  It could have been a major mess and I would guess that the treats would have stayed fresher.

review/summary: These are wonderful
review/text: I was scared to eat these at first because my experience with the kashi granola bars has not been so great.  The honey flax one is so salty, I dont remember it being that way so maybe I just got a bad batch.  I love nothing more then chocolate and coconut and when I saw these I got excited.  I went out on a limb and bought them.  I was very pleased, it wasnt out of this world good, but it wasnt bad like I was afraid it would be.  There is not much of a coconut flavor at all, but the chocolate is like a frosting on top and is very tasty, not too sweet but just right.  The granola gives it a nice texture and is just a nice snack bar.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because there really isnt a coconut flavor at all, and not even much coconut in or on it.  I am someone who loves coconut lol.

review/summary: Really delicious!  Best Kashi bar yet
review/text: I have tried several Kashi TLC bars... I like most of them, but this is by far my favorite flavor, and at 120 calories per bar I don't feel like I'm "breaking the bank."  They are satisfying and good for a quick snack when you're on the go.  A smooth layer of chocolate adorns the top, with nuts and coconut.  The chocolate is mixed with dates and other fruits to make it sweeter.<br /><br />I'm not sure what else to say about these bars - except they're delicious and you should try them.  Hope this helps!

review/text: These Kashi bars are awesome!  I've tried Kashi products before and was really not all that impressed.  I saw this flavor and I LOVE coconut and chocolate together.  I thought I would give them a try but thought they would at best be tolerable.  To my surprise they are wonderful.  They have a thick coat of dark chocolate not a sparse little drizzle.  They are only 120 calories and make a great snack.  I will buy more of these.

review/summary: Best Kashi Bar Ever
review/text: The chocolate and coconut flavor is so good. You feel like you are eating something really bad, but you're not. Only 120 calories per bar, 4 grams of fiber, no corn syrup or artificial ingredients. I was under the impression that these would be chewy granola bars because the box says "tasty little chewies" on the front but the granola layer is more on the hard/crunchy side. I think it would be better if it was a more chewy bar. I absolutely love the taste though and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars instead of 4 because of the hardness of the granola.

review/text: I absolutely love these bars, they are so yummy. The thick layer of dark chocolate satisfies the sweet tooth and the coconut and nuts on top are an added bonus, try them and you will love them too. They are flying off store shelves, my grocery store can't keep them in stock so I had to order them from Kashi directly, which is cheaper than through Amazon. If you are on Weight Watchers these are 2 pts a bar. Very delicious! Thanks Kashi!

review/summary: More of a treat than a hearty granola bar
review/text: Yes these are very good like everyone states.  But....if you need a granola bar for a back packing trip, this bar is smaller and probably has less filling effect than their other bars.  I normally order the trail mix bar as a mid afternoon snack.  Now, if you want a sweet fix that still healthy-ish, this is perfect.

review/text: I got a sample of this in the mail and it is just incredibly tasty. Generally I don't like coconut but here I felt it really added to the different textures of all the grains in the bar. It reminded me a little bit of muesli bars. Anyway, for it's size I was quite pleased - I feel full (satisfied) after eating it! All the while when I was eating the bar I couldn't help commenting on how tasty it was, and how the various subtle flavors and textures of the ingredients came through.

I think what really does it for me is the chocolate, without it this bar just wouldn't be the same.  The chocolate is a bit different than regular chocolate though, the texture seems a bit more syrupy or something...none the less it is very good!  Perfect for a quick snack, a small treat, or on the go!

review/summary: addictive, but gradually wanes
review/text: If you're a chocolate and coconut fan, these Kashi's hit the spot.  I agree with another reviewer who said the calorie count is minimal, but sometimes it's hard not to eat the whole box.  However, over time, the desire to eat more than one does seem to wear off.  Kashi does a terrific job of combining nutrition and taste without going overly sweet.  This variety is the best of their sweeter choices.  The honey almond flax nevertheless remain my favorite overall. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DHN956">Kashi Granola Honey Almond Flax,1.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: The best Kashi fruit and grain bar. Easily.
review/text: I've become a big fan of whole grain, and Kashi cereals in particular. Some of Kashi's bars can be a bit dry, but the Dark Chocolate and Coconut is my standby, go to "granola" bar. The dark chocolate "icing" and soft coconut make this bar a decadent delight, while remaining reasonably healthy. This bar is really tough to beat.

review/summary: Kashi Dark Chocolate Coconut Bars
review/text: This has been the breakfast choice of the week for me.  One a day worked just perfectly (well for six days since there are six to a box).  Tasty, moderately healthy, and reasonably filling, this is a good bar.<br /><br />The taste is definitely one of chocolate coconut.  the chocolate is actually a layer in the top and while it's not the darkest chocolate I've ever had (closer to milk chocolate) it was still pretty good.  I kind of liked the chewy frosting like texture it was in too.  The coconut sprinkle on top you could also taste and that combined with the nuts and the actual granola bar made a pretty satisfying bite.  You could taste all the different flavors without any becoming too overpowering.  I might have wished for just a little more coconut, but I won't complain too much since I could taste it.<br /><br />The ingredients are pretty decent. It's sweetened with rice syrup and cane sugar, so natural at least.  The grains are the most prominent ingredient, with wheat, oat, rye, and barley being listed.  There's also the coconut of course, and the chocolate.  And it contains the Kashi seven whole grains mix that they like to advertise.  And walnuts appeared to be the nut of choice on this bar.  Really, every ingredient in there I can pronounce and that's a win in my book.  The calories are moderate for these ingredients, 120 a bar, which is a lot less than the protein bars that are on the market.  And the sugar content is only 7 grams, which is also relatively low.  Fat is 3.5 grams, which is ok.  And there is 4 grams of protein.<br /><br />Not a bad bar and definitely a good breakfast.  I'll be buying these again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Delicious bar with natural chocolate and coconut
review/text: What stands out to me about this bar are the natural chocolate and coconut flavors. The coconut is natural coconut flakes sprinkled on top. The box states "delicious strands of naturally tasty coconut." The chocolate layer is nice and thick, and really satisfies my craving for chocolate. These Kashi bars contain no high fructose corn syrup. The dark chocolate is made of evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, and cocoa.<br /><br />WHO SHOULD GET THESE:<br /><br />* Chocolate lovers.<br />* People looking for a low protein bar.<br />* People looking for a bar with all-natural ingredients.<br />* A bar with no high fructose corn syrup<br />* A bar with dietary fiber<br /><br />There are other bars that will give you 10 or 20 grams of protein and less or about the same amount of sugar (7 grams). The only downside is that because this bar only contains 4 grams of protein, and 4 grams of dietary fiber, it doesn't leave me feeling satisfied for long.<br /><br />These work for a light snack, when I am in the mood for a bite of chocolate. They are great with a glass of skim milk. At 120 calories, and only 30 grams of fat, I highly recommend them, as long as you are not looking for a protein bar. For the chocolate flavor alone, these bars are a standout.

It's hard to find a yummy AND healthy bar for less than $1 a piece...which is what we have found in these! If you choose the subscribe and save option, they are only $.42 a piece! Amazing! They have tons of fiber and protein AND low sugar content. You get a total of 36 bars, and ours were gone within the week of receiving. Amazing. Mind you- my two oldest kids- 11 and 16- do not like dark chocolate- but loved these! I chose the once a month option for delivery, but I'm going to see if I can speed up my next delivery to come sooner than that!

review/text: Bought these recently in an effort to increase our multigrain consumption and watch calories.  So I've been eating them as well as my 48-year old husband.  They taste pretty good and the texture is like a firm rice krispy bar.  There isn't as much coconut on them as what's pictured on the box, but that's okay because the coconut and dark chocolate balance is just right - not overly sweet.  Anyway, my 17-year old daughter and her boyfriend also snack on these bars too....which means they have a cross-generational and cross-gender appeal!  I'll continue to purchase these from Amazon....more convenient and cheaper than getting them at the grocery store.

review/summary: Frosting on a Granola bar?  Eeeww!
review/text: I usually love Kashi's products, but this one is not good at all.  I LOVE dark chocolate and I LOVE coconut, so I thought these were going to be pretty much the best thing ever.  As soon as I got them home, I opened one to try it.  I was sadly disappointed in both the chocolate and coconut taste of this bar.  The so-called "dark chocolate" is a paste-like frosting that, being chocolate, obviously should taste good, but has a weird texture that makes it gross.  I was thinking it was going to be like a layer of actual chocolate, similar to the layer of chocolate on the bottom of Kashi's Go-Lean Crunch bars (which are totally yummy), not chocolate flavored frosting on the top of the granola bar.  Second, these do NOT taste like coconut at all.  There is a sprinkling of dried coconut on the top of the nasty frosting, but you can't even taste it, mostly because the chocolate-y taste of the paste, uh, I mean frosting overwhelms it.  My kids won't even eat them and they will eat anything with frosting on it.  Actually, I guess now I have to say they will eat ALMOST anything with frosting on it.  I would skip these in favor of ANY OTHER Kashi granola bar.  Don't waste your money, unless you like to eat paste and have always been searching for a chocolate flavored paste (with a sprinkling of coconut) to smear on a granola bar.

review/text: During shipment, the lid detached, leaking the contents of the starter culture. Contacted the seller who immediately responded. Received a personal note stating they would replace the item, that they had identified the container flaw, and had already implemented a new process to ensure it wouldn't happen again in the future. Later the same day, was surprised to receive an email that they had additinally credited my account $10 for delay in receiving (based on original order date, not replacement date). Very impressed. This is how customer service used to be and what every company should strive for. I predict success for this company. Would gladly do business with them in the future. About the product, it is a culture.  I had these growing in my kitchen when I lived in Poland and Russia. Very straightforward and easy to use.....when it arrives (live I hope!) it will do the job.

review/text: I ordered Lifetime Kefir's Kombucha starter and it arrived in just a few days. I followed their included instructions, and the starter mother grew quickly. I just drank my first batch of kombucha! It was definitely much more flavorful than anything you can buy at the store. It was richer and more complex. I highly recommend Lifetime Kefir's Kombucha starter. How rewarding!

review/text: It's winter here, so in a couple weeks I had a good batch of KOMBUCHA tea. It was probably one of the best tastes I've ever had. This is the second time I've made it, the first time I've ordered a mother. The first time I used two bottles of GT kombucha.<br /><br />This seems to be a great deal. The tea tastes great and gives the body buzz.

review/summary: Somewhat disapointed
review/text: Despite of my initial disappointment with the distilled vinegar that arrived and the items received not being the same as the ones pictured in the Amazon.com profile I decided to raise number of stars from 2 to 3. 3 stars are for the misleading photos in the product profile and the different items in the package that I received (please read the details below). The mother culture itself is wonderful and produced beautiful, absolutely great tasting kombucha in one week and a gorgeous scoby.<br /><br />The package arrived in a reasonable time. However, the starter liquid came in a PLASTIC bottle and only enough to start one quart of kombucha. The description ( of the product on Amazon.com)regarding the contents of the package was not specific enough. The photograph shows a plastic bag with Scoby and liquid, a mysterious brown bag/envelope and what it looks like instructions sheet. Another photograph shows a jar labeled : Kombucha Starter. NONE of these items were included in the package I received. I received a small ziploc bag with Scoby, instructions sheet and a small plastic bottle labeled: "Starter Liquid". When I opened the bottle  I realized it is nothing but distilled vinegar. After studying the ways of how to start kombucha tea process I learned that the starter should be the already fermented kombucha tea. According to the seller: Lifetime Kefir company instructions, white distilled vinegar can also be used. Then why isn't the tiny PLASTIC bottle containing WHITE DISTILLED VINEGAR labeled as such? Why use such deception? Starter liquid should be the fermented kombucha tea. I do not think it is so expensive that it cannot be included instead of WHITE DISTILLED VINEGAR. The only reason I am not going to return this package is that it is not worth my time.

review/summary: OK, but Bigelow has better mint varieties
review/text: Bigelow Green Tea with Mint has a good flavor.  I drink mostly black teas, followed in frequency by some herbal blends, but not much green tea.  When I do grab the occasional green tea bag, though, I prefer this Green Tea with Mint variety over a straight green tea.<br /><br />Green Tea with Mint doesn't add any other flavors.  The package lists only green tea and mint leaves as ingredients.  The mint's presence is quite strong, even sharp, when I give a freshly opened tea bag the deep sniff test (my favorite moment with tea!) before placing it in the cup.  Once it is steeped, though, the mint is less pronounced, and I think the mint flavor is less strong than in Bigelow's Plantation Mint black tea.  In fact, in the aroma of the steeped tea, the mint is not particularly noticeable--the most noticeable scent to me once the tea is steeped is one very similar to that of fresh grass cuttings, and I mean that in a good way.  The smell is pleasant.<br /><br />For a mint tea, I prefer the Bigelow Plantation Mint, but then, I mostly prefer black teas.  If you like green teas, Bigelow Green Tea with Mint is a good variety.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.

When Bigelow came out with Green Tea with Mint I tried it and the flavor was a bit milder than what I was used to but it was great.  I have been hooked on it since.  If you love mint flavor and want a healthier alternative to black tea this is the one!!!

review/summary: AWESOME TEA! GREAT PALETTE CLEANSER!
review/text: I LOVE this stuff. Always drink my tea straight.<br /><br />Great tea flavor and the mint gives it a crisp, clean finish (the mint is alot heavier on the smell when you open the pouch than when you actually drink the finished product).<br />If you like green tea, and mint tea, this is a great vessel.<br /><br />I typically go through 4-5 bags a day and I like to mix-and-match with other flavors (Mango being my go-to).<br /><br />I tend to eat heavy breakfast and lunches that leave quite the mark on my breath. One cup of this and my mouth feels instantly-cleansed.<br /><br />Absolutely nothing bad to say about this. Never had a problem with teeth stains or any aftertaste.

review/text: I would have never thought this would be a good combination but after having a chilled "green tea sweetened with mint and honey" I was on the hunt for the perfect green tea with mint combination.  I work in a coffee and tea shop and none of the teas we sell came close to what I was looking for.  I found this tea at my grocery store and purchased it on a whim to try it out because it was inexpensive.  It is now my favorite tea.  I have gone through it so fast and will probably buy this bulk package.  It is even better sweetened with some honey!

review/text: I never knew what real, good green tea tasted like until I bought loose leaf Gunpowder Green in bulk at a Middle Eastern market. Pre-bagged green tea is awful, tastes like dirty water, and does green tea no justice. This stuff is no exception. I like Bigelow for black teas and their flavored teas, but this is just bad green tea. The mint flavor just makes it worse. Please do yourself a favor and buy some bulk green tea--I recommend Davidson's Organic Gunpowder Green, which is $12 a pound (a bargain!!!). I buy it off Amazon, and it's an even better deal than I can get at my local market.

Unfortunately he is allergic to beef and chicken so I researched grain-free dog foods that had good recommendations behind them. Oh yes, he is a somewhat finicky eater.  But he loves Avoderm Lamb and Rice.  The top ingredients in this formula are lamb broth, lamb, lamb liver, rice, dried egg product, and several vegetables and fruits.  No corn or wheat.  Keep an eye open for Amazon listings for case prices that run around $2.50 per can--or sometimes less.<br /><br />See correlary review for Avoderm Lamb and Rice dry dog food.

review/summary: Good quality, affordable food.
review/text: It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)

review/summary: Made my dog's coat shine
review/text: I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.

review/summary: Great value product that is full of protein
review/text: We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier.

review/summary: Very good food.
review/text: I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.

review/summary: Seems to Be Good Food - Dogs Like It.  Does have an Odor While Other Premium Foods Do Not.
review/text: We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).

review/summary: Looks like good stuff!
review/text: The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.

review/text: Our source for this dog food went out of business. It was highly recommended by our dog trainer and wasn't out of line on cost. We couldn't find it anywhere and I jokingly asked my wife to check at Amazon. To our shock, you had it, at the same price and you had it delivered right to our front door, all at the same price.  Unreal.

review/summary: Quite pleased with my purchase of this food.
review/text: High Quality ingredients. Excellent deal I got on the price.My dog seems to LOVE it, which is extremely important to me because I love my dog!!!I probably would have given it 5 stars but it is rather pricey on a normal basis but kind of understandable with the great ingredients just hard for those on a budget to afford sometimes!Overall great deal.

review/summary: Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg
review/text: I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)
