review/summary: Great Chew Treats for Dental Cleaning!
review/text: These chew treats are great and my cat loves them. I have not been able to find them at any retail locations and get them exclusively with KV VetSupply.  The problem most cats have is the size. I find it is best to hold one end and let your cat knaw on the other end.  I would not leave with them unsupervised.  My cat really chews on them like a dog and scrapes his back teeth good with them.  I would buy them by the case if I could afford it.

review/summary: Almost plastic-like
review/text: Strange smooth, plastic-like texture that my cats didn't care for. My oldest cat likes to chew on my Beagle's bones and rawhides so hardness isn't an issue & both my male cats will eat just about anything. Even fruits and veggies. I'm thinking that the flavor/smell (or lack there of) wasn't enticing to them. Oh well, at least the dog will eat them so they won't go to waste. If your cat likes electrical cords or other similar tasteless, yet firm items-these chews just might be for you!

review/summary: Great for Older Kitten
review/text: I didn't mind my kitten teething on my finger when she was smaller, but she's 9 months old now and hasn't lost her urge to chew on things.  She was constantly after a certain consistency - something firm, but not completely hard, like a pencil topper, electrical cord. etc.  This chew treat is perfect - firm enough for her, but still something she can sink her teeth into.  I'm thrilled, and will definitely be getting more.  The suggestion to heat it up and re-shape it by another reviewer was really helpful and made it much easier for my kitten to play with independently (vs. me holding it).  Also, I wouldn't recommend it for small kittens, as pieces will break off and your kitten/cat needs to be able to chew it up before swallowing.  My kitten is a small 9-month old and doesn't have any problems with these.

review/summary: Two Paws Down
review/text: My cat is the most food oriented animal I have ever had.  He was a scavenger before we adopted him; eating out of dumpsters and who knows what else.  It took us months and many rolls of duct tape to train him to stay out of our kitchen trash.  He will eat anything except for salsa, peanut butter, chocolate, and food with too much cinnamon.  Notice that jalapeno potato chips, bread of any type (through the plastic bag), carrots, and bird seed were not mentioned in the list of food he won't eat?  Well add these cat chew treats to list of things he won't eat.  He won't even touch them.  He shows absolutely no interest in these once he sniffs them.  They may help with tartar, but only if the cat eats them.  Will not purchase again.

review/text: My cat is just over a year old and loves to chew. He was chewing on the hose from the toilet and a lot of other inappropriate things. He really likes these. We got them at Petco. It's hard to find chew toys/treats for cats. He didn't like the rubbery/plastic dog toys. These are a perfect solution and keep his teeth healthy.

The one that chews, loves these treats and the other one just sniffs and walks away.  If your cat tends to chew things, try these.

review/summary: "The crazy kid eats the stuff..." and Mom is happy.
review/text: My older kids won't eat it if we paid them and it tastes kinda borderline to me.  But my 15 month old (who is picky) loves it.  I try to feed my kids food I prepare from my own kitchen, but this little guy wasn't getting enough iron.  The doc has put him on a high iron diet.  He always analyzes his food visually and won't let us pry open his mouth if it doesn't pass inspection.  But he willingly tasted this before he saw the green puree and was instantly sold!  I suspect he likes the cool delivery system. I'm checking with the manufacturer to see if it really is 120% DV for iron, or if it's a misprint.<br /><br />*** Update!  Yes, Ella's reports that it was a misprint and the company is working hard to fix the problem.  4% is the actual number.  That fits more with spinach's DV's.  Only way to get that high is to add iron supplements!  Glad I checked.  Got a quick and honest answer from them.  Hope they are able to fix labeling issues soon. It's still on our list of foods to boost iron levels.***<br /><br />I found some on sale in a local grocery store.  Amazon's price came pretty close, and is still cheaper than other online places I've found.  Including the manufacturer's website.<br /><br />Each kid has their own tastes, so don't write it off because it looks or tastes nasty to others.  Worth a try at least once (it might help to not look disgusted when you give it to your kids).  Seems to be a good product.  Now the frugal mom in me is trying to figure out if I can trick him by making my own puree and using a syringe to re-fill the bag so he'll eat!

review/summary: Great Product -- Amazon Rip Off
review/text: I make all my daughters food and thankfully she prefers what I make over jar food.  I do have those times when I need something quick to grab on the go.  Ella's Organics is a great go to. Paying this much for one pouch is a huge huge rip off.  Usually Babies R Us has them for $1 - $1.40 most likely on sale for a dollar though.  I am really happy with the Happy Baby brand too ... also almost $2 a pouch but usually on sale. Just last night my local grocery store had a 10/$10 sale on this brand.<br /><br />Seek out this product just never for this price!! Yikes.

review/summary: So far she likes it!
review/text: I can hardly contain my excitement so I had to post a review. My baby is almost 17 months old. When she first started solids at around 6 months, she was adventurous and tried and ate everything, including a great amount of veggies. When she turned a year old, she got really fussy and turned her little nose up at every single veggie we tried to give her. She would only eat fruit and yogurt with her cereal in the morning and for the rest of the day she would only accept meat. This has been going on for so long now that I began to get really really worried that she wasn't getting enough good nutrition. I had seen Ella's pouches, but hadn't tried them. A friend highly recommended them to us this weekend so I figured we should try it. I decided to go full on veggie and try this flavor (spinach, apple, rutabaga), and just give them away if she really hated it.<br /><br />Ok, so I'm only giving it 4 stars just in case things change, BUT i tasted one just now and thought, yuck, ok, this is REALLY strongly spinach flavored, she is NOT going to eat this, but I gave her the pouch and she gobbled it DOWN! She was still trying to get some out of the empty pouch! I can't believe it. I'm a very pleased mama. My fussy baby ate spinach, woohoo! :)<br /><br />I'll see how things go over the next few pouches, but so far I recommend them for fussy eaters. If she continues to like this one, I will try a few more. Thanks Ella's kitchen!

See that difference? The stuff tastes just as good, I've tried them. In fact, the broccoli one of Ella's is disgusting, in my opinion. I like the brand that starts with a "P", second word Organics. Not the bunny. These get one star for pricing. The star is given because the product is nice, but 4 stars are taken away because of the complete highway robbery of offering these in a pack of only 7 for $39.95. Don't encourage them.

review/summary: I am so disappointed with this company - buyer BEWARE indeed
review/text: After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error.

review/summary: Tasty, a little bit runny
review/text: Great product.  For my older daughter, I made all organic baby food homemade.  Since we moved after the birth of my second child, we aren't able to get a nice fresh variety of organic fruits and veggies like we used to, so I decided to try buying organic baby food instead. My kids love these pouches (give or take a few of the flavors). I love the pouch packaging for easy clean-up, compact travel and not having to worry about carrying glass jars around.<br /><br />Both my infant (9 months old) and toddler (2.5 years old) love this flavor of Ella's the best, much to our surprise.  I think it's probably b/c it one of the few foods without bananas added.  It is a bit runny, so keep that in mind when using a spoon to feed.  But since it's so runny, it's good for younger ones that aren't used to thicker solids.<br /><br />The Spinach, Peas and Pears from Plum Organics is similar in taste, but is a little thicker, if the consistency of this one isn't right for you.  Also, we often mix this with some rice cereal to thicken it up if needed.<br /><br />I would recommend buying the variety pack to see which ones your kids might like.  Also, if they don't like it at first, don't give up, give them some time and try it again later.  They might change their minds.

The only ingredient not in the title is lemon juice.  No crazy preservatives or other ingredients.  The problem is the company that is selling them on Amazon.  Don't take it out on Ella's.  You can find it MUCH more reasonably priced on diapers.com, or at Target.  I agree w/ another reviewer that the Plum organics baby food is also good, and a little cheaper, but this is still a staple in our son's diet.

Very disappointed that this mistake wasn't announced or anyhow made noticable; I found out about it just by luck - was bragging about these pouches and showing the iron information to my parents, and noticed that the last shipment (I have it on subscribe and save) has only 4% of Iron listed on the pouch.

review/summary: Happy baby makes a happy mommy!
review/text: My son LOVES the Ella's kitchen line of organic baby foods. By far his favorite has to be the Spinach, Apple and Rutabaga. I'm always tasting his foods before I give it to him and this is something I would eat! My son was EBF until 6 months, and I started out making his own organic baby food, but working full time and being a single mom it was taking up too much time that I could be spending with my son. I researched the Ella's kitchen organic baby food and decided to try it out, and we haven't found a kind he dislikes! This has made feeding time a joy for both of us.

review/summary: incorrect nutrition facts
review/text: I will say that my son has enjoyed this product.  HOWEVER, i'm extremely disappointed to see that the nutrition facts on the package are incorrect.  The package says 45% of iron RDA but if you check the website, it only has 4%.  It feels like the company is intentionally misleading (similar error occurred on other flavors) to get people to buy this product.  Disappointed in the company.

He loves the flavor & I was comfortable with the ingredients after already trying all the stage 1 foods.<br />These cost $1.89 each at Target, we got them for about $1.50 each with subscribe & save.  Still pricey, but worth it when I see how much he loves this combo.

review/text: I love this product. First of all it's a great blend of fruits and vegetables.  My daughter loves it.  She is now almost 1.  I didn't get why it was so expensive at first. But after trying Happy Baby and Plum pouches I realized that this product stands alone.  The other organic baby food pouch manufacturers really thin it out with water. This is much more concentrated.  My daughter loves it and we're getting more nutrition in every pouch.  It's also a lot easier to control and prevent spills because a gentle squeeze doesn't send the food oozing out everywhere.  I love it and highly recommend it.

review/summary: More please!!
review/text: I found these wondering the isle of Target one day.  I'd decided to try baby food again because all of a sudden she stopped eating fruits and veggies.  Won't touch them if she recognizes them.  I don't know if a carrot or a pea chased her in one of her dreams, but it's been a nightmare trying to force her to eat them.  So for a time I just gave up and then she gained weight...oh no.  So went to find some baby apple sauce and stumbled upon these.  Best. Discovery. Ever.<br /><br />I take 2 with me when we're out, and give them to her when we're in the car or in between plays on the playground.  The best part of these is that I can 'inject' these into her when we're rushed. She's loved all of the flavors except for the Sweet Potatoes, and gets a kick out of eating them herself.<br /><br />After calculating what it would cost for me to make such concoctions (cheap but time consuming) and taking into consideration the method of delivery (the spouted pouch, which is about 50% of this product's wow factor) that I can not imitate, Amazon is the very best place to buy these yummy pouches.  Amazon's price makes my daughter consuming 2-3 of these a day affordable.

review/text: I am a dad who likes to get things in bulk so I can stock up and save while getting quality stuff for my kids. My wife does the picking of which organic stuff we buy. She tries them all with the kids and the best match up so far has been the Ella line. They haven't gotten bored of them for 6 month straight now. Not bad. But within that brand, it's the sweet potatoes, pumpkin, apples, and blueberries that both kids will gobble up. I think it's the combination of the purple packaging and the blueberry flavor. But that's just my opinion.

review/text: I LOVE Ella's pouches and my son does too, but the look of horror on his face when he first tried this flavor was hilarious. You'd have thought I tried to feed him poison.  Curious to know what flavor could have produced such a strong response from him, I tried the pouch myself.  EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWE!!!!!  I've never tasted anything so vial in my life.  Had we not been out in public at the time I would have spit it out on the floor.  Instead I forced myself to swallow, threw the package away immediately, and apologized profusely to my son for trying to make him eat it.  I shudder just thinking about that one awful bite I had to endure.  Blech.

I pack one of these in my toddler's lunch boxes every day, and she views eating her spinach as a treat - even more amazing.  So although this product is far more expensive than alternatives, given the taste and nutrition, this has become the one 'vegetable' I am guaranteed my daughter will consume every day.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE! Read the nutrition label on Ella's website
review/text: This stuff is garbage and Ella's Kitchen should be ashamed for false advertising. I was really surprised to see a fruit product like this one had so much calcium (10%) on the package compared to most of the other baby fruits out there (usually 0-2% unless veggies or yogurt's added in) and chose this over other products, thinking the extra calcium would be worth the extra $ for my baby in the long run. When you check it against Ella's website, it HAS NO CALCIUM%! Same goes for all the other stage 1 Ella's fruits (butternut squash, carrots, apples, prunes: 30% calcium on package but 2% on the website, carrots, apples, parsnips 30% calcium on package vs. 0% on website all the same serving size) -- there were other differences too in protein, iron, etc. It does cost a lot more than some of the other organic baby fruits out there and tastes awful. If your baby is just as content with the other less expensive organic baby fruits out there, go with the cheaper alternative because nutrition wise, Ella's no better!<br /><br />What a disgusting marketing ploy by Ella's Kitchen to get parents to choose their products because it is falsely more nutritious when it's the same as other organic baby fruits in terms of nutritional value.

Now that he's a toddler he refuses almost all fresh fruits and vegetables, even the ones that he used to love.  I use these to sneak healthy food into him!  I keep some organic baby food pouches in the car, so that I always have a healthy snack on hand for him.  He loves them!<br /><br />Note that these aren't as sweet as some of the other organic baby food pouches (such as Happy Tot's Spinach, Mango, and Pear).  If I give my son a sweeter pouch first, and then this pouch, he refuses this one.  If you think your child will eat more than one pouch, offer this sweet potato/pumpkin pouch first!  I am so grateful for these!

review/text: My son is now one, and looooves these little pouches. I can't even go through the baby food aisle at the grocery store without him seeing these and crying for one. I love the packaging because it is so easy for him to hold and eat off the spout. Plus, these are great to put in his diaper bag for snacks when we're out running errands or to feed him at a restaurant. He loves all the flavors of these, there are other brands out there that he didn't like and when I tried them they were not very good. I have tried these and they are very tasty, which I was surprised because some of the combos don't sound like they would taste good (spinach, apple, rutabaga?). I am from Dallas and I get them from a grocery store here called Central Market and they normally sell them at less than $2 but will have sales where you can get them at around $1, so that is when I stock up. The product is excellent, but I think the price you pay on Amazon is very high compared to other places where you can get a better price.

review/summary: My twins love these!
review/text: I have twin 14 month old girls and they have been eating Ella's Organic fruit/veggie pouches since they were about 4 months old. They LOVE them and they are a great snack to take on the road or outside. While I would prefer for the girls to eat actual fruit and veggies, they are going through a picky stage right now and these pouches are the next best thing. We buy them in bulk and can't keep up with the demand from our girls.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: It is hard to get my 9 month old to eat vegetables, but luckily she likes this blend! As another review mentioned, it is pretty runny but I just thicken it up with rice cereal. I'm a little torn on what I think of packages like this - I am glad they are BPA free, and they are convenient for when we're out and about, but in general I prefer glass containers that we can recycle or reuse.

review/summary: Baby loves this food!
review/text: This food is not as smooth as some of the others and is a mixture of 4 foods, so I didn't start feeding it to my baby until he was 6-7 months old.  He's 9 months old now and still loves it, and I think it's better now that it isn't as smooth.  I could see feeding him this for awhile longer alongside solids or as a snack.  The only downside is the price, but I guess it's not much more than other pouches.

review/summary: Looks and smells gross, but my baby wouldn't stop eating it!
review/text: Our pediatrician recommended this flavor combination when we first started solids because it has 120% of daily iron needs.  Well, when I sat down to feed it to my baby, all I could was, wow, this is so gross!  It looks pretty much the same way going in as it does coming out, if you know what I mean.  To my surprise, my picky eater gobbled it up!  She ate more of this than any other baby food flavor we had offered.  A 2-3oz package of anything else was lasting two days, but she ate almost the whole 3.5oz package of this in one sitting.  I did taste it, and the apples make it sweet and appetizing (and I really do not like spinach).  We've had more success with Ella's Kitchen than any other brand, but this flavor especially has been great.  Looks gross, smells gross, sounds gross, but I say, give it a try.

review/summary: Helpful for kids with special needs, too
review/text: My son is 8 but due to his disability is on a very low calorie diet and has issues chewing many low calorie foods such as raw veggies.  These packets are a fun way for him to enjoy a low calorie snack when we are on the go (only 35-40 calories for many of the packets).  He loves the taste and of course there is no worry about choking hazards.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because they are extremely pricey, even at the lowest price I could find it really adds up.

review/summary: Great baby food!
review/text: When my 4 month old son sees these brightly colored pouches he sits straight up in his high chair and starts to get excited. All the flavors are really yummy. ... I've tried everything that he's eaten at this point.<br /><br />I really like that these have no additives... They didnt even add water. Just pure organic fruit and vegetable pur&eacute;e. I figure that he's going to have so many processed food options in the future that I might as well give him the best I can now.<br /><br />I purchased the Boon Spoons (got a 3 pack of the 2-spoon sets from the big T for less than a 2 pack here on amazon) and they work perfectly with these pouches too. Very convenient to take on the go.<br /><br />I continue to purchase these pouches, though I usually buy a couple individual packs from T before buying the 7 packs here on Amazon so I can make sure he likes them.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I have been buying Ella since my son was 6 months old. Once I moved back to the States I was pleased to find the Ella product here. I was also buying Gerber Organic and then one day I studied the label and realized that only Ella was truly just pure veg and fruit whereas the other organic baby food as other random things to help the shelf life. Ella is worth the price and is so easy to mix in with chicken or fish to make it easier for your little one. Although my son is now 16months, I still use Ella when I am short on time and don't have time to make fresh veg or fruit.

If you do not use it all at one time, then you just put the cap back on and put it in the fridge. They also take up less space in the diaper bag, and you do not have to worry about the jar busting.

review/summary: My Toddler Vegetable Snob is a BIG Fan!
review/text: These little pouches are great for toddlers who refuse to eat their vegetables in the conventional way. My son started getting picky around 18 months and I was on the verge of desperation when I found these at BRU. (They are also carried at a certain big box store that has a bulls eye logo.) Yes, they are marketed for babies, and are almost two bucks a pop, but my son ALWAYS finishes these pouches, which is more than I can say for most things he eats, and I feel much better knowing he ingested something green! Yay for Ella's kitchen! Oh. and I also recommend the pumpkin version. Super yummy!

review/text: I have an 11 month and 3.5 year old. These pouches make for a great yummy snack. My kids love to eat them right out of the pouch. My older child eats her whole veggies and also these pouches. My baby, is not a huge veggie fan like my eldest.. she loves these however. When I cook for the baby if I don't hide the veggies well, she will reject the meal. So, when I can't get my baby to eat the organic veggies I have made or when I need a quick snack while shopping or out and about, Ella's takes great care of us! Def a must have. Oh, I just give my baby the whole tube and she sucks it all out.. great for the baby who had always refused me feeding her.

Yeah it is kind of expensive but if your child loves it then I would buy it for the child. They do go on sale too. If you have WIC ( Women , Infant and Children) You can buy these from Target Because only Target carry these here. I am not sure if Amazon accepts WIC.  Over all a great product I would recommend it.

review/summary: Wonderful taste - but NOT vegetarian
review/text: This has been one of my favorite quick miso soups-- in fact, I like the taste far better than even the miso soup I prepare with fresh miso paste. I enjoy it in the evenings, as it has little calories and gives me something warm to sip on rather than some other junk I'd regret later. It's easy to prepare-- just add 1 cup of boiling water per packet.<br /><br />Let's see... what other information can I give than what is provided here?  I have a packet with me right now, so I will tell you the nutrition info:<br /><br />Calories: 40 kcal, Total Fat: 1.5 g, Cholesterol: 0, Sodium: 860 mg (yikes!), Total Carbohydrate: 3 g, Sugars: 0, Protein: 3 g.  Contains soy, wheat and fish ingredients.<br /><br />Even though I love this soup, this is the last packet I'll buy because I just noticed that it is NOT vegetarian.  It says it has fish ingredients in it.  I couldn't figure out from the nutrition label where the fish was coming from, but I found out that bonito powder was a fish extract.  I just wanted to warn other vegetarians-- as I didn't notice this earlier.  You can also try the San-J Wakame broth packets-- those are almost as delicious and they're vegan (though the sodium's a bit higher).  I hope the company will come out with a vegetarian version of this miso soup though.

review/summary: Excellent/Easy
review/text: Yummy! Not like a typical instant or canned soup -- very much like served in a restaurant, including a nice body/texture. Using the 8-oz hot water and a teeny touch of soy sauce (I'm a salt-loving person -- you might not want it), I find it perfect. Have served it to company with openness and no apologies for it being instant. I like to make food from scratch, but not every course every time, so this is a welcome addition to my pantry. And nicely filling for a between meal snack.

review/summary: great shortcut miso
review/text: As someone who has created their own scratch dashi and cultivated their own miso, I can tell you this is a bargain - a full and chunky miso with quality all the way around.<br /><br />I'd order a case now if I could. Shame they don't always have it in stock here.

review/summary: surprisingly filling and tasty
review/text: The packets don't look like much, but they make a satisfying snack that fills you up. It's great as a mid-afternoon snack, or I make a quick meal out of it by adding leftover veggies or meat.<br />The downside is the high sodium content for those who need to monitor their salt intake. I will definitely buy this product again.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: A fun and fast meal that isn't noodle based. Plus, this miso is thicker than most which gives it more flavor. In the winter, I'm always looking for more types of soup to eat. My only complaint is that there isn't enough tofu.
