review/summary: good product...natural ingredients
review/text: I like that this product is very natural and I understand what all the ingredients are.  My cat loves the food too.  My only complaint is that I can't find it in my area so I have to order it off the internet.  The shipping really adds to the price.

review/summary: If you can't go raw, go with this!
review/text: The food this company makes is the closest I can find to raw until I actually get to feed mine raw more often. The value is amazing... actually because it is so dense with nutrients, my cats eat less and I spend less feeding them this brand of food than the other premium brands I was feeding them before.<br /><br />The canned is a dense pate style that needs to be mashed down. My cats had not been fond of pate textures of other brands of foods in the past. It took about 4 days for one of my cats to recognize it as her new food. She had to be enticed but it ends up she is loving it! (Patience pays off!) There was no problem getting my other cat to eat it after having it for a meal for the first time. The both now eat all 3 available flavors and seem to love the rabbit the best.<br /><br />Their coats are magnificent! Their stools are small and odorless, similar to what it would look like if they were on a raw diet. My oldest cat who had mild digestive issues doesn't have them anymore. Hooray! I also noticed that while on this brand of food, the crusty sleepies in their eyes are just about non-existent. I hardly have to groom their faces anymore. And they are so active I can hardly believe they have that much energy for their ages.<br /><br />I honestly believe that having no synthesized vitamins makes a world of difference. I had to go back to my old brand of kibble for a short time because I was waiting for my next Nature's Logic order to arrive. On their old brand the cats were producing so much extra waste and it wasn't nearly as healthy-looking. The difference really is amazing.<br /><br />There is no doubt to me the Nature's Logic foods are truly easy to digest and the nutrients are absorbed and used! I hope they continue to grow and the product becomes more well known and available. I recommend it to everyone with cats!<br /><br />Pros : Improves Coat, Increased Activity, Good Value, Likes It, All Natural, Good Taste, Nutritional, Easy To Digest, Odorless Stools<br />Cons : Few Flavor Selections

review/summary: Excellent food!
review/text: This is one of the few chicken cat foods that don't contain some kind of fish and my cat loves it.  One of my 3 has allergies to fish so I have had somewhat of a challenge finding food without any type of fish protein.  She can also have lamb, which does help as far as alternating and giving her variety.  This one is just wonderful in that it doesn't contain any synthetic vitamins.  A great approach and well received in my home.  One of my other cats has a longer allergy list and is currently on rabbit, which is even harder to find.  She is on the top 3 brands that offer rabbit, including this one.  She loves it, so I thought I would try the chicken flavor for my little fish-less one and it turned out to be a rewarding venture.  I find the price competitive with this type of food and will keep it in their rotations.  It is drier than other brands, but I just cut it up and add about a tablespoon of water on top.  They lick it off like gravy.  Good deal.

review/summary: Makes a cup of coffee taste like a candy bar, without the calories
review/text: If you haven't tried this product you really should buy a bottle and experience it for yourself.  I think that it is good enough that you won't miss the sugar.<br /><br />Water is so good for us, but so boring.  If you are trying to increase your consumption of water, try a little of this in the water.<br /><br />This product can also be used to make an Italian soda (a little syrup, a little cream, and some sparkling water).  Another yummy treat, if only they made a fat free cream it would be perfect.<br /><br />My husband and I have been buying this brand of sugar free syrup for years.  A pump of this syrup into your coffee changes it from a standard morning beverage into a liquid candy bar in a mug.  I recently switched from half and half to soy milk in my coffee.  With this syrup in my coffee the switch to soy milk was very easy.<br /><br />The ingredients in this product (listed in order) are as follows:<br /><br />Purified water<br /><br />Natural flavors<br /><br />Caramel color<br /><br />Potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate (to preserve freshness)<br /><br />Citric acid<br /><br />Xantham gum<br /><br />Sucralose (splenda brand)<br /><br />Acesulfame potassium<br /><br />Nutrition Facts label reads as follows:<br /><br />Serving Size:  1 oz.<br /><br />Servings per Package:  25.4<br /><br />Calories:  0<br /><br />Calories from fat:  0<br /><br />Total Fat:  0 g<br /><br />Sodium:  15 mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate:  0 g<br /><br />Sugars:  0 g<br /><br />Protein:  0g<br /><br />If you find that you like this product I would suggest that you order a pump for the bottle.  It allows you to dispense the same amount into your coffee without having to tediously measure.

review/text: This is surprisingly good, especially considering it is sugar-free. The chocolate flavor is very rich and is not overly sweet. If you love mochas, then you will love using this instead of chocolate syrup. Zero calories, zero fat, zero carbs and zero sugar... and it's delicious! I think the pumps are overpriced, so I use a cocktail jigger to ensure I put the same amount of syrup each time. I was worried this product would taste "fake", but it doesn't... RECOMMENDED.

review/text: My kids were chowing down on a box of these just now, when I decided to come see how much they cost on Amazon.  See, my kids LOVE these crackers -- we have tried almond, hazelnut, and pecan -- and I will happily let them snack on them.<br /><br />The review about the freshness packet was interesting... So I went and poured the entire contents of the box out on the table.  Our box only had one freshness packet, not multiple packets as has been the experience of the other reviewer.  I discarded the packet and let my kids keep snacking away!<br /><br />Now I am off to google what the contents of a freshness packet could be.  "Black and brown granules" could be something natural and completely harmless.  Or not.

review/text: My two crunchy snacks of choice for some time now have been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V3LC">Snyder's Butter Snaps Pretzels</a> and popcorn popped in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W4UP">Nordic Ware 60120 Microwave Popcorn Popper</a>. Blue Diamond Nut-Thins have pushed those two treats from the top of my crunch list. You simply cannot beat this cracker for mouth feel if you like plenty of snap, and the hazelnut flavor of this cracker is terrific. This cracker is great with dips, but it is so delicious, I usually prefer to eat it "as is," with nothing on it.<br /><br />At only 8 calories each, these crackers compare favorably to my mini pretzels, which are 5 calories each.<br /><br />Blue Diamond is known for nuts and products made with nuts, and they have two other nut flavors for these crackers besides hazelnut: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H154US">almond</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H154WQ">pecan</a>. Those two flavors are equally delicious.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Excellent product with one overwhelming problem
review/text: Tastes good, convenient, and gluten free. Purchased for $2/box at my local WholeFoods.<br /><br />The big problem is the oxygen-absorbing packets. I don't like these things in my food. I like the packaging otherwise, but I am a little disturbed after pulling multiple packets that say "do not eat" from my food. Yes, multiple "freshness packets" in a single box.<br /><br />Real food spoils, goes stale, etc., and we should not fear that fact. When I encounter too many chemical agents and artificial ingredients, I tend to stay away from the product and make my own instead. Sorry about the negative review, but little plastic packets should not be in boxes of food. I sliced open one of these packets, and what came out was fine black powder and brown granules.<br /><br />I am pleased that the Amazon product info page currently warns about these packets. The warning is also printed in tiny white letters on the tops of the boxes, although it should probably be listed near the ingredients for the benefit of consumers.

So, if you order from them, you will be paying at least 3x what you will anywhere else.  The bread is great, but not worth $18/loaf.  Buy from one of the other sellers who give a valid description.

review/summary: Not beautiful and not tasty
review/text: When you open the package, the dry tea bud look just the way they supposed to, but when you actually try to make a cup of tea, it turns into a disaster.<br /><br />1) The Appearance<br />Only the upper level of the leaves opens in the water, and the rest is tied to a tight mass that doesn't even soak properly. The result is that it doesn't really open, and takes full twenty minutes to sink to the bottom of the pot, and when it does, the open part does not necessarily face up. Consequently, instead of a beautiful flower, you get and unrecognizable mess in a pot.<br /><br />2) The Taste<br />Maybe it is because the leaves are tied too tight, maybe it is because the tea itself is old, but it tastes bad. For the first ten minutes of brewing there is no taste at all, and after that you get a kind of bland taste. I tried both green and jasmine and not only they both tasted bad, they tasted the same.<br /><br />It maybe a few bucks cheaper than the other options, but you certainly cannot serve anything like this to your guests, so it is pure waste of money.

review/text: I bought 10 Blooming Flower Tea - 5 Jasmine and 5 Green - Tea is very tasty but when I idipped them in cold water they didn't bloom! I've been in China recently and I've tried this kind of tea! So I know that a beautiful and kind of big flower blooms when the buds are in cold water!!!

review/summary: Tastes alright, presentation not as colorful as hoped.
review/text: The tea tastes decent (I have tried the jasmine so far), but I wasn't as thrilled by the presentation. I was expecting a breathtaking and colorful bloom. Instead, I poured the water over the tea ball, and it just floated lazily to the top. As the hot water soaked in, the bland colored tea leaves slowly opened and revealed...a wad of more bland colored tea leaves in the middle. It eventually sunk to the bottom and sat there looking like a hunk of pond weeds. The only color whatsoever was a few tiny pink petals that floated on the top of the water. Someone walked into the room and asked (with a trace of disgust), "What is that? A sea anemone?"<br /><br />So, if you just want to drink a delicate tea, these would be fine. But don't expect to the wowed by the blooming action.

review/summary: Fabulous...and perfect for camping!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTU2DO">Mc Cormick Recipe-Inspirations Garlic Lime Fajitas .32oz</a><br /><br />This is a hit with my family and when I needed something recently for unexpected guests.<br /><br />The package contains:<br />1 tsp McCormick minced garlic<br />1 tsp McCormick minced onions<br />3/4 tsp McCormick ground cumin<br />3/4 tsp McCormick oregano leaves<br />1/2 tsp McCormick cilantro leaves<br />1/2 tsp McCormick coarse ground black pepper (I love that they specified "McCormick" on each spice.)<br /><br />Add:<br />1/4 cup each lime and orange juices (fresh is best)<br />2 tbsp olive oil<br />1/2 tsp salt (I generally reduce this and it's fine)<br />1 1/2 lbs chicken breasts cut into thin strips (I usually use two pounds; we're big on leftovers)<br />1 each bell pepper and onion thinly sliced (again, I use 2 each)<br />flour tortillas<br /><br />The back peels off to make a perfect little recipe card complete with a picture and nutrition information, and each individual package of spice pops out labeled and sealed<br /><br />No MSG, no silicon whatever for anti-caking, or anything else questionable.<br /><br />The package contains a best by date, so you know if you've received old stock.<br /><br />I love that I can determine the amount of salt! I've had hypertension since my early twenties and packaged spice mixes are often sodium landmines.<br /><br />As I'm planning an upcoming car camping trip, this is definitely one of the meals we'll have. I don't need to take 6 bottles of spices. We always have salt and oil. I'll cut the chicken breasts into strips at home and freeze them in a big Ziploc bag as flat as possible for easy thawing at the campsite, but they'll also help with temp management for the "meat and dairy" cooler in the meantime. The big Ziploc bag will also be my marinating container. Throw a couple limes, an orange, two bell peppers, a huge vidalia sweet onion, and a package of tortillas in the "fruit, veggie and bread" cooler. Add a bag of shredded cheese to the "meat and dairy cooler." I'll pre-slice the bell peppers and onion at home and pack them together in another big Ziploc bag for space management. It's a one dish meal, absolutely a camping requirement. It's great without the tortillas for the low-carb set. And the directions are right there, so maybe I can get a night off from camp kitchen duties!<br /><br />If I'm really ambitious, I will make pico de gallo at home: a couple or three fresh tomatoes diced and drained for a bit, another vidalia sweet onion diced fine, one or two serrano peppers finely minced, chopped cilantro to taste and lime juice. This is best within a day or two of being made and will keep longer if the tomatoes are more drained than not. I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ASAIRQ">Lock & Lock Shrink-wrap 3.7 Cup Square Value 2 Pack Storage</a> to store this in for freshness and to ensure absolutely NO leakage. I'll put this in the "fruit, veggie and bread" cooler. The colder "meat and dairy" cooler would ruin the tomatoes. I make lots because some people love this with chips too.<br /><br />Obviously, with the exact amount of each spice specified on the package, you can buy each spice in bulk and replicate this combination far more cheaply, but sometimes convenience trumps frugality.<br /><br />Don't forget the Cholula. Some like it hot!

review/text: I'm always leery of buying seasoning mixes because of the monosodium glutamate, weird sugars, and unpronounceable ingredients. I don't like buying the individual spices because by the time I get back to using them, they will probably be way out of date. With these "inspirations" from McCormick, I don't have to measure and I've got exactly the spices I need. I hope this product will stay around.

review/text: I was looking for a selection of k-cups but having commitment issues. I just couldn't bring myself to commit to buy 24 cups of Vanilla Creme or Toffee or a certain decaf blend, without actually knowing what it tasted like. And the pre-packaged mixed selections already had half the flavors I wasn't interested in. This is an ingenious idea! I just ordered a wide selection of exactly what I wanted to taste. Ordered it Saturday, the seller emailed me back within two hours of receiving my order email, and mailed it out Monday morning. Package received Wednesday. Great service, all the flavors I want to try. Can't recommend this enough to folks!

review/summary: Best quality. *Pure* Almond Butter
review/text: This almond butter does not have the frequently added sugar and other ingredients.  it is pure and made in small batches with care and great attention to quality.  I've been reading labels carefully and noticed one of my favorite crunchy almond butters used sugar as well as other oils.  So I first found this looking for a sugar-free almond butter  (Peanut Butters are also famous for slipping in sugar too! health havoc!) So I got the first jar. On first tasting this, it might seem a tad bland by comparison but that is like a piece of fruit would not seem sweet if you've been eating white sugar.  Once the palate chills out and tastes what pure tastes like, I could not accept substitutes. This is the real thing.  It's a regular afternoon snack ...get one of those apple splitters, a spreading knife and boom! Health. Raw, alive, pure.  Because I liked this almond butter and this company's Tahini so much, I looked for other products and read up on them.  It's a company worthy of supporting because they genuinely care and put their best forward.

review/summary: Freekeh Rissotto - Delicious and Nutritious
review/text: This is the first time I've had Freekeh and it was excellent! I will now stock my pantry with it as a staple. It's low in calories, high in fiber and high in protein -- and also high in flavor. The Risotto I made with the Freekeh was low-cal and low-fat but tasted amazing and kept me full for a very long time. That's a winning combination in my book.<br /><br />Low Cal Freekeh Risotto<br />------------------------<br />1 Tblsp Olive Oil<br />1 Large Onion, course chopped<br />1 tsp Dried Ground Sage<br />2 cups Freekeh<br />1/2 Cup White White (Pinot Grigio is excellent)<br />1 (standard large size) Box of Low Sodium Chicken Broth (or Vegetable Broth if you're a vegan.)<br />1/2 Cup Fresh Shredded Parmesan<br />2 Tblsp Fat Free Cream Cheese<br />15 Spritzes of spray butter substitute<br />2 Cups Cubed, Cooked Butternut Squash (to keep this simple you can buy the pre-cubed stuff at the grocery store)<br />1 Cup Frozen Sweet Peas (thawed)<br />In a very large skillet, over medium heat, cook onions in the olive oil until tender (cook longer if you'd like them caramelized.) Add the Freekeh and Sage to the pan and "toast" the Freekeh with the cooked onions for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add white wine and stir until the wine has been completely absorbed. Add enough broth to completely cover the Freekeh. Stir and allow to simmer until the broth has been mostly absorbed. Add about another cup of broth, stir, simmmer...continue this process, adding about a cup of broth at a time, until the Freekeh begins to release its starches and looks creamy. This will take about an hour. (If you run out of broth before the desired consistency has been achieved, start using warm water instead of broth.) Turn off heat. Immediately add Parmesan, cream cheese and spray butter. Mix in thoroughly until cream cheese has melted. Now gently fold in your vegetables and allow to sit for a minute or so to bring veggies up to temperature. Makes 6 servings.

review/text: My 2 MinPins love these chews. They each get one of the small size every morning after their walk and will drive me nuts until they get them. Their teeth are very clean and their breath doesn't smell either. I buy them by the case from Value Pet Supplies. Really nice people to do business with.

review/summary: Dog loves them, but I hate the smell
review/text: I have a 70 pound lab mix, and he goes nuts for these treats. He'll devour one in less than 5 minutes, but it's awesome to see him so happy. However, they have a super strong odor, and I do not find them to be as appealing as he does. Recommended for dog's happiness, just hold your nose if you're sensitive to strong, funky, meat-like smells.

review/summary: Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor
review/text: My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

review/text: I have a VERY picky 9.5 yr old German Shepherd that leaves anything but a milkbone on the floor to collect dust.  She LOVED this bone!!!  I was amazed to see her crunch it up the large bone so quickly!  She's always been very well disciplined until these bones arrived at least.  She went into my pantry and tore the bag open and ate 7 bones!!!  She had such a low hung head when I approached her about the issue all I could do was laugh!!!  Luckily, my 4 month old shephard got one before her sister ate the batch!)  I save about $5 ordering the bones on Amazon.

review/summary: Ithing and chewing on paws
review/text: I first purchased a pack of Nutri Dent puppy chews for my Welsh Terrier when he was just a few months old. He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these.

review/text: Believe everything you read here, folks. This stuff really IS that bad. The product smelled rancid from the moment it was opened and did not taste any better. What's worse, you can't help inhaling the stuff when you sprinkle it over your popcorn and it BURNS your nose and throat. For this reason, you might consider using it as a means of self-defense should you run out of pepper spray. Either that, or you can sprinkle it in the garden as a critter repellent. All I know is you can't eat it. I actually purchased the product a while ago, before anyone had posted any reviews about it. Had these 1-star reviews existed at the time of my purchase, I can assure you that I would have never placed the order. Just out of curiosity, I visited this page to see if any reviews had been posted since my purchase to find out if I was alone in my initial assessment of it. I see now that I definitely was not. Kernel Season's, please discontinue all sales of this toxic dust.

review/text: I love wehani, have eaten it for years and go out of my way to find/buy it.  Have never had a guest who didn't love it too - my experience has been that people who don't care much for brown or white rice often clean their plate and ask for more.<br /><br />I'm a rice eater, and have a preference for simple preps.  Typically it's just steam and serve as a side dish.  It is a bolder and more complex flavor than many rices are, so I tend to serve it with red meat or pork, not chicken or fish.  That said, it's spectacularly beautiful and really yummy.

review/summary: Not the same as the Junket ice cream mix
review/text: I thought I was rebuying the Junket ice cream mix I've used forever and love.  I should have looked more closely as this is a different mix.  I'm sure I've used this in the past in my ice cream maker  and even noticed the custard label, but my first batch tonight didn't turn out as expected.  It did freeze, but didn't seem to expand all that much so I ended up with no more than three cups of frozen dessert instead of four and the texture was a bit grainy.  It is okay, but no more than that.  I compared the box to the remaining box of the ice cream mix and find that is heavier so although I haven't yet compared ingredients, I know the mix is not the same.<br /><br />Now this may be great when used as intended and I'll try that and update, but as an ice cream mix it's rather disappointing.

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: I have been gradually replacing many of the products I feed my family (and myself) with more natural and healthy alternatives.  Not a huge cookie fan, I still purchase them from time to time for sack lunches or a quick, sweet treat in the evening with a cup of hot tea. The combination of granola and dark chocolate was appealing to me so I put them in my shopping cart last week for us to try.<br /><br />On the plus side, the cookies are large, relatively lo-calorie, better nutrition than "regular" cookies and very filling.  I found that I only wanted one cookie versus needing two to feel satisfied.  On the negative side, I found them to be a bit dry and the taste not quite sweet enough for me.  Since I usually have a cookie with tea, the dryness wasn't too much of a factor but they aren't something I would eat without the hot drink.  I also purchase the peanut butter creme cookies from this same manufacturer and have the boxes side by side on my pantry shelf.  The peanut butter cremes are almost gone and this box is still 2/3s full.  Not bad, but I enjoy some of my other choices better.-

review/text: YES ONE COOKIE IS ALL YOU NEED, AND THE KIDS LIKE THEM TOO. SWEET AND FILLING.  MUCH MORE APPETIZING and SATISFYING THAN FAKE COOKIES (i.e. ahoy)

review/summary: The very best cookies but expensive
review/text: These cookies were delicious but a bit soft for my taste.  I toasted them in the over to crisp and it is more than great.  I bought my first box at WalMart and decided to find it in the web.  Very shocked that the price variation is about $9 considering that shipping cost is involved.  Worth the price but not a daily staple.

review/text: I hold a gumbo cook-off every year and host approximately 1000 people.  I like to have gumbo file powder available on the tables and sure couldn't afford the $11.95 per 1/2 oz. they sell in the grocery and specialty stores.  This product filled the need perfectly....with great taste and a price I could afford.  Thank you Frontier Natural Brands.
