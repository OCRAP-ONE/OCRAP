review/summary: Best Food EVER
review/text: I was really tired of going through all of the recalls & not knowing if or when either my dog or myself was going to get sick! I have bought the best dog foods on the market literally and nothing even came close to making my very picky Australian Cattle Dog happy. Then a friend suggested that I try Annamaet.  The day I took it out of the mailbox, he started jumping up & down bumping the box with his nose - I figured that he was only trying to amuse me.  So, we did the usual routine: Take a little of the food put it in the bowl & see if I get the evil stare, bent ears and disgusted look as if to say "Really, are you kidding me?" Not this time! When he saw that I had some of that wonderful smelling food in my hand, he immediately sat down and barked - he actually ate it out of my hand. His coat is incredibly soft & shiny and he looks great.  Also, he does not shed or blow his coat hardly at all like a normal blue heeler. I can not say enough about this food - I only wish that there was a store that sold it in my state, but that's ok - I will continue to order through amazon.

review/summary: Fishy, smelly and greasy
review/text: I am spoiled because I caught, marinated, smoked and packaged my own salmon in the NW for years. I ordered the small packages for stocking stuffers for the holidays. I live in Louisiana (although salmon do not migrate to the Gulf) these days but salmon can be purchased semi-fresh all season. Should have bought some fillets and smoked them myself. I do know why it so overpriced it is a very easy process and never had a bad batch.<br />This Alaska salmon I purchased is (without going into details) would make a nice pet treat or crab bait after sampling it...I would not give it as a gift. Nice, authentic style packaging...gives you a star. But I trust Amazon, however I do not believe it was sampled by anyone in QA.<br /><br />Jim Kansier<br />New Iberia, LA

review/summary: Incredible products!
review/text: I am so happy to see these carried on Amazon. I have been buying them from my local health food store, but I am going to start buying them in bulk here.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I buy very few processed foods. I make nearly everything from scratch including: pasta, bread, tortillas, crackers, ground meat, baked goods, marshmallows, etc. I feel like I have very high standards for grocery items. The only reason I even tried these was that I have a ton of respect for Rick Bayless. I have several of his cookbooks and I have enjoyed many awesome meals and learned a ton from them.<br /><br />Anyway I have tried 4-5 varieties of these pouches: the red enchilada, the green enchilada, the fajita, and the beef taco. All four of them blew me away! To the point where I actually wonder if I should even bother with making any of it from scratch anymore.<br /><br />Take my word for it.... these are totally worth the money! I will always keep them on hand.

As with any coffee good drinking water is the key ingredient to perfecting a great cup of coffee. Hence, lousy water, lousy coffee. I try to stick with distilled water to make my coffee or invest in a good countertop water filter to at least get the lousy chlorine out of the water. But for those of you who are lucky enough to have excellent well water you probably won't have to bother with distilled or filtered water. Lucky you!!

The aroma while brewing awakens me clear in the bedroom as its' set using the built in timer. My first cup and that was it ! Although I still like a strong dark French roast, this medium roasted Cameron's Toasted Southern Pecan is now my favorite brew. The Aroma and Flavor is GREAT ! I would like to try some other roast by Cameron's, but I can't seem to make a change since I like this soooo much ! Really good coffee !

review/summary: My Favorite-Cameron's Toasted Southern Pecan Coffee
review/text: This is the only coffee I've bought for a few years.  I grind the beans myself and make it strong with a little half-and-half.  The flavoring is not necessarily noticeable, you might think that it is an unflavored coffee.  It tastes smooth and creamy, not bitter.  I prepare this coffee the same way when my parents visit and they ask, "Why is your coffee so good?"  So I now give them bags of this coffee for gifts.  I prefer the whole-bean coffee, I think it tastes fresher.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars - the smell is much less when the coffee is ready, the beans themselves smell much stronger and better. But over all it is pure pleaser and I am now a returning customer. We live in the Dominican Republic and when I first have ordered this coffee beans, my husband was very irritated, said - we live in the coffee republic, to order coffee via Internet is equal as to try selling snow to Greenland. But now he is the first one, who reminds me that our coffee stock is coming to an end and we need to order some more.

review/text: I was unable to buy the particular brand of Southern Pecan coffee locally that I've bought for years so started researching on Amazon for a replacement.  Read the various customer reviews and this brand seemed to be the perfect choice.<br /><br />This is what I've found since purchasing it:  The coffee is very weak in flavor, watery in taste and........when you grind more coffee beans to compensate........it doesn't improve.  No creamy, rich flavor - not even close.<br /><br />For my money, I will never buy this coffee again.  It's just not worth it.

It's a little salty for my taste.  Water it down.  So, one package suggests 2 gallons of water...I would add an additional gallon of water.  Or whatever you like to get it just right.<br /><br />But it is awesome, it's got the aroma of Pho, it's semi-oily at the top of the broth...I mean...good, good, good!!!

I've gone to many restaurants and even some of their pho does not meet my expectation....only a few select restaurants actually does.  First time I found VV Foods' Pho base was in an asian store.  Unfortunately, they don't always have it in stock.  I guess someone else found out the "secret" base as well.  I called up VV Foods and they said that I can order directly through them or through Amazon.  Best Pho base ever.  Even if you can't cook, this pho base will make you a pro.

review/summary: Awesome Pho
review/text: I've been trying to make beef Pho at home for several months now with zero success. I finally did some extra searching when looking for some type of Pho base and found this. I read the reviews and ordered instantly.<br />It's so good. It's as good as our local restaurant. I followed some advice such as using less base so I made a gallon and used 4oz (5oz or half jar is what it calls for) or base and one spice packet. I let the spice packet boil for about an hour. I tasted it after the first boil as the instructions say but it didn't have as much flavor as I like.<br />My whole family loved it.<br />The only thing is I used rice stick noodles that weren't very good. I've tried thin rice noodles but those were about the same as the sticks. My local restaurant uses rice noodles that are very soft and look close to an angel hair pasta size. Maybe I'm not cooking the rice noodles long enough because they didn't get as soft as I like.

I make two batches out of these and it makes a lot. I can also freeze any extra broth for later use.  I don't follow the directions regarding the onion and ginger.  I just simmer one seasoning packet for an hour to really pull out the spicy flavor, then I add half the paste mix.  Serve with the traditional pho ingredients.  YUM.

review/summary: Just like Pho Vung Tau!
review/text: I fell in love with Pho on the east coast and when I moved to Texas one of the saddest moments was realizing there was no Vietnamese restaurant. I could not even get some of the spices in the recipes I found online. I tried five different times to make it from scratch, or from other Asian mixes, etc. and failed miserably.<br /><br />THIS IS IT! It's perfect. It tastes JUST LIKE the Pho at Pho Vung Tau... a perfect broth. JUST GREAT. With beef, chicken, or seafood, and romaine, sprouts, rice noodles plus fish, hoisin, limes and srichia (sp?) sauce, it's amazing!! I introduced this dish to my neighbors and Texas family and they're all Pho addicts now too. Especially fun with sweet fish dip and Chun's shrimp spring rolls. :) Can't say enough how great this stuff is if you love Pho and want to have it at home.<br /><br />Did I mention this is VERY YUMMY???? I wish I could post a picture to show how incredibly *pretty* this broth is when it's completed - such a rich color with a great sheen.<br /><br />A-plus!

review/summary: Check the expiration date on bottom of jar.
review/text: Altho this is a good pho base to make at home, however, the expiration is not visibly outside on the box but on the bottom of the jar inside the box.  I bought a couple of these from a local store and have been using them last week.  Just now I notice that they have expired three months ago.  I checked the box and see no dates so I made a call to VV Foods asking why expiration is not outside on the box instead.  The lady told me that the FDA's law that they have to have an expiration date stamped on the bottom or on the lid of the jar and not the outside packaging.  Also,  it's the store's responsibility to check and rotate the products.  She then educate me that consumers have the right to open the boxes to check on expiration dates and take back to store for refund if products expired.  Uh, each box contains 2 spice packages inside and for a customer to open the boxes up just to get a non-expired product would look very weird and even a waste of time.  And really made no sense at all.<br /><br />What if you buy from online because they're not available at local stores?  I don't think it would be a problem with Amazon to refund and/or resend but if it is Amazon's responsibility to open up the packaging to check for expiration dates before sending them to their customers would cause a problem in their shipping lines.

review/summary: Best Granola I've Ever Found
review/text: I'm not a fan of granola by any means: at least not until now. I have tried making my own on many occasions but the mess, expense, amount of ingredients to keep on hand and the less than satisfactory results have pretty much turned me off. I purchased this product in 3 flavors as a last ditch effort: Cherry Walnut, Almond and Maple Walnut. They arrived together in 2 days, well packaged, fresh and crunchy. Did I mention FLAVORFUL? I am a true convert. This is the best. While I like all 3, my favorite is the Maple Walnut, followed by the Almond and then Cherry Walnut (mostly because the huge dried cherries taste more like golden raisins than cherries, but still very good. I should also mention that while the dried cherries are about the size of the bowl of a teaspoon and look like they are soft and pliable, they are very hard and take a lot of careful chewing, after which they become sticky. I didn't find that texture pleasant). And when the ingredients listed walnuts or almonds, I figured it would be microscopic smooshed up pieces mixed in so small I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a sesame seed and a piece of walnut or almond.  BUT, the almonds are large pieces or whole almonds while the walnuts - well, the walnuts are planet-sized: sometimes 1/2 of an entire walnut and there are tons of them in a single bag of this granola. The maple walnut is the only one I find a bit on the sticky side, but not like caramel popcorn sticky-just a bit tacky. I've already used this in yogurt, cottage cheese, oatmeal, as a snack in mid afternoon, in salads, pancakes and yesterday morning, I made Bisquick biscuits and added some of all 3 flavors as an experiment. The biscuits were marvelous. Now, if I could only remember WHAT I did so I can make them again with the same success! Try this. I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you are, you can send it to me!! :)

review/summary: Nice Idea but...
review/text: It seemed like a good idea. Buy in bulk and save some cash, but as it were being shipped it must have warmed up and cooled down. Many of them were stuck together, and colors rubbed off on each other. There was a 2lb mass of beans in the box! Also, beware and don't freak out because the package consists of a cardboard box and jelly beans. No plastic inside the box, no paper lining, nothing. Kind of creepy, but I'm not dead yet, so it must be okay.

review/text: Really liked the 10 flavor sour mix from Jelly Belly, but couldn't seem to find them locally anymore.  Now they are selling the sour mix as a 5 flavor mix.  Was concerned following the other review about beans sticking together, but decided it'd be worth it to have 10 flavors.  Box arrived and they were stuck together, but only 5 flavors.  A waste of my time.  Never would have ordered if product had been described correctly by the seller.  Just drive to the store and get the 5 flavor mix that's not already stuck together.

review/summary: Natural ingredients
review/text: I ordered the Teisseire for making mai-tais after noticing that the Collins orgeat I had been using didn't even list almonds as an ingredient. When it came I had my family do a blind taste test for me. It actually tastes pretty similar to the Collins, both are sweet and taste like almonds. But the Teisseire has an additional nutty or earthy flavor that the Collins does not. It's made from almond extract, not just flavoring, and sugar, not corn syrup, and nothing with a scary chemical name.<br /><br />It does cost almost twice as much, plus shipping, but it takes me months to go through a bottle so it's worth it for me. It has a very nice pour spout that eliminates the crusty buildup you get on a screw-top bottle like Collins. My only complaint is the metal container. You can't see how much is left, and I think glass would be less likely to impart a taste. Right now there is no metallic taste at all, but in six months who knows?<br /><br />Note that the Amazon listing is wrong in a couple ways. The bottle is metal, not plastic, and the name is spelled "Teisseire." Yes, I know it looks plastic in the photo, but it really is metal shaped like that.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: As far as I can tell this is the only "all natural" orgeat available on Amazon.  Here are the ingredients: sugar, water, fructose, almond extract.  Great but how does it compare to the other orgeats?  The only other one I have on hand at the moment is from Fee Brothers.  The Fee Bro. while being pretty good does come across as more "almond-like" than just tasting like actual almonds.  It's almost too sharp.  The Fee Bro. orgeat does contain some orange flavor (again "orange-like" not actual orange).  Teisseire's orgeat  tastes like almonds and it comes through nicely in the cocktails I tried it with (Mai Tai and Japanese).  It doesn't have the orange or rose water that orgeats traditionally have but even without that it tastes better than Fee Brothers'.  The lack of orange water makes it 4 stars instead of 5.

review/text: I recently purchased this orgeat, as well as two other orgeats available on Amazon: Monin and Ferrara. I tried them in various cocktails and Teisseire came in last--a distant last--in every test. Compared with the other two it is thin and its flavor is too weak to stand up to other ingredients in a drink. I do give it bonus points for the nice bottle and pour spout, but it's certainly not worth its price and I do not recommend it for cocktail enthusiasts.

review/text: I ordered the Stephanotis Variegata (Madagascar Jasmine Variegated) from<br />Emerald Goddess Gardens on September 24, 2012 and it arrived 4 days later on September 28.  The plant arrived in healthy condition in a 4" plastic pot.<br /><br />It is a vine or stem attached to a bamboo stick and it is about 25" tall.  It has 24 leaves which are medium/dark green with white edgings and occasional white patterns.  Leaves measure 2 1/2 " to 3" in length and about 1" in width.<br /><br />It is very pleasing plant and a good sized one.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />Here are general directions for growing as a houseplant in the North.<br /><br />1. Give bright light. Avoid strong sun. The light of early morning sun is fine.<br />2. Minimum temperature is 40 degrees.<br />3. Let the soil dry between waterings.<br />4. Flowers from May to September.<br />5. Avoid sudden temperature changes and cold drafts.<br />6. During winter, keep the soil on the dry side as the plant rests. Keep temperatures cool.

review/text: I have to admit, that Glico sometimes have made some exceptional snacks with their Pocky range, such as their Pocky Strawberry, which is a blast. With this milk chocolate version, I was not so impressed.<br /><br />The idea is the same: pretzel stick dipped in chocolate. It is not as sweet as some, so those who do not like sugar-induced psychosis will appreciate these snacks.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is ok, but I found myself rather quickly bored with them. Other varieties of Pocky were much more interesting. Having said that, they make a great reading snack, as they do not leave your fingers covered in garbage, and your pages stay clean.<br /><br />Not a bad snack, but a little boring for me.

The best of Jaffa Cakes and available locally!<br /><br />The middle is an orange flavored jelly and the outside is a dark chocolate coating. They are not super sweet but that's what makes them tasty. They are semi-tart orange with the deep flavor of the chocolate. A perfect combination.<br /><br />The chocolate can look cloudy or scuffed when taken out of the bag but I believe it's because they get tossed around inside. If you want a perfect chocolate finish, you have to buy them individually packed.<br /><br />I picked up a 2 lb bag at BJs for $10.

review/text: The pieces of fruit were ripe, flavorful, firm, not "water logged" and mushy like some canned fruit I've tried. The light syrup is only fruit juice, not the typical light or heavy corn syrup which I was quite grateful to find. The reason I did not give 5 stars is there is an approximate 65 to 35 ratio of fruit to juice. It is listed as 4 servings, but it was one cereal sized bowl for me, including juice. Granted I should have made it 2 servings considering the calories, but to make 4 servings you would need to use the small custard bowls which would not satiate me. I wish they had an organic version (yes, I've tried Native Forrest and I thought it was mushy). I will reorder until I find another organic version I like. I have bought other Roland organic and non-organic products that I have enjoyed, so I consider this brand trustworthy.

review/text: If you want a fruit salad that tastes like you've just chopped it, this is what you need to buy.  I bought a case for my husband when he was ill and he ate a can a day for months.  If you want to make it a light meal, just add almonds, pecans or walnuts and some orange and grapefruit slices and place on a bed of spinach.  I made a very light topper with sour cream, sugar free whipped cream, a little of the juice from the can and a tiny bit of nutmeg.  This can be adjusted to taste.  If you ever order this, you will order over and over and never get tired of the fresh taste.

review/text: These are great, healthy, grab and go packs of nuts.  I'm a almond and pecan fan; these are a lot woodier or nuttier than I'm used to, and a little dry.  However, it's good to mix it up every once in a while.  These are about twice the size of a "100 calorie pack".  The variety inside each pack is ok, seems a little peanut and hazelnut heavy though.  I'm glad I tried this, but will not be purchasing again.  I'm going for the 100 calorie almond packs instead.  Good packaging, great to grab and go, just not my cup of tea.

review/text: First off, I love these things.  They taste great and each bag contains just enough to satisfy.<br /><br />However, my latest purchase consisted of only 12 bags per box - not 18 (so I'm paying a whole lot more for 30% less than when I originally bought these).<br /><br />Please be aware of this before you buy.

review/text: The "Nuts to Go" package is very convenient and somewhat healthy, however, the ratio of Peanuts is too high compared with the other varieties in the package. Also peanuts are a "Legume". It would be nice to have more of the other varieties of "nuts."

review/summary: vegan dog
review/text: I've been feeding my dog Evolution for a couple years now. I wasn't sure if it was a good idea at first, but my veganism made me do it! If there had been any adverse effects, I would've taken her off right away. I'm not going to subject my dog to my own moralism if it does her harm. The first thing I noticed was that she dove right into her new kibble, so it passed the taste test. Of course, I slowly transitioned her from her other food. As time passed, it seemed that 2 cups total of dry food per day were enough to maintain her weight. I suppose this implies Evolution is very concentrated? She averages between 60-63 lbs throughout the year. I feed her only once in the evening, adding enough water to the kibble to make it stewy. Instead of giving her treats, I merely give her a small handful of kibble out of the two cup total once or twice a day. My dog is now twelve going on thirteen and just passed her senior checkup (blood work, stool and urine check, etc) with flying colors. I don't dare tell the vet what I've been up to. I don't think she'd approve. I let the checkups speak for themselves.

review/summary: Best Dog Food You Can Buy!
review/text: My dogs have been eating Evolution for about the past 5 years. People always remark about how gorgeous their coats are and ask me what I do, that I must brush them and bathe them all the time. I do neither. People also can't believe my older dog is 9 because she looks and acts so young. They still love the food after all this time. I usually mix in a little canned, which Evolution also sells. The only thing I wish for that could improve it would be for it to be organic.

review/summary: Excellent healthy dog food!
review/text: I have 2 Chihuahuas - The first one I got as a puppy 9 years ago and the second one I got from a rescue a few years ago when she was already 7 years old.  I started feeding Evolution to my first dog at least 6-7 years ago when I first found out about it.  I've been a vegetarian for 10 years, so I wanted a healthy option for my dog, too! :-)  It disgusts me to know what ingredients are in other dog foods, and I can't fathom feeding that to my dogs.  My theory is if I wouldn't consider eating it, why would I feed it to my dogs?<br /><br />My first dog has always had a smooth shiny coat that gets many compliments from vets and others, she never smells bad or "dog-like", and her breath is never bad.  It actually smells good.  I attribute all that to Evolution.  Being 9 years old, she still acts like a puppy.  She is full of energy and very healthy.<br /><br />My second dog, when we first got her, was smelly and her coat was very rough.  Since she switched to Evolution, all that has changed.  She doesn't smell bad, neither does her breath, and her coat has gotten much softer and healthier-looking.  Now only if Evolution could stop her from shedding... :-)<br /><br />Overall - I'm expecting that my dogs will live happy and healthy lives from eating Evolution pet food, and I'm so glad this product is available!

review/text: My pets (2 Dog and 2 Cats) have been on Evolution Diet for 8 years. Both my dogs and my cats love the food and have been on it since they were 4 months old. My younger cat was very sick when I brought her home and I was nervous about putting her on a vegei diet until she was well. My Vet uses this product and recommended that I switch right away because it's such a high quality food. Once I put her on Evolution she had a speedy recovery. Everyone that has had contact with my pets have made comments on how beautiful their fur is.

review/text: This is a very healthy dog food.  There are no by-products in this food.  It is vegetarian and it is very healthy for dogs.  I personally think dogs will live longer by eating this type of food.  In fact, Evolution company has testimonials from owners about how the dogs actually live longer and are healthier. If you love your dog, get this food.  You and and your dog won't regret it. When dogs eat this food after a period of a week or two, I have seen a major difference in the softness and shine of their coat.<br /><br />Peace and Happiness,<br /><br />Patrick Leonardi

review/summary: Can't hurt, could (has) helped.
review/text: My family and several friends have benefited from daily use of this tea. I can't say it "cures" cancer....but I have personally seen very positive results in a young boy who was literally being eaten up with numerous tumors...in the brain, spine and legs. After numerous surgeries to remove what tumors that could be safely operated on, the boy's doctors felt they could do no more and advised the family it was "only a matter of a few months" before some would grow back or others grow bigger. Family members knew of others who were currently using this tea, and optimistically got the boy started on a daily regimen of drinking (3 oz) twice daily.  The boy's surgeries were done in 2006/2007. Today the boy is doing well,has returned to school part time, is walking again(after surgeries he was wheelchair bound), and is slowly regaining his health. Progress is slow, but it's progress. The tumors have not returned or grown, in fact the remaining ones are slowly shrinking. So, who knows?<br />A side benefit that I personally saw as well as they boy mentioned above, is the results I saw in my own father who had emphysema/asthma.  His nighttime breathing was extremely noisy, worse than snoring.  Within about 2 weeks of drinking this tea, my mother woke in a panic one night because it was so silent in their bedroom.  She thought my father had stopped breathing.  Not so.  His breathing had silenced down to normal and even during the day his breathing was much easier and quieter.<br />So, does it help?  You decide.  Does it hurt?  Not at all.  And, it tastes similar to alfalfa tea, so it's easy to take.<br />You can find better prices than the one here, though. Check [...]  for other outlets.<br />This is where the herbs are grown:[...]<br />Learn more about the developer of the tea:[...]  CAVEAT: When I contacted this site to ask about buying the tea, they are selling exactly what the nurse who developed it said NOT to drink....a serum/drops or a brew already made up. They are trying to sell it as a 3 week "treatment" for a very exorbitant price.  Not at all what the nurse intended.  So BEWARE!

review/text: I can't believe that no one has ever reviewed the magical Flower Of The Ocean sea salt.  I say magical, because I never believed that salt could so powerfully transform food the way that this Celtic Sea Salt does for me.  I've been using it for a few years because a couple of my friends were using it after seeing a nutritionist who highly recommended it.  I think this is because it is much higher in minerals and other trace elements from the ocean.  I use it while cooking as well as sprinkling on top of food when it is ready to be eaten.  I just roasted some organic beets.  I sprayed them with olive oil and then sprinkled the salt on top and it truly tasted different than when I used to make this with regular table salt.  There is a definite flavour to this salt that is hard to describe.  That is why I call it magic.

review/text: I have a great amount of experience with water kefir; have been producing it at home for many years and enjoying the great health benefits gained from drinking it daily.  I wanted to share this experience with a friend and thought to bring DEHYDRATED grains with me on a visit to get her started.  I did not want to travel a lond distance with wet grains (I could have shared my own) and thought it would be easier to bring them dried.  The product description here states that they are dehydrated grains...NOT true.  What I received was a padded manila envelope, a ziploc baggy with about 1 to 2 teaspoons of some very badly crushed, wet grains (looked like they got squished by the postage cancelling machine used by the Post Office), and a photocopy of instructions.  Not as described or pictured in this listing.  The grains smelled bad and so far, have not been able to produce good quality kefir.  Who is the product manufacturer...Real Man of Genius? It is most certainly not Cultures for Health as pictured.<br /><br /> "Each Packet of Water Kefir Starter Culture Contains: 2 teaspoons Live active water kefir culture in a dehydrated state (will rehydrate to 3-4 tablespoons of water kefir grains; sufficient to yield 2-3 quarts of water kefir every 24-48 hours). For additional information on this product, please contact the manufacturer."

It came from another company in a different state.  I emailed CFH to tell them about this impostor and they were aware of it.  Why is Amazon allowing this? Anyway the grains were not dehydrated and there was not a sufficient amount (in my opinion) to get good kefir. I do not appreciate their false advertising. AMAZON, check this out!

review/summary: Live Water Kefir Grains
review/text: Ordering live grains (or anything else "live") online was a new experience.  I only hoped they would grow and produce a fine product; some of the reviews made me wonder.  Now that I've been using them for several weeks I am so pleased.  Since our milk kefir grew prodigiously I expected the same from the water grains.  When they didn't, I contacted the seller who personally answered questions, gave very detailed instructions, wanted feedback, and was very helpful.  For instance, the water kefir wants warmth -- a heating pad on the lowest setting works perfectly -- do not let the water get cold and I had done that. The process may take several days, longer than I thought -- using the taste test(often 5-6 days for our liking)works every time!  At this point I am able to keep two jars going; patience has been rewarded. Adding fruit, as apricots or strawberries, during or after gives a delicate and delicious flavor. The grains thrive and multiply, giving us a healthy and tasty beverage that also makes great smoothies.  Our thanks!  Kudos to the seller for excellent service and delivering a fine product.

review/summary: what the heck?! - a revised review
review/text: ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />Okay, what I received was not what I bought.  The shipper was not Cultures for Health, and despite the clear description of the product on the Amazon page, I received LIVE cultures, not the dehydrated grains that I thought I had purchased.  It feels very dishonest to me.  I bought this product because someone I trust recommended Cultures for Health dehydrated water kefir grains to me, as they had a good experience with them.  I am not pleased with this apparent duplicity!!<br /><br />I have brewed the water kefir anyway, and will see what results I get from the product.  So far, I have nothing to say (positive or negative) about the quality of grains (i.e., how well they brew, and whether they have longevity).  When that changes (positive or negative), I will weigh in again.<br /><br />REVISION:<br /><br />I have since brewed the water kefir, and it has produced a good product.  So, the grains are good.
