review/summary: A great little snack!
review/text: I ordered these lollipops as a low-cal treat for myself to help curb night-time eating.  I figured they would occupy my mouth without filling me with high fructose corn syrup.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the lollipops were just as tasty as described in previous reviews.  The fruit flavors are very refreshing and not overly sweet.  I will definitely be reordering once I've finished with this batch!

review/text: These suckers are just amazing.  So much better for them, taste great (I love them too!), and even though they more than regular suckers, we ration them out at our house (1 a day) and they last forever! I will keep buying these as long as they make them! :)

review/summary: hooray, good candy for my kids
review/text: Two of my children are on very restrictive diets. These lollipops are acceptable for thier diet...and they're awesome! All of us are candy-holics so we were sceptical, but they're awesome! Even the neighborhood kids who aren't thrilled with our health foods loved them. I didn't tell them they were healthy of course:)I was thinking they'd be a little bigger, but they're not too small. They're about the size of safe-t pops

review/summary: Cheeky Lemon is the only flavor I've tried
review/text: Good, but natural lemon flavor may be too strong for some. Unlike ordinary sugary lemon drops, these lemon drops pack a powerful dose of real lemon taste in a small candy. But they offer a truer lemon taste. Just don't try to eat them fast. Each drop are meant to be enjoyed until it completely dissolves and taste lingers in the mouth.

review/summary: Unpopular Candies for Halloween treat
review/text: These candies have different flavors and only 70 calories each.<br /><br />Also, they are organic.<br /><br />For Halloween this year, I purchased a 5 pound bag and left them out side.<br /><br />Hours later, I went out side to see if they were all gone and found only one third of the candies were taken.<br /><br />However, these are organic and taste good. Maybe, more kids will like them next year.

review/summary: These are Yummy......
review/text: These are very good...yummy. My first impression was GREAT flavor but a little on the sweet side. I'm a chocolate lover and don't usually eat lollipops unless they're the ones with the chewy chocolate center.  These lollipops changed my mind.  The flavors don't taste artificial like other lollipops I've had. I tried Mango Tango first...those are very, very good.  They're tied with Pomegranate Pucker as my favorites.<br /><br />YummyEarth Organic Lollipops are not round balls, but are flat, a little over an 1" in diameter & about 1/4" thick.  Everyone who's tried them has liked them. I'm thinking of buying a bag of the Yummy Drops for our long car trips.

review/summary: Why all the hype?
review/text: I've come across this item a few times, but I hesitated to order it. When it was the Deal of the Day I decided "why not?" and ordered the 150ct container. Quite honestly, they don't taste that special to me - a lot of the flavors compare with jolly-ranchers. The few original flavors aren't well represented in the mix. For example, out of the 150 lollipops I received, 106 were watermelon (yes, I counted - I was very bored). There were only 2 blueberry lollipops and 3 pomegranate and those were my favorite - they were new and had unique flavors; I can buy a bag of watermelon lollipops that compares with this for less than a quarter of the price! All in all, not my favorite candy. I've satisfied my curiosity by buying it once, but I won't re-order until the flavors are more varied - it can't be that hard to switch them up a bit! Better yet, just sell a bag full of the flavors that are less common.

review/summary: A truly delicious lollipop
review/text: These lollipops are great because they are sourced from good ingredients and do taste amazing. The flavor is a real shock and these have become a big hit at the office. Cherry seems the most elusive and popular as I'll find all the other flavors scattered on my desk by someone who snuck around to find one. I don't eat much candy anymore but these are a great treat for the office and everyone else loves them.

review/summary: Better than regular lollipops
review/text: I've been taste-testing these all day, and I can tell you they do taste better than the average lollipop candy you'd find at the kids' hair salon. I'm not naive enough to believe that every single part of this candy is organic and natural; however, if this lollipop is even half of what the two dad makers claim, then that is already many times better than the high fructose corn syrup craptacular lollipops on the market today. I found the taste of these YummyEarth much better, and if I have to choose this brand or a store brand, I'll pick this one.

review/text: I read the reviews and was influenced to try these suckers based on the positive reviews.  I don't necessarily buy all the organic hype about them.  I do like the fact that there are no chemical dyes in them though.  They all taste great to me.  They don't leave an unpleasant aftertaste and they are average sized.  Someone said they were really small.  I was expecting Dum Dum size, but they are flat and nearly full sized.  So, if you like to have hard candy around, these aren't a bad option.

review/summary: Flavors you receive may be different than product description!
review/text: This review is for the YummyEarth Organic Lollipops, Assorted Flavors, 30-Ounce Container.<br /><br />I'm only giving this a one-star, bad review until they change this description and get it right. Beware before you buy! I've been ordering these lollipops for 2 years now, and I LOVE them, I totally recommend them actually, but I am annoyed that the current item description vs. what you will receive in the mail IS DIFFERENT. How hard is it for someone to update this thing correctly? Someone's lazy or dropping the ball.<br /><br />Under *Product Features* it reads, "Mix of Sour Apple Tart, Pomegranate Pucker, Mango Tango, TooBerry Blueberry, Googly Grape, Strawberry Smash, Very Very Cherry, Wet-Face Watermelon".<br /><br />Then, under *Product Description* it reads at the beginning of the paragraph, "Includes: Pomegranate Pucker, Razzmatazz Berry, Cheeky Lemon, Orange Squeeze, Wet-Face Watermelon" and ends the paragraph again with, "Mix of Sour Apple Tart, Pomegranate Pucker, Mango Tango, TooBerry Blueberry, Googly Grape, Strawberry Smash, Very Very Cherry, Wet-Face Watermelon".  ???  So which is it??<br /><br />VERY confusing. Now, if you don't care what flavors you get, say you're just giving these away as Halloween candy, order away. But if you're like me, I look forward to having at least some certain flavors for myself and so I'm annoyed when what I'm expecting isn't what I get.<br /><br />I also used to be annoyed that the ratios of the variety mix were VERY uneven, you'd get like one apple and 25 blueberry lollipops (the worst flavor in my opinion), but they claim to be changing that. And apparently it depends on WHO you buy them from (yummy earth or a 3rd party vendor thru Amazon). I don't think product consistency and an accurate description, no matter who you buy it from, is too much to ask!<br /><br />This is also happening in the Vitamin C 30 oz container of pops as well. I ordered what I thought was the usual variety mix it claimed to be, and it arrived with now only having blueberry, razzmataz berry, and very cherry. Lame! Just get the desciption right and be consistent. It's not fair to order and pay for something you expect to get and then get something else. It's a hassle to complain, call customer service, write this stupid review, etc. and waste everyone's time. I'm only writing this to warn you and save someone else the trouble, and also get the description fixed.<br /><br />I personally think the best flavors are apple, strawberry and watermelon and I give the rest away. These have been my Halloween candy for three years now and are a big hit. But if this inconsistency continues I'm going to move on to some other natural/organic candy.

review/summary: "Assorted Flavors"  A Misnomer
review/text: I ordered this for my nieces & nephews as a healthier alternative to the high-fructose-corn-syrup--read "poison-"--laden candy that was on offer for the Halloween season.  I was very disappointed, however to discover that the variety was only nominal.  Of all the flavors, Watermelon was the most plentiful, overwhelming the rest of the others by a ridiculous margin, actual orders of magnitude!  I counted--yes, LITERALLY counted--only 5 pomegranate; 6 sour apple w/ the remaining flavors: grape; lemon; orange; berry; mango; etc,  coming in at around plus or minus 2 of those numbers.  The candy was a hit w/ my munchkins, it's true, but I felt cheated (and so did they) that there wasn't a better balance of flavors.  They got sick of the watermelon fairly quickly and were unhappy to learn that they couldn't all get each flavor.  Instead of solving a problem, it created a larger headache for their parents and me.  Caviat emptor.

review/text: I have triplets and they love these and wanted to pass them out for Valentine's Day. These are a better buy than the small packages you can find in the local stores. They received 75 yea's from their classmates and I only got 5 back at the end of the day. There were 3-4 that were broken or the sticks had detached from the candy disc. Those were the oops ones that I claimed, so it worked out well for me. Next year I'll buy an extra bin for home. Great deal!

review/text: So I read all the fantastic reviews of these lollipops and decided to give it a try. I had high hopes thinking it would make a great snack when you are having a sweet tooth. I though these would be more like sugared fruit pure made into lollipops. Nope. This is plain (organic I guess) sugar with a die from fruits and vegetables and "natural" flavors. Nothing too special for me.

review/summary: Can You Say...........YUM!!!!!
review/text: Not long ago at a very intense meeting a participant excused himself and returned with a large bag of lollipops. I thought he had slipped a cog; that the stress of the discussion had gotten to him. Wrong, he just wanted to inject a little levity: a breather. We were each told to "take a couple." Where upon he popped one in his mouth as did others near him. A smile appeared and not long afterword the issue on the table resolved itself. Now, I'm not saying that the lollipops worked a miracle. What they did was take the pressure down a notch and remind us all that solutions were at one time in our lives easier to find. And wow, did these flavor filled pops get our attention in a NY minute. These aren't your kiddie's pops. They are for adults, unless you care to share your goodies. Flavors are rich, full bodied and 70 calories a pop. Try one. You won't regret it.

review/summary: Sweets for your sweeties on Sweetest Day - October 18th!
review/text: Since I don't have a sweetheart (boo-hoo), on Sweetest Day, October 18th, I'm making little "Sweetie-Pie" gift baskets for my grand- and great-grandkiddies!<br /><br />Among the traditional offerings of Life-Savers, Gummi Bears, peanuts, little toys, and other goodies, I decided to add some of these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDK0D2">YummyEarth Organic Lollipops, Assorted Flavors, 150-Count Container</a>.<br /><br />NO! Not an entire jar per child! I'll divide them among the kids, and put a few aside for myself to lick while I'm reading another good book ... naturally.<br /><br />Even though these yummy little lollipops are certified organic, diabetics should eat them in moderation ... if at all. (It's always wise to ask your doctor.) Amazon's product description lists these added benefits, also: no chemical dyes; 100% Natural colors; 100% Natural flavors; real fruit extracts; 100% Vegan; allergen-free; GMO-free. soy-free; nut-free; gluten-free; wheat-free, and dairy-free.<br /><br />I think it's interesting that in addition to natural fruit extracts, the manufacturer uses red cabbage and purple carrots for color; meaning no artificial dyes or flavors. Another plus is that they're certified kosher by the Kof-K Kosher Certification.<br /><br />That said, I deducted one star because of the sugar content and will replace the star when they come out with a sugar-free product with the same healthy attributes.<br /><br />Of course, my grandchildren are sweet to begin with, but I feel "sweet" for satisfying their sweet-tooth with these YummyEarth lollipops. And what a choice they have: Pomegranate Pucker, Razzmatazz Berry, Cheeky Lemon, Orange Squeeze, and Wet-Face Watermelon.<br /><br />Since I'm such a "cheeky" grandmother, I chose Cheeky Lemon as my favorite, and set aside some of the Wet-Face Watermelon for my adult friends ... like you! And you! And you! Doesn't that sound like a "messy, gooey" taste treat? ... Mmmmmm ...<br /><br />Enjoy ... but do not open until October 18th!<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />author of The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley

review/text: I rarely write reviews but wanted to warn others of the affect these lollipops had on me. I've never had any stomach problems and can eat just about anything. However, every time I ate these lollipops, I would get a mild headache and feel nauseous. I really have no idea why but that's exactly what happened. I thought it was a fluke, waited a few days, then tried some more and had the same results. Some reviewers point out the fact that these are made in Mexico and I don't know for sure but wonder if that was part of the problem. Regardless, eat at your own risk.

review/text: There is certainly nothing wrong with these and they are a fine product; however, people should really be aware that the term "Natural Flavor" does not mean the flavoring is natural.  The flavoring is derived from natural sources via chemical means.<br /><br />Don't let it stop you from buying if you want some more natural source of sugar that has less refinement associated with it.

Its a hidden ingredient in many, many foods, just listed as "flavoring" or natural flavoring, as it is natural, from a tree in south America.

review/summary: These lollipops are incredibly addicting!
review/text: Before purchasing the 150 ct container, the only YummyEarth lollipop I'd had before was the mango tango. The mango tango tasted so incredibly good, I went for it and purchased the 150 count assorted flavors container so I could try different flavors. I was disappointed to find two flavors completely missing: strawberry smash and tooberry blueberry. That is a very minor complaint because the flavors in the assortment I received are all so incredibly delicious. I am not a fan of the strong taste of artificial colors and flavors that leave a horrible aftertaste in your mouth. That's what makes these YummyEarth lollipops so perfect. There is nothing artificial in them! Normally I hate the taste of sour apple and watermelon (for example: jolly ranchers). But, the YummyEarth wet face watermelon and sour apple tart flavors both taste fantastic! My favorite flavors out of the assortment are mango tango and pomegranate pucker. I think I am going to have to keep these around the house from here on out.

review/text: Certified organic and 100% natural flavors are nice but do they taste good? No, these lollipops taste G-R-E-A-T!<br /><br />My sons, ages 6 and 5, like the sour flavors - Sour Apple Tart, Pomegranate Pucker - while my wife prefers Mango Tango, Strawberry Smash and Very Very Cherry. Me? I like them all, and at 22 calories and less than 10 cents each, I can enjoy a YummyEarth lollipop every day as an afternoon treat without worrying about my diet or my wallet.<br /><br />My wife has shared these lollipops with a friend whose daughter is on a strict diet that avoids artificial colorings. YummyEarth lollipops are allergen-free; gluten-free; wheat-free; GMO-free; soy-free; nut-free; dairy-free with no chemical dyes. Even if you don't have allergies or special dietary needs, these will quickly become your favorite lollipops.<br /><br />After reading other reviews, I want to address the complaints about the distribution of flavors. Our shipment arrived as pictured, a plastic bin with 150 assorted lollipops. Yes, there are more of some flavors than others but that is the trade-off. You can order individual flavors on Amazon but the price per lollipop is higher than the assorted bins.<br /><br />In summary, YummyEarth lollipops are a tasty, guilt-free treat for everyone and a real blessing for parents with children on restrictive diets.<br /><br />UPDATE: These make great gifts for co-workers and for Halloween, too!

My favorites are probably Apple, Watermelon and Pomegranate.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: These lollipops are so tasty!  I love that different flavors such as mango and pomegranate are included, and even the "standard" flavors like cherry and grape are better than regular ones.  Not to mention that they don't have anything artificial in them! :)<br /><br />These candies are pretty small.  I believe 3 of them make one serving size, which is good because you can either eat another one if you want or just stick to one without feeling guilty about eating it!<br /><br />Also, the number of each flavor is roughly equal, but they aren't mixed up.  When I opened mine, all the grapes were in the front, the cherry behind those, etc.  I had to dump them all out to try apple D:  But once I dumped them out they were mixed up :D<br /><br />All in all, I think these lollipops are worth a try.  They taste good, come in new and different flavors (like mango and pomegranate), and are completely natural (even the color dyes!).  They definitely aren't worse than regular lollipops, so you might as well get these and save yourself from all the weird things that lollipops usually contain.

review/summary: Organic lollipops worth every penny!
review/text: I originally got these lollipops for when I work with autistic children since they are wheat and gluten free.  Not only that, but the flavors are all natural and free from dyes and are juice on a stick.  Our dentist tell us suckers are the worst possible candy for kids to eat since it sucks the sugar into the teeth, BUT when you really gotta have one, these are wonderful tasting!  My kids loved the blueberry best and were bummed there weren't more in the container.  I hear they are going to try and put even amounts in containers, but as others have said, you get what you get.  Still they are YUMMY!  I'll let you know how the next dentist visit goes!

review/summary: REAL fruit flavored lollipops! Feel good about giving them to your kids!
review/text: Finally, a lollipop without corn syrup, chemicals, artificial colors and flavors! Organic ingredients, fruit flavors, and natural colors are what I'm looking for. The best thing is these taste great too! Kids and adults both love these.  They also come in unique flavors not usually found in lollipops or hard candy, such as mango, watermelon, pomegranate and blueberry.

review/summary: They taste organic.
review/text: I love lollipops but I am also always trying to cut out calories, fat, sugar, and chemicals from my diet. These YummyEarth Lollipops had an interesting mix of flavors, had some natural sugars/ingredients, and were fairly low in calories (70 for 3). So I decided to try them.<br />I found all the flavors to be a bit sour. I expected Pomegranate Pucker and Sour Apple Tart to be sour but I thought the rest would be a bit sweeter since the first ingredient is Cane Juice - Sugar. These are a quality product and taste fine but I would NOT order them again. I like sour candy but these do nothing to curb my sweet tooth.<br /><br />-------<br />Sour Apple Tart- One of my favorites, tastes a bit like apple juice, and isn't nearly as sour as the name suggests.<br /><br />Pomegranate Pucker- I thought this tasted like a raspberry grape flavor. Definitely tart.<br /><br />Very Very Cherry- I don't normally care much for cherry flavor but this one is quite good. Tastes like those Minute Made Popsicle type things but less sweet more bitter.<br /><br />Googly Grape- Love the name. Reminded me of grape jolly ranchers (sour) but with a bit of grape juice flavor mixed in.<br /><br />Mango Tango- So pretty, one of the least tart, but very synthetic tasting. I have only ate one and it gave me a headache. My mom and sister enjoy this flavor though.<br /><br />TooBerry Blueberry- Good taste a bit tart but not much. It'd be nice if the white stripe were cream flavored but that wouldn't be very vegan.<br /><br />Strawberry Smash- Tastes like strawberry juice and has a good flavor to it but again tiny bit sour.<br /><br />Wet-Face Watermelon- I love love love watermelon but (you guessed it) not this one. It was sour and synthetic tasting.<br /><br />I would give this product more stars if a couple of the flavors had a touch more sweetness to them.

review/summary: Yummy Earth Organic Lollipops are super delicious
review/text: I love these lollipops! I am the purchasing coordinator for Organic Valley and I purchase them to give out at some of our outings and for handouts for our employees and their children. We all love them. Everyone loves the container that they come in also. They are a big hit here. I also purchase them for my two year old grandson who gets the container out of the cupboard and helps himself. He loves them! His mother takes them along with her on outings and he gets one if he is good. So glad that we have stay at home fathers that started this business so that we can have an organic choice.

review/text: I was eating hard candy to help me get pass the refrigerator and goodies, without pigging out!  I could not find good small lollipops anywhere, till I went on amazon.com<br /><br />The maker of this product actually made these small lollipops so his baby girl, so she wasn't eating lots of sugar and additives, in other lollipops.  The fact that they are organic, was an added bonus.  The lollipops help with my oral fixations, and, they kept me from overeating.<br /><br />It  works for me.

review/summary: What's in a name?  YUMMY, that's what...
review/text: Ok, so maybe you're looking for "organic" (read: healthier) substitutes for other candies, or maybe you want to appease your conscience by compromising with your children by not removing all candy while still allowing at least this little pleasure.  Whatever the reason, don't overthink it.  These little suckers are full-flavored, tangy, sweet and varied.<br /><br />For my family, I didn't buy them for the organic/healthy reasons.  I bought them hoping that I could provide a treat for one of my children that has multiple, severe food allergies.  He cannot have most of the commercially marketed candies.  As an example of the hoops this creates, the last time I bought him "candy" it was a single, $4 maple leaf fashioned of pure maple syrup.  What a happy boy!!!<br /><br />I took a chance on these, noting that they had no artificial colors, flavors etc.<br /><br />He LOVES them!!!  AND so do his siblings!!!  AND so do his parents!!!<br /><br />Every night, after dinner together, one of our kids will ask for "dessert."  The definition of "dessert" in my house, as defined by my children, is YummyEarth Lollipop(s).<br /><br />I'm so grateful to this company for putting a product out there that works so well in our home.

review/text: I usually get these for my 29 month old son at the local store for 35 cents each and he LOVES them.  When he expressed an interest in them, it was expensive to keep buying them at the store, I found them on Amazon for a fraction of the cost.  The price is really great for a organic product  and I feel good giving my son these pops knowing that they are 100% natural, made with only real fruit extracts with no chemical dyes and no corn syrup.  They are packed with favor, my son takes a few licks and gives them back to me which I save for later.  The container is super convenient, once the pops run out I'll just buy the bulk pack.  There were very few broken pops, the broken ones I put in my purse and use them as cough drops.  I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Best lollipops I've ever tasted. Ever!
review/text: These lollipops are just as good as everybody says. I was a bit skeptical about buying, as I've seen some not getting a lot of variety. I had only a few of the blueberry and the pomegranates, but I had plenty of the rest. Especially happy to see so many strawberries, my favourite.<br /><br />Anyway, I fell in love with these. I tried all tastes I could find in a short period of time, and now have a sore mouth. But oh, so worth it. These lollipops are juicy, taste like real fruit, and has none of that horrible artificial flavour. I thought to myself when I saw the large number of cherry flavoured ones "Oh, no! Not Cherry!" But they had just good flavours in them! Tasted like cherries, not chemicals. I am finding them difficult to resist. I did find that the true flavour comes after a few seconds in the mouth. The first impression of the mango was "no good" but I have started to appreciate the more subtle mango taste. I just have to be a bit patient :)<br /><br />I find it hard to stop eating these, they are just so delicious. Buy them, you will not regret it!
