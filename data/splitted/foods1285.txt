review/text: I have gotten this flavor of slim jim before from amazon and loved it however this order tasted like salty cardboard! Expiration date of march 08 but these must have been stored improperly because they are nasty. I guess with amazon your rolling the dice when you order snacks. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they really really bad. Good luck to all who are brave enough to gamble their $$$

review/text: I got one of those $25 gift certificate in the mail, and couldn't decide what to blow it on.  This was great.  I had, like, one Slim Jim a day for almost an entire month.  And they were the Tabasco flavored ones -- my favorite.<br /><br />If you've had a Tabasco Slim Jim before, well, you know what you're getting.  It's pretty clear.  If you haven't, well, maybe you should try one before you think about ordering two dozen.

review/text: White trash, indeed. The Slim Jims of the same size in the canisters were great - salty, dry, chewy - the way I like my pepperoni stick snacks.  These were moister and almost gross.  I'm hoping I can get rid of them when friends come to visit, drink beer, and watch football, but I'm not eating any of these.  Probably just as well.  I won't reorder this box.

review/summary: Kids Love Them
review/text: I have ordered these on numerous occasions because the kids love them.  The sticks are a little small, but they allow you to eat four (serving size 4 pieces) with 160 calories.  The fat is a different matter - 1g of trans fat and 6g of saturated fat - 14 total grams of fat per serving.  Obviously not a great health choice if you are going to go through the box in one sitting.  That having been said, they taste great and sometimes are the only thing that hits the spot when you are craving a salty meaty snack.  We throw one in to our youngest kid's lunch box and it makes her day.

review/summary: Slim Jim Chewing Gum
review/text: The first one I bit into was tough as leather and I had to rip it with my teeth. I made the mistake of biting it in half, and then I chewed, and chewed, and chewed. I couldn't get it to break down - it was like chewing gum! For the next one, I tried stripping off the outside, but that didn't make any difference. Still tough. I found they were easier to eat if I took tiny bites.<br /><br />That said, they were very tasty. But I don't like to fight my food, so I won't be buying this little stick any more.

review/summary: If you like Slim Jims and/or Tabasco, then these babies are fantastic. Hot, but delicious. A+!!!
review/text: This review is in reference to the 18 count pack of Tabasco flavored Monster Slim Jim's, although any size of the Tabasco Slim Jims are GREAT. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQE3HS">Slim Jim Giant Smoked Snacks, Tabasco, 0.97-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 24)</a>)<br /><br />  I love Tabasco sauce, and love the amazing synergy products they have made with other companies. So when I saw Tabasco Slim Jims, being a fan of Slim Jims anyway, I had to try them. The smaller sized ones, which I have been unable to find here on Amazon, taste great, but they are somewhat tougher than the larger versions, though not in a bad way. The medium sized and large ones, which this review is about, are much softer. Regardless, they are ALL delicious. They have the same spicy flavor that we Tabasco lovers have come to crave, but at the same time, since it was mixed in with other ingredients, it isn't so hot that you are forced to stop eating no matter how good it tastes. My friends and I all agree that it does have a high heat factor to it, and people who don't like spicy stuff might find it too much. But if you like spicy foods, these are an AMAZING snack. If you haven't tried them, then I highly recommend you get one from your grocery or convenient store. If you like them, buy them here since they are cheaper in bulk. Fans of Tabasco will not be disappointed. That's my $.02 on the matter folks.<br /><br />  Thanks you so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell

review/text: this is the second time I have ordered these from the same seller (Amazon as it gives free shipping). The first time the slim jims were moist and plump and oily and you could tell they were fresh. This second batch was hard and dried out and not oily at all. For those who like slim jims you know what I mean about them being plump and oily as opposed to hard and dried out without much oil.<br /><br />This is the ONLY place I can get the HOT ones so I was dissappointed with the second batch, while the first batch was perfect! I will continue to buy these but may see baout buying from a different seller to get fresher ones.

review/summary: Low carb, spicy snack sticks
review/text: I've loved Slim Jims since I was a kid in the 70s, and these are just the way I remember them - a little greasy, chewy, a little spicy.  This box of 100 contains the small sized sticks - about 4 inches long, individually wrapped, and stored in a dispenser box.  They don't have to be refrigerated, which makes them easy to tuck into a purse or lunch box.<br /><br />These aren't the "spicy" flavor - I think you have to order the jalapeno or tabasco flavor to get those.  But these are *slightly* spicy, chewy and delicious.  Nobody eats Slim Jims because they're health food - they contain preservatives and low grade meats.  But for a quick snack or if you just want something spicy, these are the same yummy snacks you'll remember from your childhood.  They are also high protein and zero carbs, which is good for those who are dieting.<br /><br />I've ordered this box three times and have been happy with it every time.  Free shipping with Amazon's Supersaver Shipping makes it a good deal.  And if you sign up for automatic delivery (no obligation to keep getting it past the first shipment) you will save an additional 15%, making each stick about 20 cents apiece.

They make a good between meal snack and the .28 ounce size works well.  I suppose you either like the taste or not.  I like the spiciness as compared to Jack Links, but the texture (finely ground and extruded into a stick) seems a bit less like real meat.  All in all, a good product.

review/text: I originally bought these for myself to relive the nostalgia of consuming one of my favorite snacks of the 90's (R.I.P. Randy Savage). Little did I know how fast the box would run out, these are a huge hit when we have friends and family over. Each jerky stick is roughly a bite size version of the huge sticks you see at your local kwik-e-mart, and 100 sounds like a lot but it isn't - I find myself having to buy these nearly once a month.

The cost was no more than buying at a brick and mortar store and the product arrived with excellent freshness. The handy box they come in make for neat storage in the pantry. Not a downside to be had! I would definitely buy again.

review/text: I really wanted to like this. I was hoping to find some good, organic ESE espresso pods. I am using a Handpresso Wild to make the coffee, so perhaps that's a factor. Other pod brands, however, have come out tasting fine. I've tried around 20 brands of pods, and this, unfortunately, is the worst of the bunch. Pretty foul.<br /><br />The instructions even say to briefly wet the pod before use. I tried that - it didn't help.

review/text: This is a really rich, dark coffee and lives up to the Starbucks name.  While I have used k cups for several years, it has been hard to find one that was bold enough.  I liked Emeril's Big Easy Bold for a while and still like Green Mountain's Espresso Blend but neither have the richness that this one from Starbucks has.  Right now though the Amazon price for 30 is 48.98!  For a pack of 16 it is $9.99 at my local grocery store and Bed, Bath and Beyond carries them for $14.99 but you can use their $5 off or the 20% off coupons which are everywhere.  So until the price here drops some, I will pick it up at my local store.

review/text: I have been buying the Starbucks Cafe Verona K-cups at Costco since they came out.  I love them.  I would give them 7 stars if I could.  I found these Sumatra K-cups at Amazon Warehouse and got them for an average of $.65/cup, which I think is fair.  I had never tried the Sumatra, but glad I did because they are very good.  Very bold, very smooth, not so bold it tastes like you're drinking from an ashtray.  Amazing how Starbucks gets their K-cups to taste pretty dang close to the real thing.

review/summary: It is definitely dark roast
review/text: I love dark roast coffee, served with or without cream/sugar, and this Sumatran k-cup is most assuredly a dark roast, but I found the flavor and aroma of this product to register as slightly bitter/burnt.  It did not overwhelm my senses, and it was easily alleviated and made better with the use of creamer, but it still wasn't my favorite of the K-Cups that are available.  I thought it was "okay".<br /><br />My husband didn't enjoy the Starbucks version of Sumatra, stating that he felt it had a somewhat chemical-like aftertaste even with cream and sugar.  We used over half of the box, to make sure that our opinion wasn't perhaps based on a faulty serving or two, but ended up giving the remainder to our neighbors; unfortunately, this Sumatra just didn't work for us.

review/text: This is the best K-cup coffee I have found yet.  The Pike Place is a close second, but the Sumatra holds up well to a larger cup (either the mug or large mug size).  If you're using a travel mug, stick with the dark roasts.  Wish it came in decaf - I love my Keurig, but I can handle only so much caffeine!<br />Also, I have found the Starbucks K-cups disassemble easily (more so than some of the other brands), the foil removes very cleanly, you can compost the grounds and paper filter, and recycle the plastic.

review/summary: Best K-Cup yet.
review/text: I prefer grinding my own coffee and using my Aeropress to the K-Cup for single serving brews. When I heard Starbucks was coming out with a K-Cup I was genuinely excited! For two years I've dealt with weak "dark" roasts. Iced coffees with a K-Cup are a joke. While nothing will come close to espresso out of a Keurig (I recommend the Mypressi Twist V2 if you are on a budget), the Sumatra Dark from Starbucks is the best K-Cup yet. It is smooth, dark and even brewed with crema. This is not acidic like many of the South American blend K-Cups. It is slightly more expensive, but it has made me start using my Keurig again.<br /><br /> I would have given it 5 stars, but one cup of the 5 I've made so far came out a touch weak.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor if you shelled out the cash on a Keurig. Get the Sumatra!!!

review/text: If you're like me and like to try out every single K-Cup that comes out, you know a few things about them:<br /><br />1. If they don't say "Extra Bold," they're terrible<br />2. The coffee always looks and feels a little "flat."<br />3. It's easier than drip, but never better<br /><br />This Starbucks Sumatra K-cup, though, rocks. You see it right away as the coffee comes out with a nice foamy top. Then it tastes great, with or without milk. It doesn't quite taste like a "freshly" brewed Sumatra, but it's as close to real coffee as the K-cup gets.

review/summary: Moldy and rancid brew (evaluated over a year's time)
review/text: I often find the Starbucks K cups yield a moldy and rancid tasting brew. We have tried an assortment of Starbucks K cups flavors obtained at numerous outlets over the last year. It feels like this is a secondary (or even tertiary) market for Starbucks beans that don't make the grade. Or possibly Starbucks has production/storage/transportation issues when bringing the Starbucks K cups to market. It is a ding to the brand. Luckily, I am a devout Starbucks follower, so I will stick to their more proven bags of beans and grinds.

The cookies have pieces of candied ginger in them, making them even more gingery.  I buy four or five boxes at a time and keep them in the freezer.  They defrost quickly, without any loss of taste.

review/summary: A Treat to Stick With
review/text: Our three pooches get a Beefeaters Munchy Stick every day, usually in the evening. They look forward to this daily ritual with great anticipation. When the treats are presented to the three girls, each assumes her position apart from the others and commences chewing. Between five and ten minutes the Stix are history, and three happy girls are searching for some fortuitous crumbs. We've been following this routine for years and the dogs have never tired of these chew treats. We do vary the flavor of the Stix, and have even purchased Beefeater variations on the theme that target the coat, calm jittery nerves, or help build cartilage with glucosamine. Occasionally we've run out of Beefeeaters and had to substitute other brands while waiting for our mail order supply to arrive. Our pooches seem to prefer the Beefeaters brand.<br /><br />No matter which flavor we choose, the girls love their Beefeaters Munchies.

review/summary: Sticks are totally safe and seemingly very enjoyable.
review/text: Initially, I started buying this product because it is not made in China which had so many recalls.  I also was looking for ground raw hide chews that did not have chicken or beef since one of my dogs is allergic to that.<br /><br />In addition to all of the other premises, my dogs seem to enjoy these chews so much!  They're totally safe also since they desintegrade in their mouth while, at the same time, they help keep their teeth in good shape and clean.

review/summary: Unbelievable Results!
review/text: I purchased Deer Off when I was at the end of my rope. I've always had a small problem with squirrels in my roses, but they only ate the ones that were easy to get to and I was content to let them have them, since there were so many others. Then an adolescent squirrel fell in love with them and braved the thorns to eat EVERY ROSE on my bushes. He'd wait until new roses budded and snatch them before they bloomed, no matter how high they were. He'd pull stalks over to get them and was wrecking my bushes. As an animal lover, I knew that I had to find an alternative I could live with.<br /><br />Deer Off is amazing. I sprayed it ONCE (about 6 weeks ago) and the squirrels now give my plants wide berth. The smell must be offensive to them, but the scent is mild to my human nose and faded to nothing about a minute after spraying. I HIGHLY recommend it. I didn't expect it to work this well!

review/summary: Does NOT work for deer, at least in Texas
review/text: This product did not work at all for me for deer in Texas, (where the deer population is 6 million or so). Most of the rave reviews are concerning squirrels or rabbits, but my problem was deer. The squirrels and rabbits don't eat that much and I always plant a little extra anyway.<br />The product is called "Deer Off", and has a picture of a deer running on it. Toward my pea patch, I suppose.<br />I noticed the deer had visited my 60 foot row of purple hull and zipper peas(about 18" high and blooming), the previous night, and had nibbled a little on one end. I went back to the house and got the miracle bottle that my wife had bought a few months earlier just for this occasion.<br />I sprayed about half a bottle of Deer Off (ready to use) till everything was wet, and the next morning it looked like you ran over it with a lawn mower, and deer tracks were everywhere. The deer absolutely ate the stems and all right to the ground.<br />They ought to sell this stuff to hunters for a lure.<br />So it's off to the grocery store to buy peas.<br />No satisfaction from Woodstream customer service either. They have a 30 day limit on refunds.<br />Live and learn.<br />Terry

review/summary: Defying Peter Rabbit
review/text: We have been adding edible flowers and other vegetables to The Collard Patch lately.  The rabbits ate our eggplants, beets, tomatoes, carrots, sunflowers, and okra!  They skipped over the collards, garlic, and romaine.  All that work!  It seems the rabbits could at least wait  until the crops are grown so they would have more to eat.<br /><br />Then we discovered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A0VOD2">Deer Off DF32RTU Deer, Rabbit and Squirrel Repellent Ready-to-Use Spray 32 oz.</a> and stopped those boy and girl rabbits from eating.  Now they can spend their time elsewhere.  Maybe if they don't get so fat, they'll enjoy some of the other things that rabbits are known for, such as teasing dogs.<br /><br />So far this product is working.  It uses the flavors of rotten eggs, capsaicin, and garlic to repulse the rabbits, who are  . . . believe it or not . . . picky eaters.  This concoction is supposed to be weather-resistant.  So far with our frequent rains in Louisiana, it is still working.  When we get new leaves, we add more spray.  It  is supposed to last three months, and we are supposed to stop using it two weeks before harvesting.

review/text: We had a problem with the squirrels eating our lettuce as soon as it popped out of the ground. I bought this, but didn't want to spray directly onto any of my plants, so just sprayed around the perimeter of the garden (we have a fairly small garden) and it worked perfectly! We have had no problems since I sprayed a couple of months ago. I thought I might have to reapply because it gets hit with water every couple of days with the sprinkler, but only had to that first time.

review/summary: Solution (Literally) For Sprayer Malfunction
review/text: Like most everyone else, I found the sprayer got clogged within minutes of use. My "solution" was to (a) wear very good rubber gloves, (b) fill a bucket 3/4 full of hot water, and (c) remove the sprayer from the bottle when stuck and soak the sprayer. I found it took less than a minute to de-gunk the sprayer by doing a few practice sprays as it took in the hot water. I had 3 bottles so was able to finish the job fairly continuously (in a small yard) by rotating in the "good spray" bottle while my wife cleaned out the clogged sprayers with the hot water bucket. Clearly not ideal and the manufacturer needs to change the design...but this was our short term fix. The product did deter (but not eliminate) squirrels and rabbits; rain/irrigation washes it away pretty quickly too.

review/summary: There are respies for Deer Repellants on the Internet
review/text: I used this one to make a full gallon for a lot less than the stuff advertized here and it works. I have had no problems in my garden for the last month.<br /><br />Homemade Deer Repellent<br /><br />To make the homemade deer repellent mix the following with one gallon of water:<br /><br />  5 eggs (Blend them thoroughly if you'll be using a sprayer to avoid any clumps. You'll probably need to strain the mixture before using)<br />  1 cup of buttermilk, milk, or yogurt (think stink!)<br />  2 Tablespoons of hot sauce<br />  1 Teaspoon of liquid dish soap<br />  1 Tablespoon of vegetable oil<br />  15 drops of cinnamon oil - optional  This ingredient seems to be difficult to find but it is optional.<br />  2 Teaspoons of finely crushed garlic - optional<br /><br />Tip: Mix the ingredients in a blender with a quart of water first. Then combine the mixture with additional water. It will help keep your sprayer from plugging.<br /><br />This homemade deterrent is most effective when sprayed just before your buds appear, but can be used throughout the growing season. You'll want to change the ingredients occasionally. You can begin without the cinnamon oil and garlic in the mix. Add it later. Randomizing the bad tastes will help confuse the deer. Start in a small area to determine if the repellent is working before making large quantities is recommended.

review/text: I purchased this as it said that it would help repel squirrels. After applying it all over the tree branches/fruit that hang over the patio that these pest sit, eat, drop fruit, defecate and urinate over (making our patio most undesirable to be around)it had absolutely no effect on repelling them. So unfortunately this item is totally useless on repelling the squirrels in our neighborhood = 1 star because there is a zero star option.

review/summary: Deer Off works
review/text: Last year was my first summer living in Oregon in a neighborhood with many Black Tail Deer. As a test I designated one spot in my front yard and planted many different kinds of annuals, some which "they" say the deer won't eat. The deer ate them all. Then I started spraying them with Deer Off, and it turned into a colorful and beautiful garden. It rains a lot here and when it does not rain we have a sprinkler system that sprays the garden heavily. I sprayed the Deer Off once or twice a week. This year I actually had the nerve to plant a rose bush there. My first bottle ran out, so I am buying a new one. I think it works!

review/summary: Part of my training pack
review/text: I buy different types of treats for my dogs and keep them all in a large Rubbermaid container on top of the fridge.  The dogs go nuts every time I reach for that box.  I think they enjoy the variety because after I give them their treat they still look at me like "what else is she gonna give us" and sometimes I swear it's more like "but mom, I don't like that kind, I want the other one".<br /><br />I mix all kinds of mainly dental treats together in the box.  Rawhide sticks (all colors and flavors, not just green ones), Greenies, Dingos, CET and also use some rawhide bones.  These treats help scrape plaque from their teeth while chewing before tarter can form if given after meals or once a day.  My dogs do not get soft food or treats unless we are training.  Saving soft treats for training makes them want it all the more and the hard food is better for their teeth and digestion.<br /><br />I have a Miniature Pinscher and 2 Pomeranians that are prone to tooth loss so taking care of their teeth is very important to me.  My oldest Pomeranian is 6 years old and just had his first professional cleaning and that was mainly because it is hard for me to get his back teeth because his mouth is so tiny.<br /><br />They love when they see the bag of treats come out of the cupboard because they now it's the soft stuff or the small one bite treats and they are more receptive to training and their sessions go much faster.<br /><br />I would recommend these treats as part of a variety.  Mix it up so your dog doesn't get bored and use different shapes to get different angles on their teeth.<br /><br />If my review has helped you while considering this item, please click "Yes" this review was helpful to let me know.  Thanks!
