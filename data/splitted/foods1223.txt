review/summary: Deceived!
review/text: I ordered this brand ONLY because it stated that it was in a JAR. I got a white, opaque tub, disfigured, from what I suppose was due to multiple liquifying, then solidifying. I could have gotten it cheaper and faster but chose this for the supreme qualities of glass. The oil tastes okay, but I have doubts about what else might be in it.  Even the photo appears to be glass. What a con!

review/summary: Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil - IF NOT BLOOD TYPE O
review/text: Actually, I'm more disappointed with my research into unrefined coconut oil than this product.  Through my internet research, I was assured that this product would take care of my cholesterol.  After eating 3 tablespoons every day for a couple of weeks, I noticed that I was becoming very lethargic and I started to have chest constrictions.  I was also giving a spoonful to my 4 year old daughter.  When I saw my daughter start acting dumb, it confirmed that my lethargy wasn't accidental.  I quickly stopped giving her and myself any coconut oil to eat.  I don't exercise enough but my daughter runs around like a top all the time.  She gets plenty of exercise and this seemed to slow her mental abilities regardless of exercise.  My chest constrictions have gone after two weeks without coconut oil.  We only use it to moisterize dry skin.<br /><br />Right after I doubted the effects of this product on cholesterol, I did a more thorough internet search and discovered that blood types O did not do well with coconut oil and it is best to avoid it.  Guess what.  One third the population in America, including my family, has blood type O.<br /><br />So coconut oil may help - if you don't have blood type O.

review/summary: Coconut Oil
review/text: This product is supposed to be very good for you. But you need to make sure that you like coconut flavor...because it will add a little coconut flavor to your food. It is a little annoying that you have to melt the oil everytime you want to use it. But if you want the health benefits it is worth it. I haven't used it long enough to recognize any changes or benefits in my health.

The only thing I would teach my crew that mails out the Books know the difference and the reason  for the different addresses.  The book which was a $1.00 item ended up costing me $13.00 just to mail it. The book went to the Forwarding Address.<br /><br />When it should have been shipped to the P O Box.<br /><br />The reason  I have two address is that I live in Alaska, some item cannot be delivered here, so we use a forwarding address for more expensive items.

review/summary: I wouldn't cook with it, but it may have medicinal applications
review/text: I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable.  Also, coconut "oil" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated.  Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.<br /><br />You cannot "eat it out of the jar" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve.  I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up.

review/summary: Is there anything you can't use this oil for?
review/text: I think not!<br /><br />OF course it is great for all the things people have mentioned, but I have found it particularly wonderful as a facial CLEANSER.  I massage a good bit of the oil over my face and neck, let it sit for a few minutes while I brush my teeth etc., then I take a warm wet cloth and wipe my face.  The excess oil comes off with all the dirt and makeup that was on my face (even the water proof mascara) and it leaves a nice light film of oil that makes my face glow, and for ONCE in my life I'm free of blemishes, even during those particularly difficult times of month! I'm in love!  Next time I'll be ordering a gallon size!

review/summary: miracle facial cure!
review/text: i had moderate acne(cysts mostly on my temples and cheeks) and dry skin that drank up lotion as though it were in famine. recently, i've been nightly steaming my face, rubbing in the oil, and then steaming it again and wiping off the excess oil. my face is clearing up exceptionally well, and instead of being both dry and oily, my skin is retaining an amazing glow. i have been doing the skin treatment along with eating a tbsp of it a day(i put it in my morning tea), and the result is nothing short of a miracle. i feel like a hippie saying it, but i am so glad i switched from putting weird chemical nonsense on my face to this routine. i also use it to fry eggs and chicken and i use it to deep condition my hair. i kinda want to preach about it to everyone, yet at the same time i want to keep it my little beauty secret.

review/summary: Bargain price, QUALITY product! (edited)
review/text: I've been purchasing the Nutiva via subscription, in the two-pack jars. Recently I found the 8 pound pail available, and decided it would be a good purchase since coconut oil has such a long shelf life.<br /><br />Having seen another review that said there was a difference between the pail product and jar product, I was concerned. However, after having used both I can assure you that the product you buy in jars is the same product packed in the large pail.<br /><br />Eight pounds of wonderful coconutty goodness, creamy and fragrant and delicious! Since it turns liquid in warmer temps, I poured the liquid into my olive oil dispenser and can now add oil to my skillets without having liquid coconut oil running all down the sides of the jar. When the weather cools down I'll have to make other arrangements, of course. But this coconut oil is fabulous and a bargain at this price!<br /><br />I might have to order another one soon as my mother likes this also, and took some of my coconut oil.<br /><br />*Edit 6-14-11: when I purchased this and raved about what a bargain it was, the pail cost me just a little over $50.00  You may find that doing the math on any additional price increases changes whether this is a bargain for you or not.

I must warn you to start out slowly, maybe 1 teaspoon daily.  It has detox properties and if you take too much at first, it will cause you to detox too quickly.  I also use it daily on my skin, including my face. If you want more information, just put a "Coconut Oil benefits" search in Google.  You can't beat the price of this oil through Amazon with their free S & H.

review/summary: A Wonder
review/text: A friend of mine recommended this product to me. She said she'd lost 20 lbs in a matter of months just from using it. I was skeptical, to say the least. I'd heard all of the bad stuff about coconut oil, but I was curious enough to research. In the meantime, another acquaintance told me about a mutual friend who'd lost 75 lbs from using Nutiva. After that, I was more than curious--I wanted to try it.<br /><br />I'd tried a different brand of coconut oil before and was not impressed. It was very grainy and hard. Nutiva is very smooth. It's got a beautiful creamy texture and is very white. It also doesn't leave a smoky smell in my home--in fact, I love the way it smells when I'm sauteeing food.<br /><br />What sold me on this product was that I read you could eat it on toast. I thought that was weird, but decided to give it a try. The first time I tried it like that, I had meetings all day. I am ALWAYS hungry, and always snacking. I really eat about every 2 hours. Well, that day, about 5 hours had gone by before I realized I was hungry! I thought it was a fluke since I was so busy that day. A few days later, I tried it again. And once again, several hours went by and I wasn't a bit hungry.<br /><br />I am convinced there is something to weight loss with this product. I've already lost 15 lbs in the month that I've used it. I would (and have) recommend this product to everyone.

review/summary: The skin of a teenager!!!
review/text: The other day my significant other looked at me and remarked..."You have the skin of a teenager". It is the dramatic improvement in my skin since I've been using this product.  First my dry hair's texture was changed within a few days and I no longer have dandruff since using this product.  Then my skin from the neck down has this kind of sheen that I have not had in 40 years...the last time I was a teenager.  Also the acne on the back or my arms, backside and back of my thighs is gone.  I used to slather on a tea tree oil lip balm several times a day.  Now I rub in coconut oil on my lips in the morning and maybe one other time during the day, on the days I do not wear lipstick.<br /><br />The thing that has struck me most is my face.  I had been through microdermabrasion, chemical peels and all sorts of exfoliating products that are now all replaced by coconut oil.  I'm not usually one for dramatic reviews, but this product has performed VERY FAR BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS!!!  Also by using this product I save a lot of money now that I no long have to use a ton of other products.  I should note that I've been using this coconut oil for the last 4 or 5 months.

I will order this product again.<br /><br />May 2011, I am half way thru my second gallon of this product and the taste is very good.<br />My only wish now is that it was cold pressed/unheated.

review/summary: Inside and out
review/text: I started using this product a few months ago when I read about giving coconut oil to my black shih tzu Pucci as a dietary supplement. He liked it immediately and his coat is glossy and his skin unblemished. I have also smooshed some into his hair before his bath as a conditioner with great success. I started eating it myself - it has a very pleasant, mild taste - and I apply it to my hair and skin before a shower which makes even my hard feet smooth and soft without being greasy. It absorbs into the skin nicely. I thought the claims of a miracle product were merely the swoons of hippie health nuts but this product has enhanced my life and the life of my dog. I like Nutiva products in general so that is why I chose it for the coconut oil and it seems wonderful in all aspects. It is part of my routine now. This size jar also seems to be an excellent value for a quality product.

review/text: Coconut oil has so many health benefits, it's really incredible!  We switched from using mainly olive oil to using this coconut oil for cooking, after learning that cooking with olive oil at high heats changes the chemical make-up of the oil into a health hazard. I had never used coconut oil before, and now I use it for everything!  Coconut oil can be substituted for butter since it is a saturated fat.  I use it for baking, stovetop cooking, and as a moistuizer for my skin (it works great, isn't real greasy, and it doesn't contain synthetic toxic ingredients like conventional lotions.) The 54 oz size is a great deal!  I can't wait till it's back in stock!

It is so delicious and it is very good for you too!  I had to start buying it in this larger size because we were using up the 1 pound size so quickly.  It lasts for years too, so no worry about it going bad.  It just makes more sense to buy this size and save money.  I still buy the smaller size to take with me on vacations.  Wouldn't be without it!!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because even though this brand is very good, I have tasted some that is even better.  But the price of this is very good.

review/summary: Great Alternative for Conditioner!
review/text: I've been using this product for 2 months now, and it's AMAZING! I have wavy hair and it's very fine. I've noticed that whenever I use deep conditioners or any other type of conditioner, my hair will fall out excessively. So I decided not to use conditioners, instead I use Nutiva's Coconut oil daily (only on my ends & on dry hair) and it leaves my hair incredibly soft, shiny, and easy to untangle! I also use it once every other week as a deep-conditioner (through out my whole hair & leave it in for half an hour to an hour), and my hair doesn't fall-out as much as it does with other conditioners!!! I seriously LOVE this product, my hair feels a lot healthier and it's also more manageable, I also get a lot of comments on how shiny and silky my hair looks! I really recommend it. My only suggestion is, if you dislike the smell of coconut, this product is not for you. The smell is very strong and tends to linger on the hair, personally I love it! And one last thing, a little goes a long way with this product, if you apply too much, your hair will appear greasy!

review/summary: Good oil, but raw foodists beware "extra virgin" is not the same as raw!
review/text: This oil is extra virgin, but not raw. It is cold-pressed, but the processing tempurature rises above that of truly raw foods. Email Nutiva if you want more details on their process. They had the info on their site at one time, but I could not find it there today. Aside from that, this giant tub of oil is great for hair and skin. About once a week I saturate my hair with this oil and leave it in for 15 minutes to 1 hour before I shower, then I shampoo 2-3 times so my hair's not greasy and do not need conditioner for a few days. I also apply the oil to my skin after I wash, but while still in the shower. Then I just lightly rinse the oil off with water only, after giving it a few minutes to soak in. This way my skin gets moisturized without that greasy residue that usually takes so long to soak in. Good for when you are headed to work and don't want that greasy look for an hour or so after application. Nutiva previously had a truly raw version of this oil, but just found out from their website the Nutiva folk's supplier of the raw oil could not keep up with demand so they had to remove it from their site! There are other brands of raw available on other internet sites, but have yet to see any on Amazon.

Although I do eat later in the evening a salad and either fish or chicken and drink lots of water I am satiated and feel great!!  I certainly do recommend this product and for those of you that believe the stories that have circulated for years that coconut oil is among the bad oils for your heart... please order either The Coconut Oil Miracle book or the Eat Fat Look Thin book and read for yourself that this oil actually prevents heart disease.

review/text: This oil is so amazing!<br />1. It smells delicious.<br />2. It softens up super easily<br />3. It makes your skin so soft and moist<br />4. It can treat razor burn, shave bumps, dry skin, any sort of skin problems<br />5. Warm this stuff up and oooh it is so amazing for husband/wife full body massages!<br />6. Lube. Oh yes. Amazing lube. Don't worry about it getting inside of your girl, it is actually a remedy for yeast infections and such!<br />7. It is so beneficial to every part of your body you use it on<br />8. You can eat this stuff if you want haha!<br /><br />No worries with using this product for anything related to your body. It is one of the few oils/lotions that can double as a massage oil as well as lube. Again, do not be afraid to use it as lube. It is totally safe and is super beneficial and amazing.<br />I'd give it 10 stars if I could haha!

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I tried the Nutiva brand after purchasing another brand of coconut oil. I love the taste of this brand and use it all the time - my local health food store has it on sale quite often. Coconut oil has many uses - I just scoop out enough product and place in storage containers to use on my hair/body and the rest stays in the kitchen to use for cooking. I find that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin when I need to address dryness. Sometimes I add a drop or two of Eucalyptus essential oil to  the coconut oil and apply to my body as well. Works great as a hot oil treatment for your hair - since coconut oil is in a solid form at 76 degrees or less - just heat up a small amount in a container and apply to your hair.

review/summary: i live by this product !!
review/text: this product is absolutely amazing ! i first tried it when i found it at my local health food store and it keeps amazing me to no end. I use it as on my skin and in my tea . I wanted to share something so others may find this helpful. I work with Veterans as a volunteer and advocate i have one vet who has poor circulation in his legs and feet he also gets blood clots. He has had the swelling for almost 20 years , he is grumpy and miserable and normally hates to try anything new and will always complain about things no matter if its good or not. we went to his dr and they did not want to put him on more meds due to possible liver issues and so i mentioned could i try the coconut oil that i have , the dr said sure give it a try . so when we got back i brought the oil over and rubbed it into his legs and feet then put a coconut body butter over it and put his socks on, the next morning i stopped over to check on him and i was looking at his legs he was so amazed he was in shock just in 12 hrs his legs had gone down and the pin and needle s feeling had lessened, i continued for a week we went back to the dr and they were shocked and asked what it was i was doing , i explained the product and what i did they wrote the name down and was going to try it with other patients. this vet raved about how great it was and has kidnapped my jar and has had me go get him a case to keep on hand. it not only brought the swelling in his legs down but the cracking and dry skin on his legs and feet were gone  and the color was no longer purple  i will always keep this product on hand and use it for alot of my veterans who have skin issues.  but make sure with your dr before you use it...

review/summary: th best coconut oil ever
review/text: Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is the best coconut oil I ever tried. Its pure and natural. I never seen coconut oil so raw and the texture is smooth as silk. Its easy to mix with other ingredients. Once you try this product, you will never go back to your old coconut oil again. I  mix it  in with my favorite hair conditioner. My hair never looked this great.<br />I microwave it for 20 seconds, mix with favorite hair conditioner, place onto hair while its warm. cover my hair with plastic cap for and hour, and rinse with cool water. The results are great. I would never use any other coconut oil only Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. It's the best.

review/summary: Coconut Oil is awesome
review/text: It was not too long ago that I learned that the common understanding about nutrition is completely wrong, for example, saturated fats such as butter, lard and coconut oil are very stable, and do not break down in high heat. Moreover, this trait is protective of human health, plus, we should be eating MORE fats due to the need for the fat-soluble vitamins. (Don't even get me started on the cholesterol fraud.) So I was thrilled to learn I could obtain coconut oil on Amazon.<br /><br />The coconut oil arrived quickly. After having used 'polyunsaturated' oils for so long, I chuckled to see the coconut oil was solid, hence, the tub, rather than a narrow-necked jar.<br /><br />I got the tub in summer, so somewhere along the way, the stuff got soft and slid sideways. But no prob. And yes, when I run out, I'll get more from the same place in a heartbeat.

review/summary: Very good product
review/text: This is a very good product. I had a strange area on my leg that always itched and even my doctor didn't know what it was. I think it was some weird fungus I picked up in the hospital years ago, because that's when it seemed to appear. I tried all sorts of creams to get rid of it and after reading up on the benefits of extra virgin coconut oil I decided to try it myself. The area has healed and I still use this as a moisturizer for my face every night instead of all of the expensive products that I used to buy containing "peptides" etc. I also have started eating it and feeding it to my pets every day. I think we all look a lot healthier.

review/text: I've tried just about all the coconut oils out there.... I like this one and Aloha Nu. I eat it right out of the jar, cook with it and I use it on my hair. It's great for chemical damaged hair. I put a little bit on my hair after I shampoo, then I straighten it with my instyler. Makes my hair shiny and smooth. If I didn't, I would look like I stuck my finger in a light socket. lol  :-) Great price also for this oil. Others are very spendy.

review/summary: Love that Coconut smell!
review/text: I only give this product 4 stars because it comes in a plastic jar.  Glass would be much better on the environment- but also more expensive so...On to the product!  This coconut oil not only smells great, but tastes great too.  I put 1/2 TBL in my fruit smoothies, use it in my raw icecreams and puddings, and even use it in my hair products. My favorite use for the coconut oil is as a hot oil treatment; 1/4 cup mixed with 10 drops of rosemary.  Despite the plastic, I will probably continue to order from Nutiva as I did some research before purchasing and find them to honestly care about producing a wonderfully fresh and organic product.

review/text: The Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar is superb.  We use it in the kitchen (for cooking, baking + pastry crusts), and for our skin and hair. See: "The Coconut Oil Miracle" book.<br /><br />Also, this 54 ounce jar is a better buy--not only because the purchase contributes to less packaging waste on the planet--but this larger quantity calculates to more cost effectiveness per ounce.

review/summary: Outstanding value, superior taste
review/text: We've been buying our coconut oil from Whole Foods as well as other health food markets, but we decided to give Nutiva coconut oil a try mainly because of the price offered on Amazon. To our suprise this oil has exceeded our expectations! It smells wonderful and tastes good too. It is at least on par or superior to the products purchased at Whole Foods and health food stores but at a much lower price. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to family and friends, only problem is that most people are still sceptical of the health benefits of coconut oil. When I mention the use of coconut oil, most people just shake their heads and respond that they're not into "crazy fad diets". Too bad, their loss.

review/text: For those looking for a healthier alternative to butter and vegetable oils, coconut oil is great!!! I use it as my primary cooking oil, so this large jar is perfect for me. It doesn't need refrigeration like other coconut oils I've purchased, which is convenient.<br /><br />A neat thing - some doctors actually recommend daily doses of coconut oil. Also, you can use on your skin (which is better for you than petroleum-based products).

review/text: After losing 75 lbs. on Atkins Induction, I hit a stall and wanted to add some variety to my WOE. Low carb forums mention coconut oil as a healthy alternative to plain old vegetable oil so I ordered a jar of Nutiva EVCO. If I didn't like the taste, I figured that I could use it as skin lotion.<br /><br />This stuff is GREAT! So far, I have used it to season beef patties, chicken , steamed veggies and omelets. (Tried it in coffee - not so good). This is my new favorite food item.<br /><br />Some folks complain about the coconut smell but I like it. And it has helped get me past the stall - I actually lost a couple of lbs this week.

review/summary: Nutiva organic coconut oil
review/text: This is a really nice value, and a delicious product. Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too. This coconut oil is raw. It smells amazing and is super healthy. I use it for everything, from salad dressing to raw vegan deserts, to stir fry, skin moisturizer, hair finisher, massage oil, etc. It's amazing on baked yams. If you eat toast, try mixing raw coconut oil with honey and using it as a spread.

review/text: If you are looking for a healthier oil to cook with than corn or mixed vegetable oils, try this product. My husband read about the benefits of coconut oil in the book "Patient Heal Thyself" and in "The Bottom Line" publication a few years ago. Previously we have had to purchase this at health food stores, relying on their stock at the time. Now we can order it here and have it in a couple of days. The product itself is wonderful, and arrives in a plastic container, which is safer around the kitchen. As long as you keep it in a cool place it will keep a long time. The only thing I Don't fry with it is garlic. For some reason that combination is putrid, but onions, peppers, chicken, green beans, pork chops, are all delicious and the coconut adds a light, sweet flavor of its own.

review/text: I started taking Maca in capsule form months ago for a libido increase and bought this pouch so I could take higher doses cheaper than I could in capsule form.  I figured a little did me good, a lot will do a whole lot more.  I take about 2 tsp morning and night, and while I am happy with the libido boost, I don't feel the energy boost from the product (yet).<br /><br />The stuff is the second worst tasting stuff I have ever taken for my health.  I can find nothing to help it down but OJ.  On occasion, it tastes so bad that I hurl most of it back up.  Lastly, the 16-ounce pouch is of good quality and reseals dozens of times very well.

Not only did this taste horrible but it actually made me sick for hours after trying it for the first time. I felt nauseous and spent a great deal of time in the bathroom afterwards. I am not sure if it was an allergic reaction but it also gave me hives. I tossed the bag out after one serving and though I realize that I wasted money, I would gladly pay double to never have to ingest this again. Yes, it was that bad for me. I really would have loved to add this to my daily diet for the health benefits but unfortunately it had the opposite effect.

Maca adds a subtle sweet taste. I also use Cheyenne pepper in this bread so the Maca root countered the pepper perfectly.

review/summary: Great completely natural health food!
review/text: I discovered maca capsules years ago through a natural doctor, and just loved the smell, which for me usually means my body finds a product useful & healthy.  A couple years ago I found plain raw maca powder, and began adding it to my fruit smoothies.<br /><br />I was thrilled to find this brand, which I trust from trying several of their products through my natural foods store, right here on Amazon!  And available for auto ship at a discount, which is perfect, as I now begin every day with a greens & fruit smoothie.  This product by Navitas is just pure maca powder, that is certified organic, kosher, vegan, and raw.<br /><br />I believe maca, which I'm told works like an adaptogen, really helps my body balance, and helps my energy levels.  Maca is a root, or tuber, from Peru, where it has been eaten for thousands of years.  Good stuff!  And I still adore that smell!

review/summary: Nothing earth-shattering to report.
review/text: This is by far, the worst smelling, worst tasting supplement known to man.  It is so far worse than anything GNC sells.  I can't believe that people would mix this with a smoothie. I mix 3 tablespoons with about 3oz of water and down it while holding my breath and immediately chase it with something like orange juice.  Does it work?  I have no idea.  Tough to tell.  I'll give it another month and see.  The price is right though, to at least try it out. I won't buy another bag of this foul powder though, I'll try the pills....

review/summary: Woohoo What a flavor.
review/text: This is my First review of anything on amazon. This powder has probably the most hard to handle flavor. It is so pungent that almost nothing can cover it up. The smell is indescribable. It is impossible to cover up. It says it is supposed to help with stress, but I get more irritable drinking it. I have stopped using it for the most part and feel like I wasted money. I want to at least finish the bag. I am sure it has its benefits, and it may not be for everyone, but beware the taste. Chocolate syrup is the only thing that covered it up but it took so much that it tasted like I was drinking it straight from the bottle.

review/summary: Maca should not be eaten raw.
review/text: Maca powder = maca flour. I have cooked with maca flour ten years, as a baking and cooking ingredient/flavoring. In Peru, maca flour, or "harina de maca" is a relatively cheap regional culinary flour. Raw Reform is a great specimen of this culinary flour; ideal for cooking, an excellent nutty flavor, it's bitterness subsiding with heat. A decade ago I could buy 'harina de maca' for $8/kg (and in Peru, it's a mere $2-4/kg) - now I see this same inexpensive Peruvian cooking flour sold as a "raw superfood" at an inflated price. It's very odd to have witnessed this metamorphosis.<br /><br />The reason I gave this ONE star is simple - this company (among several others) suggests that you to eat this flour raw. Like other cruciferous roots, maca can be particularly difficult to digest when raw. Not only is it fiber-dense, it contains lots of goitrogenic compounds (a term which means 'thyroid-interfering,' not "goiter causing") - that's why the raw root and it's flour is so bitter - it's no wonder people have digestive issues and occasional hormonal (thyroid) complaints with raw maca. The one time I ate it raw, I experienced the stomachache, too! Maca is dense in fiber and thyroid inhibiting/goitrogenic compounds (glucosinolates and isothyocyanates), both of which are lessened greatly or deactivated by heat. Among the people who grow it, maca is not considered healthy unless cooked. It is therefore a great paradox that the "raw food" crowd has gotten hold of this vegetable that has always been, and by all accounts always should be cooked. This supplement is being backed by people whose basic food philosophy avoids the plant's very identity in human use. It would be like eating turnip flour, raw (except maca can even more bitter than this, in fact most of the lepidiums are). Back into antiquity, maca has had to be cooked in order to be gentle on digestion, on metabolism, and it has been cooked traditionally for this purpose.<br /><br />I have used the raw maca flour in cooking since 2002 where I first read about it in Chris Kilham's book "Tales from the Medicine Trail" and began following an interest in this ancient food. I do use raw maca flour for cooking, baking, in pancakes, confections, etc. Where you can get it inexpensively, it is excellent for such uses. For therapeutic effects and everyday drink mix usage, presently I employ a 'black gelatinized' maca - it seems to be the strongest type energetically and for sexual effects, and 'black root' is my personal preference. 'Gelatinized' means that it's fiber has been removed (skimmed off), and goitrogens denatured - it is a few times concentrated over the powder / flour. Naturally, it is less bitter than any uncooked flour product. The gelatinized processing was developed specifically to address the digestion/goitrogen issue inherent with the root. That's the process' entire purpose - that's why it even exists.<br /><br />The trend in "health food" circles says to eat maca raw, in order to glean the mood, stamina, and sexual benefits which Andean people have known for thousands of years. These merchants never mention how the plant has always been prepared - cooked - perhaps the most crucial aspect of it's identity. Why argue from antiquity about all the health benefits, while ignoring the food's ethnobotany? It's a mix of mistaken understanding, and because there's profit in re-selling a highly marked up culinary flour. I see $20.00 - $25.00 a pound slapped on maca flour in health food stores -- on a product which can be found $2-4 a kilogram in Peru ($1.36 - $1.81/lb!). This is precisely why some regional foods / surpluses suddenly become "superfoods." In maca's case there is a genuine positive effect being felt... so, like the mood boost one feels with coffee, maca is an easy sell. Most companies have a whole marketing song & dance... and they make a LOT of money.<br /><br />Pay a price of $20/lb only for the gelatinized product, which has actually been processed for immediate consumption. Do not pay this for a re-packed culinary flour.

review/summary: What Nobody Tells You About RAW Maca...
review/text: I have never written a review before but I always consult Amazon.com reviews before buying a product so thought I would give back at least once. I bought this product BEFORE I thoroughly researched it due to lifelong problems related to a hormonal imbalance and was soooo excited I just bought what I thought would be good; raw and organic. I took this product for 3 days until I broke out in hives. I only took 1/2 tsp day one and 1/4 tsp days 2 and 3. I got the hives day 2 but was hoping they were not related to the Maca (they were). So.... I researched more and there is one very informative forum I found on google (hard to find and not sure if I'm allowed to refer it or not but here it is but FINISH reading to the bottom or you will not try this product ever): [...]. There are a bunch of websites and some scientific reviews, but long story short, it appears that Maca MUST be eaten pre-cooked (gelatinized) to obtain therapeutic benefits and to alleviate potential problems related to digestion (when eaten raw) and possible toxicity (raw) the way the native Puruvians have done for thousands of years to the present (cooked). There are studies that show ingesting raw Maca is worse than not adding it to the diet at all. Based on what I've read you need to start SLOWLY with the dosage and adjust it according to your body's needs, then take a break from it occasionally or it appears to lose potency. If improper dosages are taken it exacerbates the imbalance/symptoms. There are (reportedly) many benefits of Maca on the entire Endocrine system and I still have high hopes so ordered from another company who doesn't sell raw Maca due to the reasons above. I believe Navitas also has a gelatinized version of the Maca but I bought one with DIM to prevent the overproduction of bad estrogen which can cause cancer in people with a family history. Hope this helps!

review/summary: Unique Flavor,  Not Feeling the Energy Yet
review/text: I've waited to write a review until I finished my first bag of product;  This way I could try it different ways and give a better opinion.  First, let me say I've tried other products from Navitas, and they have been quality products.  I've tried the Maca powder in lots of ways including smoothies, various raw dishes, and even straight from the bag.<br />  Other than the normal energy you would get from eating any form of concentrated carbohydrates, I haven't noticed any other benefits.  I think this product has a unique flavor that could enhance certain dishes if used in moderation.  I also think it serves better as a natural sweetner similar to stevia (but better tasting in my opinion).  Mixing this product with other carbs/sugars will cause an insulin spike in the blood which is not healthy.  If you want to know more about how sugars and insulin affect us, I recommend reading http://www.drbass.com/rosedale.html<br />  So I believe this is a good product as far as Maca goes, but I just haven't experienced the stated benefits for this high priced bag of starchy carbs.  I've tried many natural energizer foods from Acai and Cacao (which has slight liver/kidney toxins), to Ginseng, Carob, Wheatgrass, etc.  Maca energy value is low on the list for me.

I do know how I feel and it's much better then before I started taking it. I have a demanding stressful job and I feel more balanced then ever.<br /><br />The taste is bitter and you'll need to mask it in something, especially if you grew up on "Americana" High Fructose Corn Syrup.<br /><br />I think it's worth a try - give it a couple of weeks  - judge for yourself.<br /><br />One last thing about these reviews.<br /><br />It REALLY seems like a bunch of these reviews are phony and/or "paid to review" which I find more distasteful then the bitterness of the product.<br /><br />This "fakiness" review stuff is rampant on the internet - especially for health foods - and it's also blatantly dishonest.<br /><br />So if Nativas is propagating this type of thing you should stop - all it does is give you short term gains and minimize your brand - if you have a good product them it should stand on it's own merits.<br /><br />Not all people on the internet are sheep...

If you check you will find this is a great price for organic raw Maca.  I have not tried other Maca products but frankly feel no urge to do so as I am quite pleased.  Lot's of the negativer reviews compain about the taste.  I actually like the taste (in smoothies and mixed into my hot quinoa cereal -- I must have some affinity for Andean food).  But my wife finds the taste positvely revolting.  So it seems to be a personal matter.  I think it tastes like roasted malt with a nutty flavor that is very earthy.  The impact on my health -- some increased stamina, altertness, and a very positive feeling of overall physical wellbeing -- has been quite remarkable.  Having tried many herbs, supplements and healthy foods over the years this is quite unlike anything else I have tried.  It may be that my body resonates particularly well with it.  Obviously others don't have the same experience.  But it may be worth a trial.

review/summary: One of the Best Health Products I Have Ever Purchased!
review/text: As a health nut and vegan, I wanted something that would provide a good source of nutrition and an array of health benefits. Just then, I stumbled upon maca powder and after much research, I decided to go with Navitas Naturals. I must say, I am now obsessed with this stuff; I can finish an entire bag in one week. However, I will admit when I first tasted maca powder, I was not too fond of the flavor. After trying many suggestions such as mixing it with coffee, I discovered that the best way, and most delicious way is to drink it with soy or some alternative milk. I personally love it mixed with soy milk and a hint of cinnamon powder :D. I have noticed an increase in my energy that lasts throughout the day... this is very important to me as a college student who deals with daily stress and tries to eat as best and healthy as I can while living in a new environment. So, to the people who are curious and interested in trying Navitas Naturals Maca Powder, I hope this review helps!

review/summary: Great for your Heart !!
review/text: I admit that there was an adjustment period for my body to fully embrace this supplement.  I experienced some edginess, etc.  But I stuck with it and here's what I found.<br /><br />As a woman of a certain age, I had been having some cardiac distress associated with hormonal changes, particularly overnight. I know that more women experience heart attacks during the night than the day, and that more women over 55 die from heart attacks than from cancer. Neither of these facts was "heartening" given what I was feeling, prior to taking Maca.<br /><br />I have also been using Magnesium which helped and which I recommend, particularly Natural Calm by Peter Gilham, as well as Nattokinase, Serrapeptase, and Dr. Pauling's protocol( high Vit C, Lysine, & Proline) to remove plague from veins and arteries, and felt that these supplements were working but clearly there was still some distress.<br /><br />Using 1 teaspoon of Maca alnog with my powdered wheat grass juice 2-3 times a day has eliminated that feeling of cardiac distress and has contributed to a growing sense of physical well-being and calm.  I believe that Maca, which works on the endocrine system is gently nourishing my body and eliminating physical stress as well as emotional stress.  I continue with Natural Calm and everything else I do to maintain physical wellness, but Maca has made the biggest difference in my life.<br /><br />If you're feeling stressed, consider trying Maca. I think you will find that it nourishes your body in important ways and makes you feel energetic and very calm.

review/summary: unstoppable energy, sans buzz
review/text: I bought this on a lark after seeing that it was an energy booster. They're not kidding. I'm a grad student and rarely get enough sleep (and really, how many of us do?), but after a smoothie with a spoonful of maca in the afternoon, I fell asleep effortlessly that night and then nearly exploded out of bed the next day (badly startling my poor bf, I'm afraid--he's always been a morning person, but I generally am a hard sleeper and require lots of loud noise, multiple alarm clocks and strong coffee in the morning to get going.) I've been charging out of bed every morning since. Yet there's no caffeine jitters, no crazy buzz; you can sit quietly or go work out or read or whatever you normally do.<br /><br />The taste--well, it's got a little bit of an unpleasant bite, and I find myself adding more fruit, agave nectar or stevia to my smoothies to compensate. Maca is also sold toasted (or maybe roasted?) and is supposed to be sweeter and much tastier that way, so if the taste is bothersome and you don't care if it's raw or not, that might be a good option.

review/summary: Good For The Libido!
review/text: First, I have to admit that the taste of this powder takes some getting use to, but I think the results are worth it. I've definitely notices a boost in my libido, mood, and appetite. My sex drive has been off the charts after taking this supplement for little over a week. I haven't noticed an increase in energy, but I would recommend Maca for anyone looking to improve the function of their endocrine system.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: First and foremost, this is the only maca powder I have tried.  I have tried a few items from the Navitas brand and I really like them, so I continue to buy their products.  Maca powder has a very unique taste to it.  It is reminiscent of malt powder, but it is somewhat bitter.  If you're a health food freak, you probably won't have any issues with that at all.  If you eat a more typical (but highly non-nutritious) Standard American Diet, then you will probably have issues stomaching the taste.  If you're trying to mask the taste, it would probably go well with chocolate or cinnamon.<br /><br />As to the effects of taking maca, I definitely feel better when I take it regularly than when I don't.  I have been traveling weekends this summer and haven't felt quite "on" when I'm not taking it during my travels.  I am also an endurance athlete and began taking maca powder when it was suggested to me that it would help with training stress.  I have been completing some very hard training weeks of 350+ miles on the bike and have yet to get sick.  None of these statements are scientific by any stretch of the imagination, but since studies with maca are few and far between, the anecdotal evidence will have to suffice!  It seems to work for me.  Your mileage may vary, of course.

review/summary: Attitude Improvement
review/text: OK, so I didn't experience a big energy boost.  It's not like I feel like I can shave 30 minutes off my marathon time or anything.  What I did feel, after about 2 weeks, was a much better attitude at work and I wasn't dragging around in a fog anymore.  Kinda like I was used to feeling like Monday morning before coffee, and suddendly it feels like Friday on my way to happy hour.  Little bit happier, little bit perkier.  And I don't feel like shooting my boss anymore.  My opinion of the taste, "very bitter."  It works good mixed in my morning orange juice.

review/summary: pretty good stuff
review/text: This was my first foray into maca as food. There is definitely a taste to maca which I am not accustomed to yet, and it can easily overpower some things with which I've combined it.  I've learned to go easy on the amount I'll add to pancakes or breads, though it's important to note that it combines differently with various other foods.  One friend said she thought it combined very well with a zucchini drink that she makes.  I've also had some success in combining it with cacao, but again I overdid it at first.  Go easy to begin with.

review/text: I've been a loyal fan/user of Sequel's MacaSure (powder form) in the past but it's fairly expensive, so when I stumbled across this Maca at this amazing price I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Well, I was ever pleasantly surprised! I liked using MacaSure like a spice/condiment, sprinkling it over omelettes and salads; I found Navita's Maca powder a little granier but every bit as pleasant tasting. In fact at this price I can afford to 'splurge' a little more with it! I'm so glad I got 2 bags! I'll definitely be back for more in the future! Thank You Navitas!!

review/summary: best maca powder I've ever tasted
review/text: I was told your maca powder was the best, so I ordered two bags to benefit from the free shipping.  I was a little leary when I opened the bag and it smelled stronger than any other maca powder I tried.  Then I mixed it in a protein shake and then a smoothie and I was convinced.  I couldn't taste the maca powder at all like I had with other brands.  I will definately continue to purchase my maca from Nativas Naturals.

review/summary: Very good taste and great nutrition!
review/text: I bought Navitas Maca after I tried a sample of another brand to add to my smoothies. I immediately felt the effect not in energy boost but in a very sharp and clear mind (surely the adaptogen qualities of the maca) a couple of minutes after I drank my raw cacao and maca smoothie and that effect lasted all morning long with just a tablespoon of maca.<br /><br />Indeed you have to let you body rest of maca about one week per month or the effects diminish or vanish. I noticed two weeks ago I wasn't having the same effect as before so this week I took Maca off my smoothies. But tomorrow: Maca again!!!<br /><br />I have never tasted along but in a Superfood smoothie and the smell is very good, almost sweet.

review/summary: for a quick result!
review/text: I have been suffering from hormonal issues since coming off the birth control pill. I started taking Navitas maca powder and in a week I noticed the difference, my complexion was all clean again. I also agree with the fact that it diminishes appetite. Every morning, the first thing I do is to drink the following mixture: 8oz water + 2tsp Bragg organic raw-unfiltered apple cider vinegar + 2tsp Navitas organic raw maca powder + 2tsp honey. I don't even have any breakfast till 1pm. I would recommend this to anybody, it's a very nice, enjoyable drink. I have to admit that I hate any type of vinegar, but I take it to help my body to balance its ph. Moderate bitterness of maca makes this mixture really nice. I am going to try other Navitas products too. And also, Amazon offers a good deal, this is cheaper than Whole Foods price.

review/summary: Great price for a super food
review/text: Hi, I just wanted to put my two cents in regarding maca. I learned awhile back that supplements, superfoods, herbs etc. must be taken consistently in order to experience results.I began taking maca for its<br />nutrition and reputed adaptogenic effects (similar to ginseng). I later learned through research that it is a food and does not need to be taken in small amounts.Since I was a part time softball player after work and trying to increase my fitness, I also increased maca intake. Oatmeal, smoothies, soup, beverages. I had maca at least twice a day in 1-2 ounce portions. I also want to add I was not on caffeine at this time- I valued my sleep. It took about 2 and a half weeks to notice a marked improvement in energy and mood.This experiment 3 years ago convinced me that maca works for me and I haven't been without it for long since.<br />  Do try this in small amounts first. The taste is not bad,but malty and a bittersweet, like dong quai.You will pay quite a bit more for small packaging and/or gelatin capsules, but it will be worth it if you can reap the benefits.Then go for the big bag and never let go of your health.

review/summary: the taste leaves little to be desired
review/text: I got my MACA powder about 2 wks ago and I was excited since I had heard so many good things about it. However, I have to say the taste and smell has made me very nauseous. I just tried mixing it with soy milk and it was just too much for me. I only mixed about a tsp into 10oz of soymilk. I could taste it and smell it at every gulp. I don't know if these reviewers got a different batch than I have but it definitely smells HORRIBLE. Like I want to throw up every time it passes under my nose. Since I am a college student, I just can't waste the entire thing like that. So I decided to make my own capsules. I feel like I can definitely make more than 300 veggie capsules with this bag. I have no problem drinking 6 capsules to drinking this raw MACA. Plus making my own capsules will probably end up cheaper than buying the capsules from another company. Then at least you know exactly what is going in it and you can buy another powder and mix that into the capsule too. And I would buy it again for that reason.<br /><br />Definitely an acquired taste.

review/summary: Interesting Flavor
review/text: It's a bit strong to be taken alone, but mixed with a smoothie/oatmeal/etc. it's a good addition. Apparently quite healthful, and the flavor also complements raw cacao well.<br /><br />FYI - I've read varying accounts about maca and it's health benefits. There seems to be a lot of support for the claim that maca is somewhat toxic in its raw form, and is more appropriately consumed in the cooked/gelatinized form? In addition, in the raw form it can have hormonal side-effects and is best taken 1) in the cooked form 2) with some other kind of additive to modulate that side effect. Apologies if any of this information is inaccurate, I know it IS second-hand. I just figure it's important to research the subject thoroughly on your own before you dive right out on a limb.<br /><br />And FWIW I have experienced no adverse side effects thus far from taking maca raw. No gastric distress, nausea, etc. and nothing weird or PMS-y, so maybe it affects different people differently.<br /><br />Good luck whatever you choose! :)

review/text: Today was my first day of taking Maca powder and I have to say that I have already noticed a difference in my level of energy. It doesn smell too bad as other's have mentioned and the taste wasnt as bad either. I actually just mixed mine in 8oz of water and just drunk it. I think the smell and taste are a bit over exaggerated on here and I was so relieved of this after trying it out. I will give another update in about a month or so. Oh and my boyfriend has been using it for about a week now and he too has seen results. Caution...do not take after 7pm at night because it may have you up all night. :) My boyfriend now knows to take it earlier in the day.

review/text: The reviews are mixed. So I have to say that you do get an odd, but favorable taste.  I can only tolerate 1 teaspoon in which I add to my coffee instead of sugar.  If you are a picky eater and can only tolerate things that are sweet and must fit perfect with your taste buds, then you will not like this.  But if you feel that you are a person who can tolerate taste and adjust, then go for it.  I actually look forward to adding to my coffee after two uses.

review/summary: Try it
review/text: The reviews as of today are correct.<br /><br />Navitas Naturals is a great brand. I prefer the cacao powder to the nibs but then freshness isn't a factor. I use a pound in no time. Be aware however, this is not a processed food. I've bought three pounds of cacao powder and all are slightly different in taste. I assume the Maca would be the same.<br /><br />Now..as to the taste. Well...it is different. Nothing something I would buy for the taste. It is smokey, deep, complex and if you take a lot, somewhat gagging. But I added  2 tbls to a 32 oz smoothie and couldn't really tell it was there (but then I loaded it down with cacao powder). It is also hydroscopic. More than instant potatos. Not as much as psyllium. Takes a few minutes to hydrate. Don't underestimate how much water it will absorb. It takes a lot.<br /><br />Medicinal benefits? I can't even sort out the anecdotal evidence I and those in my family I've given it to have experienced. Lots of clinical studies on the net. My concern, because liver failure was an issue, was it did no harm. And I don't see it did. Nor do I read of any in the literature.<br /><br />The five stars is twofold:<br /><br />I trust the brand (the packaging is great..it stands up in the cupboard and has a plastic liner. Light is kept out by the brown wrapper, water and air by the liner).<br /><br />Why not? The price is OK. Foodies (of which I am one) should know about Maca and this amount gives you more than enough to fool around with using it. Might be a recipe out there which needs a tsp or so of Maca in it to give it depth.<br /><br />Pills are usually overpriced and I want to see and taste the raw product (well not with some pills but with  supplements which are also foods).

review/summary: This natural food works ... a genuine SUPERFOOD
review/text: Given the lack of response to some key criticisms, though relatively few, of this food, I'll focus my review on why this nutritional powerhouse is classified as a SUPERfood and why, for what are obvious reasons, some folks do not like this awesome Organic Raw Maca. Maca is surely classified as a superfood, and why that is the case pertains to its exceptional potency. General speaking, the "better" a superfood tastes, the lower (that's right, the lower) the nutritional density. And why would this be the case? Well, simply because the most nutritionally dense superfoods -- such as Maca, chlorella, spirulina, broccoli sprouts, etc. -- often have very strong tastes that seem unusual to people used to drinking sugary beverages like sodas, processed fruit juices, etc.<br />Fortunately, since it's abundantly obvious to me that not everything that's good for me is going to taste like a Ritter Sport chocolate bar, I've been able to get past the subjective definitions or pronouncements on Maca's taste or flavor -- and most reviews by far out there, by the way, indicate a much more neutral, even positive assessment of Maca's taste. I for one, like so many Americans, want really good and sustainable energy, not the kind that comes at any kind of unnatural price, e.g., sudden crashes, nervousness, the jitters, stomach aches, headaches, cramps, etc. Fortunately through Maca, I've found significantly increased energy, overall alertness, focus, and enhanced powers of concentration....not to mention the physical energy for my lengthy & strenuous workouts. Though I jus' luvs me my coffee, there are numerous ways of getting that energy without the price of the smaller dives, total crashes and inevitable burn-outs.<br />If this entirely natural, special Maca-kind-of-boost is not important to you, then you don't need to try it.<br /><br />Having communicated all this, careful readers of all of the reviews here will probably be able to see why some do not like Organic Raw Maca Powder, often linked to questions about taste, culinary expectations, etc. To note, it's difficult for me to place much weight on reviews by those who have tried out a food (and I view Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Maca Powder, not as a product, but as an exceptional nutritional food) for only a few days (only 3!, in some instances) or a few weeks. Generally speaking, the better a superfood tastes, the lower the nutritional density, and this is because the most nutritionally dense superfoods -- such as wheat grass, spinach, barley grass, chlorella, spirulina, green tea (extract), broccoli sprouts, etc. -- often have very strong tastes that seem unusual to people used to drinking sugary beverages like sodas or processed fruit juices.

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT AND COMPANY!
review/text: When you've tried the rest get the best! Tons of info is available on the internet about this miracle root. I've been in the health and fitness all my life and believe that the all natural route is the best. I've been taking Maca Root for years and I'm convinced this company is the best source of the best quality product available. And no, I don't work for or represent the company; I just believe it is best to channel your energy in praising great products rather than crushing the bad ones who no one cares about anyway. There seems to be a misconception on what is healthy in the nutritional supplement realm, so I would like to help enlightened those in search of truly natural ways of health. For example, L-Arginine HCL, Acetyl L-Carnitine HCL and other branch chain aminos, synthetic hormones enhancers, etc... are widely sold as supplements by the most well-known commercial nutritional brands (won't mention names here), and are believed to be excellent nutritional sources. These are synthetically made in labs and are substances your body naturally produces. If you consume these regularly, your body gets lazy and will eventually stop reproducing them. Maca Root on the other end, is a natural source of whole food, which contains essential amino-acids, fatty acids and other great nutrients necessary for optimum health. I would also recommend throwing away all those weight gainers in your vitamin cabinet too. Raw Organic Hemp Protein is the best, with nothing added. For my sex drive, I'd say Maca Root gives a gentle boost, but I'd recommend alternating it or taking it with Tribulus Raw Power , 200 pills, 200,000 mg. High Potency, concentrated, Tribulus Terrestris muscle volumizer, male enhancement, for long term results and for immediate all natural results, I'd recommend Red Sex Dragon - Male Enhancement Pills - Male Performance. Those who expect an immediate and drastic sexual boost from Maca Root Raw Powder have an unrealistic approach. You may eventually see results with long term use and an overall healthy lifestyle, if want to feel the bang, get it at 100:1 Extract Ratio or higher, but it can get pretty costly.

review/summary: nice flavor, adds dimension and nutrition to smoothies
review/text: It took two smoothies and now I'm hooked. I love Navitas Naturals Maca! It has a really yummy butter-scotchy smell and flavor--after a couple of times. My first taste, a quick lick off a spoon, was bitter. I wasn't sure about it at all. But that wonderful smell made me try again. I put a teaspoon in my green smoothie and it wasn't bitter at all, it just imparted a new taste and depth. I love finding new ways to change up the flavor of my smoothies and this gives it a malty taste and a little bit of a bite and amps up the nutritional level to boot.
