review/summary: Natural Treats
review/text: I feed my three cats a natural diet but was unable to pair their natural diet with natural treats, I was stuck giving them grocery store brand treats since they stuck their noses up at the natural brands I brought home. They didn't like the chewyness or the jerky-style of the natural brands. I happened to find these one day and decided to give it a try and lucky for me, they liked them. My cats will forever prefer soft treats but we seem to have found common ground with these, it's the only natural-brand treat they'll eat.

review/summary: My cats loved them!!!
review/text: Another review said their cats wouldn't touch these treats. I guess all cats are different because my cats go crazy for these treats. The could be sound asleep and if I just get the bag out of the cupboard they come running! If you look at the ingredients, they seem more healthy than a lot of other treats on the market. I give these 5 stars! Highly recommend!

review/summary: Delightful Kinder Egg Knockoff
review/text: These ornaments are about the size of a tangerine and are wrapped in foil. Inside the foil is a yellow plastic ornament (really a yellow plastic ball that snaps open) that has a trinket inside. So far, I've seen two spinning tops and a package of stickers. For those of us lucky enough to have had Kinder Eggs over the years (they're illegal in the US), these are the closest thing to them I've found. They are much more fun for children than the Wonderball (hollow chocolate ball with candy or gum inside). The chocolate isn't very good, it reminds of the taste of the Palmer chocolate coins (edible but not tasty). The chocolate isn't the star of this show, it's the surprise inside. If a Wonderball was rated a 1 and a Kinder Egg a 10, these are probably a 6. For those who are not familiar with Kinder Eggs, these are absolutely wonderful and you'll think they're a 10! Totally worth the price for the delight on a child's or even an adult's face when they discover the toy inside.

review/summary: All of the Roland balsamic glazes are terrific!
review/text: I have purchased the original glaze, blood orange, ginger, pomegranate and whatever others there are.  I used to make my own by putting balsamic in a pan and reducing it, sometimes flavored with something else.  The Roland glazes are so much easier and just squirt out of the bottle in a nice thin stream.  Great on Bruschetta, pork chops, or whenever you would garnish a dish with thickened reduced balsamic, without the work.  They also last longer and don't end up with crud in the bottom of the bottle after a few weeks, like regular reduced balsamic does.

review/summary: Good Sauce But Overpriced Here
review/text: I've had this sauce; it's the only one my butcher sells.  I'm not a bbq sauce expert, and of course any premade sauce is going to be lacking in one way or another.  However, I find this one to be highly adaptable, not too heavy, but still good at adding the right sort of flavor you want in a slightly sweet, slightly vinegary, red bbq sauce.  This isn't the syrupy thick sort of coating, it's a bit lighter.  I particularly like it as a sauce for crockpot meat, which is super easy.  It seems to tenderize the meat as well.

review/summary: Definitely tastes great especially barbecue wings
review/text: I make hotwings a lot and when I do I make some barbecue for those that don't like the hot stuff. They love this stuff and its thin enough you can toss it like regular wing sauce. Plus its not full of crazy you can't pronounce fillers and corn syrup. Because of that it is quite runny, but I have used it straight up barbecue and brushed a few coats on. This is also great in the crock pot as well. You will like this stuff, I assure you.

review/summary: Not bad, but not good either
review/text: First off I ordered "thicker", I can only imagine how watery the original sauce is because the thick sauce isn't thick at all. If you are thinking of using this as a condiment, think again. This is really only good for soaking, prepping meat that is going to be put on the grill. As a BBQ sauce goes I would put it up there with most store bought brands. This is not worth the price tag.

review/text: When looking for a new breakfast food, I ran across the Harvest Blend Rice at Costco. Last night, in search for more, I discovered that Costco no longer carries this amazing product. I put some in my rice cooker, and serve it for breakfast with a nut/ground flax seed/banana mixture with milk. This is so much better than a bowl of cereal, and I stay full for a long time. I also cook up whole barley and whole wheat groats for breakfast. Thanks to the much touted Mediterranean diet, I have transformed breakfast.

review/summary: Tasty with Aroma...
review/text: I used to consume brown rice and used to purchase the organic ones from Whole Foods which was priced real well, .99 cents a lb but stopped consuming organic brown rice when I found out about quinoa few years ago. Nothing comes close to the nutritional value of quinoa especially Bob's which is the cleanest of all <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG3UE">Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa, 26-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>. Lately I came across this Harvest Medley Rice Blend and after tasting it now I consume less quinoa than I used to since this rice blend is that delicious. Brown rice goes rancid in six months which becomes worthless so I consume this real fast and keep unused portion in freezer. These are very small rice and draining it in a strainer is just impossible. The rice has such a good aroma that I truly enjoy mixing it with some spicy curry and place it in the refrigerator for future consumption. It is a hardy rice so I soak in the water few hours before cooking. Bravo.

review/summary: Best Rice Ever
review/text: I bought this rice at Costco on a whim because the nutrition label showed such great protein and fiber amounts.  I love rice, but this product is in a league of its own.  It is incredibly delicious and filling.  Like some other commenters I actually found myself craving this stuff for breakfast the next morning (I know, right?!).  When I went back to Costco, they were no longer carrying this rice which was a real let down because I was going to purchase some extra containers for other family members.  You owe it to yourself to try this rice.  It is simply delicious and is incredibly healthy to boot - two great things that go great together but you don't find them together very often.  Thank you SunWest for making this product and to Amazon for carrying it!

review/summary: Great choclate, decent price
review/text: I run a chocolate-of-the-month club at my work, and this was the July 2012 chocolate.  It's a good dark chocolate, with strong taste but not too bitter.  The cherries seem to be real cherries (which is better than fake) and add both sweetness and a little tart zing.  The downside is that they are a little gummy and stick to the teeth, as do the almonds.  Not a big fan of nuts in my chocolate, preferring the melt-in-your-mouth sensation.  The packaging is attractive and there is a poem inside, which doesn't add to the flavor but adds to the aesthetic when handing them out as a part of a club.  As far as "adult" chocolates go, I prefer Newman's Own, but this is a great fun chocolate and you don't see a lot of cherry chocolate bars.

I originally bought a box at a local store (which no longer stocks it) and enjoyed them. I could no longer find the box, so I started buying other Organic Mixes, which tasted nasty. When I thought I lost out on finding this mix again, I tried amazon and found it. I now subscribe to the delivery to this mix. If your son or daughter doesn't like this mix, go back to the local store and choose from an entire isle of nasty pancake mixes that make spongy pancakes.

review/summary: Great cat food.  It's a keeper!
review/text: All 3 of my cats love this food.  They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.  I really can't smell it once I stand up after putting it in the bowl.

review/summary: Excellent choice for my finicky feline!
review/text: Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her. I've been ordering on Amazon since it's been difficult to find it in my local pet stores lately.

review/text: Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go.

review/text: After my cat was diagnosed with renal failure, he refused to eat any of the canned versions of his vet prescribed food for kidney disease although he would eat Hill's Science Diet k/d dry food, but he was vomiting it up regularily. Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot's Stew. My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken, turkey and salmon varieties. Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots, peas and green beans, but he does eat them. I really like that Spot's Stew is an all natural cat food with no by-products or fillers, and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys.

review/summary: Dog Food Masquerading as Cat Food
review/text: My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally "stew," with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer.

review/summary: Cats review
review/text: I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed.

review/summary: My cat loves Spot's Stew, and I know it's good for him.
review/text: I've seen other reviewers say their cats wouldn't eat the vegetables in Spot's Stew. Before deciding for or against this product, try just a couple of flavors from Petco or Petsmart first. My cat goes ga-ga for all of this product, including the vegetables. Every cat's different. I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh! I wouldn't ever want my furry loved one to eat skin - that's like feeding a human infant McDonald's, no offense to McD's.

review/summary: Wow! Cat Food That Seems Yummy!
review/text: Wow! I have the pickiest cats in the whole universe.  The only wet food they eat is Spot's Stew Chicken.  I can get them to eat the Chicken/Beef flavor if I add some shaved Bonito but with three cats Slinky, Jester and Regal, only Slinky and Jester scarf the food down.  They will eat the chicken without the Bonito but Regal is another story.  She won't eat it at first but might come back later and eat some.  She will ONLY eat the Chicken and does not like Bonito so with her, it gets a little more tough.  However, this food is a wonderful consistency, smells good (to me the human) and I assume to the kitties as well because they LOVE this stuff.  For the vegetables, I don't know if cats really need them however, I mush them up with the meat and they don't notice.  If I miss mushing some, then yes they try to eat around the peas/carrots.  All I can say is thank goodness for this food.  I spent lots of money and time trying to find something they would like.  I also feed them a mix of Halo dry Sensitive Formula Turkey and Purina Dental Health.  In order to prevent urinary symptoms, I give my cats only fresh bottled water every day that I put in bowls all over the house.  With the good water, the good food and lots of petting, I have the happiest cats in Arizona!  Thank you Halo!!

review/summary: Chicken and Beef
review/text: I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe. Whenever I put it out at feeding time, there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot's Stew in them. With 5 kitty mouths to feed, the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot's Stew, so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied. Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting, those poor things that had to "settle" for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew. I have been so pleased with it, that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners.<br />But, at our house, WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines!

review/summary: Picky felines love this canned food
review/text: My two cats somehow never figured out how to use their teeth to bite into their food--given dry food, they'll just use their tongues to lick it up and swallow the kernels whole, with an occasional bite with the teeth to crunch on food that's already been delivered into their mouths.  For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.  Anyways, thank goodness for Spot's Stew, otherwise my teeth-challenged cats would never have been able to enjoy wet food!

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.

The soft texture, and good nutrition, is excellent for (1) the elderly cat (2) the cat who's sick and (3) the cat who will literally eat anything, but you'd prefer he eat something healthy!<br /><br />This is "human quality" cat food, meaning the ingredients are pure enough for a human to eat, and it smells a little like chicken pot pie filling!

The breeder I got him from didn't give me any of his old food, and I had heard that switching food quickly causes stomach upset... but I read about Spot's Stew being great for problem tummies and it's true! My kitten has never had any problems on this food since we brought him home. Also, from the human perspective, this stuff smells like chicken/turkey/fish and not like dog vomit, like certain brands of cat food. Big plus for me.

So she leaves not only the veggies, and there are a lot of them, but also a good bit of the chicken surrounding each veggy.  This makes for more waste than I am willing to tolerate so I won't be buying any more Spot's Stew.

So I thought this was the greatest thing...but the next time I fed them the one cat decided the novelty had worn off and wanted nothing to do with it.  The other one though continued to chow down, and again left the veges, but came back later and ate most of them.  The next serving -what do you know -neither of them wanted it anymore.  I don't get it -I've never had cats like something so much one day and the next day be turned off from it.  I'm very disappointed, I wanted them to like it, knowing how good it is for them.

review/summary: Great Alergen-Free Dog food
review/text: My 6 year old German Shepperd loves this dogfood and it has done wonders for her skin.  She is on an Immunosupressant Allergy Treatment, but it only treats environmental allergies.  In addition to 3 types of pollen, dust and grain mites she is also allergic to Rice, Yeast, Corn, Wheat, Beef and Horse.  I couldn't find a single store brand (non-prescription) dog food, until this one, that has none of the ingredients that she is allergic.  I can attest to the quality of this product since her allergies are VERY severe and the slightest amount of rice or beef and she would break out in hives and chew her paws until they bleed.  She is also very sensitive to grain mites and since the dog food comes sealed, this is an excellent preventative measure.  There is not a whole lot the manufacturer can do for grain mites once the bag is opened, aside from starting with quality ingredients, so I still recommend storing the food in a sealed container out of the heat/moisture if this is a problem for your dog as well.  Freezing it is another good option which is what I do since my house is very damp (she doesn't mind it cold).  I have tried other Hypo-Allergenic and Limited Ingredient dog foods before this one and this is the only one that my German Shepperd isn't allergic to.

So far it is the only food I have found that she doesn't turn her nose up when I put it in her bowl. She also really loves the canned version of Organix grain free.<br /><br />Update:<br />Just wanted to report that normally my dog gets very dry, itchy skin in the winter which leads to hot spots, infections, hair falling out and vet visits.

review/text: We have this Pancake and Waffle mix and we prepare it with Rice milk as my daughter is allergic to dairy AND Soy. It is DELICIOUS. We make Mickey Mouse shaped waffles together, She eats an entire waffle herself. I eat them too because they are SO Delicious and it is easier than making seperate waffle mixes. Plus I think they taste BETTER than regular waffles. Very light and fluffy. We are just finishing our first box (which makes 9 waffles) and I am going to order a case from Amazon because the price is excellent. I paid almost $7 for one box at a local health foods store. I haven't made them into pancakes yet, because we have a waffle iron and it's just simple. Each 1 cup of mix makes 3 waffles. We each eat one and then I put the remaining prepared mix in the fridge and it keeps until the next day or two days later to make another waffle for her. Wonderful product and I can't thank them enough. Check out their website and save the bottom of your boxes. We have Chocolate Cake Mix and frosting to try next!

review/summary: So bad I returned it... a sticky mess.
review/text: This is the worst gluten-free pancake mix I ever bought in my life!! First I tried it on a well-seasoned iron pan (we don't use "nonstick" pans here because teflon contains harmful chemicals). It stuck so badly after 2 tries that I had to soak the pan... not even brillo (which ruins pans) could get it off. Then, not wanting to waste the rest of the mix I'd made, I got out my nonstick waffle iron, adjusted the recipe and tried again. (I oiled it REALLY WELL with ghee, which works best as a cooking oil to prevent sticking). It stuck to the waffle iron so badly that I had to end up scraping it with a fork. I ruined the waffle iron's surface doing this. The taste of the scraps (I didn't want to throw them away) was all right, very "gooey," but even the crispy parts got soggy in syrup more than most gluten-free mixes. If only they could find a way to get this to work I guess it would be all right but I am very frustrated right now after disappointing my daughter and ruining my favorite waffle iron and pan. I don't know what people who liked this product did to get it to work. BTW I don't use rice milk, we used regular dairy milk because we're not dairy-allergic or vegans. If this is a problem they should say so on the box, because I ALWAYS do substitutions with pancake mix recipes and it's never usually a problem. Not everyone has rice milk on hand.

I ended up with burnt, partially cooked gloop and a very messy iron griddle. The second day I tried to match the directions on the box as carefully as possible, and added extra oil to the griddle. The pancakes turned out better, but still stuck to the cooking surface. What seemed to help the most was keeping the heat very low. This morning I tried making them again, with results similiar to the second batch. I will not use this brand again, because I prefer to add berries to my pancakes, and it takes way too long to scrape the burnt bits off my iron griddle!<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, these have a sweet vanilla note without being cloying (which I liked), but they taste strongly of baking powder. They remind me in flavor and texture of mochi, so I suspect that the white rice flour on the ingredient list is a sticky rice flour.<br /><br />All in all, I've had much better luck with other pancake mixes!

review/summary: Gluten free dreams indeed!
review/text: I have been gluten free for so long, I almost forgot what a "real" waffle tastes like.  I was looking for an easy mix that would work without too much fuss.  I tried a box of this mix and was very pleased.  Not only I love the waffles, so does my husband.  I played with adding a bit of protein mix to the waffles and even that did not change the taste or the texture.  I usually make the entire box and refrigirate the remaining waffles.  They are great even toasted.  Huge fan!

review/summary: Did not like this particular mix at all
review/text: I am a loyal fan of Cherrybrook products especially their pancake mixes.  I started out with the whole grain but unfortunately Amazon must of had some issues w/ stocking it.  I moved on to the reg. pancake mix which is great minus the fiber content which I prefer.  We normally add chocolate chips to our mix for a fun surprise at breakfast for the kids so I thought why not try the mix w/ them in it.  Wow, I must say we all spit it out on the first bite.  We are pretty easy w/ tastes, but for some reason this particular mix was just aweful....sorry to say.  If you have a special diet/needs, this might work for you but I will go back to the original mix and be happy.

review/summary: Amazing waffles
review/text: We weren't so crazy about the pancakes we made with this mix. They weren't bad, but they weren't great. But when we used it for waffles, wow! Crunchy outside, chewy inside, and any extras keep well in the freezer. I prefer these to waffles made with wheat--which is amazing because, to my taste, things with rice flour are usually nowhere near as good.<br /><br />So now we can all really enjoy a family waffle breakfast with my son who's allergic to eggs. Yum.

review/text: My son has been on a gluten-free diet for three years; he's also allergic to all nuts.  Cherrybrook Kitchen Pancake Mix is by far the **best** mix we've tried, and we've tried them all.  The taste and texture are excellent.  They're really light as opposed to the typical really dense gluten-free mixes.  We add chocolate chips, and they're awesome! :) I've added cinnamon and sugar to the mix and then topped them with cinnamon butter which was also excellent. This is the only mix we've tried that would get me to sit down to a plate of pancakes! We've tried a couple other CBK products and love them as well (premade choc frosting, choc chip cookie mix and mini choc chip cookies). ENJOY!!!

review/text: I don't know what I am doing wrong this these. I'm using oil, low/medium heat and they stick LIKE CRAZY to my non stick pan in under one and half minutes (the box says "cook for two minutes"). They aren't exactly burning, just sticking like super glue to the pan. It's horrible. I've read other reviews that say the same thing. I've made pancakes so many times before and this was such a frustrating experience. Never again.

review/summary: Best Gluten/Dairy Free Pancake EVER!!
review/text: My boys are both milk protein intolerant. They also have food allergies and sensitivities as well. When my oldest son who is special needs had to give up milk he was devastated. It took ages to find a "cheese" he could have and pizza was even worse. By far though, pancakes where the worst thing to replace. One of his many issues is Sensory Processing Disorder, his oral issues are numerous. One being a VERY sensitive pallet, he notices a slight change in just about everything! I must've ran through dozens of homemade pancakes, and almost as many boxed mixes. None were even close to being anything he'd even sit next to, let alone eat. So, when he not only sat down next to a plate full, but took a big sniff, followed by an even bigger bite, I almost cried!<br /><br />Since then, he will eat nothing else. In fact, at his birthday party this weekend, he's having a birthday pancake stack! He won't eat cake because of the texture of it. I'm so thankful for this product and now for finding the ability to order it online!!<br /><br />I saw several people mention it sticking. I don't use a waffle iron but, I use a cast iron pan to do his pancakes in. All I do is give it a little (I do mean a light) spray before each pancake. Not a single one has stuck on me yet. When I make them, I make a whole box worth of them too and then refrigerate or freeze them for the week or two ahead. Then pop them in the microwave to reheat when he's ready for them. 1 box generally lasts us a week. Pancakes being a little bit over 4" and all, I don't think that's bad by any means.<br /><br />Oh and these pancakes are soo delicious that even my 13 yr old stepson can't get enough of them and asks for them when he comes to visit! Believe it or not, the kid is a very picky eater too. So, trust me when I say this pancake is THE best allergy friendly pancake I've ever eaten!

review/text: I've tried a number of gluten free pancake mixes, these are the thickest so far. Mine turned out more the texture of french toast than pancakes, but I think adding some more liquid would help. They have a nice vanilla flavor. If you are able to tolerate dairy, I think the Pamela's mix is closer to "real" pancakes, but for the DF this is a decent substitute.

review/text: My son has multiple allergies and has had a very restricted diet from birth. He is also a typical picky 2-year old. He really likes this product. We make it as waffles in a not-so-expensive waffle maker. They turn out great. I make them in small quantities, so it was difficult to measure volume. I transferred all the measurements to weight and use an accurate scale and my waffles are turning perfect every time from that point. My husband and I like them too. So, it is easy to "share" my son's food so that he feels he is included.

I've been gluten and casein free for a couple of years now and this is by far the best mix I've found for pancakes and waffles - even better than Pamela's or Bob's. Great all around from the low allergen to the ease to prepare and store any leftover batter.

They cook better than my old recipe that used oat flour and the first time my son had them he wanted to eat them for breakfast and lunch.  They cook better if you allow the batter to sit longer than the suggested five minutes, but they are just great either way. I couldn't find them in my local store but Whole Foods in Atlanta sells these and my son enjoys them on the weekends.  I thank Cherrybrook Kitchen for providing this product.

review/text: I first experienced these liquor filled delights in Italy. And when I returned I gave a box of them to my wife. She has always loved the European liquor candies, but they are so hard to find here in the US. They are the kind of thing that you keep for special moments... Maybe in the evening with a nice cup strong coffee... when the kids are in bed... And you can sit back and spoil yourself a little... But they are so good that you will want to spoil yourself a lot more often!!! :-))))<br /><br />From the first bite as the chocolate candy opens up, releasing that wickedly delicious liquor (and it is REAL liquor) to overwhealm your taste buds and slip warmly down your throat... To the deliciously firm Marachino cherry center, and the finish of excellent creamy milk chololate... It is a wave of pleasure... You know, I think I'm going to run off and have one! :-)))))))))) You should buy some too! You won't be sorry!

I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia!

I have no idea what the substance is, maybe that's what the truffles look like after they've melted in shipping or something but it is certainly not something I am going to eat.  What a disappointment, my wife and I had these truffles at Christmas time and they really were the best chocolate either of us has tasted.  I've never had a bad experience shopping through Amazon before but this one has left a bad taste in my mouth, exactly the opposite of what I was expecting.  BTW the seller was listed on the packing receipt as Potential Dynamix LLC.

review/text: I was very disappointed to learn that the "centuries-old Belgian tradition" in this case included the use of palm kernel oil and other non-dairy fatteners instead of actual heavy cream.  I don't have the ingredient list in front of me, but it was NOT, for example, what you'd even find in a box of Lindt truffles.  It's highly processed junk chocolate, and a huge disappointment.  I gave one of the boxes away.  That being said, the flavor was decent, so I gave them two stars, but haven't been able to eat more than two of them at a time because of the greasy film in my mouth afterwards.  Even with a good flavor, though, selling these as "real" Belgian truffles is marketing bunk, and Donckels should be ashamed of themselves.  Better to charge a little more and use quality ingredients.

review/summary: Delicious chocolate, not shipped well
review/text: Someone gave me these chocolates for the holidays and they are terrifice.<br />I thought that ordering from Amazon would be great but...<br />It's the dead of winter here and the contents was one hard white block or ..something. The expiration date was two weeks from the date they arrived.<br />I returned them but I think that I will have to find them in local stores.<br /><br />They are..the best chocolates I've ever had when they are fresh.

review/summary: Melt in your mouth explosion
review/text: These chocolates are absolutely the best.  I had a bunch of co-workers come by and have some.  I advised them to let the chocolate melt in your mouth... don't chew.  A while later many of them came back to tell me about the awesome experience they had.  Simply the best chocolate they have had.<br /><br />The secret is to let the chocolate slowly melt.... as it does you experience a sensational explosion of taste.  Wonderful treats.  And for this price it is amazing... it rivals the French chocolates at a store down the street..... at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />Enjoy...and make sure to let these delightful nuggets slowly melt in your mouth.

review/summary: Control Yourself and You'll be Fine. May cause explosive diarrhea if you dont.
review/text: Let me say these are very good and very rich in taste which is good and bad.  By rich I don't mean if you look around the Monopoly guys house you would find a box of these.  So I found myself eating about eight in one minute which was quite excessive but man they were good.  Even my wife ate quite a few and we both agreed to put the bag up or we would finish it up.  Not a good thing since in four pieces I think there is fifteen grams of saturated fat and around two hundred forty calories.  We usually don't get sweets but when we do we indulge.  When you first eat one it tastes really good but after its been chewed the aftertaste sets in.  I did notice after a couple the taste gets unbearable so I had to drink something.  The dark chocolate is so rich that it is kind of overbearing after awhile but still they are very good.  I wouldn't say its my favorite chocolate but they do offer a certain taste I was looking and I am glad I bought them.  I wish there was a smaller bag to sample them with but we took a gander and really liked them.  Try them out and they might fit your taste.  If you are like me you will find yourself eating one after another which I don't recommend.  Oh yeah I did have major stomach cramps and a case of diarrhea afterwards but it was worth it just for those moments of bliss.  Thank you Donchels.

review/summary: Chocolate Snob's Opinion
review/text: By far, this is the very best chocolate that has passed my lips. I am the atypical chocoholic for only the very best will I eat. Since I tried Donckles no other chocolate will do, and, since it is exorbitantly expensive, I will do without rather than substitute. Shortly after the end of the year, I was able to purchase this wonderful experience from Marshall's department store. Their supplies have long since vanished.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Wow
review/text: Received these as a gift at Easter.  Unexpectedly smooth, delicious, quality candy.  I am not a huge chocolate fan or even a big candy fan but these are irrisistable. I am searching online to see where I can find more for myself and to give as gifts.

review/summary: No Better Chocolate Than This!
review/text: These things are the bomb! The Shiz Nizzle! The Whoopity Whoop Whoop!<br />I have had the pleasure of tasting true Swiss chocolate and yeah, thats<br />good stuff, but THESE???  You aint had nothin yet!  These chocolates<br />blow them away! Smooth, creamy, true melt-in-your-mouth bliss! They are<br />dusted in cocoa powder so at first they taste a little bitter, but once that<br />cocoa dissolves and you get to the real-deal . . . well, you just have to<br />experience it on your own. I usually have two a time, the first one I let<br />melt all the way and the second I let melt a little bit and then I cant resist<br />the urge to chew it. Both ways are awesome. After eating these, I balk at a Kiss,<br />turn my nose at Dove, and Ghirardelli? Not even close. So what are you<br />waiting for? Order the 3 pack!

review/text: The taste was still the same but the boxes were tattered and there was no dusted cocoa on the outside. I could not give it as a gift because of the appearance. I was disappointed but my hubby and kids were happy.

review/text: It is the best choice forever. I brought it to my colleagues and got a bunch of cheers. The only thing confuses me is it came as a whole block instead of seperate pieces shown on the package.

review/summary: They Don't Get Any Better
review/text: Donchels Cocoa Dusted Belgian Chocolate Truffles is really a superb candy.  In my experience they have only been bested by fresh chocolates, ones that have been prepared that very same day, (e.g., in NYC, a store called Li-Lac, cooks their deserts that very same day and when they run out of them, they run out.  They don't try to fake it by using yesterday's product.<br /><br />But barring those unusual offerings. Donchels is at the top of my list (for truffles).  The outer candy is firm, but not not crunchy, and the inner chocolate cream was soft, sweet, and simply melted in my mouth.<br /><br />I did not experience the gastrointestinal "issues" that some of the other reviewers here speak of because I limited myself to 3 of the truffles spread out through the day (the last being at bedtime).  That way I was always looking forward to something a bit later (and it took much will to avoid "cheating"),  Certainly during the winter months, shipping should not be a problem (not so for late spring through late fall...these puppies tend to melt unless they are taken very good care of until delivery...I can't speak to that since I've always ordered them in cool/cold environments).  My advice: give them a try during the winter.
