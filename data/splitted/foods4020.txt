review/summary: heaven & hell
review/text: These things smell like the dampest, rankest corner of hell, however my dog absolutely LOVES THEM.  He runs around snorting and darting from room to room with it in his mouth - unusual for him these days given that he is 14 years old.  Joseph has always loved his treats but I can't remember seeing this much joy over a treat in a long time.<br />These aren't treats that you'll be using all day long - I would say one every other day, or once a day, at the most.<br />Kudos to this company for putting out a treat that is purely for their intended consumer (your dog!). Most often pet-products are marketed to humans, without as much regard for the pet's actual enjoyment of the product. This is a complete reversal of that strategy and I respect PetKind wholeheartedly for that.  Trust me, your dog would much rather have this over a little faux-Cheetoz puff.

review/summary: Good for the dog but they stink so bad I puked my dinner -_-
review/text: Tripe is extremely good for your dog.<br />Unbleached tripe (like this) is even better because all the good bacteria are still in the tripe and will help improve your dog's GI tract.<br />If your dog is having gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea, you can try this treat out to hopefully prevent such problems in the future.<br />Note: Don't give it when your dog is having diarrhea unless your vet says its ok!<br /><br />Now the bad part.<br />They stink so bad.<br />So bad its beyond disbelief.<br />Other reviewers have said it stinks, but I thought it is just exaggeration.<br />After experiencing firsthand, I will tell you that they are not. This smells worse than a sewerage leak.<br />It smells like food garbage decomposing!<br />I have to wash my dog's paws and mouth each time after he finishes the treat. The stain will still remain if I wipe it, so I have to wash him -_-<br />I make him eat it on the porch too because he makes the carpet stinks so bad if he eats on the carpet.<br /><br />I think I will finish this bag of treats since it is so good for my dog.<br />But, I won't buy it again, unless my dog is having problems with his GI tract.<br /><br />if you can stand bad smells, don't let this deter you as much as it has for me.<br />And don't let the bad smell undermine this excellent product (if you can stand it).

review/summary: So Far, So Good
review/text: I drink only flavored coffee.  Thus far, my favorites are Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee; Timothy's German Chocolate Cake; Van Houtte's Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and Spicy Mayan Chocolate.  The last one was my No. 1 favorite, so I was heartbroken to learn that it has been discontinued. I am currently rationing each precious K-Cup from my very last box of 24.<br /><br />Two days ago, I saw and purchased my first box of Folger's Vanilla Biscotti,  (Who knew that Folger's made K-cups?)  It's too soon to know for certain, but there is a good chance this flavor will make my list of favorites.  The good news is that Target sells it and other 18 count boxes of Folger K-Cups for $10.85.  That means you can buy 36 for $21.70.  Compare that to the greedy sellers on this page who get $48.46 and $43.04 (with shipping) respectively.

review/summary: Average columbian coffee, good but not great
review/text: Had hoped for a really good cup of columbian coffee, and columbian (preferably supremo) is among my very favorites. As I drink 8 cups a day, I've tasted lots of coffees and lots of beans from around the world.  While this is a decent coffee, probably 4 stars when compared to other non columbian coffees, it is not among the better columbian coffees. My guess is that they use a higer percentage of just average columbian beans, and not many supremo beans. The roast is medium, but it is a little more bitter than you might expect for columbian.  I would recommend millstone columbian supremo if you want a good cup of columbian coffee. Supremo is the grade of bean, so if you don't see that you know you are getting a cheaper bean.

review/text: Coffee is very much a personal taste choice. My favorite is Folgers Medium Roast Colombian in K-cups. It has a bolder taste than the Green Mountain breakfast blend, but is not overpowering. It is smooth tasting. Everyone has their favorites and this is mine. I was drinking Folgers coffee long before getting a Keurig brewer.

review/summary: I have 6 favorites, this is one of them
review/text: This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.<br /><br />Regarding coffee, I like strong and smooth.  I don't like French roast as I find it too harsh, but I do like Italian roast.  Kona is great and I like Hazelnut, Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.<br />I drink my coffee with probably too much (at least 2-3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee) of evaporated milk in it or plain non-dairy creamer. No sugar.<br /><br />That being said...my favorite coffees are:<br /><br />Green Mountain Hazelnut Dark Roast Extra Bold<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee<br />Newman's Own Extra Bold<br />Tully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra Bold<br />Folger's Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti<br /><br />and a special mention for<br />Timothy's World Coffee German Chocolate Cake - It has an almost coco-nutty taste to it. Not the deep chocolate taste I was looking for, but the best I have found so far. Please if you can suggest a Dark Chocolate Flavor coffee to me; do so.<br /><br />Also since I have posted a review about a Senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to Keurig a bit about why... if you're interested..which why I put it last.  Feel free to ignore it.<br /><br />We decided to get a Keurig coffee maker after enjoying the Senseo system for over 3 years.<br />Please note, since we got the Senseo system essentially free, not much thought was put into it's purchase. However it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems.<br /><br />We switched to the Keurig system from the Senseo for several reasons.<br /><br />1. Local availability of coffee. For some reason the Senseo system was waning here at the Rochester NY grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee?  Yes, you can buy online, but sometimes when your planning isn't the best, you might run out. What coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences.<br /><br />2. Online purchases of Senseo coffees  were either for 4 bags of 16-18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees. Invariably there was a few you didn't like.  I never saw small quantities of 5 or so.<br /><br />3. The Senseo "duck" for filling  with your own coffee never worked for us.  I'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector. We literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could. Maybe we had a faulty unit, but based on reviews here, we were in good company. I knew many that had luck with the Keurig system however and we did as well.<br /><br />4. Once you open a bag of Senseo pods, they are starting to go stale, by virtue of being open to air. The Keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors "open" at once. Yes for those of you that are "green" there is more plastic waste. However I'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee.

review/summary: Really good coffee, good to the last drop
review/text: With all the fancy coffee names out there, leave it to one of the old originals to come up with a great k-cup coffee.  I remember when I was a kid at my grand parents watching them drink Folgers coffee.  It was the only kind they would drink.  The old red can.  When I saw this k-cup with the Folgers name on it, I bought it out of nostalgia, as much as anything.  After receiveing it, we loved it, too.  It has a very mild taste and flavor.  Not quite as much "vanilla" as some of the other vanilla flavored coffees out there, but just the right amount.  To re-use an old phrase, it is "good, to the last drop"!

review/summary: Good coffee - Could have been fresher.
review/text: Folgers Gourmet Selections, Lively Colombian Decaf, is good-tasting coffee, as far as decaffeinated coffee is concerned.  I find it is the perfect strength for me. It is between mild and strong. However, the boxes I received from Amazon expired in about a month.  Those I received from Keurig had 6 months expiration, so were a lot fresher.  For the price paid on Amazon, I feel the product should have had a later expiration date.

review/summary: Tastes exactly like my drip Folgers.
review/text: I grew up on Folgers coffee. It was simply the best affordable coffee that could be drank on a daily basis. I was glad that Folgers has formulated there distinct coffee for the K-Cup. A few years ago I did try using folgers ground coffee in one of those <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and it just did not come out right. I have had no luck with the refillable K-Cup with any brand of coffee. I honestly believe that a lot of product testing goes into these K-cups. It's not as simple as fill it up and run water through it.<br /><br />Folgers Columbian  K-cups taste exactly like I made it way back when with my Mr. Coffee. Becuse you are able to adjust the amount of coffee used in the Drip brewers this may or may not be as perfect of a match for your tastes. The one constant is the all important aftertaste. The Extra-Bold Newman's own and Doughnut Shop K-cups have a long, strong aftertaste that I really enjoy but they give you strong coffee breath. By comparison This Folgers has less of a aftertaste which Is nice when you know you will be in conversation with someone.<br /><br />There are many Columbian coffee K-cup choices and in reality they are all good. If you loved Folgers in the past. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Update 8-7-2011<br />I have been drinking this now for well over 3 weeks now and I have to say it is now my new fav everyday coffee. Our 2 mainstays used to be Doughnut Shop by Coffee People <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> and Breakfast Blend by Green Mountain <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> Folgers has replaced Breakfast Blend which is the milder of the 2.  Sooo Good!

review/summary: Tales of a Coffee Snob
review/text: I'm what I refer to as a "middle-level" coffee snob; that is, I don't need a Barista to enjoy a good cup of coffee but I don't drink the plebeian brands (Maxwell House, Folgers, et al), either.  We were in Vermont for the weekend when the hostess of the B&B in which we were staying served a delicious coffee at breakfast.  Inquiring as to the brand, she told us it was Folgers Black Silk.  I couldn't believe that Folgers made such a rich, robust, yet smooth coffee.  As soon as we got home, I went out and bought a can of Black Silk, as well as ordered a box of K-cups from Amazon.  It's every bit as good at home as it was in Vermont.  The object lesson here: "Don't be such a snob; try new brands and varieties...some of them might pleasantly surprise you!"

review/text: This review pertains to the Black Silk only. If you are thinking of skimping on your next K-Cup purchase, read this.<br /><br />No surprise, but you get what you pay for. While many of the other brands of K-Cups say "100% Arabica Coffee" on the side of the package, these merely say, "100% Coffee" - so you know there's gotta be some Robusta in there somewhere. I'd say the flavor is OK if you enjoy the free coffee at your local car dealership while waiting for a repair. Maybe even a step up to "diner coffee." Not terrible, but definitely leaves a burned aftertaste in your mouth. These were OK to try, but I would spend the extra pennies for better quality K-Cups in the future.

review/summary: Ok for a K-Cup, but not quite the vanilla flavor you'd hope for
review/text: For Folgers and this being a K-cup, it's not that bad for instant brew. But if you are looking for a bold cup of Vanilla coffee, this ain't it. It's mild in the coffee area and the flavor is like a mix of vanilla and butter toffee. While the taste is off a bit in the Vanilla area, it at least does not have that chemical taste of other vanilla k-cups I've tried.

review/text: I do not drink fancy coffee.  I do not own a burr grinder or an espresso machine.  I do like to fill up my Contigo cup for the commute to work.  I find that Folgers makes a smooth cup of coffee to drink on the way to work.  I actually use 1 3/4 of water to brew mine so it fills my cup to the top.  A single pack of sweetener and I'm off to work.  I purchased 3 of these 36 count packs because it was cheaper than picking them up from Walmart ($10.87 + tax for 18 count)

review/summary: Definitely the tastiest of the Folgers K-Cups
review/text: Given that Folger's is basically "supermarket coffee" rather than any kind of gourmet blend, I was surprised by how good the Folger's K-Cups were.  So far, I've tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IREFJI">Lively Colombian</a> as well as these, and I definitely like these the best.  They're not as good as the extra bold flavors from Green Mountain or Coffee People, but if you can get them at a decent price, they're worth trying.  If you can get the GM or CP brands for about the same price, you'd be crazy to buy these.

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty coffee at a nice price
review/text: Let's face it - "Folgers" isn't a name that usually springs to mind when you think of great coffee, but this isn't bad.  Nice aroma, a balanced blend that's not too strong, but still provides plenty of flavor.  Give it a try if you're tired of overpriced K-Cups that cost almost what a coffee shop would charge.  Mrs. Olsen would approve.<br /><br />UPDATE: my review was based on a purchase price that figured out to 46.5 cents per cup.  They were worth trying at that price.  The current price of 65 cents a cup puts them in the same price-range as gourmet brands like Green Mountain or Coffee People, and they're not even close to the same quality as those brands.  If you can find them for under fifty cents a cup, they're worth trying.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.

review/summary: Nice option, especially when you need to surve a variety of tastes in a hurry
review/text: My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Folgers Kcups - Messed up packaging
review/text: I got my most recent 3 pack product in April and two of the three boxes had kcups that had expanded - I mean that the bottom was round and puffed out.  When put in the Keurig, a couple of them popped at the top and spritzed/leaked coffee out of the keurig and onto my counter.  The others crumpled when used.  We pay a lot of money for kcups and I encourage you to check all three boxes when you get them to make sure they are normal.  I am wondering what kind of extremes the packages are subjected to in storage and/or transit.  One of the three boxes had all kcups as they should be (sealed tight, flat bottoms).  When I reorder, I will check each box and return any with the defective packaging.<br /><br />Folgers Black Silk Kcup coffee is smooth, flavorful and doesn't get buried when you add milk (latte) or cream.  Delicious!

review/text: I'm so glad I decided to search for Jordan Almonds.  They are my husband's favorite and they are not readily available where I am located.  One specialty store carries them however they are very expensive.  I was pleased to find a five pound bag at a very reasonable price.  The almonds arrived in tact, not broken, and tasted wonderful.  Will definitely be buying again.  Would appreciate a Super Saver Shipping option, though.

review/text: These almonds were all I expected them to be, and more!!  They arrived on time and very very fresh and unbroken. Not a single broken piece!  This, I've come to realize, is unusually good when ordering more than 1 pound of this confection.  My husband and I have to control ourselves so as to not eat too many at one time!  So so good.  Thanks for making such delicious candied almonds.<br />From:  a devoted Jordan Almond lover

The shell was crisp but not so hard I couldn't chew them right away. I went through 5 lbs in about 2 weeks and I didn't want to share 8) Fabulous!

review/text: Prince of Peace Peony White is better classified as a Shou Mei grade of tea. It forms a relatively dark brew in the cup, reminiscent of a green tea or perhaps an Oolong. Nevertheless, its taste is smooth and pleasing with little astringency. All in all, this a good deal on a decent cup of tea - but if you're looking for a true white tea, you should search elsewhere.

review/summary: A decent-tasting white tea
review/text: For a convenient tea in a teabag, this is a good buy, largely due to a lack of bagged white tea availability in most locales.  White tea is believed to be even more beneficial than green tea in some ways, and can have quite a bit less caffeine then green or black if the tea is immature enough.<br /><br />For most of this year, I have been using bulk teas (silver needles and rooibos) with a Swissgold infuser--all purchased from Amazon.  I now notice the paper taste on normal teas I once thought were perfectly fine.  That said, the flavor from the paper in this tea is not too bad, and thankfully, the floral-fruity tea flavor comes out okay.  The bag uses unbleached filter paper and the tea is organic.<br /><br />I find a sweetener and a brewing temperature under 180 degrees helps this tea.  Another reviewer stated this white tea produces a darker tea, and I definitely find this to be true.<br /><br />As with Silver Needles, I find I can focus better on work or study.  This effect starts within twenty minutes of drinking.  However, Silver Needles seems to produce no jittery "caffeine" effect while this one can a bit.  I have had other white peony teas that have no caffeine "jittery-effect", but these are ones I've had at good cafes, and they were bulk, but pricier teas.<br /><br />A higher-grade, better tasting white tea, Silver Needles, is also available on Amazon.  We get the Davidson's Tea Silver Needles in bulk.  If you are looking for a pure white tea with no flavorings of any sort, this White Peony and the Davidson's are the two to try.<br /><br />The Davidson's Tea Silver Needles is here:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SANUEK">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Silver Needles, 16-Ounce Bag</a>

review/summary: Good value, great for your health
review/text: I'm not naturally drawn to any tea, but for health reasons I've been trying to pick it up for years, mostly trying green teas.  I never could make a habit of it until I found a small box of this locally.  In the past 5 months, I've averaged 4 cups a day and have officially developed a positive habit.  I'm still not in love with the taste, though I find white tea easier to stomach than some green teas that were grassier, but I do enjoy the experience of drinking white tea and I enjoy its effects.  Rather than a caffeine buzz, teas have a balance of caffeine and l-theanine that provide mental clarity and aid focus, the balance in white tea is just right for me.<br /><br />POP white tea brews darker than a more costly white tea I was given, and I do suspect that darker color means lower quality, but the price is right.  The bags also brew more cups than an equivalent bag of black tea, furthering the value.  I have no trouble getting 6 large cups of tea from a single bag, and arguably, the second cup is better than the first.  I'm on my second box of 100, and have recently discovered another listing of the same tea here that offers subscribe and save, I'm likely to buy much more in the future.  How many good habits are this affordable?

review/text: I feel extremely cheated after trying this tea. I bought the Oolong tea and decided to give this white tea a try since it had so much good reviews. The tea tastes, smells and looks exactly like the oolong tea. White tea should have a clearer look to it but this was just a rip off after spending almost $8 on it. Next time I'll stick to the Lipton white tea cause I just feel so wronged. Oh well guess I learnt my lesson buying tea online.

review/summary: Great if you're looking for lower caffeine
review/text: I'm a former coffee drinker who's moved to tea.  I was finding that coffee was just getting me too tense.  I drink a lot of Earl Grey.  But I heard about white tea, I hadn't know about it before.  It has lower caffeine than even green tea, and quite a bit less than an earl grey or black.  It also is supposed to have a lot of antioxidants.<br /><br />I'm finding this tea to taste more like a black tea than a green.  Green has a grassy taste to me.  The thing I really like is I can continue having several cups without getting an overload of caffeine.  If that's what you're looking for, I'd recommend it.  The price is right, too!

review/summary: Some of the best white tea i've had... but there's a catch.
review/text: I've tried many organic white teas before but this one is definitely a favorite of mine. The aroma isn't the best but it tastes great. The catch to this great tea is that it's not "pure" white tea so to speak. Due to the nature of white peony tea, (1 bud and 2 tips) it really ends up being a mixture between green tea and white tea. However this is not a problem for me because I think it makes it taste better than other white teas, while still being very good for your health. It brews plenty strong for white tea so you won't be disappointed. the 100 pack at $7 is a great value!

review/text: First let me say I'm new to drinking tea. So you're not getting a well rounded expert opinion. I started drinking lipton green tea at work and loved it. Small caffeine boost, great flavor, no calories, etc. Read about white teas online so I gave this a try. The price is incredible. The tea reminds me of a tea I drank at a Chinese restaurant when I was young. Brings back good childhood memories, love the flavor. WILL BUY AGAIN.

review/summary: Prince of Peace puts only about half as much tea in each tea bag as Bigelow does
review/text: The only defect I could find was that Prince of Peace brand puts only about half as much tea in each of its tea bags as other brands such as Bigelow brand.  This shouldn't be a problem for people trying to brew just one pint of tea with one tea bag.  However, if you have been happy brewing a half gallon of tea with just one Bigelow tea bag, then you may need to use two Prince of Peace tea bags per half gallon of boiling water to get the same quality of tea.  One gram of white tea has more catechins and more polyphenols than one gram of green tea (please click "Comment" below).  If green tea is stronger than oolong tea and white tea is stronger than green tea, then what would be stronger than white tea?  Rooibos tea?  No.  Honeybush tea?  No.  Olive leaf tea?  Yes!  Live long and prosper.

review/summary: POP White Peony tastes great,
review/text: I am not an expert on teas. I've been drinking grocery-store-bought green tea(Wegman's Brand) for years. I thought I'd try the POP White Peony Tea(Bai Mudan) for additional antioxidant power and to reduce the consumption of fluoride that green tea contains. So I bought four 100-bag boxes. In making my first cup of White Peony, I noticed right away how dark brown the brew was. Is this characteristic of all Bai Mudan teas?  in the past, I would brew two bags of the green tea within one cup of water (and steep it forever at high temps) and it would still only make an amber brew. But only one tea bag of the White Peony after a few minutes of steeping, makes for a dark tea similar to black tea. Again, I am not an expert. Just stating my observations. Is White Peony supposed to be that dark? Thanks, Wayne
