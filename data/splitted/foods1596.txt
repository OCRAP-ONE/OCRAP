review/summary: Gluten Free Perfection with Slight Recipe Modification
review/text: My two sons and I are on a strict gluten free diet since being diagnosed with celiac disease a couple of years ago. I have tried many different bread mixes, but this is everybody's favorite after having perfected the recipe a bit.<br />I use the gluten free cycle on my Breadman Pro machine (total time 1 hour 18 minutes). Originally the main problem with the bread was that it would rise to the top of the machine but after removing it from the pan it would partially collapse towards the sides, ending up with an hour glass shape. After trying several remedies, I discovered that the best way to prevent this partial collapse from happening was to wait for the end of the gluten free cycle and then bake the bread on the bake cycle for an additional 20 to 30 minutes. Once you do this, you can remove the bread and it maintains its shape and is fluffy and delicious.<br />A few other suggestions that I would make:<br />* Use coconut milk (SO Delicious Coconut Milk Beverage)  instead of water or milk<br />* Use olive oil instead of regular oil<br />* Use three eggs (instead of one egg and egg whites), then add an extra tablespoon of olive oil for extra fluffiness<br /><br />If you follow these steps, you will have fluffy, moist, delicious bread baked to perfection. Enjoy!

review/summary: brm vs pamelas
review/text: I feel bad for alot of other gf bread/baking flour makers because if more people discover the goodness of pamela bread mix they would go out of business. My sister and I are celiac and believe me we tried it all. We tried baking our own to purchasing about every different mix we could find and It came down to pamelas or BRM because they are more readily available at local grocery stores. Let me tell you Pamela blows them all away. I've had family member and co-workers (who by this time were pretty scared of taste testing my gf baked goods) completly surprised some even said they preferred over wheat varieties. The Sweet bread recipe taste almost like a moist potato bread. Sorry BRM

review/summary: Our best yet, but still experimenting
review/text: We tried Pamela's first and found it to be too sweet for our taste.  We also didn't get the proper rise, probably because of the first attempts with our old bread maker and a gluten-free mix and not necessarily because of the Pamela mix.  After spending time with cookbooks and the web, I decided to use a mix with bean flour (Bob's).  I also bought a new programmable "Zo" bread maker from Amazon which I could use to monitor and adjust the process.  My first attempt with Bob's (and using egg replacement as suggested) was better than with Pamela's, but still without sufficient rise.  Next I added one egg, extra egg replacement, and gelatin which resulted in so much rise (and faster) that it stuck to the bread maker top before I caught it.  Although the bread sank after baking, it was still the best yet.  I used only the third rise cycle before baking as suggested by "Zo".  Plan to cut back on egg and egg replacement next and keep the gelatin since I found that in many recipes.  However, I have no complaints about Bob's mix yet.  There must be a recipe and process which gives optimum in-between results.  Although I do have suggestions for bread maker improvements, I like the flexibility and ability to observe and adjust the cycle.  ... and pleased to report that my wife now again enjoys bread without the old dire consequences of eating wheat bread.

review/text: I really like this product and have been making buns with the mix. Summer is a real hamburger sort of time of year and I was missing good buns. I mix this according to directions, plop some on parchment paper, smooth them out with damp fingers and bake until golden. They taste good and the texture is good without toasting which you often have to do with GF products.

review/summary: Garbanzo beans can make you sick if you have trouble with soy
review/text: I love most Bob's stuff, but I bought this bread mix and made rolls.  I had two in one day and woke up with terrible stomach pains the next morning.  As most of us who must stay gluten free do, I went over in my mind what I had had to eat the day before and these rolls were the only new thing.  I then researched garbanzo beans.  They are in the soybean family.  My doctor has told me that I must also be careful of soy as well as milk unless it is lactose free.  The garbanzo beans were the problem so I had to go to another brand with the other types of flour.  If you don't have a problem with soy, the rolls were very good.  Wonderful taste and very soft.  However, you may need to stay away from it if you are allergic to soy also.

review/summary: Baked to perfection in my bread machine!
review/text: I am not one to write reviews, but this bread is worth it. I have really been missing bread since I had to go gluten free and was skeptical about this product at first. I also have not had good luck with baking bread since I moved to Florida; I think the humidity affects the dough. I followed the directions on the bag exactly. I used one whole egg in a measuring cup and topped it up to 3/4 cup with egg whites from a carton. I put it all into my bread machine and set it for 1.5 lb loaf and medium crust. It smelled wonderful while baking and came out great. The bread slices well and tastes great. Maybe I can survive with a gluten-free diet!!

review/summary: Finally delicious bread!!
review/text: My husband is gluten intolerant and recently went completely gluten free. It has been hard but well worth it for both of us. I tried to make bread that was good, but was not succeeding. I finally ordered this for us and baked a loaf the day we received it. Like the person who posted photos, a larger loaf pan is a good idea because the bread gets huge after a while in the oven. Make sure when you cover it with aluminum foil you leave room or the foil will pretty much be floating lol. Anyway, this is the most.delicious.gluten.free.bread.EVER! I am not gluten intolerant, but I have cut back a lot on my gluten intake. Which leads me to conclude that gluten makes you fat, or at least helps make you fat! I am losing weight without trying!<br />We use Bob's brown rice flour and sorghum flour. Love it too!<br />If I had to hate anything about this bread it'd be the smell when you are preparing it. But thank goodness there is no trace of that in the baked bread. I was worried about it having a "bean flavor" like others mentioned. If you ask me this tastes very very close to regular wheat bread. There's no gross texture, flavor or dryness, like other gluten free breads seem to have.

review/summary: Bread is great; however, problem with shipping of item
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Wonderful Bread Mix:<br /><br />Bread is great; especially when using a breadmaker with the gluten free setting.  The only problem is that it uses 6 eggs (1 whole egg and whites of 5 additional eggs) in additional to the oil, milk and vinegar.  All in all, the texture is great.  The price of the mix is exceptional compared to the store prices.<br /><br />I have had problems at least 3 times with the shipment.  Each of those 3 times, there was bread mix all over the box in which the manufacturer box was shipped and the bags that contained the mix were cut toward the top of the package.  It appears that there is a problem with the sealing process. The last time, the box from the manufacturer was slit as well.  Each time, Amazon has replaced my item very promptly. I was told they would investigate the problem. Each time, I was told to toss the items as they do not accept returned food items.<br /><br />I would like to know if anyone has had any similar problems with the shipping.  At one time, I was told they had had similar complaints but another time I was told I was the only one and it made me feel that they did not believe me.  Hopefully, they are able to find the cause of the problem.

review/summary: Great, with modifications
review/text: This bread mix is the best GF bread I've had, and certainly the best mix I've worked with.  It has a lovely light flavor, results in a tender, soft texture, and is for the most part, mix and go.  From the start I found it needed salt, and the addition of 1 teaspoon brings it well into balance.  It is, however, not too sweet.  It's a good savory bread, that would be tasty with sweet uses.  Another thing I found is that when I made it exactly as the directions stated, the bread sank in the middle, everytime, resulting in a depressed Mickey Mouse shaped loaf.  I do mix by stand mixer and bake in the oven, so perhaps if made in a bread machine the instructions are more spot-on.  I found that to achieve a good rise and to maintain it, the liquid ingredients must be room temperature.  No short cuts.  I use very soft butter (not melted) instead of oil.  I also back off the recommended baking temperature of 375, and bake it at 365, and instead of baking it for 60-65 minutes, let it go for 70-75 minutes.  Comes out perfect.  The dough, itself, tastes a bit beany, but the final product doesn't.<br /><br />I would certainly try other mixes, but after years of suffering through crumbly bread and weedy-flavored pastries, I'm in no rush to.  I will keep this mix as a go-to option, indefinitely.

review/summary: WOW! THE BEST GF BREAD!!!
review/text: This is the best GF bread I've ever had! I make this in my breadman bread machine on the GF setting, however in the machine I had before I made it on "French" and that worked well until the machine broke. This bread is great because it works well whether it's toasted or not, so it makes great sandwiches and I love to make cinnamon toast and garlic bread with it. YUM!It even looks like normal bread and makes the house smells good while It's baking, just like a bakery. I altered the recipe on the bag in a few ways: 1. I use Egg Replacer; 2. almond milk and 3. I had a little honey. Also I like the taste better when I use butter instead of oil. Full flavored Olive oil is good too, but ONLY IF you're planning to use the WHOLE loaf for Italian bread. I take it out as soon as it's done and let it cool on a wire rack, otherwise it sweats and gets soggy. This is as close too the real thing as you can probably get!!! I've fed this to my friends and family and many didn't notice anything different, just thought it was regular homemade bread!!!

My whole family loves it. I read that adding a package of Knox Unflavored Gelatine would give homemade bread a better texture. I decided to try it in this mix, and it worked great. The bread has held together nicely, and has a great soft texture. Can't wait to try more GFCF products.

review/summary: Good tasting bread mix
review/text: So far this is the best GF mix I've used.  I liked pamela's too although very sweet, to be honest though I hated that it contained so much sugar.  This bread contains no sugar.<br /><br />I also like that the yeast that comes with this bread is of good quality, and is active and reliable.<br /><br />It produces a good flavoured bread that is spongy and not grainy at all.  It is quite dense, though not thick, it actually makes great french toast. It keeps for about 3 days, though it tastes best if eaten the same day it was baked.<br /><br />It does have it's faults though, it sometimes over rises, or caves in on it's self.  I use the rapid white dark crust setting on my Cuisinart breadmaker and I bake it for an additional 20 min to get a good crust and dryer centre.<br /><br />I also don't like how much after cost is involved in this bread.  Although the mix is less than some others, it requires 5 eggs, since I use organic it costs an extra $2.20 just in eggs. I use rice milk, as I find soy milk gives it a funny taste.<br /><br />This is a subscribe and save item for me and I will continue to use it for our son, so he can have his favourite PB&J's, but if another breadmix comes along that I find better I will certainly switch.

review/summary: Fiber rich option for GF diets
review/text: I have to say first that the taste of this bread takes a little getting used to.  However, this is a reasonably priced, more nutritious option to all the white rice bread products out there.  While the white rice items might have a better taste, they are not adding much in the way of nutritional value to our overall diet.  The only other caution I would give, if you are baking by hand and not using a bread machine, is to not allow the bread to rise even to the top of the pan as it balloons up considerably during the baking process.  This leaves a very lopsided loaf.

review/summary: I can have REAL sandwiches now!
review/text: Gluten is not the issue for me as it is for so many celiacs and other "tummy trouble" people.  I have a life long and serious allergy to wheat, eggs, milk, nuts and chocolate, so even gluten free ready-made breads on the market are not an option to me.  Bob's Red Mill has opened a whole new world.  I follow the directions for hand mixing (gluten free/egg free breads aren't happy in the bread machine).  I use soy milk, substitute the whole egg with flaxseed meal and the egg whites are substituted with Ener-G egg replacer.  It mixes up and bakes beautifully and makes a fairly sturdy yet moist bread.  To be honest, there is no gluten free product on the market that will ever compare to the moistness of white bread, but it is a wonderful substitute and toasts up great and makes wonderful bread crumbs.  With Vegenaise brand mayo, I get to enjoy the awesomeness of a tuna fish sandwich that the rest of the world takes for granted.  My mom smiles with pleasure and giggles along with me when I say "I get to eat like real people!"  Trust me, at 50 years old, eating like real people is a dream come true.

review/summary: Great Bread
review/text: I have been GF for 2 years and finally being diagnosed correctly literally saved my life.  That said, I went in search of GF breads.  Those frozen loaves and vacuum sealed loaves went right in the trash.  I then tried BRM mixes and love most of them.<br /><br />I used this mix in my bread maker and had failed results.  I then tried the oven method and have used this method ever since.  As I never was a big bread eater before GF, sandwiches were not a crucial part of my diet but my PBJs are a craving that never went away.  I am 59 yo now and not being diagnosed in the prior 10 years resulted in lactose intolerance and eventually egg problems as well.  I can tolerate moderate amounts of both in recipes.<br /><br />OK, my review.  As with most GF bread mixes, the batter climbed my hand mixer blades and was difficult to work with.  My son bought me a Kitchen Aid mixer and what a difference!  I follow the directions on the bag but use 3 whole eggs instead of the eggs/ egg whites combo.  OK so far.  I have used lactose free milk and found this works best for me.  Soy milk is also ok.  I use spray cooking oil in a dark pan and also use it to spray my spatula and mixing blade.  No more climbing the blades and easy to clean and my bread comes out of the pan very easily.  just flip over and it falls out.  On a few occasions, no variations in prep, my loaf collapsed in the center.  I think it may have been the temp of the milk when I added the yeast.  I now heat my milk to 120 degrees and so far so good.<br /><br />As I do not normally eat sandwiches, I seldom use this bread for that.  I do toast it or when sliced thicker, makes great garlic bread slices.  The bread flavor is good.  The texture is good.  I slice the entire loaf and freeze them in 4 slices to a baggie.  This bread rises perfectly when a longer pan is used.  I also create an aluminum foil " tent" over the bread when baking for the entire time in<br />the oven.  This makes the crust lighter in color and not as tough on the edges.<br /><br />I order this product utilizing the super saver option every 2 months and find it a little less expensive than even Walmart.  As I also use other GF products for other breads I like, that option is sufficient.  I may change my option and order more often but am testing the frozen mix and resulting bread after thawing.  I put a package of the mix in the freezer and will keep for a year before baking the bread.  I have not found a review of this process as yet.

The only negative is the large amount of butter and eggs required to make a loaf.  If you don't want to waste those egg yolks, use them for some pudding and make that while the bread is baking.

review/text: My first loaf ever of gluten-free bread.  I was dubious as to how it smelled when I poured the batter into the loaf pan, it just didn't smell appealing.  But after it cooled and we sliced it with an electric knife (highly recommend doing this), it tasted heavenly.  I am looking forward to having a sandwich tomorrow for lunch.  Thank you, Bob's Red Mill!

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty
review/text: We are not gluten free but my MIL is.  I bought this to have on hand when she came out for a visit...  and then never got around to making it.  We just made it recently to use it up and get it out of here, expecting mediocrity at best...  but it was surprisingly tasty!  It had a bouncy, springy texture.  We ate the entire loaf at one meal (with bean soup, which I keep wishing my kids would like, but they won't...  so they ate a lot of bread...) so I can't attest to its keeping qualities, but fresh from the oven it was great.  It smelled AWFUL raw so I was skeptical, but smelled good baking and tasted great.  I think I will keep a bag or two around now just as a way to have easy fresh baked bread for dinner.  And maybe one of these days my kids will learn to like bean soup.  My husband did the actual mixing, as far as I know he followed the directions exactly.  I may try some of the tweaks suggested next time.  It does call for an odd amount of eggs, that would be the only complaint.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill GF Bread
review/text: I just baked a fresh loaf of this tasty gluten free bread.  I baked it in the oven and it rose beautifully and is the size of a normal loaf of bread from a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  It has a very spongy , moist texture that does not crumble like alot of other gluten free breads. It is wonderful for sandwiches without even toasting it like you have to for other gluten free breads to even taste good.  Tip: I used an non-stick baking spray like PAM and the bread just popped right out of the pan.<br />Try it...you will like it!!!

review/summary: Too good to be GF
review/text: We are new to gluten free cooking and this is on the 4th bread we've tried. I like some of Bob's Red Mill products and others are just ok. I bought a cheap breadmachine on Amazon and threw this in. Three hours later I had wonderful bread. It isn't gritty, dry, and doesn't have an after <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067REBU">Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker</a>taste. My son loved it. It was soooo easy and I couldn't believe how fluffy it is. It rises well, slices well, and seems like normal bread. I got on the subscribe and save list for this. I get 4 packages for a little over $13. The price makes it even more unbelievable. Don't waste your money on other breads. This is the best.

review/summary: Blah bread that sticks to the pan
review/text: I've been buying Bob's Red Mill bread mixes for about a year now. I like the 10 Grain Bread and, even more, the Potato Bread. I was disappointed by the Wonderful Bread. It requires more added ingredients, esp. eggs and egg whites. As a result, I was expecting something with more flavor. But the bread just tastes like regular white bread. It is softer than the 10 Grain - again, similar to packaged white bread. I use a bread machine. I've never had a problem with any other bread mix. But the Wonderful bread sticks to the sides of the pan. As a result, the finished loaf is always broken with large tears and holes on all sides. I suppose I could get past this if the bread was indeed Wonderful. But it isn't. It's just blah.

review/text: As many others who cannot eat gluten, bread is difficult to make taste like the gluten filled stuff. This is the BEST GF bread that I have had so far. I used a Tuscan herb olive oil in the bread instead of plain olive oil and it made a great bread even better. I would recommend this bread to anyone who is having trouble making a good sandwich bread!

review/text: This is the best gluten free bread mix I have found. I make it with a bread maker and use an egg substitute and rice milk. The density of the bread is perfect and it has a nice flavor. I occasionally add cinnimon, brown sugar, and raisins for a sweet treat and it comes out great. The bread does not stay good for very long though, I wrap it in paper towels and put it in an large ziploc bag. Try to use it all within 4-5 days. Amazon is by far the cheapest place to buy it! well worhth the money

review/summary: Comes out great using a bread machine
review/text: I made this in my bread machine and it came out perfect. The dough was much wetter than regular bread (more like a thick batter), and at first I thought I must have made a mistake when I measured the other ingredients. Then I found out that gluten-free bread has a much different dough than wheat flour bread. The bread baked perfectly and tasted great....it had a different texture than regular bread, but was still very tasty.

review/summary: A lot to be desired
review/text: Three major issues with this bread:<br />1. This bread had an off taste - not quite "beany" as another reviewer noted, but more like eggs or egg whites. Almost a French toast aftertaste.<br />2. Although it rose, the top sunk when cooling. The loaf looked like a volcanic crater and made for misshapen slices.<br />3. It was not as hard as the frozen gluten free breads found in the store, but it certainly crumbled as badly making it useless as a sandwich bread - maybe good for croutons (except for the taste).<br /><br />I found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8H4">The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> bread mix to be a lot better. It was moist, did not crumble, had a great taste, and made a normal looking loaf. I'm new on the celiac diet and will try Pamela's next, but Bob's was put out for the birds to eat.

review/summary: GREAT texture - weird taste.
review/text: We've tried a few gluten free bread mixes and so far Pamela's Products is in the clear lead.  This bread has a great texture, it slices nice and thin and holds up.  It has a nice "chew" to it and it is moist with a great crust.  It came with its own yeast and if you use a bread mixer - it bakes up in a breeze.  Its just to bad the taste is "off"  kind of "beany" maybe?  My daughter, who we make the bread for, has this to say about it:  "It tastes just blaaaah.  Its tasteless and it has a rubber after taste."  We wont buy this again.

review/summary: The best gluten-free bread
review/text: Having only been diagnosed with celiac disease about a year, my husband and I have been trying multiple gluten-free products.  Most breads and bread mixes are awful as bread comes out with the consistency of a tough sponge and taste and texture of styrofoam!  Bob's Red Mill Homemade Wonderful bread and Cornbread are fantastic.  Great nutty flavor.  Soft yet chewy texture.  It's easy to make.  Even friends and family who are not looking for gluten-free foods like it.  Buying the 4-packs on Amazon is also the most economical way to get it.  Thanks Bob's Red Mill for great, high-quality products!

review/summary: Great bread!
review/text: This is a really great all-purpose bread that tastes fantastic. Keep in mind as you make it that the batter will look like batter and NOT yeast dough. Made that mistake the first time I made this and added way too much extra flour. Oops! The second time I made it, I got an extra packet of yeast in the mix and made the bread with 2 packs instead of 1. Boy was that a HUGE loaf of bread. Had to bake it an extra 15 minutes but it was delicious. A word of advice with any gluten free bread - when you first put the loaf pan in the oven to bake the bread, loosely cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil. This will keep the bread from getting overly brown as it bakes, especially for loaves that require a minimum of 60 minutes. Also, add a little extra sweetener (1/4 cup sugar to the flour mix and 1/4 cup honey to the milk mixture that you warm on the stove). This added touch of sweet really makes it zing. Even works well with a diabetic on insulin. Not matter what, give this bread mix a chance. You will be glad you did.

review/summary: Good for Bread Machine
review/text: I make a loaf of this bread mix in my bread machine at least once a week for my son who is on the GF/CF diet.  He had no hesitation in eating this bread and it allows him to continue having PB&J sandwiches.  My daughter who is not on the diet happily eats it with her brother at lunchtime so I don't have to worry about the kids sharing.  She has access to wheat bread and never complains about eating this bread.  My husband also likes the bread.  I find it to have a little of a "beany" taste by itself, but have enjoyed it as a base for stuffing and breadcrumbs.  It's easy to make in a bread machine and requires only milk (I use almond), eggs, oil, and cider vinegar--all staples at my house.  It's easy, almost fail-proof, and with Amazon subscription, the most cost-effective MIX I've found.

review/summary: The best gluten-free bread I've had so far
review/text: I've been on a gluten-free diet for the last 5 months and had managed to find suitable replacements for cereals, pastas, etc.  However, bread has been a big problem and I have made bread crumbs from/thrown out more loaves of gf bread than I can count - both store bought and homemade. I had pretty much given up when someone suggested I try this mix. Well, I am very happy with this bread. I made mine in my bread machine and I have been slicing off thin slices as I need them for the last week (I have it stored in the fridge wrapped in aluminum foil).  The bread is not crumbly and is very similar to the regular Brick Oven brand bread.  It is very good both toasted and plain (great for the open-faced peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I crave). It is excellent toasted, especially with over-easy eggs. It is also much more flavorful than the other gf breads I have tried. Definitely worth a try!!!

review/summary: Really!  It's okay!
review/text: I read the other reviews before I made the bread.  I'm glad I did, because there is a trick to this bread, as Sara Bell mentioned.  I did leave the bread in the bread machine about 15 minutes after it shut off.  I waited until it was cooled off, but still warm.  Don't do that!  I was so disappointed in the flavor.  It had the same bean after-taste that everyone else had mentioned.  And, I like beans, but this was not pleasant.  My hopes were dashed until I remembered someone said to make sure the bread was cooled.  I put it in the fridge, and lo and behold, the next day--the bean flavor had mellowed so much I couldn't taste it much at all.  The bread really has a good flavor after it is chilled.  That is the secret.  Don't cut into when it comes out of the bread machine or oven.  Let it sit in the fridge for a full day!  BTW . . . it slices up better than regular bread.  It makes a nice loaf.<br /><br />I made the second loaf.  This time I used rice milk.  Much, much better!  The flavor was really nice, and that was shortly after I took it out of the bread machine.  I found out to cook the bread on the "express bake" setting for 1 hour and 20 minutes. The loaf rose much higher.  The rice milk made it fluffy and gave it a very nice texture.  I am really pleased now with this bread.

I only added a pinch more yeast because I didn't get the bubble action from the original packet.  I used cooking spray in my loaf pan and it fell right out. I also let the dough rise slightly above the loaf pan. It worked. My first slice and I noticed it had raised sufficiently to keep the bottom of the loaf from being too thick. Buttered hot fresh bread! Yea!! Just like my prior bread-making before I had to go gluten free. Thank you Bob's Red Mill.

Tonight is our 'maiden voyage' with the white loaf. We tried the whole grain dark loaf last week. It didn't rise but just a little. We threw some craisins in there and it added a nice tart yet mildly sweet flavor.But, the white is brimming with height as I type. We don't have a bread machine (yet)...my question is...does the GF varieties bake better with the machines? Thanks for all your great ideas. We're off to GF land...

review/text: I love this popcorn.  Not sure what the other customer meant about the popcorn not popping.  I've never had that problem. After popping that first bag and adjusting my microwave properly,  I've never had any problems.  It always pops nicely with few or almost no un-popped kernels.  I use a little butter spray and other seasonings if needed.  Thank you Jolly Time.

review/summary: SWF seeks tall, dark, warm, fast Joe.
review/text: So I had this enormous coffeemaker and I like to have a cup of coffee before I buzz off to work.  Problem: Mr. Coffee and I don't seem to see eye-to-eye when it comes to getting the grounds/water ratio right for just a cup or two in the morning.  I found one of these single cup coffeemaker thingies at Target.  Get this!  They were offering a 6-pack of 18-count coffee pod packages for $39.99 ... and you got the machine for free!  As a result of my rocky relationship with Mr. Coffee, I was easily bellying up to the bar(ista) and spending $39.99 in a month at Starbucks, so I bit.  The manufacturer of the JV Pod machine I bought recommends using only JV (short for "Juan Valdez") Pod brand pods, of course.  The trouble was, I had trouble finding them after the first batch I got with the machine.  I bought several packs of these Melitta guys (different flavors) from Amazon to use in my JV Pod coffeemaker.  Since a friend has a Melitta machine, I sprang for enough of these pods to qualify for the free Super Saver shipping and figured I'd give them to her if they didn't work for me. As it turns out, they work just fine in the JV machine and both the regular and flavored coffees, though not necessarily "gourmet" stuff, are really quite tasty.  I would have no problem serving this coffee to a guest in my home.

I did find the Target brand "Archer Farms" pods to be the BEST.  The French Roast really does rival Starbucks home brewed.  Its cheap too...3.99 for 18 pods.  If you like a full bodied, rich, dark and strong cup of cofee, don't do Melitta.  I found Senseo and Archer Farms pods fit in my Melitta pod brewer just fine.

review/summary: Product changed-used to be much better.
review/text: We have been buying the Melita Buzzworthy Dark Roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied.  Recently, they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines.  I also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling.  At the time Melita made these changes, I believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good.  Accordingly, I rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars.  We are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee.

review/text: I've been using Satin Ice for a year now on my cakes.  I purchase it from local bakery supplies stores as well as online.  It is nice and smooth, soft and pliable. It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though.  If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out.  Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable.  Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier.

review/summary: Best sugar ever!
review/text: I discovered this India Tree dark Muscovado sugar on a trip to D.C. a couple of years ago and became hooked.  Unfortunately, the few pounds that I bought soon disappeared and I searched everywhere for more Muscovado.  Nothing I tried compared to the India Tree sugar.  We live in rural Wyoming, where gourmet food stores are fairly non-existant.  Finally, I did a Google search, found India Tree Dark on Amazon and now I get my fix 5.5 lbs. at a time.  This is the best sugar you will ever taste - hints of caramel and spices, slightly salty undertones, uneven and lumpy texture with delicious dark chunks heavy with molasses.  Excellent with gourmet coffee, over fruit, etc.  I brew beer as well, and this sugar is my "secret ingredient".

review/text: This is the way dark brown sugar is supposed to taste.  Many, Many years ago the stores used to carry dark brown sugar like this.  The dark brown sugar in the grocery stores today is more like light brown sugar.  The dark Muscovado sugar gives my baked goods the taste of our grandmother's baked goods.  Compare using store bought dark brown sugar in your chocolate chip cookies and using Dark Muscovado brown sugar.  A blind taste test will tell you that the cookie with the dark muscovado is richer and more flavorful.  I love this sugar and recommend it for all baking.  It tastes great in hot tea and coffee as well.

review/summary: High molasses and strong flavor
review/text: Dark Muscovado has a fine, moist and somewhat sticky texture and is rich and dark with a high molasses content and a strong flavor that I love to have in coffee and pretty much everything else that you would use brown sugar in. Muscovado is made from pressed sugar cane juice and is probably much like eating white refined sugar as far as the health benefits are concerned so despite its taste and dark good looks, it is still concentrated glucose and fructose. But if you are going to eat sugar it might as well taste this good.

review/summary: Refined Sugar!!  Molasses!!  Carnauba Wax!! Save Your Money, Honey!!
review/text: I bought this because it sounded like a less-refined sugar (such as Rapadura, which is granular rather than crystalline). I would have given this one star except I see, looking at the description, that it does say on the product page that the ingredients are "Cane sugar crystals and food grade carnauba wax".  Had I noticed this ahead of time I wouldn't have ordered it - food grade carnauba wax??  YUM!!!  And I don't think there's any way to get crystals from sugar cane other than by refining it the same way white cane table sugar is refined, and then adding molasses back in.<br /><br />As far as the flavor and texture, which previous reviewers found so remarkable - to me it tastes exactly like dark brown sugar from the supermarket, and has a similar texture, but with a burned-molasses aftertaste that stayed with me for hours, even after I ate an apple to try and get rid of it - that's the "strong,lingering flavor" that the description mentions, I guess.  Actually, when you think about it, that's what sugar cane grown in volcanic ash WOULD taste like.  Also I got the same "cattle prod to the brain" - type jolt from this stuff that I used to get from refined white or brown sugar, which I no longer eat.<br /><br />So since I'm going to immediately give this away to friends who still eat refined sugar, I can't speak to how this would work in barbecue or brownies or any of the other things mentioned in the other reviews.  I was going to try some of it in coffee, just to be fair, and to see if the aftertaste problem was less intense that way, however I can't re-open the jar!  It was almost impossible to open the first time - I had to bang the edge of the lid on the countertop multiple times and then run hot water over it - but I thought it would be easier to open after that, since I didn't tighten the lid down hard when I replaced it.  I don't usually have problems opening jars, so I don't know, maybe it's made this way on purpose to keep the contents fresh or something.  If I were going to keep this for myself, the only way I could get it open at this point would be to slice into the plastic container with a serrated bread knife - not the safest way to open a jar.<br /><br />The two 2.8 lb. jars were $28.00, I think, and thank Heaven I got free shipping, however I could have gotten an equivalent amount of dark brown sugar at the grocery store for less than $10.00, if that's what I had wanted.  So I hate to go against some of the other really quite lyrical reviews of this stuff, but to me it's just incredibly expensive, funny-tasting, impossible-to-open brown sugar.

review/summary: Tastes burnt
review/text: I did not care for this product at all.  I was expecting more of a Demerara sugar taste and this is WAY more intense.  Tried to use it in iced tea - taste burnt.  PLUS - beware - you can't return it.  It is a grocery item on Amazon and they won't accept returns.  I'd find some somewhere to try before buying these big containers.  I used one cup and hated it and then had to just give it away.

review/summary: Ambrosia of the Gods
review/text: I first had this wonderful nectar when I took a trip to Southern Africa in 2006. When I tried it, I knew I was addicted. It's a wonderful concoction of cherries, apples, litchi, and pears. This is literally the best juice I have ever had. I cannot rate this juice high enough. I would give my first born for an unlimited supply of Secrets of The Valley that is readily available to me stateside. I have scoured the stores and South African Food Shops to try and find it. To date, I've only found it in the suburbs of Chicago and in Laurel, MD. This is the purest, tastiest juice I have ever had.<br /><br />An aside: this is an awesome mixer as well!

review/summary: Unpleasant cherry flavor
review/text: While I am very fond of the Ceres range of juice products and drink some every day I cannot recommend this particular flavor.<br /><br />Full disclosure that I'm not generally fond of cherry-flavored products. The cherry flavor in this juice tastes overwhelming and reminds me of some tastes of medicine I've had as a child. There is also (for me) a lingering, unpleasant taste.<br /><br />The juice, other than all other Ceres juices I've had, is clear, All the other juices and I've had too many to recall all the various flavors) were "cloudy" as if they were directly squeezed. This juice appears clear as if it has been filtered. I'm not saying this is bad, I am just describing the appearance. It looks lovely if poured into a glass - if you like red-colored drinks.<br /><br />In general this is the only flavor of all the Ceres juices I cannot recommend.

review/summary: Solid taste but not as good as the other flavors
review/text: The mango flavor is good but not necessarily five pounds worth of eating. The 12 flavor variety bag or even the orange only bag are better options than this unless you love the flavor. I disagree with the others saying that these are terrible but the fact is that they're not on the same level as some of the other flavors.

review/summary: I should have listened to SortaTired!
review/text: The flavor is not just weak, its BAD.  Even my own pre-teen grandchildren wouldn't eat them.  The only good thing about these gummys might be the price, that is if you can and want to eat them.  I am going to offer them to the church kindergarten for a class snack. But if they don't like them either, I am going to toss them out as uneatable.

review/summary: Jelly Belly's are the Best
review/text: Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

review/summary: I wouldn't buy this product again!
review/text: My review on this is not based on actually trying the product and this is because the bag it came in looks like a regular goody bag which they just attached their packing labels on, which usually wouldn't bother me, but it was sealed with red tape! I just like my products to be sealed more professionally! =/

review/summary: Convenient packaging, but watch out for shipping damage
review/text: I have to confess that I'm not a fan of this or any other creamer (or milk for that matter). I prefer my coffee and tea black - no cream, no sugar, just plain. But, my Mom and her friends just love this stuff, but the large size containers are hard for them to handle, shake and pour without putting too much or too little into the cup, or causing a big mess.<br /><br />While I cringe a bit about all the plastic waste involved in individual serving cups, they work very well for elderly people who have a hard time grasping and pouring. The cups are reasonably easy for them to open since the tab is larger than what you typically find, so it's easier to get leverage. Plus, if they spill, not much of a mess. (And yes, I repeatedly try to help them, but they are determined to do things themselves. Got to appreciate that spirit!)<br /><br />No refrigeration is needed, but I store them in a cool basement regardless. In terms of taste, they love this stuff, so I'll give it five stars.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with the product is the ease of which it is damaged in shipping. My first shipment was a huge mess -- many of the cups were broken, and the entire shipment had to be thrown out. No way to salvage any of them.  Amazon, in its usual excellent fashion, quickly responded and shipped me a replacement. The replacement was much better, but still had some broken cups (about ten). The mess was far more manageable -- I picked through and pulled out the cracked cups, then washed the remaining cups and set them out to dry. When this batch runs out I may look for this locally rather than through Amazon since it seems that shipping damage is common for this product.
