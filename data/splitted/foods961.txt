review/summary: Yum
review/text: I'm really into fruits and veggies and everything healthy.  These have just about every plant and antioxidant you can think of and while the presentation is off-putting (looks like a dark greenish brick), the taste is delightful- not overly sweet- and the texture has a nice bite.  I first tried one of these at a Whole Foods and thought they were delicious/ nutritious but just too expensive.  Amazon had them cheaper so I bought a box and really enjoyed them.  I haven't bought another box though because of the price.  I love nutrition but paying close to $3 a piece for a breakfast bar just doesn't feel right.  If that doesn't bother you though, enjoy!

review/summary: Delicous Lasagna
review/text: I made Lasagna for Christmas dinner and it was excellent.  Everyone enjoyed it!  I had a little issue with the time to leave the noodles in the boiling water.  The noodles were too mushy when I left in the for the amount of time on the box.  They were falling apart when I tried to take the out.  When I shortened the time it all worked out.  I always use this brand on a day to day basis.  The texture and taste is the best out of all the brands I've tried.

review/summary: Great coffee, I've stopped making my own.
review/text: As someone who drinks 4-8 8oz cups of coffee per day I have to say that both Vinecafe and G7 have made my life a little easier. Boiling water on the stove takes only a couple minutes (gas range) and the end result is a cup of coffee superior to almost every grocery store bean or ground. Very good stuff. G7 is a little stiffer, Vinecafe a little sweeter. I recommend using Coffeemate World Flavours to reach perfection (Parisian Almond Creme and Italian Sweet Creme are my favourites).

review/summary: Great for those on the go...
review/text: I tried these among several other instant coffee products looking for something I could take with me while on the go. I've tried plenty of instant coffees, and all of them taste... instant. In my estimation, the Vinacafe actually tastes somewhat like brewed coffee. I take these with me when camping, hiking, and even when going to friends houses who don't drink coffee and may not have any on hand. i also use them at home when I want a quick 'pick me up' and don't want to brew a whole pot of coffee.<br /><br />You can make iced coffee very quickly with these as well. Simply add the contents of the packet to a very small amount of hot water (maybe 1/4 cup or less). It doesn't need to be boiling or anything, just hot from the tap. Add another 3/4 cup of cold water and ice, and presto... instant iced coffee. Very handy!<br /><br />You get 5 bags of 24 packets, for $25, which equals 120 packets for about 20 cents each. Considering that when I get the hankering for a cup of coffee when I'm out and about, it could cost me a couple bucks or more, these are at least ten times cheaper.

review/text: I have always used regular ground coffee in a french press when I go backpacking and was trying to cut down on weight. I discovered this coffee while browsing through Amazon and based on all the positive reviews, decided to give it a chance. Well, I am going to leave my French Press at home and just bring a bunch of these freeze dried packets. I like my coffee with cream and sugar so I love the simplicity of adding this to some hot water. And a bit of Kahlua really hits the stop. I highly recommend this coffee and the price is sure right.

review/summary: Great product and BPA-FREE!
review/text: I had been using Muir Glen Organic whole/diced tomatoes, but after having had cancer I read a lot of research publications indicating that BPA's estrogen mimicking effects can be quite dangerous. BPA found in cans with acidic foods are some of the worst since the chemical is leached out even more. The same is true of plastic containers with BPA -- acid, heat or surface abrasion lead to much greater leaching into the food.<br /><br />Although Muir Glen is promising to get rid of BPA in their can liners, they are replacing it with some unspecified 'vinyl-based substitute'. If you want to get their cans without BPA, look for a use-by date of around the summer of 2013. [This info is per a conversation with their customer service representative.]<br /><br />I had heard about Pomi Tetra-pak products before -- Mario Batali and other foodies/chefs have recommended them so I thought I would give them a try.<br /><br />The tomatoes are naturally grown in Italy without pesticides and have no salt added. I used them to create a wonderful marinara sauce. They taste great and I am very happy with the quality.

I was going to buy from Amazon for the convenience of having it delivered but not for that price.

review/summary: Rich Aroma, Robust Taste!
review/text: I really enjoy whole-bean coffees. Once you're used to them you just can't go back to coffee from a can, much less to instant (ugh!) coffee. Once you're into whole-bean, grind-it-yourself coffee, the coffee you get at other places tastes like dishwater. Well, maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but you get the idea. In any case, I like to try whole-bean coffees from all the major growing areas of the world and in all of the different roasts. I generally buy it in two- or three-pound bags and I seldom repeat the same coffee when I buy a new bag. I like variety. I generally buy my beans at Costco. They only seldom have more than two or three varieties present on any particular shopping day, but they seem to change so when you come back different varieties and roasts may be present. Alternatively, on-line is an excellent source if you really get into it or don't have a good local source. I tend to be too price sensitive and have three Costco warehouses within a five-mile radius of my house.<br /><br />My latest acquisition os a three-pound bag of San Francisco Bay French Roast Beans. My previous beans were a medium roast, so I thought this would make a good change. I knew I was right when I cracked open the bag. Mmmm. What a nice rich aroma! Nice smell while brewing too. While it was brewing, I went outside to get the morning paper. A headline caught my attention so I spent perhaps five minutes reading the story. Then I went back inside. The newly-brewed coffee aroma was just overwhelming! That's my kind of coffee! It would be nice to have guests come in and get a whiff of this brew! And the taste, oh my, oh my! Rich. Full bodied, yet not the least bit harsh. Ahhhh, this stuff is a nice break from the last medium-roast bag, but the last bag was good coffee too. Man, this brew will grow hair on your chest (just a little joke, folks). How could anyone ever drink anything other than whole-bean coffees?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I had ordered both fresh white truffles<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BIOE40">Fresh White Truffles 1 ounce ( White Alba Truffle)</a> and some caviar close to a holiday weekend (on the Thursday before Christmas on Sunday) and I had done so without anticipation of getting them except in time for New Years. Shipping was noted as $6 for each of the 2 items I'd ordered.<br /><br />Not only did the seller notice the 2 orders shipping to the same location and consolidated the shipping cost to $8 for both. But they obtained my phone number from Amazon, called me to tell me that normally they overnight these types of items in any event, but while they would happily upgrade for Saturday Delivery at no charge to me so I would have the order for Christmas, they had worries that there was possibly no Saturday delivery in rural area (I live in Bridgehampton NY and they were correct, there is no Saturday deliver here even from Fed-X) and so, to avoid the order sitting around unrefrigerated from Friday till Tuesday, they were calling to ask if they should hold the order and instead ship Tuesday for Wednesday.<br /><br />Since I did not pick up my calls Thursday eve or Friday AM rather than just leave a voice-mail a call their job done, when I finally answered a call at 5:20 Friday, it was from a seller employee's cell phone, who had my order with him, in order to be able keep it freshest, pending an instruction from me, and so as to make absolutely sure they were following my wishes.<br /><br />As you can imagine the items received were commensurate with that service, and when they arrived Wednesday morning they were perfect IN EVERY WAY.<br /><br />And no matter how expensive the items (and they were the cheapest of their kind I found this season), this kind of service, while certainly also rare as the items themselves, is in my estimation, priceless.

review/summary: The Original.
review/text: Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.<br /><br />(From the Twinings website: "When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name.")<br /><br />Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley.

review/summary: Tasty tea
review/text: I recently gave up coffee & made the switch to teas.  I've tried all the usual suspects.  Lipton & other grocery blends were bitter or weak.  I purchased the loose tea leaves from Amazon at a fair price & quick shipping.  English friends suggested PJ Tips Tea, which we ordered from another online site.  Twinning's blows it away.  The Earl Grey & Irish Blend are great both on the pallet & to the nose.

review/summary: This is not the same Twinings Earl Grey!
review/text: I have drunk a pot of Twinings Earl Grey tea every morning for the last 15 years (family favorite).  However in the last year & a half I've noticed a terrible change in the taste of the tea.  The Earl Grey that I knew & loved was fragrant & never bitter unlike the new stuff sold today.  At first I thought it had bought old tea or a bad tin.  I even switched stores & finally bought it here on Amazon.  But same bad taste.  Several members of my family also complained about the change as well as friends who were longtime drinkers.  I googled Twinings Earl Grey & have discovered that there was indeed a switch about 2 years ago.  I cannot recommend this new stuff at all--it is not remotely similar to the Earl Grey of old.  It's bitter, harsh tasting & I can't really taste or smell the bergemot.  It's terrible & I don't recommend it.  I sold  my remaining tins on Ebay.<br /><br />Update:  due to complaints, Twinings is now selling the "classic" or original Earl Grey tea.  Just be sure it's marked classic to get that same great taste.

review/summary: The best Earl Grey on the market
review/text: I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />I prefer loose leaf teas to tea bags. There is something in the process of measuring tea into a cozy and letting it steep that makes the resulting cup of tea that much nicer. There is a reason they have tea ceremonies in most of the world (and although less rigorous, so do the British in their own way). Twinings is the quintessential British Earl Grey, and if you've never tried it, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!

My only wish is that Amazon stocked it in a bigger size.  I'm running out of ideas for things to do with all the dozens of little metal tea boxes i have around the house now.  Good for storing electronic cables, screws, poker chips, etc...<br /><br />Loose tea is much better than bagged tea... more room for the leaves to brew.

Unfortunately, the tea was just as meh as I remembered.

review/text: I'm able to purchase this in my local large chain grocery store, right by the Quaker brands.  YES it takes longer to cook but you can pre-cook it and keep it in the fridge, covered, for 5 days!  Just re-heat when needed!  It is SO much healthier AND tastier!  If you're not going to buy the healthier stuff for yourself, DO IT FOR YOUR KIDS! I did look into purchasing the import brands but it is TWICE the cost!!  I compared the nutritional value and it is virtually the same! Hodgkins Mill had 0.5g of saturated fat compared to McCanns -0-, but Hodgkins had 10% of daily iron compared to their 6%.  So, in the end the good and the bad kind of balanced out.  So come on people, feed your family the healthy stuff and keep our dollars in the USA rather than sending it off to another country!

review/summary: Tasty oats!
review/text: I don't know why, but steel-cut oats make much tastier oatmeal than the flakey stuff you usually find at the market. I used to think I was an oatmeal snob for ignoring 'instant' in favor of 'old-fashioned,' but steel-cut is an even larger step-up. Every brand of steel-cut I've tried has benefited from a nuttier, chewier flavor and texture. The Hodgson Mill brand is as good as the more expensive Irish imports I started with, but the shipping cost at Amazon is prohibitive unless you buy a few boxes. At the miller's own website, you can save more with the case price; Amazon should also offer cases.

review/summary: Great taste and texture!
review/text: I really like these oats. I cook one cup (dry) of oats at a time, and store it in the refrigerator. It lasts me 4 or 5 days. It's great with maple syrup, honey, molasses and/or fruit. I am surprised by some of the hyperbole within the reviews of steel-cut oat products. Rolled oats and steel-cut oats are very similar, and both are delicious. Most reviewers are saying that the steel-cut oats have a better texture. Although I agree, they don't seem to appreciate the extent to which their oatmeal's texture is determined by the amounts of water (or milk) and time used to prepare it. The instructions printed on the packages of rolled oats (aka quick or instant oats) has the cook use far too much water and too little time during cooking, resulting in oatmeal with a thin or "slimy" consistency. By manipulating the amount of water and time used during preparation, you can get the oatmeal to have almost the exact same consistency as you would get from steel-cut oats. The texture will still be slightly different, perhaps inferior, but the difference is subtle. The taste of steel-cut oats is also similar, but slightly better. I cannot understand why so many people are raving about steel-cut oats while acting as if rolled oats are the most disgusting thing on the face of the planet. They are both very good. I think that most people would prefer steel-cut oats, however. If you like rolled oats, you will like steel-cut oats. If you don't like rolled-oats, you probably will not like steel-cut oats either.

review/summary: Goodlife Recipe Indoor Wholesome Salmon & Garden Greens Delights
review/text: From my 3 cat's point of view these are the best treats they have ever tasted (and they have tasted many types).  The cats keep wanting more and more.  I have to hide the packet.  If your cats like what my cats like, they will love these.  The extra cost is well worth it to see your cats enjoy these treats.  I should have known they would love them because their all time favorite regular dry cat food is The Goodlife Recipe Indoor (made with Real Chicken, Brown Rice & Garden Greens) food.

review/summary: My cats love these so much...
review/text: My cats love these so much that one of them stole an entire bag off the kitchen counter, tore out the bottom, and ate most of it while I was away one morning. That said, I'm not terribly happy with these treats. The 2nd, 4th, and 6th main ingredients in the treats are ground corn, rice, and wheat flour -- starches I'm not stoked about giving my cats. The ingredient list is also very long. These were the best I could find at my local grocery store, and the cats definitely like them, but I'm hoping to find better ones through Amazon. I'm looking for a poultry-based treat with few additives; I picked these out because, despite the 'real salmon and garden greens flavor,' the ingredient list begins with chicken by-product meal; for reference, salmon meal is the 17th ingredient and the first green comes much later.

review/summary: cat drugs!
review/text: My cat is very picky , and has rarely liked the treats we have offered over the years. A while back  we had to give him some medicine and wanted to find something to give him afterward.  We found these and decided to try them.<br />Well , we finally hit kitty gold!  We shake the bag 3 rooms away and he arrives at the speed of light!<br /><br />I am afraid of what would happen to us if we ran out  of these treats. I think that our cat might sneak up in the middle of the night and disappear us.. or worse!! So I just bought a 12 pack ...I think we are safe, for now...

review/summary: My Cats Say "MEOW" and So Does my Dog!
review/text: My cat children love, love, love this product! My Daughter worked for a veterinarian, and brought home some sample packs. Well, why did she do that? Those cats went into a tastebud frenzy! The call of one of their names AND everybody comes running! Even my Dog asks for the treats and they are just tiny, weeny in size, but she loves them as well; and will sit until she gets one as well! This treat was vet recommended and cat approved! The Seller's price point was better than every 'Google' search...Even with Petco and Petsmart!!! Go figure! The delivery time was equally good. Would not only recommend this product but would recommend this Seller. Would purchase from this Seller in the future as well.

review/summary: Perfect Little Treat for Entertainment.
review/text: I got this product from a seller on Amazon.com as a sample when I purchased some Fancy Feast Kitten food. My new kitty, Mo-No is just loving it! He was a little skeptical at first, so I left them on the floor in the middle of my office. He got into them later in the evening, and we must not had seen him. He was so festive when a friend came to visit! Then this morning, I watched him nibble just a tad bit at them.. and at this very moment.. he is running around the entire apartment bouncing off walls, literally!! I love this stuff! These treats are safe (research was done) and nutritious for my love... I will be purchasing more of these, now that I know what the good stuff is!

I could get them to come into the RV anytime I wanted all I had to do what make a noise like I was opening the bag of Treats and they came running.  They turn their nose up at all the other one's now.  I live in Canada and can't buy them here, so I have to order them from Amazon.

review/text: I can't vouch for how healthy these are, I haven't done that research.  But my cat LOVES these (as does my mother's cats) and with the help of these treats I am able to clip my cat's claws, which otherwise I'd have to ask the vet to do because my cat hates claw clipping.  But honestly, if I put a few of these treats in front of  him, he lets me clip him no problem.  For that they get 5 stars.

review/summary: Not smoked salmon. Baked salmon that has been smoked.
review/text: When I ordered this product I thought that it was smoked salmon, as it is labeled on the package. However when I got the product it was not actually smoked salmon. True smoked salmon has the texture of raw salmon because it is cooked with smoke instead of temperature. This salmon is cooked with temperature and then is either smoked or has the smoke flavor added. While it does taste good, it is not 16.00 or so dollars good, and is not what the labeling leads one to believe. Not a full one star because it is a good quality fish, if you want to pay that much money for it. But again, it is not true smoked salmon.

review/text: I found these cookies at my local Costco and hesitated before finally deciding to try them. They are delicious! I have only had the cranberry, but they also have pistachio and chocolate! I am a cookie fanatic who has recently decided to start eating better. These make the perfect guilt free snack. Only 100 calories! The name says it all - they are addictive! The cookie itself is thin and crunchy. The cranberry is just the right amount of chewy and tart, and the almond slivers complete this tasty treat. If you like biscotti, you will love these.

review/summary: Delicious but Costly
review/text: This are the best cookie I have ever eaten, and if I could only stop at one little 3 cookie pack, it would be perfect. Costco does carry the cranberry almond, which is great but doesn't carry the chocolate chip. As a chocoholic I would like to find them. You can't beat Costco's price of 20 packs for $6.99. BJ's carries an assorted box of 15 for $5.99. The Christmas Tree Shops carry the chocolate chip as well as the other varieties in a smaller box of 7  packs for $3.99. I thought that was way too expensive until I see them here for $24.00 for 20 packs! I know that they have to ship them, but even so, the price is unreasonable.<br />So if you find these great little cookies, buy a bunch because Costco says they only buy them around Christmas time and when they run out they won't be bringing any more in for many months.<br />All you Costco members, an e-mail requesting them would help.

review/summary: Wow! Addictive Thins is very appropriate name - they are delicious and addictive!
review/text: These Cranberry Almond Thins were offered as samples at Costco today, and I was instantly addicted! I immediately bought a package and it will not be my last. They are delicious! Not too sweet, crunchy, with cranberries adding tartness, and a almond slices adding almond flavor to the cookie.  They come in nice individual packages, each package has three thins.  A perfect amount for a snack and kind of stops you from eating more. Maybe not totally stop, but at least make you think about opening the next one!<br /><br />The best price on them is at Costco at $6.99.  I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool to be very helpful. I set up an alert on Amazon if the price approaches this amount.<br /><br />I really like the taste of these thins and recommend them!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/text: My MIL packed these in a snack bag to take on the car ride home and I thought, "oh geez another one of her health food cardboard snacks".  Five hours into the car ride I began to get very hungry and decided to try one of these and they were so good I ended up eating four packs in one sitting.  They're crunchy and sweet (but not too sweet) and cholesterol free.  The cranberries and almonds are a wonderful combination with just the right amount of almond flavoring baked into the cookie.  There is a reason they're called thin addictives because they're just so addictive!  I have not been able to find them anywhere (including the internet) so I kept checking on amazon's site and low and behold they now have them!!!!!!!!!!!  Yay to Amazon for such a wonderful selection on a variety of items!  Thank you for finally carrying these cookies...my new addiction!
