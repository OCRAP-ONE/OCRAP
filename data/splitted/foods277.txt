review/summary: A Good Simple Snack
review/text: Probably my favorite of the Somersaults Snacks.  They taste like a combination between a salt and pepper chip and nuts.  Their substantial crunch and texture make you feel like you've really eaten something after only a few.  I like to keep some in my purse for those mid-day cravings when I'm out and about and need a snack to keep me going.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I think the Salt and Pepper might be my favorite Somersaults flavor so far!  Neither the salt nor the pepper is overpowering.  They aren't too spicy, and both my children enjoyed them too.  I have been putting these in my son's lunch and he loves them.  The great thing about these snacks is that they are delicious, portable, healthy, and satisfying due to the protein in the sunflower seeds.  I will definitely be buying these again.  :)

review/summary: Nuts/seeds, a bit of spice, delicious!!  I love these...
review/text: I was absolutely delighted when I just accidentally tried these at a Caribou lately, but... I LOVE them!!<br /><br />A delicious "cracker" of sorts, made mostly with sunflower seeds and other seed-nut-type things, though they do have a fairly standard cracker carb load, which is unfortunate. If a bit lower on carbs (I think it's somewhere around 14-16g per small (2 oz?) bag, they might well be the only thing I eat [besides eggs, and lettuce].<br /><br />I really, really love these things! The combination of salt/pepper on snacks, I find irresistible, and on these healthy, nut/seed snacks... way better than potato chips! While there IS something cardboard ish about their texture (could be what the negative review is referencing), to me similar to [Va-]Nilla Wafers and Saltines, both classics, the flavor of these salt/pepper Somersaults is killer-delicious. I tried another flavor at Caribou but didn't enjoy it at all, though the salt/pepper, well, I personally can't stop eating them. I buy them anytime I see them and am sad they're not at my local grocery.<br /><br />I'm very, very excited to have found them here, and can't wait to receive them!!!  :)

review/text: I didn't know what to expect when ordering these, but I gave it a try anyway.  Kinda like a mix between a cracker and pretzel chunk with sunflower seeds.  The salt and pepper flavoring is great and tends to be self limiting in consumption.  The pepper keeps you from eating too many at a time.  Very tasty!

review/summary: Just the right heat, without too much "spiciness"
review/text: The main reason to buy the salt and pepper variety over the "plain" sea salt flavored somersaults is simple - the salt-only variety are FAAAAR too addictive. It's really hard to stop eating them. The pepper, while just as yummy in taste/texture as the sea salt, offers a feeling of greater "substance"... Maybe it's hard to imagine, but one of the reasons snacks are generally so salty is that the saltiness makes you crave more. These seem to lack that "crack factor", while still being really great treats to munch on.<br /><br />Not sure what the other reviewer is talking about... If they were that gross, you would RETURN THEM, not throw them out. I think it might be a false review, given how completely wacky it sounds.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are familiar with any variety of somersaults, the pepper are a good option to try. I will say I was expecting "bigger chunks" of peppercorn - these are misted in very fine grain pepper, which means you get all the heat spread throughout each nugget, but not as much strong pepper-spice flavor.<br /><br />Only negative was I did find a single nugget that seemed coated with about a millimeter thick coating of pepper, so perhaps there are manufacturing issues that may cause per-bag variances? Anyway, I'm hooked!

review/text: Having previously purchased Harney & Sons Peppermint tea, I thought I knew exactly what I was getting. However, this particular tea is just ok. It turns out, what I had previously purchased was the Peppermint Herbal caffeine-free herbal tea from Harney & Sons Historic Royal Palace Line (solid green tin box). This particular one from Amazon is actually Peppermint Herbal tea from Harney & Sons Classic Collection line (cream tin box). Both product details say the tea leaves are from Oregon, but they must process the tea leaves differently or use a different variety because the Classic Collection version, while brews a decent cup of tea, just doesn't give that same impactful 'wow' minty flavor of the Historic Royal Line version.

review/text: I have been a vegetarian for 15 years.  One of the little things I miss is jerky.  I have made it myself, with good results, and tired several commercial brands.  Pan's is by fair the best I have had. Great taste, good spice and heat, with a great chewy texture. I actually hate mushrooms but love this product.  My only complaint, and the reason I didn't get it 5 stars, is that this product is NOT vegan, as it contains egg whites. Seem kinda odd they would go to the trouble to make a vegetarian jerky and not just make it vegan as well. I am not complaining, as I still love this product, but I vegan version would be nice.

review/summary: Consistently Good Green Tea
review/text: I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.

review/text: The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in.  The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.  Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt).  It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.  I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not "loose" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern.  Per the box, store in a cool, dry place.<br />Nutritional info:<br /><br />Servings per container: 1<br />Calories: 120<br />Total fat: 2g (3%)<br />Saturated fat: 1g (5%)<br />Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 50 mg (17%)<br />Sodium: 1360 mg (57%)<br />Total carbohydrates: 4g (1%)<br />Dietary fiber: 0g<br />Sugars: 2g<br />Protein: 22g

review/text: This is a sooo much better snack than crackers or chips.  I have blood sugar issues and a protein snack is just what I need.  I also quit smoking in Jan. 2007 and am still smoke free thanks to Jack Links 2 oz. Original Beef Steak.  I honestly love them.

review/summary: Tastes great and not loaded with corn syrup or sugar
review/text: These jerky packs are great.  They actually do fill you up or at least stop the grum bellies.  I stay away from all the products that are just different ways of eating sugar and corn syrup.  I have a boy with ADD and I don't have him on drugs so it is very nice to have a great tasting and filling snack that isn't just sugar with flavoring.  Since sugar and corn syrup are major contributors to that condition.  Keep up the good work Jack Link.

review/text: I enjoy this product simply because it is beef jerky (don't know when I became a redneck) and I like how it comes in 1-oz packages, but I won't be ordering this flavor again.  I'd recommend the pepper flavor instead.

review/summary: Good snack!
review/text: Have order three boxes in total now. I bring one as a snack to work almost everyday. Soooo much cheaper to order from Amazon than to buy at a gas station. Some reviews say they've had 'moldy' packages. So far I've only had one single package that tasted a little off. The rest of the box was fine. Some jerky strips will have a bit of congealed grease on them, I just wipe it off. Perhaps those folks with the 'moldy' packages were mistaking grease for mold? I will continue to buy this product from Amazon and will always have a box on hand in my pantry. (Oh, of note, these strips are made from WHOLE strips of beef, not the "chipped, chopped, pressed and pattied" variety, and it is very lean. Lots of protein and only 70 calories a package. 'Beats a package of potato chips any day! They are a tad salty, but so are potato chips - and I always have something to wash them down with too!)

review/text: I subscribed and saved to this kind of jerky in the past, then had the subscription canceled for a time. Since jerky is more expensive by the piece, I recently restarted the subscription... only to cancel it after the second shipment. It's nasty. I got two boxes of it and don't know what to do with it. It's old, moldy and disgusting. I am very disappointed with this product and recommend people avoid this until the company steps up and improves the quality. It may be a better deal to buy it in quantity, but it's not when you can't even eat it.

review/text: The best jerky I've found for a low price. I'd rather have the organic/free range/etc jerky but am a poor grad student, so this stuff works for me. The best deal I can find for jerky anywhere is here on Amazon.<br /><br />They are so easy to carry around and are very filling. Sometimes they are a little tougher than others, but it's not so bad you'll rip your teeth out eating them. I only have 2 complaints - a ridiculous amount of sodium and a few other additives (like SUGAR) that I'd prefer not to be eating. But still... so good for what you pay for.

review/summary: Best Jerky / Beef Steak! Best to buy it from Amazon!!
review/text: I have not yet purchased this product FROM amazon, BUT as soon as my box from the Jack Link's Site is gone I will forever buy it from Amazon alone! This (Jack Link's ORINGINAL Beef Steak) is my absolute FAVORITE jerky and has been for years! I've spent way to much time and gas looking for it at near-by stores only to be disapointed and settling for either Jack Link's other products or O'Boy Oberto which are both fine, but for me it does NOTHING for my beef jerky cravings! It is true it is quite salty but what good beef jerky isn't???? My husband a fitness/gym nut LOVES this jerky as well as the high protein content! I also LOVE the extremly low fat content as I cannot stand chewing on leather or fat that never chews away! This product is not only healthy (aside from salt), filling, great tasting, and a great snack thats easy to eat it is also CHEAP! At least in my perspective! On Amazon it is an amazing $10.00+ cheaper (when including shipping cost) than the same box from the Jack Link's website(kicking myself in the butt for that)! I will absolutely be setting up auto shipping for this product!

review/summary: Less Additives than other Packaged Jerky
review/text: It's tough to rate a food item as everyone has their own tastes. However, I think when it comes to store bought beef jerky, Jack Link's is about as good as they come. Most companies add a ton of extra garbage to their jerky, including sugar. You'll sometimes find 8-10 grams of sugar in some other brands. But with Jack Link's you are getting only 2 grams, and a taste that is comparable. And while all jerky is high in sodium, I realized these are a bit less than most competitors.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is just good beef jerky without all the hoopla. A perfect healthy snack for someone in need of a little extra protein during the day. It won't beat the stuff coming direct from a butcher, but it's better than most of the other one's you'll find at a convenient store.

review/summary: Good but salty!
review/text: It's a nice price for a good jerky.  I try to keep loaded up on protein, and these jerkys are easy to just have lying around in case I feel like having one.  They taste pretty good, they're very low in carbohydrates and fat...<br /><br />But they're too salty.  I don't mean in a "Gee that's more than the Surgeon General recommends" kind of way, but in a disgusting kind of way.  Maybe if you have a really high tolerance for salt it's no problem, but I think most people would agree...anyway I get the Teriyaki flavor, with 440 mg of salt per oz.  The Pepper and the original flavors, at 770 per oz, are just too salty for me to want to eat.<br /><br />Amazon also has like alligator and elk and duck jerkey for sale...think I might give those a try once I run through this box.

review/summary: Thick and chewy, not traditional jerky but delicious nonetheless
review/text: I am in search of a good jerky and just had to try these.  I guess I paid little attention to the label "Beef Steak" versus beef jerky.  These pieces are thick and chewy and very peppery (in the original flavor).  I [personally find that I have more of an affinity to the regular, thinner sliced jerky over these "beef steaks" ... but we bought two boxes and are certainly enjoying them.<br /><br />These 2-ounce packs are filling, packed with protein and provide a great mid-day energy boost.  They travel well and the Jack Links brand has not let us down.  With so many varieties, we will be trying more.  These were a pleasant surprise and were different.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a thicker cut, 2 oz packs have 1280 mgs of sodium per serving.  Quite a lot!  Also, keep a toothpick or dental floss nearby, you'll need it!<br /><br />Very enjoyable nonetheless.

I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up.  The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty.

It's not as soft as normal jerky you find in the bag - I think this stuff is made differently.  It's tough and salty (that's what she said).  It's not the best tasting Jerky I've ever had, but for the price it definitely exceeds my expectations.  I've tried the Oberto brand jerky sticks and they were not very good at all.  And with 23g of protein and only 2g of fat in each stick it's pretty good for you!  One stick is pretty much a meal, though.  I find myself working on it for about 30 minutes before I down it all (that's what she said).<br /><br />Goodnight everybody - i'll be in town all week!

The spicy taste lingers in your mouth for a bit but it's not a hot burn. It's not as tasty as I'd like but overall it's good and I'll order it again. My favorite is the peppered though, great taste and just a little spice from the pepper.

review/text: I like the peppered flavor a lot better than the original or plain, it does have a good cracked pepper flavor. I also think the quality is better than most other brands that I have tried. I like the 1 oz. packages and great value compared to buying individually.

review/summary: Great for gym rats..
review/text: This product is pretty good. With 26 or 27 grams of protien and low in fat, it is great for gym enthusiasts or people who want to stay healthy by eating healthy. I personally am a body builder and I'm looking to eat as much protien as possible everday. I definatly noticed an upgrade in performance in the gym and during the day when I take this. Although the cajun flavor is a tade too spicy for me at times. Like my eyes will get red and my nose will start to run. Other than that it is delicous. I will probably try the Teriyaki next.

review/summary: Needs to retain freshness longer...Gets like shoe leather
review/text: Even though these are in sealed, individual packages, which is nice, it seems like they don't retain there freshness. A few of the sticks got like shoe leather and had little taste. I would not purchase them again. I think they should have more flavor since they are vaccummed sealed for freshness. Also the sticks get very hard.

review/text: Hickory is one of the top flavors when we asked US troops what they like.  They love the steak strips as they are a bit softer but very satisfying.  If being able to carry along a snack, and needing protein is part of your decision, this flavor in a steak strip cannot be beat !  You won't go wrong on this item.

review/summary: Steak Strips
review/text: Good brand.  They must pay their sales people a lot tho.  I saw these in stores for at least 50% more and convenience stores.... well, who has a wheelbarrow that big to haul around their change in?<br /><br />Send a lot of Jacks Link's steak strips and jerky to the American GIs in the Sand and found ordering it this way to be much more pliable and easier on your jaw than the same brand in Mart type or warehouse membership stores. If you send any to the heat like that, this is a much better product so there's a little time allowed to still have decent jerky arrive.  Steak strips and jerky are better liked than the nuggets tho..

review/summary: Try it in strip form and from somewhere else
review/text: I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer.

review/summary: Eating Salt Jerky
review/text: I thought this was similar to the Jack Links Peppered Beef Jerky, boy was I wrong.  This stuff is like eating pure SALT.  Nasty as hell.  One package serving is 57% of your recommended daily intake of Sodium.  This is one of the highest content of sodium I've found in Beef Jerky.  I don't recommend this unless you really really like SALT.

review/text: These boxes of decaffeinated tea were purchased as presents for my ageing in-laws who had had to give up their beloved coffee and espresso because of health reasons.  At last, I had discovered something useful and affordable to give as gifts to loved ones who had "everything".  After scouring the website, I eventually chose this brand because of the price.  However, my in laws claim that it is "very good" indeed so the low price is an added bonus.  They have been thrilled with a neverending supply of the beverage since we can "afford" to send them the tea in our care packages that go out every few weeks.

review/summary: Bigelow Green Tea Pomegranate K-Cup
review/text: This is a very flavorful tea. The pomegranate flavor comes through. It isn't as earthy as plain green tea.  It is fruity.  I don't feel like I'm missing anything a traditional tea bag has to offer. I've made green tea using whole leaf, tea bags and k-cups. The k-cup makes it all the more enjoyable because it is fast and there is no clean-up.  I think the tea tastes fresh with every cup because it isn't like opening a box and having it sit around waiting for me to use the rest of it. I will definitely purchase this tea k-cup again.

review/text: This is a wonderful, delicate, yet so tasty green tea. The Pomegranate gives it a special, almost zesty, taste. I ordered a box of it for my Keurig machine, and went through the 1st box at record speed. Since then, I order two boxes at a time, Since it's a green (herbal) tea, you can enjoy it any time of day or as a tisane in the evening.  I think you'll like it as much as I do.
