review/summary: Don't waste your money!
review/text: Awful, Awful, Awful!  I like a lighter roast and I really love french vanilla so I was thrilled to find this one.  With the first sip I was highly disappointed.  It has a very strong artificial flavor that doesn't taste anything like french vanilla and it certainly doesn't taste like coffee.  Like one other reviewer said, I'll probably just toss it in the trash and throw that money away because I don't know anybody who would enjoy it.  YUK!

review/summary: One of the best k cups we've tried so far!
review/text: I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla. It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!<br /><br />Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either. It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.

review/summary: What happened 2 my once-favorite coffee?
review/text: I have been drinking this Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee for quite a while and recommending it to all my friends.  I LOVED it!  My first conscious thought every morning would be of that great-tasting cup of coffee.  YUM!  So what happened to it?  The last few boxes have been absolutely tastless :(  There is no wonderful aroma either.  I might as well be drinking hot water.  This is SUCH a disappointment.  That wonderful flavor is now only a memory.  Sadly, I am giving up on Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and will purchase another flavor from now on.

review/summary: AMAZING!!
review/text: After seeing all the reviews for this, I had to try it and now need to order another box of them. The smell of it brewing alone is probably enough reason to want to get more, but it tastes just as good as it smells. I've come to expect the same aromatic results from other kcup flavors and every other kind I have tried hasn't come anywhere near how this one brews. I find myself sniffing other flavors while they're brewing to see if there is any smell at all and I'm generally disappointed. This is my favorite flavor thus far!

review/summary: Decadence without the guilt!
review/text: I am happy to find that Amazon carries the Van Houtte k-cups, as the pricing is far better than other resources for k-cups.  This k-cup flavor strikes a nice balance between coffee and the chocolate and raspberry flavors, and you can feel like you're enjoying a nice truffle candy without the calories or guilt.<br /><br />The two box packaging is a plus if you're like me and have a Keurig at home and another at work.  This way, a box can go to work and the other stay home.  NOTE: these are the 24 count boxes, too, not the 12 or 14 that seem to fill the shelves of the local supermarkets, WalMart and department stores!<br /><br />If you're new to the K-cups and want a flavored coffee that delivers the flavor in the title, you can't go wrong with any of the Van Houtte varieties.  The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle and French Vanilla are my favorites, followed by Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee and Mudslide.

review/summary: Meh....
review/text: I would actually give this coffee 2-1/2 stars, as I don't hate it, it isn't awful, but very "meh" for me.  As others have said, nice raspberry aroma and noticeable raspberry taste, but that's it.  The only flavor I detected (close to overriding the coffee altogether, so you could almost be drinking flavored hot water) is the raspberry.  The coffee is WEAK, no buts about it.  If you like coffee with body/"legs", you won't be happy.  Very watery-tasting 'mouth feel.'  I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz "cup" I brewed *two* K-cups - one 6 oz. and one 8 oz. - likely smaller than most people would brew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had brewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder. Maybe try adding 4 oz. shots of it to a full-bodied coffee.

I like mochas and sweet coffee drinks from Starbucks and Coffee Bean, so that should give you an idea of how my taste is skewed.  I mix this coffee with International Delight "White Chocolate Mocha" creamer and it is the bomb!  Perfect hint of raspberry with the chocolate truffle flavor.  You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Terrible waste of chocolate and raspberry flavors
review/text: I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.  I drink a lot of flavored coffees and decided to try this one due to the rave reviews and being a combo of two of my favorite flavors.<br /><br />I've gone through one box, and am either giving the second one away (if I can find someone to take it) or just pitching it.  The quality control on the flavorings is HORRIBLE.  One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a "tinny" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.<br /><br />If the flavor/strength of the chocolate and raspberry were consistent throughout, it would be two and a half stars.  As it stands, it's more of a waste of water and electricity.

review/summary: Kitten Heaven
review/text: This catnip is so potent my cat begs for it. We have to keep the container hidden away or she will try to pry off the lid with her teeth. After purchasing a "bulk" brand catnip at the local store, she turned her nose up and thought it was just terrible that we would expect her to go kitten wild over anything else.<br /><br />Cosmic Catnip is the one she loves and she will literally eat it out of the container by the mouthful if we let her. It is interesting that cats in nature actually eat wild catnip to aid with digestion. They recommend a tablespoon, but a teaspoon seems to be enough to make any cat a little bouncy and playful. Princess will nibble on some from the container and then we sprinkle some on the floor and she rolls around and acts like she is in kitten heaven.<br /><br />This is also good for toys and you can roll a toy in the catnip and your cat should be occupied for quite a while. While this herb makes cats wild, I drink a catnip tea and it seems calming.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: It's not what I was expecting
review/text: Sorry I can't give this stuff a screaming good review.  Maybe catnip is a sort of personal thing as our cat Tasha has shown great interest in catnip filled mice in the past but this catnip she's ambivalent to.  Hence why I can only give the product a neutral three stars.  I stuffed a catnip mouse with this product and she checked the freshly filled mouse out but showed a nearby older catnip laced mouse more interest.  I placed a small amount next to her on the back patio and yes, after two sessions, she ate it all but other than laying there, she seemed not to be affected by the catnip.  I fed some catnip to her a second time and she ate a bit but in the end, blew the rest of the catnip off.  In the morning while my wife and I are on the patio for coffee, Tasha's more animated in her morning play without then with.<br /><br />In summary, I can't say it's not good catnip, I can only say that Tasha didn't show a whole lot of interest in this product.  I guess like beer, everybody has their product preferences and for her, this doesn't seem to be knocking her socks off.  I'm currently looking at other catnip products, including sprays and extract oils.  FWIW, if we wanted, we can get this same product at our local pet store for a bit less then here; including California sales tax, $5.50.  When one takes into consideration the price of gas coupled to the time it takes to shop for a product of this kind, this is a reasonably priced product.  I'll keep trying to interest Tasha in this product as I'm not going throw the catnip away.  And if she shows more than a passing interest, I'll stop by, change my star rating and amend what I've written here.  Until then, hope my above helps with your shopping decision.

review/summary: Crack for Cats!!
review/text: My local pet store stopped carrying Cosmic, so I decided to try their other brand thinking, "Catnip is catnip."  Right?  Wrong!!  Maisey Mae was so disappointed with this other stuff that she actually moaned at me when I set in in front of her.<br /><br />Without hesitation I switch back to Cosmic (this time from Amazon) and she is in kitty heaven again!  Her eyes get all big and wild as she turns into a playful kitten again.  This stuff literally gets her high!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY OTHER CATNIP!!

review/text: My cats and kittens loved this product so much that they got onto the counter where I was storing it (with the lid closed) and ripped off the top and decided to roll around in it.  My largest and oldest cat Harvey had so much fun with it that she kept falling off the counter in a drunkin stupor and had to keep jumping back up to roll around it!  They were adorable, and had a great time, even though they made a massive mess.

review/summary: Best Organic Gummi Bear Wannabees
review/text: I bought these because they are dye-free (allergy).  I had purchased some previously in a local natural foods market, so I knew what to expect.  They are soft and fruity and have a sugary coating.  They are flavorful and have a consistency more like jelly candy than original Gummi Bears. If you want something really chewy, this is not it.  However, if you just want something natural/organic that can substitute for Gummi Bears, I think this brand is pretty good.

review/summary: Gummy Candy that is Actually Worth the Guilt
review/text: I first tried Sunny Bears in a grocery store while on a trip through a small town in Northern California.  One taste, and HOOKED!  OK, so I love Gummi Bears, but these are different.  There are a little less waxy and firm, and more soft and chewy, with a slight bit of granular sugar on the outside.  The flavor is very natural, because they use real CANE sugar in the mix, not a substitute or a cheaper form of sweetner.  After my travel supply was long gone, I checked with local grocery stores for more, but no one had ever heard of them.  Then came a search on Amazon, and there they were!  Saved!  A new source for a tasty little indulgence.  This chewy candy is great when you want just a taste of something sweet, without scarfing down an entire cheesecake.  I was about to buy more on-line, then I discovered they now carry it at my local WHOLE FOODS grocery store.  So however you get them, they are worth a try... you'll like 'em.

review/text: This is a great mug.  I normally like a more petite cup and saucer but this is very close to a cup but with the sturdiness of a mug.  The picture does not do justice to the nice lime color of the mug.  More green than the picture shows.<br /><br />My problem is I don't drink my drinks too fast.  I take a sip and wait 10 minutes while I browse the internet.  This cup goes a long way in keeping my tea or coffee from getting too cold.  I ordered another one for work and may get a few more before I'm done.<br /><br />The "handle" on the top where the swirl is located, isn't too big but you can grip it if you're careful.  I have not used the infuser.  It's so pretty I may put it in my hobby room to hold sewing notions.

review/summary: Really nice cup.
review/text: Just got this yesterday and have to say, I like it.<br /><br />Pros: Nice ceramic material, not flimsy and not too heavy to be uncomfortable holding in your hand.  The lime green is my favorite color, so it gets points for that.  The lid doubling as a saucer for the infuser is handy, no drippy mess on the table.  I used it in the microwave and it heated up the water faster than when I use a plastic cup.<br /><br />Cons: The lid has such a loose fit on top of the cup that I can foresee it falling off and breaking.  Also, when placing the infuser in the lid, it doesn't fit all the way in and kind of rocks back and forth a little, making it a bit unstable.  The design could certainly have been better.  The infuser works well, but still allows small particles of tea leaf to get through into the cup, not that it's a major problem, but something a coffee filter would block.<br /><br />So, other than the design, which needs to be improved on, I really have nothing bad to say about it.<br /><br />Would give it 5 stars except for the poor design.

review/text: I didn't expect this to be as delicious as the fresh, warm kettle corn I buy some Saturday mornings at our downtown farmers market, but I did expect the sweet/salty combination that's characteristic of kettle corn. This popcorn is too sweet. The sugar coating is also much thicker and crunchier than traditional corn. It's very similar to Cracker Jacks or Crunch 'n Munch, but without the nuts. It's a tasty snack if you're just looking for something sweet and natural, but it may be disappointing if you're expecting kettle corn.

review/text: The first time I tasted this brand I couldn't believe it was so low in calories, fat and sugar. When I went back to buy more they had discontinued it and I was so disappointed.  I love this so much, that when I found it on Amazon, I put in a standing order to have it shipped to me every month.  It has a wonderful flavor and you can eat a reasonable amount without all the guilt that usually comes with eating snack food.  If you like this, try their black and white popcorn snack.

review/summary: The BEST Kettle Corn I have ever purchased
review/text: LesserEvil brand kettle corn is the best tasting and satisfying sweetened popcorn I have ever purchased. I have purchased it as 6.5 ounce and 1.75 ounce packages at both the grocery store and through Amazon. If you enjoy this product, I recommend purchasing the product through Amazon.

review/summary: I don't even like kettle corn but, I LOVE this!
review/text: I bought this to use in a recipe I choose this kettle corn for one; because there was no soybean oil (nothing really wrong with soybean oil it's just that soy in everything and it's most likely awlways GMO so when given the option I opt out) two; it was made with brown rice syrup good a "lesser evil" sweetener and three; way lower in fat than all other kettle corn. BoO ya. ....I got hungry on the way home from the grocery store and opened them up and Loved them. THey are a very respectable indulgence. THey taste like carmel corn to me. THey are no longer around for my recipe but I will definately be back for more.  who knew?

review/summary: With mouse droppings! Yum Yum! Poopcorn
review/text: I received this order in a nice Amazon box sold by Amazon sent from an Amazon warehouse. Not and I repeat not from Lesser Evil who should not be held responsible for this mess. I opened the Amazon box to find a damaged, partially opened Lesser Evil box. I opened that box to find 12 bags most with mouse gnaw holes, free floating popcorn mixed with many mouse droppings. The box was damaged enough where partially eaten popcorn, or should I say poopcorn was falling out of it! This should have never made it to shipping! Shame on you Amazon! Shame on the jerk who shipped it! I'm just glad I opened the box before my kids!

review/summary: Pretty nice
review/text: The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in.  The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.  Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt).  It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.  I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not "loose" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern.  Per the box, store in a cool, dry place.<br />Nutritional info:<br /><br />Servings per container: 1<br />Calories: 120<br />Total fat: 2g (3%)<br />Saturated fat: 1g (5%)<br />Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 50 mg (17%)<br />Sodium: 1360 mg (57%)<br />Total carbohydrates: 4g (1%)<br />Dietary fiber: 0g<br />Sugars: 2g<br />Protein: 22g

review/text: ...in that it's chewy, beefy, and has a long shelf life. Jack Link's Peppered jerky is a tad too peppery for my liking, so I expected the teriyaki flavor to be just as robust. Instead, it is mild. Still really good, however! One word of caution, although it's addictive, eat in moderation, or your sodium levels will be off the chart.

I even gave them a second try the next month and they were all moldy AGAIN. Terrible company. "Subscribe and save" users should form a class action lawsuit like done against Netflix when they gave new subscribers the latest movies, leaving the old B movies to the long term customers. Shame on Jack Links. Pathetic.

Since then, they either have mold or have been so hard that I cannot take a first bite through it (sidenote: I am an avid carnivore). They need to step up their quality control before selling this.

review/text: After trying the teriyaki flavor of these beef steaks, I decided I would try another flavor so I ordered these peppered ones.  The flavor is really like throwing a salt and pepper shaker into your mouth.  You never really get a chance to taste the meat since your tongue is overwhelmed by this cloyingly salty, stale pepper flavor.  The worst part? There is 1470mg of Sodium in a single package, which is a whopping 61% of your daily value of sodium for the ENTIRE day.

I stay away from all the products that are just different ways of eating sugar and corn syrup.  I have a boy with ADD and I don't have him on drugs so it is very nice to have a great tasting and filling snack that isn't just sugar with flavoring.  Since sugar and corn syrup are major contributors to that condition.  Keep up the good work Jack Link.

review/summary: Good snack!
review/text: Have order three boxes in total now. I bring one as a snack to work almost everyday. Soooo much cheaper to order from Amazon than to buy at a gas station. Some reviews say they've had 'moldy' packages. So far I've only had one single package that tasted a little off. The rest of the box was fine. Some jerky strips will have a bit of congealed grease on them, I just wipe it off. Perhaps those folks with the 'moldy' packages were mistaking grease for mold? I will continue to buy this product from Amazon and will always have a box on hand in my pantry. (Oh, of note, these strips are made from WHOLE strips of beef, not the "chipped, chopped, pressed and pattied" variety, and it is very lean. Lots of protein and only 70 calories a package. 'Beats a package of potato chips any day! They are a tad salty, but so are potato chips - and I always have something to wash them down with too!)

Since jerky is more expensive by the piece, I recently restarted the subscription... only to cancel it after the second shipment. It's nasty. I got two boxes of it and don't know what to do with it. It's old, moldy and disgusting. I am very disappointed with this product and recommend people avoid this until the company steps up and improves the quality. It may be a better deal to buy it in quantity, but it's not when you can't even eat it.

review/summary: Best Jerky / Beef Steak! Best to buy it from Amazon!!
review/text: I have not yet purchased this product FROM amazon, BUT as soon as my box from the Jack Link's Site is gone I will forever buy it from Amazon alone! This (Jack Link's ORINGINAL Beef Steak) is my absolute FAVORITE jerky and has been for years! I've spent way to much time and gas looking for it at near-by stores only to be disapointed and settling for either Jack Link's other products or O'Boy Oberto which are both fine, but for me it does NOTHING for my beef jerky cravings! It is true it is quite salty but what good beef jerky isn't???? My husband a fitness/gym nut LOVES this jerky as well as the high protein content! I also LOVE the extremly low fat content as I cannot stand chewing on leather or fat that never chews away! This product is not only healthy (aside from salt), filling, great tasting, and a great snack thats easy to eat it is also CHEAP! At least in my perspective! On Amazon it is an amazing $10.00+ cheaper (when including shipping cost) than the same box from the Jack Link's website(kicking myself in the butt for that)! I will absolutely be setting up auto shipping for this product!
