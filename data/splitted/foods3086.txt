review/summary: Not Really Amish
review/text: This is typical of a product you could purchase at any grocery store.  We normally buy Amish Buggy Brand which is far superior and actually the same product as if if you purchaseed hand made in an Amish cummunity.  However Amazon was temporairely out of the product. Skip this and just go to the grocery or by Amish Buggy Brand extra wide.

review/summary: What a disappointment!
review/text: I love to eat blue crab.  I mean I absolutely L O V E crab anything, but not this soup.  I do not even want to taste it again.  I certainly would not add it to a crab soup that I make.  That would spoil my soup.  First, it contained no, I repeat no, crab meat...not even tiny pieces.  There were black specs in it that could have been ground black pepper or something else.  Second, I reconstituted it with milk as directed, yet the broth was very thin.  This could be because I used skim milk; however, the directions did not recommend using whole whole milk.  Third, it didn't even taste like crab.  Honestly, it tasted like it was broth left after boiling crab shells and straining out the solids.  I have another can of the stuff that I do not know what to do with.  I certainly do not want to plan a dinner around it, and I wouldn't gift it to anyone.  At least it wasn't too salty.  If anyone has actually enjoyed this soup and thinks that I may have had a bad batch of it, let me know.

review/summary: Where's the Crab - A Real Disappointment
review/text: Friends of ours recommended this soup.  What a disappointment.  It is a an unmemorable  cream soup.  The picture on the can is misleading.  If you look at the picture you would expect it to be full of chunky goodness.  Instead you find a cream soup which is condensed and when reconstituted is a notch below the famous brand name Cream of Mushroom.  There is no chunky goodness.  As a matter of facts the only chunks you might find are parts of the soup which have fully not blended.  Might use it in recipes that call for a cream soup.  Certainly expected more at over $3 a can.

review/summary: Maggi Beef Boullion granules
review/text: I really like the Maggi Beef Boullion granules for seasoning everything... I used to use dried onion soup on roasts, but after I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I had to quit using it because it contains soy... which is bad for estrogen receptive cancer situations... In fact, I had to research food without soy because of this.<br /><br />Anytime you need a "beef" flavor in anything, this product is perfect.. and much easier to use than the cubes... Maggi is one of the only bouillon products without soy that I have been able to find.<br /><br />Besides using it to season roasts, I use it to season beef gravy, and mix with sour cream to make a great dip for vegetables and chips...<br />I cannot find it anymore in my locality and was very pleased to find out I could order it online!<br /><br />Thank you, Maggi, for the wonderful product.<br /><br />Joni Singleton, Mobile, Alabama

review/text: This is so delicious! I don't care that with shipping added, it's over $10 to buy. If you want a unique, tastey, sweet treat, then this is for you! There are five buns in the package, each one is individually wrapped in a cute folded plastic sheet. All you have to do is lift one corner, then lift the corner the first one reveals, and Presto! you have a delicious treat to nibble on, without getting your fingers sticky. They're perfectly sized so you only need to eat one to have a satisfying snack. (Personally I have trouble not eating them all at once. They're just so good! XD) Please try them! Buy for a rare treat. Be warned though, the texture of the bean paste(slightly gritty, like re-fried beans) may turn some people off, but if that doesn't bother you, then you are good to go and enjoy!

review/summary: Filters work well
review/text: These large round filters work well in the CatIt Fresh and Clear Fountain, but I knocked off a star because some seem to be slightly larger than others - and this inhibits the water flow around them and makes the fountain work less well.  The filter is well-constructed of quality materials and filters out everything; hair, dirt, litter, and whatever else the cats get into their fountain.  I would highly recommend purchasing the CatIt Fresh and Clear Fountain; I had tried many before I discovered it, and the price can't be beat.

review/summary: Quiet Cat Filtered Water
review/text: My cats constantly made a mess out of their standing water dish. One would dip her paw into it, to lick the water off - leaving dirt, litter and hair to collect in the bowl - so then the other would turn her nose up at the dish and cry at anyone who was around. This solved it. Mama still dips her paws, but it gets pulled through the filter so Kitten can't complain. Took them a day or two to realize it was for them - even though I let them check it out during set up. They'd sniff and sneeze at the water they just snorted, but wouldn't really drink it. Then I put a small ice cube in the fountain, like I always did when I dropped one on the floor - which apparently signaled to them that its their water now. None of us miss the old water dispenser. My only complaint is having one of the four outlets in my tiny kitchen blocked by the big plug, but we'll live.

review/text: I have the CatIt fountain with the blue plastic which is pictured, which is why I bought it, but I received the package with the green plastic CatIt fountain on the cover with a different serial number. After opening the package and inspecting the filters I see that they are basically the same thing and will also work with my fountain. So if you are like me and have the blue plastic fountain, don't sweat it, if you get the package with the green plastic fountain on the front they still work.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: Like EVERYTHING that I purchase I looked up reviews for this device and decided to purchase it. My aging cat needs a constant source of water so this took the pain out of constantly changing the water. The fountain arrived quickly and assembly wasnt painfull (I do have an engineering degree so my apologies to those who disagree). I love this cat fountain. It runs quitely and after some initial apprehension (well it isnt THAT quiet), my old cat has been using it and seems to have no problem with it. I did have to place her food next to the fountain to get her to come near the fountain. The reason I didnt give it 5 stars are beacause when pouring water in, when it begins to reach the top it has the tendency to overflow onto the floor. It has a floating indicator that tells you when its getting full but I would like a little more tolerance. The other issue is that the filter needs replacing and that means a constant expense and dependency on their products. Small sacrifices for the peace of mind that my cat always has water. Also, the water does evaporate at a rate of about 4 cups per week so you will be refilling.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: This item was easy to set up and does exactly what we hoped it would do. Our 17-year-old cat was crying for fresh water several times a day. We finally realized that changing to clumping litter had created a problem for him because he usually drank using his paws, dipping into the water and then licking them. So much of the litter was clinging to his paws that he could no longer do that. He was getting dehydrated and constantly crying for fresh water. Now he drinks from a gently bubbling fountain and is very content. Cleaning is easy and the little motor is almost silent. We recommend it to anyone who has a cat that is a problem drinker - or any cat that enjoys fresh water.

It's simple to set up and you can fill it without moving it unlike some which require you to take it apart to fill.

I just add a glass every couple of days to keep it full. I left town for a weekend forgetting to top it off and when I got back, there was still a good bit of water left. The filters work very well to keep the water clean and fresh. I can no longer find these at my local pet store, so it's great to know they are on Amazon-- for a cheaper price!

review/summary: Cat loves this fountain
review/text: The fountain is incredibly easy to set up and doesn't smell strongly of plastic.  My cat immediately started drinking out of it and loves it.  The water is constantly running without too much noise and is at a good level for my cat.  The red tab makes it easy to fill without overflowing and the pieces detach very easily for washing (most of them go in the dishwasher).  I suggest buying extra filters since they are hard to find locally.  If you don't clean it in the recommended timeframe (for me, it's once every 3 weeks) you will start to hear the fountain, since the debris makes everything clog up slightly.

review/summary: Fabulous "Instant" Organic Pantry item
review/text: We first tried this product at Costco, not expecting much beyond an emergency 'immediate' organic side for other dishes. We were delighted with how tasty this quinoa & brown rice combo can be. My husband sometimes thought the dish alone 'dry' unless he added a dressing or marinade on top: I, however, thought it was perfect directly from the microwave directions (nutty, with a rich quinoa taste without the overall heaviness of brown rice). When we returned to Costco to get more, alas...like Trader Joe's of late....they did not carry it. It's so irritating to be introduced to a new product and then have no access to it when shops discontinue! Until we lost shopping access we used it: alongside grilled foods; as a base for lentil daal; as a quick starch for a veggie dinner; in mixed salads---and have never been disappointed. It really is a tasty, healthy shelf-stable addition for any frazzled organic-oriented home cook. Enjoy!!

review/summary: Love this tasty rice!
review/text: A co-worker of mine brought this to work for lunch and let some of us try it. I must say I was a little hesitant about Quinoa, only because I had it before and the person didn't make it good at all. But this product was absolutely flavorful, delicious and takes 90 seconds in the microwave. It filled me up with just 3/4 of the serving. The downside is 1 cup serving is like 240 calories, but is so high in whole grain and nutrition, you can't pass up.<br /><br />The rice is not hard at all and seasoned with just the right amount of garlic.

review/summary: Great for Stir-Fry and Fried Rice
review/text: I found Starport Foods through Twitter. I checked out their products and found this one to be suitable for my needs. I had to cook fried rice for 40 people and needed a large bottle of sauce. Starport Foods' Brown Stir-fry sauce was perfect, great flavor, and reasonably priced for a huge gallon. I was able to make vegetarian and meat versions too. Customer service for Starport Foods were great in providing nutritional information as well as recipes. I even got a tip on how to bake rice in the oven! I had enough left over to use at home to cook for my family.<br /><br />Rather than gathering all these different types of asian sauce ingredients (ie. garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, chili paste) this one-step and easy-to-use sauce cuts my cooking time in half. I can make a stir-fry or fried rice in under 20 minutes! Glad I ordered this!<br /><br />I also don't understand the fuss with the one star review. Her complaint was that this sauce is not vegan because it has sugar in it. Not all (non "organic") sugar is processed with bone char. It sucks that she felt the company misinformed her. Her review has nothing to do with the quality of the flavor, use, and practicality of the product as well as the helpfulness of their customer service. Don't diss it if you didn't try it.

review/summary: Best Chicken and Broccoli in town!
review/text: I have been trying for years with no success to duplicate the flavor of typical chicken and broccoli recipes found in the Chinese restaurants and take out places that we all know and love. The solid ingredients of these recipes are obvious and simple, but the flavor of the sauce was always elusive. This product has put an end to my frustration ! Using a 12 inch hand hammered wok from the Wok Shop, I have been able to prepare this dish many times for guests whom all want to know what recipe I'm using or what the "secret" ingredient is. The product makes me appear as if I "really know what I'm doing! Ok...so it comes in a gallon container... but I put mine in 12 oz. squeeze bottles and use as needed, keeping the rest in the refrigerator. Believe me when you start using this stuff you will find yourself making stir fry recipes more often, and coming up with new ideas to use it. Fried rice,  marinades, etc. Before long your friends will be calling you Hop Sing !

review/summary: Vegans Beware: Has Sugar
review/text: This item is listed as vegan, but the list of ingredients is not visible in the image, and the ingredients is not listed on Amazon. I contacted the company to send me the information on a few sauces. They have sugar in them, though they are labelled vegan. The company rep wrote that, "All of the sauces you are interested are vegan, it contains no dairy product, meat or seafood. However, all cooking sauces contain sugar." This is obviously a contradiction to many, if not most vegans.<br /><br />I write this as an FYI to those wanting to find a vegan sauce. My daughter just turned vegan and needs an stir fry sauce without sugar or with organic sugar or other sweetener, so I felt I was almost tricked into buying this, but she would have been upset.<br /><br />I gave it only one star because of this misrepresentation.

I love the rich flavor of just the plain Yerba Mate, but it also comes sweetened naturally w/stevia leaf-also very good. You just need a little 1/4 tsp. per cup, drink hot or cold, and it's both stimulating and relaxing-try some today. Finally, tea is an item you only want to drink organically, as it's extremely pesticide, etc. ridden otherwise. Should be the 13th item after the "dirty dozen"-and coffee!

review/text: This tea lasts a long time because you use very little of the powder for each serving. It tastes great hot or cold, straight or mixed with other teas or even fruit juices.  I usually drink it hot without anything added and a bit stronger than the concentration suggested.  Preparing and drinking this does not give you the same experience as steeping mate leaves yourself, but this is a very convenient way to have the same tea and health benefits.

review/text: This is the essential ingredient for the spicy tofu dish that is a signature of Szechuan cuisine. Don't buy the stuff that calls itself "Szechuan" sauce! The sign of the real deal Szechuan sauce is that it contains "broad bean" paste, not just soybean paste, and it has a name more or less like "toban djan," though it can be spelled various ways in Western script. There are other brands, specifically a Japanese one I've bought in Asian groceries that is significantly hotter and redder (so more chilis, I guess), but this one is just fine and easy to get thanks to Amazon.

review/text: Currently as of Fall of 2012, we go to an Asian store and buy these for $0.49 each packet.<br /><br />The BBQ Chicken Mi Goreng flavor packs on the heat...and just right for those who like their food on the intense side. It has lots of packets of flavor including a spicy chili oil and soy sauce and some msg-powdered seasoning and hot chili powder and even dehydrated fried onions as garnish.<br /><br />It is subtly sweet and the spicy-heat just hits you in every bite and the flavors all merge into deliciousness. This is a flavor unlike any asian bistro cooking, and yet, it's so-oooooooooooo so, so good.<br /><br />I must admit that I have often wanted to find other flavors that were just as tasty and spicy and have only found 1 that is nearly as tasty but it's not a similar sweet-n-hot-savory, it's got heat but it's very different.

Great cup of coffee. In fact, I think the coffee is better than what is in the Senseo pods. These pods are a little thicker, IMO, compared to the others but this means I can sneak another half cup of coffee out of the 2 pods. Would definitely reorder these again.

I'd give 4 stars for my personal taste, however, I knew I was not buying the same coffee, so it'd be unfair to downgrade it. It is still good coffee. I will continue buying it.

review/summary: Top quality sourdough starter
review/text: The wet dough sourdough product is excellent.  Upon feeding and expanding it woke up very quickly and leavened loafs extremely well.  Lots of classic sourdough taste and lots of gas production. But as a university microbiologist, I can't just try out a sourdough starter. I had to take it to the lab and find out what's in it.  I am happy to report that the starter contains precisely what it should: one species of yeast and one species of lactic acid bacteria. It is a complex task to definitively identify them as the authentic Saccharomyces exiguus and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, but everything is consistent so far with them being derived from authentic San Francisco sourdough.  In particular, as one subcultures them repeatedly, the levels of each stay pretty consistent.  This is a hallmark of an authentic sourdough starter pair of microbes. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Fantastic Product and Customer Service
review/text: This product delivers.  Literally.  The San Francisco Sourdough Yeast arrived quickly; the starter is of excellent quality, and the rapid customer service (Rosalyn answered my online questions on a Sunday!) was about the best I have ever experienced.  Good things do come in small packages and this sourdough starter is no exception.<br /><br />As I write this my dough is proofing and that singular San Francisco aroma tells me this is the real thing.  M-m-m.  I close my eyes and remember that delicious, yeasty sourdough from Fisherman's Wharf.<br /><br />The only caveat comes with following the directions.  After the first feeding of the yeast with bread flour and water, the directions state to discard all but � cup, which can be used to make pancakes or biscuits.  (The pancakes were delicious.)  The second and third feedings each require adding � cup water and slightly less than 1 cup (I used 7/8 cup) bread flour.<br /><br />The Sourdough Bread recipe calls for 2 1/3 cups of starter.  Take my advice.  Keep your discarded excess starter (remember, you keep only � cup of it each of the three times) in the refrigerator.  You may use it to create additional starters in order to have enough (2 1/3 cups) to begin making your dough.  Alternatively, take your final (third) proofing, using � cup of it to have enough multiples to make 2 1/3 cups of starter for your dough.<br /><br />The best place for the yeast to activate was in the oven, with the oven light remaining on.  It gives off sufficient heat for a perfect environment and was free from drafts.<br /><br />My dough (2 lbs.,14.5 oz.)  is ready to be punched down and I see that I'll be able to get two large or three medium loaves.<br /><br />One final word:  This does not perform like bread using rapid rise yeast.  Give yourself a week to proof your sourdough yeast, make your dough and allow it rise two times (each rise can be from 12-24 hours).  Good things come to those who wait...

review/summary: yummy fresh tasty sour beer aroma
review/text: This starter is an amazing and well-balanced culture. You can smell the potential in it when it first arrives.  It's supposed to revive by the second day of feeding it, but I found that it almost immediately picked up with bubble action after the initial feeding.  I am going to give this creature a name and invite it into the family.  I'm going to walk it everyday and groom its shiny coat.  I love it!  I'm moderately experienced with sourdough starters and the only starter I've ever used that rivals this starter is one that I was given as part of a baking class years ago from a baker in Boulder, CO -- and that starter had a San Francisco lineage.  Comes with clear instructions.  I would recommend finding the perfect jar for this baby the way you would buy the perfect pet bed for your prize-winning Shi-Tzu.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: Two days after the envelope arrived, I have a quart ball jar about to overflow with active starter, and I'm ready to bake.<br /><br />When you place your order, buy some spring water and have a quart ball jar ready. When the starter comes in the mail, measure a couple of TB of spring water directly into the zip lock bag, and massage the very stiff mixture over several minutes into a loose batter. Squeeze the contents into your ball jar, stir in a couple of TB of flour, and set to rest with the lid loose enough to let expanding air out. Twice a day, double the weight of the jar contents, half and half flour and spring water by weight. Leave plenty of room for expansion; start tossing out half to make room once you've scaled up to your jar size. The provided instructions are simpler, and probably also work just fine.<br /><br />It is worth reading multiple sources (e.g. every book covering sourdough at a bookstore) for perspective. There's a school of thought that this sourdough starter is a visiting tribe of friendlies, to protect the wild yeast on your flour from unfriendlies as your own wild yeast (and its entourage; sourdough is complex) gets established. A month from now, there will only be your yeast. Know another source that dates to the Oregon Trail? Yeah, right. Just like trying to track down Mohito mint; mint is indeterminate, and all you can actually grow is YOUR mint. Mint adapts. Yeast adapts.<br /><br />Thus, any reliable starter is as good as any other, to bootstrap getting your own wild yeast going. This source is the real deal, as good as any, and a convenient Amazon one-click. No need to hesitate.<br /><br />This same school of thought holds that the source doesn't affect your sourdough flavor, once it is replaced by your local friendlies. Rather, the proportion (by weight) between flour and water, and the flours used, affect the response to proofing temperature and the flavor. It is important to train your starter with the same flours you'll be using to bake, perhaps along with some rye no matter what. I'm using freshly ground red wheat and rye, and 1:1 water to flour by weight.<br /><br />There are those who prefer spring water to distilled, as the minerals create a nice environment. Once a starter gets going, plenty of people just use tap water. In any case, the chlorine leaves standing water pretty quickly; one can simply plan ahead and set aside tap water, e.g. in a Brita.

review/text: I have had this starter in use for seven loaves of bread now. I keep it in the refrigerator between uses and bring it out the day before I intend to bake, feed and divide it. I decided a long time ago to treat a starter with respect but to not coddle it and this starter is right there with me each time unlike several other brands I have used in the past. This is the best starter I have ever used, I am glad my old one was lost. I live north of San Francisco and was dubious about a starter from the midwest, however I feel my sourdough bread rivals San Francisco's best in taste and texture with this one from Breadtopia!

review/summary: Excellent starter
review/text: We have had active starters in the house for most of the last 30 years in all climates and altitudes.  Most were started from scratch and a few used starter "kits".  After my mother-in-law A)asked me to make some sourdough bread for an upcoming family get together, and B) proudly stated that she had "tossed out that stinky, sticky stuff in the jar" we decided to give this starter a try. Turns out this has the best flavor without a doubt of any of my starters over the years.<br /><br />Our experience is that all starters seem to have "personality" and not just the flavor.  This one is easy to care for, smells and tastes great and activates really quickly.  I can't recall a starter producing this many of the bubbles and holes that help make sourdough distinctive.<br /><br />The seller's videos, recipes and advice are straight forward and practical.<br /><br />In summary, can't say enough good things about this cost effective way to get a starter.

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: Since I'm such a big fan of sourdough bread, I'd tried a number of times over the years to make my own sourdough starter. I failed miserably, except for the last time, when it worked well enough (using a potato flake-sugar-water recipe I found on allrecipes.com), but the resulting bread tasted overwhelmingly like beer. Which is fine if you like beer -- my son loved the bread for that very reason, for example -- but not if you want bread with a true sourdough taste.<br /><br />So after seeing all the 5-star reviews for this starter, I decided to give it a try. Since I have all my online purchases sent to my workplace so I'm there to receive them, my starter sat in a mailbox inside the door of my business from Saturday when it was delivered until Monday. That meant I couldn't even begin to start the process of feeding it until Monday evening. So I was a little worried that the starter might have suffered from sitting so long in that mailbox unfed.<br /><br />The starter came in a little zip-lock baggie with a card of instructions. I found it pretty hard to get the sticky starter out of its baggie due to the consistency -- it was kind of a mess, actually. I wish I'd read the reviews that suggested adding water to the baggie first to make it easier to get out, but as it was, I finally just tore the bag down the side and scraped as much as I could out into the bowl. I've read reviews that said how good the starter smelled, but mine kind of had the aroma of wallpaper paste, which worried me a little, I must admit.<br /><br />A day after the first feeding, there were tiny little bubbles on the surface of the mixture, but not a lot of action. By the second feeding, there were a few more. But the third time, when I added the full cup of flour and the water, the mixture took off: There was no question it was alive and well! After feeding it one more time, I used a cup of it to make "Classic San Francisco Sourdough Bread," a recipe I found online. It took a bit of work and a LOT of time, but oh, my -- the results were spectacular! True sourdough taste, just like the bread I enjoyed so much on my visits to San Francisco.<br /><br />I can't recommend this starter more highly. The only negative is that I found the instructional videos and answers to questions on breadtopia.com to be a little less helpful than I had hoped. I think the instructions for the care and feeding of the starter could be a bit more detailed, especially for those of us who are new to the art of sourdough. But that's a minor complaint, because the product itself is so very good it more than makes up for having to research the topic for more information. If you're looking for a great sourdough starter, this is the one to try.

I made sourdough according to the "123" method I found on youtube.  It is SO EASY and fun, and the bread is excellent.  The starter keeps going too; I take out 1 cup at a time and replace with 1 cup of water and 7/8 cup of flour.  In a couple hours it is bubbling away and ready to back to the fridge.  I still have the dry starter, haven't needed it yet.

It revived in short-order and after only a coupe of days I had a jar full of bubbling, vigorous starter--and made bread . . . then pizza dough.  Incredibly appealing sourdough taste, and crusts are cripsy and chewy.  I realize I should let the starter mature but I keep making something, so I created three separate starter containers with the goal of letting one develop for a week.  I have been making sourdoughs for 35 years using wild yeast but none can compare to this.  I'm a believer!

I ordered it on Amazon, got it 2 days, read the directions in roughly 20 seconds, scissored the pouch and wrung out the paste in a bowl, added the water&flour, then the next day you add the same ratio water/flour to double the volume. 24 hrs later do the same and your ready to.

Important: Only add baking soda/water mixture to the pancake batter just before you are ready to cook the pancakes.<br /><br />When ready to cook your sourdough pancakes, fold the baking soda/water mixture gently into the prepared pancake batter (do not beat). This will cause a gentle foaming and rising action in the batter. Let the mixture bubble and foam a minute or two before using. TO DIE FOR!!!<br /><br />[...]

review/text: I purchased this starter about a week ago. It arrived SUPER fast. I was eager to get started so I ran off to the kitchen and ripped the package open with daydreams of my mothers sourdough rolls fresh in my mind. I found that thanks to the Texas heat, it was super super sticky and spooning it out wasn't an option. I cut the baggie open and scraped it out into a bowl using a butter knife. Then followed the directions on the package. Within just HOURS, the starter livened right up, started bubbling and rising. I was super excited again, daydreaming of my mothers old sourdough rolls. However those dreams soon crushed as I found my son pouring apple cider vinegar into the rising starter. Devastated I quickly poured off the vinegar and scraped off the top layer. I considered throwing it away, but the package said to e-mail Eric if you encountered any problems.. Well this was definitely a problem!<br /><br />I e-mailed Eric and much to my surprise he emailed me back pretty quickly, told me all hope may not be lost, and he patiently gave me directions and advice on how to bring it back to life. Good news! Thanks to Eric, it is now back alive and thriving, and I'm just a feeding or two away from having enough to start my rolls!<br /><br />If you are reading this, please know this is the BEST quality starter that you can possibly order from the internet. It is shipped SUPER fast, it is strong, healthy and very alive. Even my toddler couldn't kill it! The customer service is unmatched anywhere. Eric was very nice, patient and very helpful! I am now a loyal Breadtopia customer!

review/text: When I first received this sourdough starter, I did something wrong.  I can't tell you what it was, but my starter DIED.  I felt like an abject failure, and I had been so excited to start this sourdough project.  Dejected, I slunk to my computer and emailed Breadtopia, fully expecting them to berate me as a sourdough murderer and an unfit starter parent.  Instead, I got a reply from Eric within 10 minutes, offering a couple suggestions and a reassurance that maybe it would come to life over the weekend.  He told me to email back in a few days and he would be happy to send me more if the suggestions didn't work. After the weekend, I had to admit defeat.  The starter just wasn't a-startin'.  I emailed Eric again, and he again responded within 10 minutes telling me that he would send another live starter.  He was helpful, responded literally within minutes, answered my questions, and was kind to a sourdough beginner.  Now that I have gotten my second batch and babied it (now I'm an overprotective starter parent), it's awesome.  It came right to life, smelled deliciously sour and fantastic, and last but most important: MAKES AMAZING BREAD. As a novice hobby breadmaker, Breadtopia has definitely gained a loyal customer in me.

review/text: I have been baking sourdough for years.  Whenever I needed to start a new starter I usually purchased a dried starter (Gold Rush) that was readily available in the local stores.  When I could not find that product I came to Amazon and found this.<br /><br />When I received it I was not prepared to get it it started since I was looking for a better container after my last two starters became contaminated by airborne nasties, so it sat in my refrigerator for a couple of weeks.  I feared that I may have waited too long, but I fed it and it fired right up.<br /><br />I have to say that this product is far superior to what I was previously using, and my first loaves garnered rave reviews from the family.  With the Gold Rush product it usually took months for the starter to develop a real sourdough tang, but this product is perfect right out of the gate.  Where the old starter was a mild sourdough at best, this tastes like our local bakeries produced it (and I live in the San Francisco bay area so I think I know of what I speak).<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with this product.

Nice, sour flavor, good crust, good crumb. The seller has a wonderful website with recipes and instructions for caring for your starter. I highly recommend this product, and Breadtopia overall.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: It arrived quickly, but it looked like the USPS had run it through some kind of package mutilator. The ziplock bag containing the starter was smashed flat, but still sealed.  I had to cut open the ziplock bag so I could lay it flat and scrape the starter from the bag with a scraper.  But it came alive within a few hours.  It has a great sourdough smell, and it has been very vigorous so far.

review/summary: Great Starter!
review/text: After a few mediocre starters created at home, I gave up and ordered a recommended starter.  This worked great.  I would have saved a lot of time and money if I had bought this starter from the beginning.  This makes tasty bread and is super active. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Makes Great Sourdough
review/text: Bought this about 3 mos ago and have made probably 2 dozen loaves since. Makes really good sourdough, particularly if you take your time, make a biga from fed starter, age it overnight, make the dough and age that in the fridge overnight as well. But even if you shorten the time you can still get a good, slightly tart loaf.<br />This arrives in a small zip lock bag and has to be developed/nutured but its pretty simple. Key thing is the right ingredients; good unbleached flour and spring or distilled h2o (no chlorine).<br />This comes in a small ziploc bag. Instructions are to spoon it out of the bag into a container and add the flour and h2o. But the starter is very sticky so I found it easier and less wasteful to add some of the h2o to the bag, reseal it and massage a while to thin the starter. Then snip a corner like a homemade pastry bag and squeeze it out. Worked great.

review/summary: Great product, now only if I could figure out how to make sourdough...
review/text: Got the starter, revived without any problems and it was up and running in about 1.5 days. My only problem is frustration in using this to make no-knead sourdough. I have been using the Jim Lahey method (from youtube) and making amazing bread without any problems for months now. Using that same method won't work...ie if you try to let it rise for 18 hours you will ruin the gluten strands in your dough and will get no second rise. I have read that you can let it rise for 5 hours at room temp and then put in fridge overnight and then let rise again after shaping into loaf. I haven't tried this yet, and if that doesn't work I may just go back to the delicious/amazing recipe found on youtube.[...].

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I purchased this sourdough starter after I had failed with a granulated type a few days before. I know my way around sourdough starters, and, if not for an unfortunate lapse in attention, and way too much hooch in the home of my 275 year old starter-there was nothing to do but start again. Unless you know sourdough, you cannot know how heartbreaking this is.<br />The little packet arrived and the first thing I did was smell it. Beautiful! That wonderful round smell that tells you you're in business again. We have well water here and no chlorine is added so I knew that would be fine.<br />24 hours later I uncovered the ball jar to discover that the starter had done its thing perfectly. It was bubbly and smelled wonderful. At this point you should really dump half of it and feed it again-but I never have done that. I just make something with it and feed the rest. My one and a half cups got divided in half again and became the basis for whole wheat and rye breads. Yes, everything has to be fed about once a month if you aren't using it all the time and it is refrigerated, but that has never been a problem around here. Someone is always waiting on a loaf of my sourdough whatever.<br />Today was sourdough rye with onions. Breadtopia-you're my kind of company. Excellent starter, excellent service. Arrived alive and on time. Fair price and one beautiful starter.

This is my third or fourth attempt over the years to work with sourdough starter. This time is truly a success and I give all the thanks to a tasty, active easy to use starter. If you want to give your efforts at making sour dough baked goods the best chance of success I recommend you try this!

review/summary: A stellar sourdough starter
review/text: This was actually my second sourdough starter that I purchased from Amazon, and I'm ecstatic about it.  Here's what I like about it.<br /><br />-It makes great-tasting bread!  That, by far, is the most important part.<br />-This starter came with clear, concise directions on how to "grow" and care for your starter.<br />-This comes as almost dormant -- like pancake dough-- so you needn't worry about starting "from scratch."<br />-BreadTopia is awesome enough to offer a "fall back" plan in the event that you kill off your starter (they will send you a powdered version).<br />-It's easy to take care of, it doesn't require much room, and doesn't require a ton of flour for feeding.<br /><br />If you need a sourdough starter, this is a great product!

review/summary: Quick simple and sour
review/text: As someone who develops his own starters I have learned about patience and failure. No such worries here within 24 hours starter was bubbling away with a strong sour nose to it. At the same time as I began this I also started 2 other "commercial" dried starters.  Both are days away from being ready.  If just starting out or can't wait a week for a starter I highly recommend this live one.
