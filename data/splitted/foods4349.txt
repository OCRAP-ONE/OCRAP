review/summary: Wouldn't buy it again
review/text: I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.  I bought the Steak Nuggets as well, which aren't as good as Jack Link's jerky, but definitely tasted better than the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.<br />To put it bluntly, they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight Buffalo flavor.  They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there.

review/summary: Might make okay dog treats....
review/text: I would like to say that I have never tried a flavor of jerky that I didn't like...  that was true until a few days ago.  I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef.  This was a mistake, I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried.  From the smell to the taste, just not good.  If you really want to give this stuff a whirl, I suggest you find a single pack.  Don't buy 4 of them like I did.  One final note:  taste is subjective, you may really love this stuff, I just didn't.

review/summary: Better than standard jerkey
review/text: I normally have beef jerkey with my lunch for some easy to transport protein. I decided to give these a try, bought them at the grocery store and they were great. Easy to measure and a lot less stringy than normal beef jerkey.<br /><br />I ended up saving a ton of money using amazons subscribe and save over using the grocery store. Definitely something I'll reorder.

review/text: Flamin' Buffalo Chick + A1 are my all time favorites. The meat is tender, and the taste (based on the ones I've bought) are extreme with flavor. The only problem with jerky is the salt, and these have a ton of it. I wouldn't consume more then one bag a day, but it's your choice and body. I'll definitely be buying more in the future though, because these are delicious.

review/summary: Downright Addictive!
review/text: These are a great go-to snack/meal when you're in a rush and don't want chips or hotdogs.<br /><br />The nuggets are about the size of a stack of three quarters with some smaller ones the size of a couple of nickels.<br /><br />The flavor is spicy with a nice tang.<br /><br />The texture is softer than jerky but not as soft as say summer sausage.<br /><br />Quick comment on quantity - there are three servings, 60 calories each, in the package.  This ends up being a little over a handful for the entire package.<br /><br />Great to have on hand for those on the go times.

review/summary: Mildly Spicy
review/text: I thought this would be spicy, and coming from someone who eats spicy food all the time and fire sauce on his burritos, this is really only mild. This does not make your nose run, or make your throat burn, ears tingle, which is the funnest part of eating spicy food. Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6-8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience. Just in case you don't eat it all in one sitting, the bag contains a zip-lock storage to keep things sealed. It will last 3 days after opening without refrigeration.

review/summary: Awesome "Hot Wing" supplement
review/text: Ive always been a big Jack Links jerky fan.  I usually buy a couple bags a month, but last month I was in Vegas and they were out of A1 flavor...my personal favorite!<br /><br />I looked around the store and found these!  I opened the bag and had a few on my way to the pool, they were awesome.  Anybody that loves chicken wings should give these a taste.  The chicken is tender and quite generous in size.  I was pretty surprised they even brought a bead of sweat to my forehead, usually store bought "buffalo" flavors don't accomplish that.<br /><br />As another reviewer said these are great if you love chicken wings but don't wanna down 200 calories a piece for that spicy burn.  I do have to say these are impossible to find in WI though, so luckily amazon has them, and at a good price for a pack of 8 bags!

review/summary: dark meat
review/text: All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)

There's basically food in the bottom 3 inches of the bag, and, because of the sauce, if you reach your hand in instead of shaking it out of the bag into your hand, you'll end up with dirty hands.  A much smaller bag would make sense.  I'd also like to see more for the price.  Flavor is good.

review/summary: NOH HAWAIIAN BAR-B-Q SAUCE
review/text: Fantastic barbeque sauce!!!  Made in Honolulu, HA!  Have you ever checked the bottles of BBQ sauce on your grocer's shelf and tried to find one without high fructose corn syrup in it.  I have, and it's nearly impossible!  I ended up going to a "Good Earth" health food store in order to find one.  I was so surprised and happy to find this one on an end cap at Walmart for $5.62/20 oz. bottle--not much more here and well worth it no matter what! It is absolutely the best barbeque sauce I have ever had!  We used it on ribs, that I sprinkled with salt and pepper and baked in a covered casserole dish in the oven at 350 degrees for an hour, took them out and basted them with a basting brush with this sauce and put under the broiler to glaze, turn ribs to glaze the other side too.  This BBQ sauce has such a wonderful "sheer goodness" flavor and thickened up beautifully to a wonderful glaze on the ribs.  Oh my gosh, they were so-o good!!!  My family kept saying how good the ribs were.  I served them with leftover baked potatoes that I peeled and sprinkled with salt and dried rosemary and browned in a pan that I lightly coated with olive oil, and with artichokes, and strawberries.  It only took about 1/4 of a bottle to glaze both sides of two racks of pork baby back ribs, which is two meals for my family.  I can't wait to try it on BBQ chicken and as suggested here, BBQ chicken pizza!  I'm sure it'll be fabulous.  The BBQ sauce bottle's label has directions to boil the ribs for 30-40 minutes first, baste with the sauce, and then bake them for 20 min. in 350 degree oven.  That sounds like a great way to cook ribs, so I'll be trying it that way next time!  You can also write NOH Foods of Hawaii Intl, PO Box 8392, Honolulu, HA 96830 for a free recipe booklet.  How nice is that! I'll definitely be buying more of this sauce!<br /><br />Also, take a look at the list of ingredients on the bottle:  Tomato Puree (water, tomato paste), Brown Sugar (sugar, molasses), Distilled Vinegar, Salt, Worcestershire Sauce (distilled vinegar, molasses, corn syrup, water, salt, caramel color, garlic powder, sugar, spices, tamarind, natural flavor).  Contains less than 2% of:  natural Smoke Flavor, Onion Powder, Water, Mustard Seed, Cornstarch, Garlic Powder, Caramel Color, Tumeric (Color), Dextrose, Paprika (Color) Spices, Natural Flavor. I really liked knowing that all the ingredients in the sauce were things I actually knew what they were! Says on the label it is "All Natural."  60 Calories in 2 T. and fat free.  Love it!!!

review/text: I purchased this for a shared "coffee mess."  We have been using it for the last two weeks and everyone likes it.  It's flavorful and goes well with unflavored light/smooth bodied coffees.  Bold/bitter coffees tend to over-power the mint flavor.<br /><br />  The pump feature does not leak after you use it.  We were expecting to have little drips from it and placed a cup to catch them, but it has not been sullied yet.  Very well designed.  If your preference is for liquid creamer over powdered this is the way to go, especially if you do not have access to refrigeration.

review/summary: Top Shelf Mix for Top Shelf Liquor
review/text: I like to drink and I like to make drinks so much that I recently graduated from bartending school for the sole reason of makig better drinks at home.  I use the Q brand ginger ale and tonic so I thought I would give the Kola a try.  It did not disappoint it has so much flavor that even though it is Kola flavor it is not fair to compare it to coke or pepsi the Q brand has so much taste and natural flavor.  It is slightly more tart than a typical cola but that is not a bad thing.  Now as far as mixing it with a bourbon (I use it with Makers Mark or Woodford) or rum (appleton estate) the drinks are considerbly better with the Q product.  If you are going to pay top dollar for top shelf liqour than dont be cheap on the mix and get the Q Kola you will not be disappointed and your friends will be impressed with the taste of a simple drink like bourbon and cola and how different it tastes with the Q product.

review/text: Until we ordered these bones, we had problems finding any chew toys or bones that would hold up to our very energetic young pit mix shelter girl who LOVES any chew bones! But now, we give her one of these to share with her pit playmate and it takes quite a while for them to chew these down.(great!) The problem is, when they get to the knot part, they leave it around the yard for us to find much later with lots of dirt and slobber on them! I dont know if this is supposed to be the safety part of this rawhide chew or not, but it seems the dogs should be able to chew the whole thing up.

review/text: We bought this in a pack of 12 at Costco for a much better price than here.  However, it has kind of become a rejected food item in our house.  My one year old likes it because it is easy to grab, but even my three year old asks to add more cheese.  Once you add some shredded cheese to it, it isn't that bad.  Just not a lot of flavor.  For the price we prefer Simply Organic Macaroni and Cheese.  The flavor is much better and the price is about the same.

My first batch was not the best, but my 2nd and all the rest were great.  I always looked forward to a big bowl of Annie's Mac & Cheese.  I forgot to try adding butter, that might make the sauce creamier.  I often used only water, or a splash of milk.  There are plenty of ways to enhance the sauce if you're looking for a particular consistency, so don't let that deter you from Annie's!

My house has a pleasant smell of all of the seasoning that was just used to make my favorite blend. The seasoning is fresh and six months to a year later, the seasoning still holds the aroma and flavor of each seasoning and spice that I have ordered.  I have ordered this season in which I am reviewing as well as countless other seasoning and I am thoroughly happy with each of my orders. The salt is not overpowering and I usually do not use salt to season my foods, as this is a good blend for those that are looking for a low salt product. Order a lot so the shipping balances out to nearly free.

review/summary: The Quintessential Southern Dessert
review/text: Dessert in the South is a matter of tradition and hard work. Many Southerners will tell you that their favorite dessert, caramel cake, was a treat reserved for very special occasions. Despite the near universal love for caramel cake in the South, it was almost impossible for ordinary mortals to make. Thus the preparation of caramel cake was left to the loving hands of "cake ladies" who in their home kitchens prepared the great Southern delights such as lemon cheese cake (this has nothing to do with cheese cake-the filing is lemon curd) and the quintessential waistline expander-caramel cake.<br /><br />The trick to making caramel cake is in the icing. This cake has nothing to do with Kraft squares or squeezed-on gook from your local supermarket bakery. It is brown sugar and other good stuff carefully stirred in a double boiler until it is caramelized, when it is thickly applied to ordinary yellow cake. Most cooks make two layers. Caroline serves seven.<br /><br />In several days from the preparation of this review "The Help" will reach the big screen. Prominently featured in this movie, like all true and exaggerated tales of the real life South, is caramel cake. The cake these ladies serve is actually the one featured in this review-seven layers of pure joy from Caroline. I have had a couple of Caroline's caramel cakes over the past few years. Each one of them has been perfect, arriving at my home in South Florida via Fed Ex in pristine condition. Before discovering Caroline I had for years ordered them from cake ladies in small towns across the South who packed them up and put them on a Greyhound to arrive at odd hours at the bus station. Federal Express is definitely the preferred method of shipping since bus stations are usually not in great neighborhoods. Additionally these cake ladies seem to be dying out and finding replacements has not been easy.<br /><br />Caroline, by contrast is now not only an entrepreneur but an institution already discovered by Hollywood. The demand for these cakes will be incredible once The Help is released. Unless you know a real Southern cake lady, Caroline is your best bet. In fact, even if you do know a cake lady, she is still your best bet.

review/text: Let me start by saying that I'm a lifelong tea drinker and I love tea, and I've tried all sorts.<br /><br />I started out years ago with Lipton's before all these different designer brands and flavors came along. Black Ceylon tea was what they called it.<br />Then when all these designer brands and flavors came out I tried all the exotic flavors I could get my hands on, mango, vanilla, raspberry, chocoloate, peach, whatever. I tried different brands, I tried expensive teas, inexpensive teas, organic teas, the standards such as Earl Grey, Darjeeling, Assam, etc.<br /><br />Finally, I came back to this tea. It was like travelling around the world in a circle and coming back to the start. I love this tea because I've found all that other stuff, apple, peach, raspberry, just detracts from the true flavor of tea. This tea is just pure tea, without any other distracting flavors and that's what I love about it. A stong tea, a robust tea with full strong flavor, for a man (or a manly woman).<br /><br />Words can hardly describe my feelings about it. When I make it just right, the right temperature, the right strength, I can just feel the tea molecules infuse every part of my body. So far, I have not been able to find another unadulterated tea with such a full and strong flavor. I love it. 10/10. I imagine this is what the British conquered their empire on. I can imagine some British explorer brewing this tea in a battered tin pan before conquering some mountain top, or the the Artic, or some jungle or facing a mutiny. Cheers, old bean.

review/summary: South African Secret.
review/text: South Africans are as avid tea drinkers as the inhabitants of any other country (formerly) belonging to the British Commmonwealth -- today, consumption averages about 10 billion cups per year -- and tea was first grown in Durban Botanical Gardens in 1850 from plants imported from London's Kew Gardens (commercial production began in 1877, with seeds coming from Assam in northeastern India). Yet, production around the major tea center of Tzaneen in the Northern Province (formerly known as North-East Transvaal) as well as in the country's other tea growing locations has had an unstable history; staggering badly in the mid-twentieth century and although revived thereafter, available only domestically during apartheid. Only after apartheid ended, South African tea farmers were able to export their products. Hence, black tea from South Africa is still a fairly well-kept secret; although roughly 40% of the country's tea is now sold on the world market and it is already among the world's top 20 tea-producing nations.<br /><br />Harvested before the beginning of the winter cool, between October and April, a tea fairly well-known outside South Africa is that produced by the Ntingwe Estate located in a remote corner of the Kwazulu-Natal heartland. Established in 1987 and with over 200 permanent employees, 430 seasonal pickers as well as a program involving the cooperation of local farmers with the estate's on-site processing plant, Ntingwe is *the* single biggest employer and source of financial stability in a region otherwise plagued by record unemployment numbers (up to 60%), illiteracy and poverty. Lighter than other African (e.g. Kenyan) teas, Ntingwe tea has gained an excellent reputation in the short time since its introduction to the international market and makes for as great a breakfast tea as an afternoon refreshment or a pick-me-up throughout the day.

review/summary: the perfect cup of tea
review/text: We first sampled Kwazulu tea on a visit to one of Taylor's tearooms in York, England in 2005.  We brought some back with us, but were unable to find it locally. Was glad to see that Amazon now carries it.  For tea lovers who like a strong, English tea, you will like this one. It has a very distinctive flavor, that is stronger than an English Breakfast variety. It has a pretty copper color.  (The loose tea is in little nuggets, not black leaves like you would expect.)  A great way to start off your day, and though the English would quite disapprove, it is also excellent iced as its strong flavor doesn't get watered down so easily. For people with the Senseo machines, if you buy one of the reusable and refillable Eco-Pad podfilters, you can fill it with this loose tea and it works perfectly!  Just don't pack the tea in too tightly, as it expands quite a bit.

When I found out that one of the main differences between Yorkshire and Yorkshire Gold was the addition of Ntingwe Kwazulu to the Gold,  I thought I would be getting 100% of that special "note" I find so enjoyable in YG.  Not so, unfortunately.  There is a flatness to this tea which is disappointing.  For me, it works best as an addition to other loose teas where it seems to round out the flavor. Guess I just like blends.  My daughter brought back some grocery store teas from South Africa which were really great and I was hoping this tea would be as good but it's not .  Maybe the years have jaded my taste buds and my palate is not as sensitive to the nuances of this tea, but I would never buy it again.

review/text: I am a huge black licorice fan, however I don't think I'd really experienced black licorice until I had Panda black licorice. Great, intense licorice flavoring, extremely addictive.  If I open up a box, I find it very hard to stop munching until the box is empty!  Delicious.

review/summary: Licorice the way it was meant to be!
review/text: This stuff is completely different from other black licorice. Soft black chews that don't have that strange harsh burning flavor you'd expect but has a mellow smoothness. Somehow it retains intense licorice flavor. Mildly sweet, not cloying at all. A look at the ingredients list is very revealing:<br /><br />molasses<br />wheat flour<br />licorice extract<br />natural flavor (aniseed oil)<br /><br />That's it.<br /><br />Hooray for a great recipe, natural ingredients and keeping it simple.

review/summary: addictive.....
review/text: I will come clean to you, here and now, and admit that I do have ONE addiction.  That addiction is this totally wonderful Panda licorice.  For starters, it isn't too sweet. Secondly, it is made with anise oil and has a wonderful flavor.  Plus, the blurb on the side of the box is right.  Licorice does have mellowing properties and helps with digestion, and I also notice that I feel less stressed after I eat it.  [Or is this purely psychological?]  It's wonderful for those days when you are craving a treat, but don't want to feel guilty afterwards.  It's fat free and you should definitely keep it in on a high shelf out of reach, or you might find yourself eating the box in just a couple of days!

review/text: I bought the Caramel Apple Cheesball kit because it sounded so yummy. I made my first package (as a spread) this weekend for Bunco and half way through the night I realized I didn't put the peanuts on top so I sprinkled about half them. My friend and I took an bite and both of us were like "something is wrong" The peanuts were gross. So I tried to scrap them off but had no luck getting them all out. Other than the peanuts everyone LOVED it. I loved it and I am keeping the other 5 mixes to make in the future but I am not going to use the peanuts.

Nothing comes close to the taste and texture of this product.  They stay moist and do not get dried out after a day or two.  This mix is versitile, I could see myself being about to change the items I add to it easily.  We also love their pound cake.  I would love to see this company come out with a pizza crust.

review/text: I made these bars for my four year old with many allergies using the applesauce recipe option. I didn't frost or use powder sugar on them them because we don't have a recipe for frosting that meets his hypoallergneic diet and he can't have powder sugar, but he enjoyed them plain. Since his allergies are a new discovery, he is used to eating "normal" food.  These bars weren't a challenge to get him to eat because they tasted like the type of baked goods he used to eat.  They were very moist and light.  We also enjoyed the brownies from this company!!  Can't wait to try their other products!

review/summary: Worst gluten free baking experience ever.
review/text: I recently purchased the above product because I have an important event tomorrow which requires I serve something Gluten Free. Instead of purchasing something pre-made for almost as much, I opted to try this mix. I spent $7.99 at my local store and added organic, free range eggs and organic apple sauce as suggested. I made them exactly as directed to and what happened next was easily the biggest disaster in my Gluten Free baking experience ever.<br /><br />I should preface this by saying, I have been baking Gluten Free for over 6 years now and opted to buy this mix out of laziness. I have never had this happen in any baking expedition, ever. After 3 times the amount of time listed on the box, the bars were still not solidified (not just a little unset, but genuinely boiling). In addition, over half had spilled out all over the pan I'd had the unexpected foresight to put down underneath the baking container and ruined both containers as well.<br /><br />All in all I'm out<br />$ 7.99 for the mix<br />$ 2 for the eggs<br />$ 1.50 for the apple sauce<br />$ 20.00 for the ruined pans<br />$ 8 to buy something pre-made<br /><br />So, your product has cost me a little under $40 ($39.49)  -- not including time -- to try and I am wildly disappointed.

review/text: I find that Rooibos tea something you either like or dislike with very little in between. My daughter and I decided to do an expensive experiment and went to Whole Foods to buy all the different teas with vanilla and this was our favorite. We were surprised this was our favorite because just as the other reviewer said, the vanilla really is an essence and not at all strong. It speaks to the quality of the tea. Since we could not find this tea when we went back, we tried a few other Rooibos teas but none were as good, so I am now ordering a 6 box case here.

It tastes OK too (way better than cough syrup), and I just drink the whole bottle in 1 big gulp. Sometimes I do feel flushed/warm for about 30 minutes, but it isn't uncomfortable, just noticeable.

review/summary: Good peppers but expired date
review/text: I love peppers and have ordered from different companies including World Specialties but will not again after the sent me habaneros with a "best by.." date of last year I just received today. Knowing that peppers which are basically pickled can last a couple years unopened this means these peppers have been sitting on their stockroom shelf for about 2years and they are still willing to ship out past this date. When it comes to food these dates are important and to send me old peppers just shows they either hire people who do not pay attention to these dates which is odd since they deal with food nonstop or it's their policy. Either way it's not good business to do so. If you want Mezzetta peppers go to the Mezzetta website and order directly who will care if their product is fresh because thy have invested interest in their product. I think what World Specialties has done is not only bad business but a disservice to Mezzetta which could effect the opinion of the quality of their products by shipping out old, not fresh, products. Also I find this dangerous considering habanero peppers are around 500000 on the Skoville scale of hotness and after sitting that long without any knowledge of what temperature changes it has endured and the simple fact that they have sat that long in general they could have become hotter and possibly poisonous to the body. We are not talking about banana peppers here. Anyways this is the first and last time I will order food from this company and the ONLY recommendation I have is the WS change their policies and/or hire better employees.
