review/summary: Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts
review/text: Prompt service and quality product.  My only complaint was that UPS left it on my front porch IN THE SNOW, and I did not know it was there for TWO DAYS.  Fortunately the product was in a plastic bag and was not as wet as the box it came in.  Our local Walmart no longer carries this product.  Rather than pay a premium for it at the chain grocery store, I opted to purchase it from Amazon instead.

review/text: I bought these through COSTCO, the really large econo can.  They were RANCID.  I contacted Nestle/Mauna Loa and they sent me coupons to buy more.  COSTCO, of course, would not accept coupons, so I went to Safeway and bought smaller jars with the coupons.  When I got them home, all the replacement jars I bought were also RANCID.  Something is going wrong at Mauna Loa with their Quality Control.  Somehow, they are letting their macadamias set out for too long before putting them in the "fresh seal" jars.  What good is fresh sealing if the nuts are RANCID to begin with?!  Why would they send me coupons to replace the macadamias when they know they are ALL RANCID on any shelf in any store!?

It enhances the popcorn flavor. Just don't use too much. But again, how much is too much? That is beyond the scope of this review. Do you trust my taste in popcorn seasoning? If so, buy this now. If not, just buy it anyway. You need seasoning. You know this or you wouldn't be reading this review. Your life is empty without popcorn seasoning. Spice up your life!

review/summary: makes your popcorn taste amazing
review/text: Wabash Valley Farms Popcorn salt is wonderful. It is very fine grained<br />and won't just glide across your popcorn and fall to the<br />bottom of the bowl. This season sticks to popcorn and<br />makes is taste amazing. I ordered Wabash Valley Farm popcorn seasons to go along with Paragon's Coconut oil bars. Unfortunatley Amazon did not send me the Paragon Coconut oil bars I ordered but substituted with Lou Ann coconut oil bars. Which taste pretty good, just not what I ordered.<br /><br />The combination of cooking popcorn in the coconut oil and then topping it<br />off with this Wabash popcorn salt is a grand finish. You will get popcorn<br />that tastes like theater popcorn.  I ordered this combo after reading reviews<br />here at Amazon. Glad I read the reviews. Because we are popcorn lovers and this<br />combination of Wabash popcorn salt and the coconut oil bars gave us popcorn<br />perfection. You don't need much of this salt , a little goes a long way.<br />It has a slight buttery flavor to it.<br /><br />I recommend Wabash Valley Farms Popcorn salt .<br />Plus get some coconut popcorn oil to cook your popcorn in.<br />We use the Whirly pop popcorn maker to cook popcorn in. It makes the fluffiest<br />lightest popcorn of any popcorn maker I have ever used.

review/summary: Too Salty
review/text: I purchased this at a local Home Outfitters and was really excited to try it out. Unfortunately, it was extremely salty, and did not really impart any butter flavor. I tried to just use it sparingly as other users have suggested on Amazon, but it didn't seem to help -- it was just... mildly salted popcorn now, rather than that buttery/salty flavor that you're hoping for in 'movie style' popcorn.<br /><br />I didn't mind the yellow color of the product but couldn't get over the fact that it really just tasted like regular salt. I really like Wabash's Zesty Cheddar Cheese seasoning, which is quite salty as well, but has a great cheesy taste - try that one out!

review/text: I thought this was the salt that Wabash puts in their popcorn packs that you can use in the Whirley-Pop. This salt you are advised to use only as a topping and it doesn't taste as good as the salt flavoring in the popcorn/oil/salt packs. So I used it as directed. I didn't really go crazy for the flavor. I have another salt I like better and it's the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014A1BWQ">ACT II-Buttery Popcorn Salt, 3 lb. 4 oz. jug</a> which when added to butter really tastes like the movies. Won't be buying this again.

review/text: The old product finally got rancid from age.  Folks used to rave about my popcorn, and the secret was the seasoning.  I tried some thing I bought at the local grocery and it is not good at all so I examined the container of the "old" stuff and found an web place and placed an order.  Seems like this new batch is not quite the same.  We will still use it and is far better than the POOR product I bought locally.  I'll try it out on company and see if anyone gets excited.<br />In a few words . . .what were my expectations?  More butter flavor.  Lots of product to use here, and not super cheep so not sure I want to experiment.

review/summary: Salty beyond reason
review/text: The butter flavor of this topping is decent. But the salt is beyond reason. I shook a minimal amount on our first batch of popcorn and none of us could continue to eating past the first few bites. Now, I sprinkle maybe 3 shakes over an entire large bowl and then I end up with several really salty bites and a bunch of popcorn with no topping flavor at all on it. I might consider a low-salt version of this, but with the amount I have left of these bottles, it will probably take me 3 years to get through it. I'll probably end up throwing them away.

review/summary: Theater Style Popcorn Seasoning "Great Stuff"
review/text: We were gifted a jar of Whirly-Pop Theater Popcorn Spice in 2004 and became fans immediately. When we tried to replace it we were unable to find it anywhere in Washington State and proceeded to search the net for our favorite spice. We visited a store in Everett, Washington that carried the Wabash Valley Farms seasoning but they did not have Theater Spice. We finally found it at Amazon.com in a three-pack and have shared it with family and friends who are now converts. This is a great product, it reminds me of my weekend trips to the movie theater back in the 50's and 60's because it tastes the same. Word of Caution: DO NOT USE TO MUCH a little goes a long way. Hey... Its popcorn night tonight!

review/text: I love this seasoning!  I do not pop microwave popcorn.  Instead, I pop it myself on the stove top.  It lacks the buttery flavor that you get with movie theater popcorn.  This product adds that taste to my home made popcorn.  I just sprinkle it on when I am finished popping.  I also use their butter flavored oil.  Together my popcorn tastes fabulous.  When I get low, I simply order more. I have used Wasbash Valley Farms products for some time, and they have all been good, high quality popcorn products.

review/text: This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is "russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA".  Notice that this product title starts with "Alaskan Salmon", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of "Grained Salmon Caviar"  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see "made in USA" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was "sorry I was out of town".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.

review/text: As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say "Product of USA." This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star.

I've had these before in restaurants but never this salty. Perhaps it is too early in the day, or my preference for low sodium foods, but I was slightly disappointed.  However, the worst disappointment was the shipping cost -- more than the product!

review/text: I've been eating Hodgson Mill Milled Flaxseed and Soy Hot Cereal for over a year - was on a subscription with Amazon to get it regularly because I really liked it. But I was ready for a change and decided to try the Bulgur Wheat. Wow. I am pleasantly very surprised by how good this is! Very, very flavorful and very hearty as well. I had to figure out how to fix a single serving in the microwave because there are no instructions for that on the box, but I just used 1/4 cup of the cereal with 1/2 cup water and nuked it for 3 minutes. Could have done with a bit less water, but it worked overall. One thing about the NI listed: It's different than what is on Amazon. Calories for 1/4 cup is 115, and it has 3 g fiber and 10 g protein, which is different from what was listed when I first looked it up for purchase.

review/text: We found Nutorious in a Whole Foods earlier this year and the Original was great but Pumpkin is just a great taste and flavor.  It has a great hint of spice along with the pumpkin taste which is great this time of year.  Nice to see it on Amazon.<br /><br />We have actually found this is a great topper as well for salads and for breakfast on yogurt.

review/summary: Memorable Christmas Gifts for 10 Fortunate Friends
review/text: These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur. When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />Each chocolate has a unique design and after you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and buttercream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I will be ordering an entire box of these sometime in the future.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk chocolate and banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. I can say this because I first tasted them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />If you want to introduce your friends and family to<br /><br />the Leonidas Chocolates, this a perfect way to order<br /><br />them and then give them out during the holidays.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Sugary Apple Chips - For Sugar Lovers
review/text: The first thing I noticed about these chips was that there was loose, sticky cinnamon-flavored sugar all over the inside of the bag.  This makes it very difficult to put your hand in without having it come out coated with sugar granules.  Very very messy and sticky.  The sugar is very over-powering and cinnamon is subtle.  Overall, it's good, but I was disappointed after tasting the original apple chips.  It's for someone who has a very sweet tooth.  Also, if you are familiar with these apple-chips, there are a lot of crumbs--about 1/3 crumbs.  If you are down to the last third of the bag, expect half of what you pop into your mouth to be sugar.

I would be more than happy to take the 11 bags they're trying to get rid of! lol. : ) I guess they aren't as "healthy" as some people would like, if you're really watching what you eat. They do have quite a bit of sugar on them, but they taste so darn good. They're still better for you to eat rather than greasy potato chips. I highly recommend them! Very delicious! : )

review/summary: Crisp, tasty snack for an occasional treat!
review/text: These crispy apple chips are just that.  Unlike dehydrated apples, which are chewy, these chips are super thin and crispy.  But they get that crispiness because of the oil added when they make them.  Sure they have less fat than potato chips, but don't kid yourself that these are a low-fat snack.<br /><br />Still, these chips are a fantastic treat when you want something that crunches much like a potato chip, and they have much less fat and far more flavor than a potato chip.  But there's another trade off - you don't have the sodium of potato chips, but you do have extra sugar.<br /><br />I originally found these chips in my local coop at about twice the price I'm paying for them on Amazon, so I was thrilled to find them here.  Even at the high price, I occasionally bought a bag.  With the lower price, I can keep them on hand.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that these aren't the most nutritious snack out there and they're more expensive than an individual bag of potato chips, I keep them in my cupboard as I (and my family) love them.  There are supposedly 2.5 servings a bag, but I doubt many of us get that many servings out of a bag.  These chips are really tasty and satisfying - and once you open a bag, you'll likely keep eating until they're all gone.<br /><br />Why do I give these five stars despite the fat, sugar, and price?  They're one of the best light, crunchy treats I've found and they're incredibly tasty.  I love 'em!

review/summary: Five Star Taste, with some caveats
review/text: These apple chips are incredible-tasting, so I give the product 5-stars.  They're sweet, slightly tart, and fried--what can be better?  As you've seen from other reviewers, it's easy to eat a whole bag in one sitting.  They taste great, because they're cooked in oil and does have a little less fat than potato chips.<br /><br />Besides the "non-healthiness" of it, the box of 12 arrived at my door completely beaten up.  The package tape was unraveling and the box looked like it had just come back from a war zone--slightly smooshed and tearing at the seams.  There are no buffers or packaging materials in the box, with only the apple chip bags in there.  Thus, half of my chips were really just crumbs.<br /><br />I bought one bag in the store and there were quite a few crumbs in there too.  I wish the chips came more whole.  I'm not sure what everyone else's shipping experience was like, but I was a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Update: I've since purchased another couple of boxes and Amazon has placed the original apple chip boxes into an Amazon.com boxes.  This kept the chips from being mangled too much.  Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />Also, FYI: watch out for the stems!

review/text: I was craving for apple chips one day when remembering the good things in high school.  Can't find them in the groceries store anymore so i had to order on-line.  They're almost as good as I remember: crispy, sweet (but not too sweet), with a touch of cinamon = yummy! But all 12 bags were crushed into small pieces and they were hard to pick up, and I felt that I was eating someone's left-over.  Better packing would make a huge difference.

review/summary: Another fantastic ZiwiPeak product!
review/text: It should have been no surprise to me that the ZiwiPeak canned venison is a hit with my dog as he already enjoys the ZiwiPeak Air Dried Venison Dog Food...but I was indeed surprised at HOW MUCH he loves the ZP canned.  I've been feeding my dog, Titan, another brand of canned dog food so that I could hide his different medications and get him to eat them without having to wrestle his powferful jaws like the late beloved Crocodile Hunter.  While he enjoyed this other brand of 100% venison canned food, he was on to me with the whole pill hiding thing and would root around his bowl and eat around the pills.  Titan is a food motivated dog (you'd think he was a lab rather than a pittie) and usually I could count on telling him to sit, give me paw and then literally drop the ball of wet food with the pills hidden inside into his mouth and he would gulp them down.  Well, a couple of weeks ago, he wouldn't eat the wet in his dish, and when I tried the old 'drop in his mouth' trick, he let the ball of wet food hit him in the snout and didn't even lick it off; he just watched me pick up the mess and waited for me to wipe off his face.<br /><br />Enter ZP canned.  First, this stuff doesn't look like normal canned food.  It has such a fresh quality to it.  Titan loved it instantly.  In fact, I don't even have to hide the pills anymore.  I feed him just like an 80+ baby, spoon feeding him right from the can, except that I place a pill on the spoon as it goes in his mouth.  No getting my hands all messy with shaping the canned food around a pill to conceal it from him.  Titan knows the pill is in there, and as long as he gets a mouthful of the ZP canned, he doesn't care.<br /><br />Oh, and he won't even touch the old stuff with or without pills.  He knows he's moved on up in the quality of food  and there's no turning back!

review/text: Maybe it's cause the food from NewZealand, but my Shihtzu loves this stuff. She went to push the food aside out of her way and one wif and she started gobbling it down. I mix a big spoon full in with her kibble and she seems to really like it. I feel really good giving it to her because the ingredients seem to be really good quality. Dogfoodadvisor.com gives this a 5 star rating which is the highest they can give for a dog food.

The best deal is that it was offered with super savings shipping (free)!  I really liked the variety of flavors offered in this package to give each a try.  All 4 of my dogs loved all of them.

When I ran out of the Butter Burst before, I made the mistake of getting a jug of Act II Popping and Topping Oil at the big box store, because it was cheaper. It was not so good. I learned my lesson, you get what you pay for. I will definitely keep ordering Snappy Butter Burst Oil.

It is enhanced by Flavarcol but not required.  It is liquid below room temperature which means it can be put in a squeeze bottle and kept handy for those movie nights.  Get a gallon of this and you'll be happy.

It is an excellent product to top off your special popcorn. I've even use it as an oil to pop the popcorn but I like it the best as a topper. You won't be sorry if you try it I promise.

review/summary: An Authentic Movie Theater Popcorn Experience.
review/text: My wife is a popcorn fanatic and especially  loves that Authentic  Movie Theater Popcorn.  I have been trying relentlessly to re-create that experience at home using various products, from clarified butter, to flavacol, to movie butter seasoning.. all of which came close but not exactly it.  After trying the Snappy Butter Burst Oil we agreed this was the closest we've tasted that fit that flavor profile of Authentic Movie Theater Popcorn.  Of course you have remember  to include the other steps as well , like cooking on the stove vs. a hot-air popper and cooking with coconut oil while also using fine-grained salt to top afterwards. (not regular table salt, the fine-grained salt gives much better coverage  ).<br /><br />I could not find any nutritional information on the product so here it is :<br />1 tablespoon Serving Size<br />Total Fat : 14g<br />Saturated Fat: 2g<br />Trans Fatty Fat: 0<br />Polyunsaturated Fat: 8g<br />Monounsaturated Fat: 4g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 0mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 0g<br />Protein: 0g<br /><br />Ingredients: soybean oil, Artificial Butter Flavor, TBHQ and citric acid, Beta Carotene<br /><br />Suggestion: purchase a pump for use with the gallon size or  , as we like to do,  use a cup with a pouring spout (measuring cup will do),  heat 1 - 2 tablespoons in microwave for 10-15 seconds and slowly pour warmed oil over popped corn ( layering in the popcorn to maximize coverage) .<br /><br />kick back and enjoy your favorite movie,  an episode of your favorite drama, or just enjoy the popcorn all to yourself - whatever suits your mood.

review/text: DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH 'SNAPPY POPCORN'!! - Jon Tiefemthaler, 610 Main St., Breda, IA 51436 -<br />We placed an order with them and we have had complications w/ our bank card/account. The card declined so the sales rep. called us back. After giving the rep. a brief explanation I asked if he could hold the order until we could straighten things out w/ the bank. That we would contact him Mon. and let him know if we still wanted the order. He said he would<br /> hold the order. What he did, instead was sent it to shipping were it was processed on Mon. morning 10/15/12 and arrived here Wed.10/17/12. On Monday an overdraft fee arrived on our bank account because 'Snappy Popcorn' performed an unauthorized transaction on our card. The co. states that we can pay the shipping to return the product and wait to get our $$ back. No remorse was shown and they had the nerve to blame our bank! They are taking NO responsibility for their actions. Our bank, which we love and have used for more years than I can remember, will be going after 'Snappy Popcorn' for our $32.00 and waiving our overdraft. What 'Snappy Popcorn' did is verging law-breaking, they don't care about the 'little people'. Too bad.<br />Thank you U.S. Bank!!! You truly have, always, put us first<br />Although we are pleased with the actual product, we find that there customer service is more than unacceptable.

review/summary: Crunchy, flavorful chip alternative for low carbers
review/text: Just The Cheese snacks are perfect for low-carb dieters searching for a crunchy alternative to chips and other junk food. How many times have we been at the movies and smelled the buttery popcorn, yet knew if we caved in we would blow our carb allowance.<br /><br />Here's the alternative. Slip a bag in to the movies and you're set. They're also perfect for travel, a quick breakfast or snack, or any time you get a chips craving. I love that one bag has 20 g of protein and nearly 2/3 of the calcium RDA.<br /><br />While others have called JTC snacks dry and too salty, I rather like the flavor and mouth feel (as they say in the food industry).<br /><br />I do have a problem with the company proclaiming that "nothing else [has been] added" other than cheese. Here are the Herb & Garlic flavor ingredients: cheese, powdered cellucose, maltodextrin, disodium phosphate, spices, dehydrated garlic, dextrose, parsley, citric acid, natural garlic flavor. Ok, a FEW more ingredients than "just" the cheese!<br /><br />They're also pricey, though if you purchase them through Amazon they only come out to a little more than one dollar a bag. While the bags aren't huge, they are quite filling thanks to the high fat content. (240 of the 300 calories in the bag come from fat. And for the saturated fat-phobic, one bag has 14 g of saturated fat.)<br /><br />If you're on the fence, I would suggest trying a bag (see if your local health food store carries them) before buying the box. Your taste may be different, but for me JTC snacks are a flavorful and portable idea.

review/summary: great trick and delicious for ribs or brisket.
review/text: I've lived in apartments with no outdoor space for years-- but can always get nicely smoked foods by using these bags.  True, your entire home will smell like wood smoke, but not such a bad thing (you can always undercook a bit, take the meat out and finish it outside the bag if you don't want a strong smell to linger).  The times for cooking and the recipes included on the inside are right on target every time, you really can't go wrong.  Makes wonderful brisket-- I let it cool after cooking, slice it, and then add sauce and reheat.  My friends and I agree that the poultry/fish bags aren't quite as good.<br /><br />The first I tried was a similar import from William's Foods, but they no longer carry these.  Wish I could get them locally, but this works!

review/summary: EASY TO USE GREAT SMOKEY FLAVOR!!!
review/text: I have been using these smoker bags for several years. the first time I used them I bought them from my local Cub foods grocery store. i however now just order them on line since I can get them year around. I have used them on the grill, but mostly inside in the oven. I use them mainly for smoking ribs and turkey legs. They always come out perfect. Everyone compliments me on the flavor and tenderness of the meat. I usually finish them up on the gas grill with barbeque sauce for that perfct taste. I have given these away to friends nd family and they are now using them. I would be really surprised if anyone tried them and didn't like them.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I used a smoker bag to make incredible pulled pork. I used a 6 lb pork shoulder and seasoned it. Placed in the smoker bag at 225. I put mine in the oven at midnight and let it slow roast till 7 am. I was afraid at this low heat it would not get smokey enough but it was perfect. I pulled the pork apart in the juices from the bag and it was as good as any pulled pork I've had.

review/text: To the person who rated this low to due getting just 1 bag...read what you order. Very unfair to rate a product 1 star due to your own error.<br />The bags are great!! So far I've only tried the alder one which gives a lighter taste than the mesquite.<br />*Read the instructions WELL on the INside of the cardboard*<br />I bought a 4-pack of rainbow trout from [...] and rubbed kosher salt inside the fish a couple of hours before cooking. Preheated oven to 475F, placed 1 large cubed zucchini and the 4 fish inside the bag, folded closed and placed on a low rack. Lowered temp to 375F after 15 min and continued for another 25-30 min (3 lbs of fish) = perfection! My kids were crazy about eating "fish tummy" and this couldn't have been any easier to cook or easier to clean up.<br />A very light smoke lingered around the kitchen, but nothing that I'd need to even open the windows for. If the smell is a problem, use your bbq (instructions include oven, coal or gas grill).<br />Too bad the price is such a rip off...these are available for under a buck in Finland.

The ribs were the worst I ever tasted. I usually don't do reviews unless I feel it's necessary and this is one of those times. I really expected to have good results.

Some say It cost More to purchase today! Well,what idoesn't ? However,for Me that isn't true!  It's a wonderful drink You can carry a package right in Your purse ! Get a glass of ICE & water & mix & You have got a drink! This summer was a HOT SUMMER ! The worse I can remember!  I have bought a drink & Drank maybe  6 ounces & realize hours later where I left it! By that time it's flat! Plus TASTE is everything! This Flavor is the best! It is also good if You want it a little weaker add more water!<br />To lose weight We need to keep up on OUR  fluids! Do Yourself a Favor & try a great New  Flavor! :-)  I also realized that because I try to remember to carry  1 or 2 extra pachages with Me I also Have lost weight! It makes it so much easier getting more water intake everyday,which keeps Me from eating more than I should! I went to the largest size because I have lots of friends & family who will ask Me (especially this summer because it has been so HOT!)if I have a "EXTRA PACKAGE?" You can stop & buy a 20 ounce bottle of water & pour it in until it is just the right TASTE! Shake it & Before You know it,You have passed by the COOKIE PLATE because You are already Full! Try It! There are so many flavors! This is Just My FAVORITE!

review/summary: Great Substitute for Energy Drinks!
review/text: I am a caffeine junkie, constantly buying the 16 ounce cans of Rockstar, Amp, whatever was handy that had caffeine.  I purchased a box of the Crystal Light energy at the local grocery and was pleasantly surprised.  Each packet has 120 mg of caffeine, and I usually put it in a 32 ounce bottle of water, which really stretches it.  I noticed a change in my weight after a few weeks, and realized that part of the reason I drank so many energy drinks was just a developed routine.  I feel much healthier, because of my additional water intake.<br />I definitely recommend these to anyone that needs that caffeine boost, without all the sugar highs and lows that come with the sodas and energy drinks.  They even have a peach mango flavor, which is quite good.

review/summary: Great
review/text: Taste good (at first just a little bland), but as you use this, it's really great and doesn't raise my blood sugar like "regular" peanut butter.  Just wish I could consistently get locally.

review/summary: Great Crunchy Cheese Taste
review/text: Tried these when Amazon had them on sale.  Pleasantly surprised: great crunchy texture with a high quality natural cheese flavor.  No artificial aftertaste.  The crostini has an excellent taste, like a good fresh crunchy pizza crust.  The cheese flavor is balanced perfectly and tastes fresh and natural.

review/summary: Tastes like Grandma's cookies
review/text: These sugar cookies are a pleasure to bake. The dough is fun to work with and easy to shape. There is no cardboard after taste in your mouth which leads you to just wanting more.

review/summary: More delicious raw walnuts!
review/text: Why get 5# when you can get 10#? I love these smaller increments of nuts and seeds. 25 or 50 pounds always seems like a lot, though these days with teaching raw classes and all, it probably makes sense... Remember to freeze the nuts and seeds! Helps keeps them fresh.
