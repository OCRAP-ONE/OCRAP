review/summary: BBQ Sauce with zing!
review/text: We found out this is the BBQ sauce we've loved for years at our favorite roast beef sandwich place in South Boston, MA(Liberty Bell, if you're ever in the area) and my husband had to have it! We found it through Amazon, and it was a no brainer to buy it! Having it ourselves, won't stop us from going to our favorite haunt, we'll just have it to enjoy on other foods now, too! It's definitely on the spicy and zesty side and has a bit of a kick, so if you're looking for a sweet BBQ sauce, this one's not for you!

review/summary: A taste of the North Shore
review/text: Growing up in Beverly, MA there are no shortage of Roast Beef Sandwich shops in the North Shore area outside of Boston. Bill & Bob's, Big Fred's, Riley's but the best is Nick's "Famous" Roast Beef. If you think you know what a Roast Beef Sandwich is, you may be mistaken. It is thin, freshly sliced, house roasted beef, on a butter grilled roll slathered in James River Barbeque Sauce... Some shops use onion rolls or poppy seed or plain... The spices on the roast beef may vary but it is ALWAYS James River... I always get some when I head back home and make sandwiches, the best I can, for Vermont friends!

review/summary: Delicious but too little for price
review/text: We made two trips to Europe this year -- one to The Netherlands & Belgium and a second trip to Scotland.  Before leaving Belgium we found large bars of Cote d'Or chocolate in a local grocery and bought some to bring home.  They were thick and absolutely delicious.  Little did we know that this brand is considered one of the best Belgium factory-made chocolates around.<br /><br />After finishing the ones from Belgium, I found these for sale at Amazon and immediately ordered several in several flavors.  When they arrived, I was disappointed to discover that they were about a 1/4 the thickness of those we had purchased in Belgium!  Very thin.  While they taste marvelous, we were already paying considerably more for them than we had in Belgium.  Consequently, I doubt we will buy any more of this brand.

review/text: Apples are soft and white in color. Not chewy, just like when the apple goes bad -soft. You can feel chemical taste of some kind of conservator. I offered them to my kids they refused after one bite. So far about 10-12 people tried  and did not like them. I ordered these to try but will never order again.

The ones I didnt use in pies, my grand-daughter snacked on, these are one of her favorite snacks.<br /><br />I would definitely buy these again.

review/text: I received Filippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil as a free sample through Bzzagent.com and let me tell you - it is such a good product!!!  I've used this product in marinades for chicken and also in a recipe for oven roasted potato wedges.  I believe that using olive oil such as this product is a healthier alternative to using other types of oils in my meals.  I was unsure about making the switch and substituting olive oil for things like butter and other oil in my recipes, but so far I haven't been disappointed!  For the most part I can't tell the difference too much (which is good since I generally LOVE butter flavor), and when I can tell it is a pleasant change.  I've also found some great recipes at filippoberio.com that are easy AND delicious!

Great service with Amazon, it was shipped quickly and arrived at her door in great condition and nicley packaged. It is the coffee that she loves to drink and she was incredibly suprised/happy to receive the 4 pack.  Why 4 stars instead of 5 well, per pound this is acutally more expensive than I would pay for it in the local grocery store...without having to purchase 4/12 oz bags at a time.  I checked out shipping and even adding that in, this was  no bargin.  One would think by purchasing in "bulk" the price would have been better / more competetive.  I decided to purchase from amazon due to convience as I was incredibly busy at the time, not sure I would do it again with this product.

The price definately can't be beat after purchasing some at the grocery store if you can even find it in the store.  I tried to purchase some at a Winn Dixie. They only sell coffee beans in this brand but they didnt have a grinder to grind it up. That was the best thing that could have happened since i went online to Amazon.com and found it cheaper than i would have been able to find it. And it was ground up coffee.  I will definately be visiting this website again and purchasing this awesome tasting coffee.

review/summary: Really Good, Inexpensive Coffee
review/text: We're big coffee drinkers in my house, going through about 20 cups per day, altogether.  Two of us have been non-caffeine for years.  The challenge has been to find a great-tasting, yet inexpensive decaffeinated coffee.  We found that in the Eight O'Clock brand.  I had been buying a bag weekly at Walmart, but found that they often ran out of it, so I decided to check Amazon, and happened onto this auto-ship plan that is ideal for us.  Amazon will ship 4 bags at a time at an interval that I specify (in our case, once per month), until I cancel, and discounts the price as well.  I end up saving $1.00 per bag over what Walmart charges, shipping charges are waived, and I am always assured of having enough coffee on hand.  At less than $6.00 per bag on the auto=ship plan, this is a great deal!

This was why I bought the item to begin with. Many cereals have been infused with higher and higher amounts of whole grain, and it's ruining the taste. That's why I bought it from Amazon, thinking it was the original formula, which it sure as hell isn't.<br /><br />Oh, and the seller of this cereal has a 20% "restocking fee" for any returns (can you say ripoff), as well as you (the buyer) having to pay the shipping fees.<br /><br />In sum, I will never buy from these people again. And to the sellers, UPDATE YOUR DAMN IMAGES!

review/summary: I'm Excited!!!
review/text: I am so excited to try the Berry Berry Kix that I just received in the mail. I haven't had it since I was like 7 years old and I'm now 18 and in college, so this is a nice stroll down memory lane. I remember the berries used to look like the actual shapes of the fruit which I like, but now there the same shape as the kix itself. I don't mind though I just want to taste it and be happy. I wish they would carry this at Whole Foods market or Bristol Farms out in Irvine (UCI start supplying the school with my favorite cereal PLEASE!!!!!)

review/summary: Thank heaven Amazon carries Berry Berry Kix
review/text: This is my 17 year old daughter's favorite cereal, and she is a picky eater.  We can no longer get it in Alabama.  I asked my grocery store to try and get it, and they said it was only available in California.  I don't know if that is true, but I have ordered it from Amazon.  With free shipping, it is close to what I would pay at the grocery store in price.  It would be nice if it had more fiber, but the sugar content is far less than in most other sweetened cereals.

review/summary: R.I.P :  Berry Berry Kix
review/text: This review is for the origninal Berry Berry Kix pictured as well as the new KiX creation (as of 11/12/11)..  Since it's inception in 1992, Berry Berry Kix had been my favorite cereal.  None of what is offered on Amazon.com is the original stuff...  Gone, are the much more delectable raspberry and grape triads..  Somehow this new rework isn't as tasty and delicious as the orignal was..  but still, this new variant isn't horrible.  I still reccommend this cereal..  'better than nothing.

review/text: I love this cereal.  It disappeared from the stores where I lived about 9 years ago.  It is back - looks slightly different - the little purple and hot-pink pieces are gone and the cereal looks like Kix with pale grape and pink swirls running thru it.  Glad it is on Amazon.  I found some at the local Target last week and it actually perked me up out of my end-of-winter blahs.  I will be ordering it off Amazon if it disappears again or just when I put in my next order for anything else from Amazon - you can never have too many boxes of cereal stashed away.

review/text: I was looking for treats for my recently adopted cat who seems to have a lot of allergies.  I found a healthy cat food with turkey and salmon that agrees with her, so decided to give these a try as treats.  She likes them, and she is finicky since I won't give her the things she really wants because it causes allergic reactions. It has been a lot of trial and error.  These don't cause her any problems.  And best of all, she likes them.  So do my two dogs.

review/summary: Best Gluten-free Bread Yet
review/text: I've known I was celiac for years, but I've had a terrible time trying to give up gluten. A lot products I tried were just never tasteful. This bread however was what finally allowed me to give up gluten HAPPILY. It's delicious, not at all cardboard like, soft, and toasts really well ( you just need to keep an eye on it because it can burn if you're not careful). I love eating it toasted with butter and cinnamon sugar on top. It makes for a great breakfast item or a tasty snack. I had eleven slices the first day I tried the bread. It had been forever since I had had a decent piece of bread/ toast that wouldn't make me sick and I gorged on it in utter delight.<br /><br />If you're a parent of a gluten- free child, this is a MUST try. Check out any Trader Joes, Whole Foods, New Leaf, or store that stocks Gluten-free near you the next time you go shopping for them. I can now give up relapsing in my Gluten-free diet and finally eat something that is both yummy and good for me.

Albeit not for lunch meat sandwiches but for toast and peanut butter in the morning or a sweet little mid-day bite, it's great.  Just be careful to turn your toaster down as the bread is thin (1/2") and slices are smaller (4" square roughly).

review/summary: Save The Songbird's Habitat With A Superior Cup O' Coffee
review/text: Audubon 'Shade Song' French Roast is not only a great way to start your day, but with this coffee you can be sure your are getting a Habitat and Earth Friendly, 100% Organic coffee, and fair treatment to workers. Audubon's mission is to "...conserve and restore natural ecosystems, focusing on birds, other wildlife and their habitats for the benefit of humanity and the earth's biological diversity."<br /><br />While so many other coffee farmers are trying to increase their coffee farming output by using full sun farming, Audubon has managed to come up with wonderful beans without cutting down trees or destroying the natural habitats of birdsongs, butterflies and other life. No pesticides are used and what you get is coffee beans that have absorbed all the natural flavors of the earth around it.<br /><br />This 'Shade Song French Roast' makes an outstanding brew. It is what may be called bold. I'll say it is a strong and satisfying cup of coffee. This comes from someone who doubles up on those pre-measured packets they give you in hotel rooms for a 4 cup pot(which is usually 2 for me). I found the Shade Song to be very fresh, very flavorful, with a wonderful aroma as well.<br /><br />It's very difficult to find shade grown,organic at my local markets;now that I know The Audubon Society has their own brand that tastes great as well protecting the the rainforest habitats, I'll be sticking with it and maybe even trying some of the other varieties. Also I can use a little less per cup than most other coffees, so for me it is a bargain to boot.<br /><br />Enjoy....Laurie

review/text: I think it is great that we have a company that is willing to make these rawhide chews in the U.S. without all the nasty chemicals that usually are used on these. I purchased this large roll, and one of the donut rolls for my 8 month old husky who likes to chew. He loved the donut and was able to chew it while it also lasted longer than regular rawhide. However, this super thick roll was jut too thick for him. He doesn't like to chew it because every time he has tried it is too much effort with no reward. He can't get through it. Unless your dog is huge and has super jaw strength, I'd go for the donut, which my dog loved.

We have several in our house in various states of chew, which is perfect for our dogs to pick up and gnaw away.  Our dogs would tear through regular rawhide bones so fast that we rarely gave them as treats for fear that they would choke on the tiny pieces of those cheaper split rawhide bones.

review/summary: Great Flavors For Your Own Slushie Or Cones
review/text: After getting my ice shaver I knew that I had to get some decent syrups to go with it, and this brand and flavors have been a pretty good choice.<br />The flavors do indeed stay with the ice instead of just washing off the ice and becoming a colored juice on the bottom of my bowl,  the flavors were very good for trying out the ice shaver for the first time and if anyone buys an ice shaver themselves I highly recommend this brand to try their first test on.  One complaint though while the price of the syrups was decent the shipping is a little pricey so if you're not sure of this brand yet the other one I do recommend is the Torani syrup bottles which are pretty decent themselves as well...

review/text: After suffering through ~Heatwave 2011~ I finally decided to get a snowcone maker and realized... oh I need to buy some syrup!<br /><br />What made me choose this flavor pack were the positive reviews and the darling bottles- they appeared to be so darn adorable and old fashioned. (I'm a sucker for that stuff.)<br />The 3 bottles were shipped PERFECTLY - completely snug in a specially designed box.<br />I honestly didn't want to take them out because they looked super fancy, lol.<br /><br />As pleased as I was by their appearance, they taste just as good as they look.<br />My favorite is blue raspberry and I've never given grape a chance until now - and let me just say that HSI's grape is my second favorite snow cone syrup! They all mix well and still keep their distinct tastes - nothing muddy or super sugary that make your teeth tingle.<br /><br />I haven't looked further into what additional items Hawaiian Shaved Ice produces but they've got a longtime customer in me for sure! I hope they sell the blue raspberry by the 3 pack because I could live off this stuff forever!

review/summary: Acceptable, but not great
review/text: The syrup is very thick and sweet.  Too thick, in my opinion - it feels like it should be watered down with about 1 part water added for every 3 parts syrup to make it a better consistency.  Probably works great for snow cones where you want it to stick to the ice chunks, but for shave ice, it needs to percolate down, and it doesn't.  So you're constantly adding more.  And it's not just the flavor that's too concentrated - the color is too.  My 4 year old had blue lips for 2 days after eating shave ice with the blue raspberry syrup on it.  For reference, our preferred brand is Hawaiian Snow (substantially superior taste, IMO, but you have to order it from Hawaii and mix it yourself), and the staining only lasts a few hours, or until the next meal.  It's OK, hence the 3 stars, and we'll probably use it up eventually, but I don't think I will buy more.

review/summary: Expensive and tastes like medicine
review/text: This tastes like medicine, especially the grape.  At first I thought ordering online was the only way I was going to be able to get flavors for my shaved ice machine, but after trying this and being disappointed, I went on a mission to find decent flavors.  None of the regular supermarkets near my house carried anything, but I managed to run across a Japanese supermarket (Marukai in West Los Angeles) that sold shaved ice syrup.  They had several flavors (25+, including guava, passion fruit, mango, lime, etc.) and they were much cheaper, only $2.50 to $2.99 per bottle.  These from Amazon end up being $5/bottle.<br /><br />If you have access to a Japanese supermarket, you might want to check that out first before committing $15 for only 3 flavors.  If you don't have access, well I guess you're SOL.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: The syrups were too thick, which means that you have to mix it into the shaved ice rather than just pour it over the top.  There is so much food coloring that you can taste it.  Obviously, I expected food coloring, but I hate it when there's so much it affects the flavor.  My daughter only liked the blue raspberry flavor.  I won't buy again.

review/summary: Great Hawaiian ice maker
review/text: This machine works great, a little loud, but hey it is shaving ice. I got this for my daughter this for her 11th B-day, and she uses it every night. I opted for this one because the little toy icee maker looked so cheap, and the reviews were not so good. It is safe enough for her to use herself, and also sturdy enough to do the job for many more icee's to come. We loveeeeeee this product!!! (I am thinking of the getting the cotton candy maker next, by this brand)

review/summary: Good, but there is better!
review/text: The snow cone syrup did taste pretty good. Small container (16 ounces) does not go very far. Was $5.00 for 16 ounces. We found a place called The Corn Popper in Tulsa, Ok. That has quarts (32 ounces) for $3.95 and gallons (128 ounces) for $9.95. They make something like 70 flavors of the best snow cone syrup you ever tasted! Really flavorful and no high fructose corn syrup. Made with pure cane sugar.<br />I believe they have a web site. It is a good idea to refridgerate your syrup as it will stay good longer but also will make it thicker to stay up on the ice and being cold it won"t melt the ice as much.

review/text: So I purchased this thinking it would be a novelty item. I just wanted to see people choke, cough, spit and wheeze when they tried this. Quite the opposite happened. These became an IMMEDIATE crowd pleaser. The chip itself is as perfect as a kettle chip can get: crunchy, thick with a robust potato flavor and not greasy. The spices. Dear God the spices. It takes a few seconds, but when the habanero kicks in, yeah, you'll "feel alive". The level of heat does not take to your knees. I found myself going for more! Certainly ingesting these does not come without hazards (tear jerking restroom moments), but I guarantee you it is quickly forgotten after that bag stares you in the face when you open the pantry. I'll be ordering more once I'm down to four bags. For the rest of the nation buried under snow, a bag of this will put your body in the Bahamas.
