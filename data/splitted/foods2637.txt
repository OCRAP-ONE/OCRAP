review/summary: tea is good, arrival less so
review/text: I've been looking for a really good peachy flavored black tea. This is probably the best I've found, though still tastes more fruity than peachy, if that makes any sense. It came in a box with all the tea loose inside, so you'll need something to keep it in, or leave it in the cardboard box. I'm using a lock and lock container.

review/summary: Has STASH tea become weaker in flavor?
review/text: It how takes three to four tea bags and steeping for at least half hour for me to get a large mug of licorice spice tea.  This was always my favorite tea, however I have noticed a decline in the strength over the last year or two.  However, the price is right.

review/summary: Delicious! *****
review/text: This blend of Earl Grey from Stash Tea is delicious. It is the most fragrant Earl Grey we have ever enjoyed. The blend has a floral quality to it; not overpoweringly sweet but quite distinctive. Not herbal.<br /><br />The taste is similarly floral with no harsh black tea flavor. It must be low in caffeine as I experience no "spikes", either.<br /><br />A very distinctive blend for which Stash should be pleased.

review/text: I love earl grey tea, but am very picky & find that the flavor quality varies from each supplier, & some are not so good.  Stash is always consistantly good, and the flavor is just right. I ordered decaff since want to drink as much as I want before bed.  It's much cheaper to buy in bulk without all the fancy packaging & I would recommed this to anyone who loves earl grey tea.

review/summary: no orange taste and not spicy
review/text: I was very disappointed by this tea as it has no orange flavour and also is not spicy at all. It tastes like a rather boring, cheap black tea. Only the tea bacgs themselves seem to be dirty with an orange colour, so probably there are some colorants in this tea. As the box is so big it is a pain to finish them... I would recommend not to buy it. A good orange spicy tea is the one from Harney & Sons.

So, unless you plan to store your teabags in your garage at your workbench, do not order these.  I ordered these as a subscription which I am now cancelling.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I've come to trust the Stash brand, among only a few others due to its consistently excellent product line and variety.  I was initially a fan of English Breakfast tea, but was introduced to Irish Breakfast tea some time back.  A slightly thicker liquor produced than does English Breakfast, it mixes well with a variety of items (sugar and milk are recommended, but certain alcoholic bases or mixers sit quite nicely if you want to switch up the classic Hot Toddy concept or use Kahlua instead of sugar), and has an even stronger aroma and flavor than your regular black tea.<br /><br />If you're a fan of weaker brews where one or two dunks is good enough, this is not for you.  I tend to steep this for a long while (tea experts would call me nuts for doing this as it could scald and alter the flavor of the leaves), but I love the strength of the brew afterwards.  This is great to have on-the-go, too, and hearty to drink if you're ill and require a lot of liquids.

review/text: This is one of my favorite winter teas! The ginger-peach flavor is absolutely wonderful, especially when I have a cold or flu. Next time, I won't order this specific packaging. I expected the tea bags to be arranged in rows in a box, but STASH appears to have dumped and squashed 100 tea bags into too small of a box. The individual packs are crumpled, folded and mangled. If you prefer more pristine tea bags, order the multi-pack box.

One bag is enough or me I can put it in a cup of hot water and leave the bag in without worrying if it was to get too strong like other teas do.  Adding just a little raw honey enhances the flavor also.<br />I enjoy this tea before I go to bed and it has a very soothing and the warmth of the liquid allows me to slip into a nice sleep.<br /><br />I like the convenience of a foil package, I can carry one or two with me when I go out to lunch with friends, I just order a cup of hot water and slip this tea into it.<br />I have on occasion I have put this is a cup with some fresh ginger and it makes a totally different tea, and he ginger helps sooth the tummy while the Chamomile tends to relax you.<br />Doesn't get much better than this.

review/text: I make  iced green tea because I find drinking water bearable rather than enjoyable. And green tea is healthier than other non-water beverages, but I don't love green tea, either. So I've tried various flavored green teas, and the fruit-flavored ones usually result in a sort of sicky-sweet fruitiness mixed with the dirt flavor of green tea. This one, however, is the most tolerably-flavored green tea I've found so far, almost enjoyable, even.

review/summary: A deliciously potent peppermint tea!
review/text: This stuff is great.  The peppermint smell when you open up the teabags is incredibly strong -- much moreso than with a number of other peppermint tea brands that I've tried before.  Let me tell you, I am a mint addict, and this stuff really hits the spot.  For hot tea, I use one bag for every 8-12 oz. of hot water.  For iced tea, I use 2 bags for every quart, and it's great every time!  So, for 100 bags, I will probably get about 15-20 pitchers of tea (just depending on how much I make each time).  One thing that I wish the product description had let me know -- they literally send you a cardboard box with 100 loose (though individually wrapped) teabags inside.  The whole thing is a  little disorderly and presented a bit of a storage problem for us since the box is fairly large and the bags are not organized at all inside.  However, the tea is just so good that this one inconvenience is not enough to take the rating below 5 stars.

review/summary: Great to carry with you
review/text: I'm a fan of all kinds of teas so it's easy to give them a thumbs up.  The single pouches are what I use to take with me to work or camping which cuts down on space AND lets me share with others easier.  Great product at home or on the go for sure.  They do have strings, staples and paper tags which is why I only gave it a 4 star.  Eliminate those wasteful parts and they're a five star for sure.

review/summary: Great, subtle tasting jasmine green tea
review/text: Taste is very personal, but I do enjoy this jasmine green tea. I've found the taste to be more subtle than some other brands I've tried, but it is still very pleasant. If you like a stronger tea, this might not be for you. The jasmine has a wonderful aroma and is not overpowering at all.

review/summary: Best decaf green tea. DELIGHTFUL FLAVOR & CONVENIENT
review/text: Stash tea continues to serve up the best tea products in bags.  This is especially true for their green tea.  It is pleasant, slightly "grain" flavored, lacks bitterness while having a delicate tea flavor and feel in the mouth. It is equally robust when used for iced tea.  I also like the 100 count box of loose envelopes without the cello zip strip bags of 25.  They are very fresh in their individual foil lined bags, convenient easy to open and use.  Overall a good value.  Will continue to buy this delightful tea

review/text: I did not receive the tea in its original packaging and there is no way this is "double bergamot" since it doesn't taste like Earl Grey at all. As a tea it is very good one though. The batch I received had no flavor or the nice smell of Earl Grey even though it says on the packaging it is. Upset with this purchase.

review/text: I've tried the other teas but when I open the package of this tea the freshness comes out. The tea has a great peppermint flavor. If you're trying to diet then mix it with ginger root tea and it has a great flavor by themselves without adding the calories of sweeteners. It won't taste sweet but it will taste good. Drink it practically everyday.

review/text: The stash black tea has a nice flavor, definitely better than lipton. I still prefer Tazo over it because Tazo has a little bit more of a bold flavor and does a better job of waking me up in the morning. Still, it's a nice tea and cheaper than Tazo so if you're mainly looking for nice flavor and not an early morning jump start this is a nice one to try.

review/text: Normally, I buy loose leaf tea and use an infuser because tea bag tea just doesn't cut it after you've had the real thing.  This tea, however, is a very decent quality with a good flavor and a nice body without being harsh.  I compared this Stash tea with a store brand that was marginally cheaper for the same type of tea, but this is much better.  If you don't want to mess with brewing your own tea this is an acceptable substitute.  Makes a very good ice tea as well.

review/text: I first ran across the Double Bergamot by accident.  I love Earl Grey, and I have enjoyed many other Stash teas in the past (if you haven't tried the Chocolate Hazelnut yet, go order some now.  I'll wait...).  I tried this one, and it was like a ramped-up version of Earl Grey.  The bergamot oil is what makes Earl Grey, well, Earl Grey.  Doubling that oil just intensifies the flavor.  Great for a late weekend afternoon reading my Kindle.  I even keep a bunch in my office to get me through the last couple of hours!

review/summary: Yum-o! 5+ cups of this tea a day!
review/text: I first fell in love with Stash's Wild Raspberry Herbal Tea on a recent trip to San Francisco. The little, european style hotel I stayed in offered this yummy tea 24-7 and I found myself stopping to grab a cup at least 3x a day. The tea has a strong, raspberry fruit flavor that is crisp enough to please your tongue and keep you hydrated, but without the keep-you-up-all-night caffeine. I instantly began craving the flavor.<br /><br />When I flew back to the east coast I was sad to realize that I couldn't find it in my local grocery store. I quickly hopped on Amazon and was happy to find that I can have the tea shipped to me. (YEA! Amazon!). Buying in the 100-count boxes is the cheapest option I've found, however, be warned that the 100-count box delivers the tea bags loose (they're in their separate, pink tea pouches, but loose in the box), which can be a cabinet disaster if you do not have a tea box or other place to keep the 100 tea bags under rule.<br /><br />The tea is great hot or cold over ice... you absolutely can't go wrong with this fruity tea!

review/text: I recently quit caffiene, and for over a year have quit sugar and all grains from my diet. This tea is my go to tea when I want something dessertish. A hot cup of this tea at night while watching TV is all I need to make me feel like I am having something to soothe me. I would give it 5 stars if it were organic. I try not to eat things with pesticides and fake flavors, but this tea is truly the most comforting delicious tea. I guess we can't be perfect 100% of the time. The fact that its decaf is awesome. Quitting caffiene has really helped with my ovarian cysts. They are much milder now than they have been in years. I even send in a zip lock bag to one of my son's teachers when I get it on auto delivery. This tea really takes me to my happy place at a great price.

review/summary: What a Bargain
review/text: My local large chain grocery store wants $4.99 for a box of 20 of these great tasting Wild Raspberry, caffeine free, Herbal Tea Bags.  100 for $13.77 is a great bargain and with Amazon Prime shipping, what could be better?  Stash makes great products and I haven't found a one of their teas that I didn't like, but with this sort of savings, my local grocery store comes out the losers.  Getting the product delivered to my front door is yet another huge benefit, especially since I'm physically challenged.  Thank You Amazon and Stash!!<br /><br />I may be going out on a limb here, but Amazon Prime has two HUGE advantages for me.  Being physically challenged, I really do appreciate the reasonable 2nd Day Air shipping that you offer on many of the products purchased on this site...but the really BIG BONUS is that the $79 you charge for that 2nd Day Air shipping (delivered to my front door) also gives me unlimited streaming of thousands of movies that I can watch for NO ADDITIONAL COST.  Now in my book--that IS a BARGAIN!

review/summary: Great Berry Flavor
review/text: I have always loved Stash brand teas, and this is no exception. I tried Panera Bread's new Acai Berry Tea and LOVED it, so I did some shopping of my own in the hopes that I could find something with a comparable flavor. Well, this is IT! It has just the right amount of berry flavor-- very clean and just a bit tart. It was exactly what I was looking for. You cannot beat this value either. I purchased 18 of these exact tea bags for about $3 at Target, and was more than happy with the value. So to get more than four times that amount for less than four times the cost is awesome! I also love that these teabags are made in the USA. You will love this product!

review/summary: Powerful Peach Flavor & Aroma is NOT for Sissies!
review/text: When you brew this tea, everyone within 50 yards will come over and want to taste it.  Intense peach flavor and aroma is strong delicious natural peach essence, almost like tea flavored with a shot of peach juice.  This is the best tea I have ever tasted.

review/text: I've sampled hundreds of teas for decades. I may not be a connoisseur but I know what I like. This Stash decaf tea is the best I've ever had, over any other brand. It makes great iced tea as well. Once you try it, you'll be hooked.

review/summary: Surprisingly amazing
review/text: This is wonderful tasting Raspberry tea.  I purchased a box of it along with several boxes of Blueberry - my favorite - not quite sure how I would like the raspberry.  It is so flavorful and just plain good.  I had been drinking Celestial raspberry tea, not thrilled with it, but this Stash raspberry knocks the other stuff out.<br /><br />I drink it iced.  The instructions seem to indicate that I should double the teabags, but I only use 2 herb tea bags and one green tea bag for 16 oz of tea and it is very flavorful.  Very flavorful.<br /><br />Good stuff.  I just received my first order today and it is so good that I had to reorder another box.

review/summary: Best blueberry tea that I have ever had
review/text: This is the best Blueberry tea that I have ever had.  I use 2 bags of blueberry plus 1 bag of green tea for a 16 oz cup of iced tea.  So rich in flavor, even though the instructions seem to indicate that I should double the blueberry tea bags for iced tea.  I sweeten it with Stevia drops.<br /><br />I received my first order today, and it is so good that I have just reordered.  So much better than Celestial blueberry from the grocery store, comparable in price with free shipping - 2 boxes qualify for free shipping.

review/summary: Finally! A great tasting Breakfast tea
review/text: Ive tried several different brands of English Breakfast tea. Some were too bitter, some werent strong enough, others had a weird aftertaste, etc....<br />I originally bought a small box of Stash Earl Grey and liked it so much I thought Id give the English breakfast a try. Wow! Glad I did!!<br />This tea is perfectly balanced...not bitter, not too strong....just strong enough to give me that great tea taste, and still mellow flavor.<br />I take mine with a drop of milk and its just perfect!<br />Liked it so much I bought 100 bags of this, 100 of the earl grey and 100 of the peach ginger....Yummy!!!

review/summary: Cool tea
review/text: This is the BEST peppermint tea I have had;  it's even better than the natural dried herbs you can get at health food store when making your own peppermint tea.  Since I cannot locate Stash brand in the 100 count at my local grocer I have bought it here at least 3 times recently.  Everyone in the family loves this flavor/brand.  I highly recommend this and it makes excellent peppermint iced tea as well.

review/summary: One of my favorites
review/text: I was first introduced to this delicious tea in Stash's Green Tea Sampler (also highly recommended). I was immediately addicted. I really wasn't expecting to be impressed, because I usually HATE fruity teas (they always taste medicinal to me), but this is nothing like I've tasted before.<br /><br />It has an incredibly strong peach flavor and aroma, and a spicy ginger aftertaste. I can't really taste the green tea, but that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />This is one of the only teas that I put honey in, and I find that copious amounts of it make this tea the best.

review/summary: Hands down the BEST tea I've ever had!
review/text: Pros:<br />1- Tastes great hot or cold<br />2- Universally enjoyed (kids, adults, non-green tea drinkers)<br />3- Mild and smooth<br />4- Good sweet with cream (like Chai)or plain<br /><br />Cons:<br />1- can get bitter if you leave the teabag in too long<br />2- It didn't magically melt 50 lbs of fat off my body<br /><br />We use this at home for "water" - we make batches using five tea bags in 2 quarts of water - in our microwave for 7 minutes and let it steep for another 15-20 minutes.  Then we pour it into a gallon jug, and add water to make one gallon of "iced" tea that we keep in the refrigerator.  On a weekend we can easily go through 3 or 4 gallons a day (we keep to jugs going.) I sweeten mine with what ever is handy, my husband drinks his straight.  We've used maple syrup and honey for sweeteners both are great!  I can also nuke a mug for hot tea.<br /><br />At work I keep this tea for my morning hot cup of tea.  I love that it if goes cold it's still delicious - no more wasted work coffee.  I've given tea bags to many at work, and converted most!<br /><br />We get this on auto refill and love love love it.  I've been drinking it for several years now.

review/text: The Stash peach black tea makes an excellent cup of tea and is also excellent with honey.  I warm the cup before I add the hot water and steep the tea for 4 minutes.  It can be too strong if you let it go too long.  The peach flavoring is just right - not too strong or too weak.  It also tastes natural.

review/text: Each tea bag is wrapped in packaging. The bottom of each says "Best by 20102014". Huh? I think this tea is stale. The expiration date is confusing or just meaningless.<br />The tea bags are sent in a shipping box. So, you get 100 tea bags all wadded into a cardboard box with a shipping label stuck on the outside. You will need to put the bags into something else when you receive them. A ziplock bag should be fine.

I can't have caffeine and this actually contains no tea at all, just herbs, so it's perfect. I love the spearmint flavor.  If you don't like spearmint, you will not like it!  As it is the most notable flavor in the tea itself.

review/summary: Delicious, and the packaging is fine.
review/text: The tea is delicious, and is truly double-spice. I usually steep my teas for an unreasonably long time to get a strong flavor, and with this one I don't have to. It's not quite as amazing as a fresh home-made chai, but it's the best I've had from a bag.<br /><br />A note on the packaging - as the Amazon picture would indicate, the tea is shipped in the Stash cardboard box, and the individual packets are packed within that box. They're not "crammed", they're packed tightly and don't suffer any damage that I've seen. Personally, I prefer this shipping method, as it cuts down on waste. I'll add an image to the product page to show how mine arrived.
