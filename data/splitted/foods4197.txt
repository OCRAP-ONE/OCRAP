review/text: This tea is so good I drink two thermos full in a day. great tasting and great health benefits for women. Ladies if you have any menstral cramping or female issues try drinking this consistantly for a couple days and you will see a difference. I was reccomended by a friend to try this and was not disappointed.

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: I am just over 25 weeks pregnant now and have just started drinking this tea alongside the mother-to-be tea that Yogi also makes.  I put one bag apiece in each cup and together they taste great.  It does make the tea a bit more bitter than when I was drinking the mother-to-be tea by itself, but I don't mind bitter teas and it's still a very mild taste.  The mother-to-be tea also contains ingredients other than the raspberry leaf and it helps give the mixture more flavor.  I drink a maximum of 3 cups a day and I will probably continue drinking it after the baby comes because I do have PCOS and the tea helps the female system in general.

review/summary: Great Tea!
review/text: I ordered this tea based on the reviews I read and was actually pleasantly surprised by the flavor.  I don't really find it bitter at all.  If anything it is just a plain tea with not much flavor.  I find it very pleasant with a little bit of honey/sugar/agave nectar and some lemon juice.  I don't know if it has made a difference yet.  I am at 32 weeks in my pregnancy, will update if I think it helps!  The price was also really great.

review/summary: 1 which should be a ZERO star for taste
review/text: I purchased this tea from Swanson vitamins along with another brand.. "Traditional Medicinals".<br /><br />I tried TM first.  I never add sugar, honey etc. in my teas i drink it according to my husband "John Wayne style"<br /><br /> The tea tasted ok. I didn't have to add an additional tea bag to taste the flavor.. it also smelled really good.<br /><br />Then i tried Yogi... there was absolutely no taste and I didn't smell the flavor like i did with TM.<br /><br />I added 2 tea bags in about 6 ounces of water and still nothing. It was just like drinking plain hot water with a brown tint.<br /><br />Now as far as what health benefits i have experienced from drinking either brand.. I think it's too early for me to tell.

review/summary: Can't hurt to try...
review/text: I began taking this tea at 36 weeks. I was drinking three cups a day. To me the taste was rather bland, but honestly I was not drinking it for the taste, I was drinking it with the hopes that it would strengthen and tone my uterus. I did not have any abnormal side effects or cramping from this tea. I used an epidural during delivery and even though from what I heard about epidurals making for a longer "pushing" stage of labor, mine was actually unbelievably quick! My doctor had me push three times per contraction. Baby crowned within the first contraction, and was born on the third. I pushed for less than ten minutes! Could it have been the tea? I like to think so. This was my first baby, and even doctor and nurses commented on how well it went! I told them it must have been the tea. haha, Since this was first pregnancy I really have nothing to compare it to, but when breastfeeding I do not feel any cramping and had very limited cramping postpartum. A couple of times the day of & day after delivery. I have continued to drink one cup a day since baby's birth. Figure it can't hurt in helping uterus tone up & get back to size over next few weeks or so...

review/text: I never wrote a review for an item before, but I just loved this tea and I really believe it helped me through a fast labor and fast recovery with my first baby. I started having two cups after week 36, I was in labor at week 39 and it was only 8 hours. I also had NO painful cramping after the labor and I am recovering very fast.<br /><br />I also like the mild earthy taste of the tea itself. I am leaving it in for 5 minutes it hot water, after I remove the tea bag I am adding a little honey and I love it.

review/summary: Beneficial tea
review/text: Raspberry leaf tea was recommended to me by friend who swore by it during pregnancy and for labour. I did my research and was doubtful it would do anything for my pregnancy as there is no scientific evidence that it induces labour or shortens the length of it.<br /><br />I was persuaded to try the tea after finding out the other health benefits on Mindful Mum - lessening bleeding gums and nosebleeds (nightmare!), calming morning sickness (which is has for me but doesn't work for everyone) and lots of vitamins (E, B1 and B3).<br /><br />Although it won't speed up labour or pregnancy, it's worth taking as a good supplement for vitamins.

review/text: I bought this before I gave birth in hopes of going into labor a week or so early, but still at what's considered full term. I drank about a pitcher a day for a week, and then my water ended up breaking about 12 days before my due date. So does it work in aiding an early birth? I don't know, but the taste is okay so I guess it didn't hurt anything either way.

review/summary: Grilling is a gift
review/text: The Baja Chipotle is a great marinade. It took my meat to a whole new level. I am very sensitive when it comes to my meat and when I put the meat in my mouth it needs to explode... with flavor.<br /><br />One drawback. It did play a small role in my divorce. No, no, don't worry about me, all I need is my Lawry's Baja Chipotle and I am a satisfied man.<br />After soaking in marinade (minimum 6 1/2 hours under close observation and massage) I like to put a little in a squirt gun mixed with water. A little squirt here and there during the grilling process brings out the magic in your meat.<br /><br />My wife thought she was being playful when she squirted me with the hose as I was cooking. DO NOT mess with a meat master when he is in the grilling zone. That is like messing with Yoda while he is meditating. Someone going to get hurt. A lesson must be taught at this point. Negative reinforcement for bad behavior. I hit her with the super soaker 6000, fully pumped, primed with Lawry's Baja Chipotle. Yoda would have been proud.<br />I had no idea the effect this would have on our german shepard Trixie. Trixie was on her like a starving lion on a Wildebeest. My wife ran down the driveway where two more dogs appeared out of nowhere. I watched in awe at this developing train wreck. Unable to move. Couldn't move anyway until my meat was properly removed from the grill. Priorities my friends.<br /><br />I heard screaming, possibly my name mixed with a few curse words. She was headed down the street with four dogs now in tow. How am I supposed to help her if she runs away from me. Seriously, she calls me the stupid one. I decided to take the truck.<br />I pulled up along side of the galloping herd and gave her the hand signal to jump in the back. Apparently I overestimated her fitness ability. She hit the side of the truck like a slab of beef. Yes, more curse words. I even heard them over the blaring radio. The dogs were on her like sharks on chum.<br /><br />Can you believe the judge took her side after hearing the story. All I got out of the divorce was the grill, super soaker 6000, and of course the dog.<br /><br />Lawry's Baja Chipotle is a great marinade, don't squirt on spouse, and just your dog lick it off, don't run and scream like a wounded wildebeest. Last note. Dogs love Lawry's Baja Chipotle but cleaning up dog diarrhea is a horrible way to spend an afternoon. Don't feed to animals.

Try cooking sliced chicken breast as you would for a fajita with peppers and onions, add some Baja Marinade and put in a baked potato with cheddar or monterey jack cheese.

review/summary: The best drumsticks and chicken wings!.. with my own recipe
review/text: This marinade is one of the best I've tried for chicken drumsticks and wings, they come out delicious, a little spicy with a great grill flavor.<br /><br />My recipe is simple: put chicken in a bag with about 1/8th of a bottle of marinade for about 1/2 hour [don't over-marinade - more or longer doesn't mean better].  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Put chicken on a foil lined baking pan, don't add anything else.  40min for bone-in chicken and 20min w/o bones is all you need, and it comes out delicious!<br /><br />Price is great too.  My local store charges about $3.19 a bottle or puts them on sale for 2 for $5.

review/text: I've always trusted Lawry's for good and successful spice. I expected a robust chipotle taste before and after cooking.  We marinated chicken for 45 minutes, well over the recommended time, then baked per instructions.  The uncooked marinade has a very slight chipotle taste; the cooked marinade has no chipotle taste at all, overwhelmed by the taste of what may be cayenne.  It's hard to tell - the taste is very metallic.

review/text: I absolutely love Lawry's Baja Chipotle Marinade, and use it in a variety of dishes. And, yes, as my title says, we're vegetarian! This product is very versatile and adds great flavor in vegan/vegetarian versions of things, such as these killer fajitas in this blog post, "My fantastic vegan fajitas" [...]<br /><br />The nice thing about it is that it's spicy and flavorful without being TOO hot. Personally, I love really hot [as in spicy] foods, but not everyone does. When I cook something for company, such as the aforementioned fajitas, I don't have to worry about the marinade making mouths burn for those unaccustomed to really hot foods. I can use enough so that the dish is flavorful but not overpoweringly HOT.<br /><br />It also has a wonderful smoky sweetness, which is a nice counterpoint to its spiciness.<br /><br />I've used this product on or in many foods, everything from veggie burgers to veggie Italian sausage, and it's always a hit. I went into panic mode recently when Vons (the supermarket chain in SoCal where I order groceries online) suddenly didn't carry it any more. So I headed over here to Amazon to see if it's available, and it is, thank goodness. I don't know if the outage at Vons was just temporary or if they're no longer going to carry it, or what, but I didn't want to take any chances on running out so here I am!

It's easier to stop after 1 bag with the white cheddar.<br /><br />The good news is that, unlike many soy-content chips, these have a very nice (not at all mealy) texture.  Nor are there any red-flag ingredients to worry about.  The bad news is that they are higher carb than I had hoped.  Here's the breakdown for a bag of these lemon-herb chips...<br /><br />calories - 110 (30% from fat)<br />fat - 3.5g<br />carbs - 14g<br />protein - 10g<br /><br />If you're on a low carb diet, these probably won't fit.

review/summary: Gastric Bypass Patient
review/text: I had gastric bypass surgery 2/6/07 and MUST increase my protein intake. These chips are the "perfect" way of doing so. While most of us got into this mess by eating "junk food", this product will satisfy that "craving" for CRUNCH! I take them to work and in the car. Taste does take some getting used too, but when choices are "limited" (like mine) these are PERFECT!

review/text: We first bought these from a local health food store because my son had food allergies.  Kids love them.  They do have a bit of a soy taste, but I still think they are wonderful.  We also use them as croutons on salads.  They aren't as good as junkfood, so if you're a junk food junkie, I doubt you'll like them.  But, if you're into health food, you'll probably love these.

review/summary: A little too much flavor
review/text: These things are good when you eat a few, but it's a little hard for me to finish an entire bag since they're so full of flavor (salt, herbs, etc). I have an entire drawer of them and am always reluctant to grab a bag for lunch since I don't really look forward to a mouthful of flavor. I was hoping they'd be a little more subtle like Cheezits (spelling?). This would be good for people who like a ton of flavor, but other than that, you probably won't like them enough to eat all of them.

review/summary: New formula - Texture STALE, many CRUMBS, downsized to 1.2 ounces.
review/text: I bought this product before they reformulated it, and of course now. This product has definitely changed for the worse. The texture is not crispy at all, and even borders on tasting stale. There were many crumbs in the bag, and the package has been downsized from 1.5 ounces to 1.2 ounces. Not much to like here anymore. I will be removing it from my subscribe and save. What a disappointment, because I really did enjoy them before.<br /><br />I am not allowed to review them independently but, there are several flavors if this product. At this time the Lemon Herb is still 1.5 ounces and the original formula. This could change at any time. I ordered another 12 pack of them before that formula also inevitably changes - they were terrific.<br /><br />C'est la vie

review/summary: Not doritos - but pretty good!
review/text: If you're expecting something as good as doritos, then you'll be dissappointed.  My family has eaten these for at least 3 years as my son had food allergies.  So, we're not necessarily eating them for the nutrition, that should say something.  They're good enough to eat just because.<br /><br />It is a personal preference.  If you generally like soy items, than you will probably like these.  The soy taste, light as it is, is what most of my friends don't like about them.  Kids seem to like them better than adults.  And, I would say the parm. & the nacho flavors are better.  However, we like these too.

review/summary: Tasty, Messy High Protein Snack
review/text: As part of a high protein diet, I have conducted a broad search for the most protein-rich foods. It is easy to find cheeses, meat, and protein shakes loaded with protein. It is much more difficult to find flavorful high protein foods that are traditionally carbohydrate rich.  Kay's makes a few good snack offerings that meet this requirement, including the Parmesan Cheese protein chips. At a cost of approximately 0.05 dollars per gram of protein, the protein affordability is on par with reasonably priced cheeses and meats but more expensive than protein shakes.<br /><br />Taste is matter of preference but I can say these snacks are indeed tasty from my perspective. Yet, they don't taste like other mainstream snacks such as Doritos or Cheetos. Hence, you may be inclined to eat them in moderation.<br /><br />One big downside to this snack is the volume of crumbs created when eating. Oddly, many of the Kay's chips are far messier than mainstream alternatives. So, while Parmesan protein chips may make a nice snack while watching television, expect to eat over a large bowl or table napkin. Otherwise, you will have a mess of crumbs that will find their way into every crevice of your furniture.<br /><br />High protein foods are typically more expensive than foods rich in carbohydrates or fats.  So, I have recorded the nutrition of about 200 foods to find the best value in terms of lowest dollar cost/gram of protein. An excerpt is below. As you can see, the chips are a reasonably good value at 0.05 dollars/gram.  A typical strength athlete might need as much as 1 gram/kg of weight daily.  This would equate to about 10 dollars of chips per day for a 220 pound (100kg) athlete if eating nothing but Kay's protein chips. While not realistic, it gives consumers an idea of the expense involved. So, if you like the taste and can store a full case, they make a tasty component of your high protein diet at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />Pros<br />Taste<br />Moderate protein cost<br /><br />Cons<br />Extremely messy<br /><br />PARTIAL RANKED LIST OF PROTEIN RICH FOODS<br /><br />SOURCE .....

review/summary: A decent snack option for low carbing
review/text: I just received these, tore open the box, and snarfed down a bag.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviews, I did find these crunchy --they weren't soggy or soft at all. Overall, I like them because it's pretty hard to find salty crunchy snacks on a low carb diet. These compare to Medifast's Parmesan Snacks with the exception that these are flat and Medifast snacks are little balls, but overall the flavor is pretty much the same. Also, these are a MUCH cheaper option than Medifast or any of the other high protein low cal diet product, who charge about $15 for a box of 7. At the sale price of $9.25 for a box of 12, that's less than .80 cents per serving. Good deal.<br /><br />And, speaking of servings, I have a pet peeve for the manufacturer... the bag is 1.5 oz but the nutrional facts are based on a 1 oz serving. Gimme a break. Who's going to eat only two thirds of the bag and leave the rest? They tout 110 calories, but realize that you're actually going to get 155 calories, 5.25 grams of fat, 21 grams of carbs (not net carbs cuz this does have some fiber), and 15 grams of protein when you eat a whole bag. This still isn't horrible, so why not just tell us what we're going to get when we eat the whole little bag, which we will do :-).<br /><br />Also, these little chips do crumble easily. I think there were maybe 5 whole chips in my bag, the rest were smashed (but still tasty). Overall, I recommend this and for the price point, flavor, texture, and lack of other options. I will repurchase.<br /><br />Lastly, kudos to Amazon. I got free shipping through Prime and they were on my doorstep in 1 day.

review/text: Due to medical reasons I have to be on a high protein, lower carb diet.  These are a great snack.  It's nice to have something to crunch on instead of potato chips or tortilla chips.  The taste of these is okay.  I personally prefer the Kruncheez by Kay's Naturals.  While these don't totally taste like Parmesean, they do have a nice flavor.  The only reasons to not give 5 stars are that they don't really taste like the flavor specified, and each bag has 1.5 servings.  I really think the bag should be one serving when they are this size.

review/text: This is the first product I have ever reviewed.  I shop a lot on Amazon and rely on reviews and they have always helped me.  This product is so bad, that I felt I had to warn others.  I purchased it looking for healthy low fat snack.  First off, the package says low fat.  They may be low fat, but the chip is as greasy as they come.  Next, the chip has no snap too it.  It is soft and melts.  Not something you want in a chip.  Worst of all is the taste.  The cheese flavor is prominent but nasty.  Overall, avoid this product.  I should have been tipped off by the price, which is fairly low for a supposedly healthy and gluten free product in this quantity.

review/text: When I opened up the whole case of protein chips, I was quite overwhelmed since I thought, WOW. Did I go a little overboard with this? I could not believe I bought a whole case without trying it first.<br />Anyway, I opened up one box just to taste it and it did not taste good at first. But as I kept on eating it, it just got better and better. I ended up eating this box all day periodically from morning till the end of my work day. Uh-oh, one box equals 5 servings. YIKES.<br /><br />As a fitness fanatic, I keep a high protein-low carb diet. This is an excellent substitute to my craving for potato chips and salty snacks. Unfortunately, there aren't that many healthy, salty snacks to choose from (I do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of the world). The Chili nacho flavor creates a party in my tummy, I wish it was spicy though but it does the job.<br /><br />So a whole case of Kay's protein chips?? Yeah, no problem!

review/text: These really fill that need for something salty and crunchy while not actually being junk food. The nutrition info speaks for itself. The chips are small, so the bag takes a long time to munch through, so you don't feel like you took two bites and ran out. Their texture is similar to puffed rice/wheat/corn junk foods, like bugles or salsa fries. They kind of dissolve after the first initial crunch, as opposed to a chip made from a slice of potato, which just breaks into smaller hard pieces. This is my favourite flavor - the parmesean isn't bad, but this is really late-night-I'm-stoned-and-playing-video-games junk food goodness.

review/summary: Yes Yes Yes Thanks for Healthy Snacks Like This One
review/text: These "chips" are really freaking good for being so healthy. The thing is, you have to know what to expect when you are eating a high protein/fiber product like this one. It is not going to taste like a potato chip so kiss that fantasy goodbye if that is what you are expecting. I suppose some people have extremely refined taste buds when it comes to chips and have a hard time stomaching these. But seriously, they are extremely good, even you don't care a whole lot about them being healthy. They are crunchy and crispy and have a good dose of flavoring on them, and they are not too salty. These are perfect for people who want to add more protein to their diet in an easy way. I take a bag to school or on trips and they are awesome, especially good for days when I work out a lot. The price for these is really good too, especially if you score some extra savings with Amazon. As an afternoon snack, these beat anything you'll find in a vending machine price- and health-wise. It is products like this one that make my life a little easier so I don't have to struggle to eat healthy while being busy!

review/summary: One of the best low-carb snacks you can buy
review/text: If you're doing a low carb diet or even just want to cut down on them then these are really some of the best low-carb chips you can buy.<br /><br />Taste/Texture: They don't REALLY taste like chips but honestly its close enough to, say, a dorito, that it works. The texture is different, a little lighter than a chip which may be a positive for some people. You definitely get the chili nacho cheese flavor from it and in my opinion it's about the closest you're going to get to a "real" chip if you're looking for low carb. Haven't tried the other flavors though.<br /><br />Size: The bags are small, yes, but not that much smaller than a regular small sized bag of chips. You might find yourself eating more than one bag as a snack though.<br /><br />Price: Pretty good when you buy the bulk (12 pack) product although it works out to about a dollar a bag which IS a little pricey I guess but when you look at it as "12 dollars for a pack of 12" somehow, to me, it seems like a better deal. Also, if you like them, sign up for the regular deliveries and it shaves 2 dollars off each order AND includes free shipping so you really can't beat that. Considering the high price of a lot of speciality products (and this is) it's pretty inexpensive.<br /><br />Overall: A good purchase for low carb dieters, a tasty chip substitute, something even fans of traditional chips may enjoy. Good value.

review/summary: Decent alternative but not great.
review/text: These chips taste okay - although I probably would have liked the Nacho flavor better, they were 3 dollars more a case at the time I made my purchase. The main problem with these chips, is half of every bag is protein powder at the bottom of the bag, so your stuck trying to scoop it up with your fingers or end up just throwing it out. I guess, in trying to make them low fat, the oils that usually hold chips together is missing, so you end up with half a bag of crumbs. I ordered 3 cases and every bag is like this, so I don't believe it's an isolated problem.

review/text: These chips are wonderfully light and lightly seansoned and that allows one to use them in a variety of creative ways.<br />I have had gastric bypass and still have difficulty getting my daily protien intake because it is difficult to eat the protien they suggest.  However, with these chips and this flavor in particular I can travel with them and add them to just about any soup for a sustainable meal with crunch and nutrional value.<br />Unlike the more pronounced flavors of nacho cheese ( superb choice for football games etc.) I can enjoy these as a part of a meal even in salads.<br />Bravo Kays' for making such a wonderful product.<br />WHERE ARE THE CINNAMON ONES?  THEY MAKE A GREAT QUICK BREAKFAST!!!!!!!!!<br />M

review/summary: Pretty Good - Very High in Protein
review/text: These are pretty good.  I mean, the seasoning tastes really good (I'm a sucker for good seasoning...).  I can't really say much about the crackers themselves as they don't really stand out in any way (this isn't to say they're bad, they're most definitely not), they're just crackers, EXCEPT---you get a great amount of protein from one little bag (a 1.5 oz bag has 15g of soy protein and 4.5g of fiber, which is not too bad).<br /><br />The calorie count for the same 1.5 oz bag is 165, the fat count is 5.25g, which isn't super great, but it's way better than the count from the same amount of potato chips and you're getting much more protein and also fiber, so not too bad if you have a craving for something salty and seasoned.  Also, they're just more satisfying.  You don't feel the urge to immediately eat another bag like you often do with chips.  Probably because of the soy protein and fiber, huh? &lt;g><br /><br />If there had been a choice for 4.5 stars, I would have taken it, but just couldn't go to the 5 for some reason, but I'll definitely be buying them again just to have on hand when the craving for salt and spice hits.  Which, unfortunately for me, is quite often.  Oh well, there are worse things I could do... &lt;VBG>

review/text: I am on a high protein, low carb, low fat, low sugar diet. More than sweets I crave salty chips and crackers, something to munch on in front of the TV. These are delicious! If someone told me they were bad for me I would believe it. They don't necessarily taste like anything else on the market...maybe a wheat thins toasted chip? They are very crunchy and light not heavy or gritty like other high protein crackers. The only downside is that each individual size bag is actually 1.5 servings and of course once it's opened, I am going to eat it all because I have no self control. These are going to become a staple in my diet from here on out, the perfect substitute for potato chips, without that guilty feeling after.

review/summary: Pretty darn good
review/text: I'll be honest, I bought these on a whim because I needed another item to push me over the minimum for SuperSave shipping.  I was browsing pantry items because I figured I might as well buy something I'd need anyways, and I came across these chips when looking for healthy snacks.  While I'm not typically a big consumer of "natural" foods (nothing against them, I just don't go out of my way to sneak them out), I try to stay away from obviously unhealthy foods and thought it couldn't hurt to try these as a substitute for less-healthy snacks like chips.  My expectations weren't very high, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that these chips are really pretty tasty.  They're salty and crunchy yet not greasy.  I'm not saying I wouldn't prefer regular old potato chips all else equal, but if you're looking for a healthy alternative and debating giving these a try, I say go for it (because we all know "all else" isn't really equal...).

The bad thing is they are extremely unhealthy with tons of bad fats in them, including they have no nutrition.  It's just pure unhealthy.  As someone who is trying to get a lot of protein in their diet I had seen these.  Since I've missed chips so much I thought I'd try them.  The hard truth is while these are healthy the taste is really just not that good.  They're good enough to like them but not good enough to love them either.  I may buy more of this in the future but I may look for other products instead.  Just because these are great for protein, 12g protein, low fat, low calories, and decent taste Ill give these 4/5 stars

review/summary: Good Protien snack
review/text: I am pregnancy and gluten free so i was looking for a good crunchy snack to much on during the day. I will have to say i was pleasantly surprised by these chips. They taste pretty good and the stats are good with those of protien, no gluten and low in fat.  I am going to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Good Snack!
review/text: This was my first time trying this product and I enjoyed it.  I liked the amount of protein in the snack which is what motivated me to buy it.  The flavor was good (chili nacho cheese) and I will definitely try the others.  One big plus (besides the nutritional content) is the amount in each bag.  Usually with individually bagged chips I'm always reaching for more, but these have large portions in them that leave your crunch craving satisfied.  My only complaints (which are very minor) are that the bags are a little difficult to open and your fingers are left a bit messy.

review/summary: LOVE them!
review/text: the best healthy chip I've ever had. The serving size is quite satisfying and the taste can't get any better. I've had the parmesan and nacho cheese...the lemon don't appeal to me but I haven't tried them. They really are delicious and you won't regret buying them. Don't expect doritos or your conventional chip though. They are definitely DIFFERENT than your grocery store chip but really really good!

review/summary: Good, but pricey
review/text: I ususally buy Genisoy tortilla chips, but can't seem to locate them in-stock anywhere. So I decided to try the Kay's chips, because they are high protein also. They are good, but very pricey. I don't think I'll buy them again-  just didn't think they were worth the cost. I hope I can find the Genisoy chips soon.
