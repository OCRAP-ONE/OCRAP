review/summary: Better Than Starbucks Gingerbread Loaf
review/text: This is my second year to use the Libby Pumpkin Bread Kit for our family. I had looked for a substitute for the Starbucks Gingerbread loaf in the past and not pleased. The cost of serving it to my large family was too much. So I decided to add 2 Tbls. of ground ginger to the kit mix. I also substituted half the oil with melted butter.  Unbelievable!!  The taste is the best, most moist gingerbread loaf (better than Starbucks) around.  I did not use the icing in the kit, but made a cream cheese icing for one loaf. The other loaf I left plain. All through the holidays, guests would choose the gingerbread over other desserts. Keep offering it Amazon. Some of us live in small towns that do not carry it. If you like gingerbread or pumpkin bread, you will not be disappointed in this kit.

review/summary: Should call these "Sesame Bars," but they still taste great
review/text: This product is definitely yummy, but the overriding flavor is of sesame seeds (second ingredient). I wouldn't know quinoa was even in the bar if I didn't see the label. But I still love these! I would give them five stars if they had just a smidge less sugar, since I don't think they need it. Also, it's really three thin bars in each package, not one big bar. But makes it easier to portion it out if you don't want to eat it all at once!

review/summary: Not as good as the sesame bars, but good for me.
review/text: I loved the Osrki sesame bars, but wanted to try these as they  provide a little more nutrition and saw that another reviewer said they could barely taste any quinoa for the sesame flavor in these (which sounded like a win to me). I wish I could say the same.  Unlike the sesame bars, these taste like something you eat because it's good for you, and they are a bit harder to chew and stick in my teeth worse.  However, they don't taste *bad* exactly, and they do have  more protein, fiber, and calcium than the sesame bars. And I do like that they aren't even as sweet as the sesame bars, since I don't need much sweetness to satisfy me.  Unfortunately they also have almost twice the fat and a few more calories, although I'm sure the fat is the very healthy kind.<br /><br />I get the Osrki bars to have as a small breakfast to go with my vitamins, and will finish these for that purpose, but I won't be snacking on them outside of that much. I may grow more fond of them as the box wears on, but speaking after having had three or four of them, I probably won't buy this flavor again. I'll return to update that if that changes.

review/summary: Nice Bold Earthy Flavor!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this tea! From the minute I first smelled its earthy, nutty scents (with hints of tobacco and leather), I knew it would be a delightful morning tea. I couldn't have been more right. For those who love boldly flavored and earthy teas, this is a must try.<br /><br />As one who has recently given up coffee (got tired of the jitters and crash), I have been searching for teas with bold and robust flavors, like in coffee. I do not exaggerate when I say that this tea has the boldest and most interesting and  complex flavor I've experienced (without the bitterness of many "bold" black teas).<br /><br />Coincidentally, this tea also has nearly as much caffeine as coffee. As with all teas, though, the caffeine absorbs into the bloodstream at a much slower rate, leaving the drinker jitter- and crash-free. (For the curious, this seems due to the fact that the caffeine in tea bonds with the tannins, making it much harder to metabolize.)<br /><br />Thus, this morning mate is not only absolutely delicious for its nutty and earthy, yet smooth, flavor, but is great for concentration and energy. I cannot reccomend it enough, particularly for those looking for boldness from their tea!

review/text: My Morning Mate is a mix of mate, black tea, and red rooibos. Listed under ingredients are sweet cocoa, chocolate and almond bits, pistachio nuts, macadamia nuts and coriander with warm hazelnut and cinnamon.<br /><br />Some of the reviews on the Teavana site state that they think this tastes like coffee.  It does not taste like coffee but mate has a very distinct taste.  Although the ingredient list is extensive, I think it mostly tastes nutty.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it is not my favorite mate tea-it is a little bitter to be 5 stars.

review/summary: Great product. Good way to get fiber throughout the day.
review/text: We drink a lot of tea in our household - several mugfuls a day, which could result in sugar overload if you like your tea sweet, which we do. We use this Splenda with Fiber in black tea, green tea, white tea, herbal teas, barley tea, and coffee.<br /><br />To give an idea of how much you might need, I like 3-4 teaspoonfuls in a 15 oz. mug of tea. With 1 gram of fiber per teaspoon, this Splenda makes it easier to reach the recommended daily intake of 25-30 grams.<br /><br />We often have to have our Subscribe & Save shipment moved up because we run out quickly. Our local supermarket (the only one for 40 miles) sells this product for $8 a bag, so we save a few dollars with Subscribe & Save.

review/summary: Looks funny, but...
review/text: ... tastes just like regular Splenda.  I use it for everything - well, for everything I put sweetener into, that is.  It's great for iced tea & stuff like oatmeal, cream of wheat, etc.  I even used it to make a jug of Kool-aid & it was fine.  It does have kind of a funny look to it, though - it looks like it's just a pure fiber supplement (you know, kind of powdery & 'not quite right' looking).  If you have kids or older adults who are picky about the look of their food, I'd do a stealth job & mix it in before they get a chance to see it - they'll never notice the difference in the taste.  Once you stir it up, it's clear, so your tea, Kool-aid, etc. doesn't look any different.<br /><br />I haven't tried it for baking yet - I live in Arkansas and it's been in the 100s for over a month, with small relief days of 'only' 95 or so. I am NOT heating up my house to find out if it's good for cheesecake; that'll have to wait for winter!

review/text: Sweetleaf is expensive and weird. So Splenda is the best, way overpriced product so far. The others are not the same in terms of taste or the overall exorbitant cost for all of these products. I also use some cactus juice. If one could travel to Mexico without being beheaded, I'd pick up a lot of cactus items for sweetening, itching, different diseases -- it's a dollar for a quart. Here, we pay a fortune, Also, my wife is part Quechua -- the original settlors of North and South America, so I tire somewhat at the 'American Indian' casino stuff -- so the old Andean medicine works better than our idiocies. Look on the Web. I am second-generation diabetic -- 6 ft., 150 lbs. I know sugar replacements. Splenda does add real sugar for baking; avoid it.

review/summary: It is what it advertises
review/text: I can't speak for other states but I can tell you that in the state of North Carolina Texas Pete is an institution. It can be found in practically every non-fast food restaurant ranging from barbecue spots to your local Waffle House, as well as about 75% of homes here. It's a pretty versatile hot sauce (I think it excels on pizza and is made for scrambled eggs). It has one pitfall though. It has practically no punch and is widely considered a "starter hotsauce" for this very reason. For those of us that like our hotsauces to have some firepower that's a bit of a problem since we like the taste, but the lack of fireworks Texas Pete provides usually forces us to mosey on over to something a little hotter.<br /><br />So it was with great surprise I saw that one of the local supermarkets had this on thier shelves. I wasn't expecting Texas Pete Hotter Hot Sauce to be much hotter than it's predecessor, but I was very wrong. This stuff is *plenty* hot and has the same basic taste as the regular variety. I brought a bottle to work where a number of my coworkers are hotsauce afficianados and after a few tentative splashes onto their foods of choice they all began devouring it so fast I had to bring in a replacement bottle 2 weeks later. If I had to guess I'd say that this stuff rates at least 7,000 Scovilles or so. It's brought some fun back into breakfast!

I give it 5-stars because it really is great for people that want that Texas Pete taste but with more heat.  I promise that you won't be going through bottles every week or month with this stuff!!!<br /><br />I think my lips are burning, too.

review/text: I live in a rural area where it can be difficult to get even the store brand grated cheese, and so I was hoping to solve that problem by finding a good brand online. I certainly wasn't expecting gourmet quality, just something adequate.<br /><br />When I read the reviews of this product, I was very hopeful. I am not a fan of Kraft grated cheeses, and never buy them. So when people said in their reviews of this product that they felt this was better than Kraft grated cheese products, I hoped it might be comparable to the local store brand, which is actually quite good. I was VERY disappointed. This cheese is sharp, but lacks any of the richness and more subtle flavors of even a moderately good parmesan, and is extremely dry. I find I don't cook as much pasta as I used to because this cheese is so disappointing. Everyone who knows me knows that I really enjoy cheese on my pasta, but I will go without before I will waste my money on this again.

Each individually wrapped torta is flaky and light.  I ate them with cheese slices and can think of many other ways to use them.  Yummy!

review/summary: Not your grandmother's condensed soup!
review/text: The MTR line of soups in shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  This Simply Tomato soup is mildly spicy with Indian flavors and is not at all bland but for more of a bite, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UUXPPG">MTR Spicy Tomato Soup</a>.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the paste, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I make it as directed but substitute � cup of milk for some of the water.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, milk, sugar, edible starch, salt, refined sunflower oil, onion, ginger, jeera (black cumin seed), garlic, and black pepper.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian but not vegan as it contains milk.  Note that the label indicates five servings per packet but two or three is much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup so each serving would be a little over half a cup which is not realistic.<br /><br />Calories 70<br />Calories from fat 20<br />Total fat 2.5g<br />Saturated fat 1g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 10mg<br />Sodium 950mg<br />Total carbohydrate 10g<br />Dietary Fiber 0g<br />Sugars 7g<br />Protein less than 1g<br />Vitamin A 2%<br />Vitamin C 6%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 4.8g of sodium.

review/summary: Perfect Size for a Cavalier
review/text: Each of our Cavaliers gets one of these (size small) first thing in the morning. I find this size to be perfect for our 18lb dogs. More of a snack than a biscuit, but not so much that it fills them up. It takes them about a minute to eat. We have lots of good stuff in the treat cabinet, and this is by far the favorite. I love that it gives them minty fresh breath in the morning. At night, they get a Teenie Greenie and they get their teeth brushed. It's a routine that has worked well for us.<br /><br />I hadn't previously heard of FidoDogTreats.com, but their prices were so good that I decided to give them a try. Lovely web site. Very reasonable shipping - $6 for 10 packs of Twistix, and they shipped quickly. I had the Twistix within 3 days. I also contacted their customer service department with a comment, and they replied the same day.<br /><br />Couldn't ask for more!

review/summary: Good Greenie alternative
review/text: First off, let me just say we spoil our dog.  I'm sure most people do.  For our little Maltese, we've tried a variety of dental chews.  His favorite treats are Greenies.<br /><br />After one visit to the vet, we were told that Greenies are made predominantly of wheat and that could lead to problems in the later years.  We were giving him at least two a day.  She recommended giving him one maybe every other day or on special occasions.  So the hunt began...<br /><br />We've tried all kinds.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT0Y">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AYL9NU">Get Naked Low Calorie Dental Chew Sticks for Dogs, Small/6.2-Ounce, 18 sticks/Pack</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFLONA">N - Bone Oral Hygine Twistix Twested Stick Dog Treats Small 5.5 oz</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BZQB8K">Blue Buffalo Mini Blue Bones Natural Dog Dental Chews</a>.  Of all of them, Greenies are his favorites.  They're also the cheapest.<br /><br />The size of these are a little larger than the Greenies.  They're also pretty cheap on Amazon compared to a local pet store.  They do seem a little tougher than the other dental chews.  All of the other ones seem a bit softer, but these are a bit rough and harder.  One thing that we liked about them is that they are wheat free and gluten free.  Our dog seems to like them.<br /><br />We try to mix it up and give him different treats throughout the week.  These are a good treat to throw in the mix if you'd like to do that.  They're no Greenies, but if it will keep our little guy healthier a little longer, then we'll continue to give him these and spoil him at the same time.

review/text: I bought this for the first time at a Farmers Market.  The first time I tried heating the quinoa, it was pretty think (chunky even).  I added a little water, and then it was too watery!  So I asked the woman at the Farmer's Market the following week and she suggested adding the mango to it.  I tried it that afternoon and it worked perfectly!  The perfect amount of moisture was added and my son LOVED it!  I will continue to buy this brand, as everything we've tried since then has gone over well with the baby.  And it puts my mind at ease to know he's getting the purest, most nutritious food he can.

review/summary: No seconds on this
review/text: We had ordered the quart size root beer by Paragon (motla) and everyone at my daughter's birthday party (adults and children) loved it and came back for seconds. We ran out that day, so I ordered the gallon size. BIG disappointment. It did not taste like any root beer flavor I had ever tasted, no one even ate more than a third of their cup. To me, it tasted more like black licorice with a very strong aftertaste. I called Paragon and they said they cannot do anything about it, since we ordered it through Amazon. We cannot return it here because it is opened. I now realize though, that I had not seen that the gallon is labeled "Premium" (would of thought that meant "even better taste") and the quart we had purchased was labeled "standard". Will go back to the standard. I was drawn to the fact that the gallon was only a few more dollars than the quart.

review/text: I give this product 5 starts, but not for eating it as a cereal. I think that eating it plain/with milk is a little rough: as a cereal, I'd give it 2 stars. However, I LOVE using this stuff in yogurt (any flavor)--it adds more of a crunch than granola does--and it's also fantastic when you put it on top of fruit (espeically strawberries and melons like canteloupe...not so much watermelon). I really like the Ezekiel 4:9 with almonds best!<br /><br />And as an FYI, 22 bucks for 6 boxes is a great deal. The cereal usually runs about $5-6 a box in-store.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Best hot cereal in the world
review/text: Eaten cold, this no-sugar-added cereal has a crunchy texture and a pleasantly sweet, subtle flavor, like a more sophisticated twist on Grape-Nuts. But it's when this cereal is served hot that it really shines. In addition to packing far more flavor than oatmeal, it also has the perfect consistency for cooking; somehow, it never seems to stick to the bottom of the pot. And it takes just a few minutes.<br /><br />Every person I've ever served this to has been impressed. "This is the most delicious oatmeal I've ever tasted," they say. There's no need for any sweetener, though raisins and sliced banana are always a welcome addition. Chopped walnuts are also great for adding protein and some extra crunch.<br /><br />I like all of Ezekiel 4:9's cereal varieties about equally well, and would pick any of them over any other kind of cereal. And Amazon's prices beat those at my local grocery store. It's a great way to stock up on a truly amazing breakfast food.

review/text: This natural sprouted grain cereal has become our "staff of life"!  Last year, I believe my 60 year old husband was a "heart-attack waiting to happen" - we changed our eating habits to organics, high omega3 foods, sprouted grains, a lot of leafy green veggies, exercise, a lot less carbohydrates, etc and a year later his cholesterol, blood pressure, homocysteine and all his other lab reports showed the blood work of "someone in their 20's", his doctor declared!  I even make a "granola" with Ezekiel 4:9, organic coconut, raisins, pecans, and cinnamon that he loves sprinkled in his yogurt.  With no refined sugar, preservatives, artificial colors, flavors or shortening - we're lovin' it!

As others have mentioned, it has a texture that may not appeal to everyone (kind of like Grape Nuts, only different.) I use soy milk, which gives it a richer taste (admittedly not for everyone, but I like it). The cereal is very absorbent and soaks up the milk really quickly, so you may need to add more as desired. I have not tried it hot yet, but I bet it's really good that way, too. I highly recommend this cereal and can't wait to try this company's other products!

review/text: I wanted some healthy cereal that would very nutritious.  I was already familiar with Ezekiel bread, so why not try the cereal?<br /><br />It's good.  I don't eat it plain, however.  I always chop up a banana in it.<br /><br />It's healthy, inexpensive (when you consider how much nutrition you're getting), and tastes good.  I eat a bowl of this most mornings.

review/summary: Top notch product
review/text: If you are looking for a healthy, complete cereal, this is for you.  Most boxes of cereal can be eaten in a few helpings, but even though this comes in a relatively small box, it's pretty full (16 oz is more than most big general mills boxes) and should last you far more meals than your average cereal because it's filling and nutrient dense.  As far as the cereal goes, do not be fooled by the calorie count per half cup - there is zero sugar and every calorie you eat is nutrient dense and healthy.  This is perfect with milk and some fruit (e.g., banana, blueberries).  You can also eat it plain with milk but it's not as sweet, although it does not taste bad in my opinion.  It goes well in Yogurt as well.  Another great thing about this cereal is that it's completely natural, there's not any added vitamins.  If you don't understand what this means, for example, cereals like Total are basically cereal + vitamins added.  It's like adding multivitamin to the cereal, the vitamins and minerals are not natural.  This cereal is completely whole.

review/text: As most write on Ezekiel, you need to develop a palette for unprocessed foods to enjoy it. I would describe this cereal as tasting like Grapenuts but the granules are smaller so doesn't hurt your teeth. I usually eat with vanilla almond milk, a little Stevia sweetener and a sliced banana for breakfast, or I sprinkle over yogurt. Often I add a tablespoon of organic oat bran to either. Highly recommend.

review/text: I bought the cereal for the first time as an ingredient for an energy bar recipe.  That was about 4 yrs ago and we have been eating it consistently as cereal with vanilla soy milk, raisins and a banana.  Hubby eats it every morning.  So satisfying and crunchy.  We haven't tried it with dairy milk but I can guess that it might need the sweetness of the soy milk or the banana, raisins.  All varieties are good.

review/summary: superb holiday splurge, truly exceptional ham
review/text: My family has been ordering holiday goodies from the Swiss Colony since I was a little girl. When the boxes with the Swiss Colony logo arrived we fell upon them like famished fools. What a treat! The Swiss Colony Baked Ham is described by the company as "fork-tender", and that is absolutely true! These hams are so succulent, tender, and flavorful that they won't last long once they are opened! We simply sliced the ham and placed in a baking dish and let it cook just long enough to warm it and bring out the juiciness. We then devoured it with whatever else we were eating, but the ham was what we remembered! There is very little fat on this ham, but I always saved the end pieces and the bone and used them to cook a pot of dried beans. Best beans ever! This product deserves more than five stars, but that's all I am allowed to give--it really deserves ten stars : )

review/summary: I have a funny story to share
review/text: Well unless your sense of humor is different from mine, then you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />One time several years ago I went to the uptown mini mart with my mom.  I believe the year was 1990.  It was really early in the morning.  I recall the dampness of the morning dew had turned all the trees and plants a swampy shade of green in the autumn sun.  What a fantastic story I just shared, huh?  Oh wait that's just the introduction!  Continue on!<br /><br />Anyway my mom walks into the store but I wait in the car.  I'm not a morning person and the car seat was comfortable so good luck getting me to budge.  A man dressed in formal attire pulls up a few parking spaces to the right.  He was obviously going to some business meeting and making it big in my no-name Amish town, making me feel small and ashamed of myself for living in a town way below his high profile standards.  Making me feel any sense of accomplishment I might get to experience will automatically be deemed inferior.<br /><br />Anyway he gives me these dirty looks as he pulls open the front door and walks into the store. I wasn't sure what to make of that, but needless to say I was young and therefore shocked and confused that someone so sharp dressed would stare me down with piercing eyes. This might not have been a showdown in the wild west but I was one second away from pulling out my squirt gun.<br /><br />I watch the man do what is most likely his usual morning routine (well I mean his routine after leaving the house- I KNOW he brushes his teeth, gets a shower and makes the bed).  I now stare HIM down since he was too far away to see me.  Like a Jack Russell Terrier, I wait for him to turn around and *then* nip at his ankles.  With his back turned, he was no longer capable of giving me those bad looks, which gave me this sense of unlimited power.  The power's now in MY hands.  You're completely under my eyes command so to speak.  Well I was about to find out why he was so desperately trying to tuck himself out of my view.  The closet demons apparently volunteered to go for a ride with him that morning.<br /><br />When I see the guy walk to the cash register lady, guess what he was holding?  No, not a newspaper and coffee like most people of his type.  He was holding a pink Hostess Sno Ball.  And NOTHING else!<br /><br />He walks out of the store giving me another frightening look of intimidation but the Sno Ball was CLEARLY visible.  It was like watching a sumo wrestler push someone around wearing those bunny pajamas that Ralphie's aunt made for him from the holiday classic- The Christmas Story (only this time I'm glad my eyes weren't shot out so I could witness the youtube-worthy humiliation standing before me).  This time I'm not scared realizing his reputation as a serious business man was now in serious question.  No thriving company would ever consider hiring the proud owner of a Hostess Sno Ball.  I smile as he leaves.  He pulls away too ashamed to make eye contact with me (or because he needed to see where he was driving, but still, I SO won that battle!)

review/summary: Wow, wow, WOW.
review/text: First off, I'd like to explain that I am not a professional, but do try to make fantastic cakes at home and for friends. I have worked as a cake decorator in a small town before, but did not get started in fondant until the last few years, on my own at home.  I started with Wilton (YUCK!), and then found Satin Ice, which is good stuff.  But, I kept reading reviews that raved on Fondarific Buttercream flavored fondant, and how much easier it was to work with, etc.  So, I bit and bought some via the subscription ($10/2 lbs and free shipping??  Awesome!)<br />When it arrived, I immediately checked for an expiration date.  My heart sank. 06312.  That means "63rd day of 2012".  I thought that meant it had expired, but before I went to send it back, I double checked the manufacturer website.  Come to find out, that is the *manufactured* date, and it would expire 1-2 years AFTER that date.  So... my fondant batch was MADE on the 63rd day of 2012.  Fresh!  Awesome!<br />Upon first opening, I actually let out an "OMG".  The smell was divine!  It smelled of vanilla and buttery goodness, like good homemade buttercream icing.  It seemed like a hard ball of fondant inside the packaging, but I was able to break a small piece off.  Upon rolling around in my fingers just a few seconds, it softened beautifully and was very pliable.  No crust fell off, no crumbles.. just smooth.  And surprisingly, not sticky!  I even stuck a fingernail in to see if it would stick under my nails, and it wouldn't.  I keep my nails super short, but it always seems like I get fondant under my fingers when I work with it.  Not with this test.  So, of course.. I had to try some.  And it was as good as it smelled! Sweet buttercream flavor, but not ungodly sweet like most fondants are. And it tastes authentic... not like artificial butter or super strong vanilla. No weird off flavors, either.  And the aftertaste was just butter and vanilla, not "chemicals".  I don't know how to describe it, but some fondants can taste "chemical-y".  This stuff doesn't have any of that.  Usually, I tear off the fondant from cake I eat.  This stuff?  I'd almost definitely eat with the cake, especially if it rolls as thin as the manufacturer says it can.  According to the website, it can take almost 50% less than what the Wilton Fondant chart calls for.  More bang for your buck if that holds true.  The taste was so impressive, I bought some more to try out that others had mentioned was a good flavor (has not arrived yet).<br />I bought this fondant ahead of time for a cake I'm going to make at the end of May, so I have not yet rolled it out and covered a cake yet.  But so far?  I'm impressed.  I plan to update this review once I have covered a cake.  (if you look at my other reviews, you'll find that I have a habit of reviewing and then updating after with what I have learned).<br />Keep in mind this, though:  unlike Satin Ice, Fondarific is meant just for flat decorations. It stays soft, so any 3d stuff you try and make will never harden.  If you need to make 3d fondant figures or flowers, they recommend 1/2 Fondarific to 1/3 gumpaste, which will be what I try.  They also recommend Tylose powder to firm it up, but from what I've read on cake decorating boards, no one has had any luck with this method.  Worst case scenario?  Go all gumpaste, or buy Satin Ice to do 3d figures.  But for what this is, and the price compared to other fondants online (and considering free shipping), this is a good buy.<br />Also, this color "Antique White" really is an off white.  I want to make a "story book" cake, so this is perfect for that color of book pages. It's like it has just the slightest beige tint to it.  If you want something really white, consider their "Wedding white" color.<br />Stay tuned for my update on it's performance in cake coverage and fondant thickness used!

review/summary: Best Tasting Fondant
review/text: This is, by far, the best tasting fondant I've used. It has a really great, almost real, buttercream icing flavor.<br /><br />It's also can roll out pretty thinly without cracking. It also stays pretty malleable after covering the cake, which is especially great if your embossing or impressing details on the cake. I mostly use Satin Ice, which is also great, but can start to crack a little when you're covering the cake or pressing in details. I wish the Fondarific was a little less expensive, but I understand why it costs more. This fondant is great-tasting and easy-to-use, a great product.

review/summary: Worked For Me
review/text: I had heard commercial fondants tasted bad but this actually tastes very good. It has a nice buttery vanilla flavor. I haven't rolled it out to cover a cake yet. What I used if for so far was to make cute little accessories for a gingerbread house I donated to a charity event. I colored it and rolled out square yellow windows and green awnings plus a chocolate brown front door. Also added some tylose powder to make gumpaste figures such as a light fixture with a yellow gumdrop "light bulb" and a little mouse for my pretzel woodpile. This fondant worked very well for my purpose and everyone liked my finished gingerbread house. Next I will be using it to roll out and cut out little fondant Christmas decorations for cupcakes. Having already worked with it I'm sure this fondant will work out perfectly.

review/summary: Wow, wow, and wow!
review/text: My first experience with fondant was Wilton's inedible putty.  God only knows how many people's opinions of fondant has been poisoned by that stuff... But this fondant is *wonderful*!<br /><br />It has a light buttercream flavor -- my family sampled a bit straight from the container, and thought it was delicious.  None of the chemical, artificial, plastic flavor that taints Wilton's product.<br /><br />It's much more pliable than Wilton's, and remains that way for a longer period.  I didn't have to moisten the fondant at all during a lengthy session decorating a cake, and it barely needed any flour or sugar to keep it from sticking to the prep surface.<br /><br />It's resistant to tearing even though it's rolled to half the thickness of Wilton's fondant.<br /><br />It's a night and day difference.  I enthusiastically recommend it!

review/summary: Beginner friendly and tastey
review/text: I wanted to make my first fondant covered cake so I came here and cake forums for reviews. I was intimidated by how hard the fondant felt upon opening it. I decided to knead it around in my hands before trying the microwave. No microwave was needed it softened up really fast. It rolled out with no problems and I easily covered the cake. I'm ready to take on more fondant cakes. It is pricey compared to other fondant I've seen on here but since it tastes great and was easy to work with I will stick to it.

review/text: Before I decided to try this, I had only worked with Wilton's Fondant.  Compared to Wilton's, this fondant is *AWESOME* as far as taste is concerned.  I had a little difficulty with it sticking to my work space when rolling it to cover a cake, but I learned later not to use shortening (as you do with Wilton's) and to use corn starch instead.  The price is a good one...it is a few dollars more than Wilton's, but you get 1/2 pound more.  Overall, good product.
