review/text: Brooks Tangy Catsup is so much better than Heinz, Hunt's or those other catsups on the market. Those taste like stewed tomatoes. Brooks does not. It is much more flavorful. Switch to Brooks and you won't want to go back to those others.

review/summary: Best Catsup Ever
review/text: Brooks has not been on US shelves in years and too bad for us.  It is great tasting.<br /><br />Makes Heinz, Hunts and all the rest taste like what they are - tomato paste and sugar.<br /><br />Canada must know because it is now manufactured there.<br /><br />Check out the history - yes, Brooks has an interesting history and great following including a brooks bottle watertower in Collinsville Illinois.

review/summary: Not as tangy as I remember
review/text: It had been many years since I last tasted one of my favorite ketchups, Brooks, so I was really looking forward to that spicy, tangy taste I remembered from at least several  decades ago.  I ordered some through Amazon, but alas, what I received had no unique flavor.  In a blind taste test with others we had trouble differentiating it from Heinz ketchup.<br /><br />It is a good quality ketchup but lacks the spice and zip to make it truly unique.

review/text: Brooks is the only brand of ketchup used in our families.  We have been using it for over 60 years, and never found another to compare with it.  Since we cannot find it locally anymore, I now buy it in bulk and give it out to relatives for Christmas, and they are very happy to receive it.

review/summary: The very best ketchup ever made! A++++++
review/text: I have been searching local stores for months to find Brooks Rich Tangy Ketchup. When I finally heard that the it was no longer made, I went on the internet to see if I could find any bottles anywhere. That is when I discovered that it was being made in Canada. I also found that I could find it on your website so when I had the chance I bought a case and shared the bottles with family and friends who had been raised with this being the only ketchup ever put on our table. If you make your own barbecue sauce this just gives it that extra tang that you want. I am not a ketchup person but when I want it this is the only kind I want to eat.

review/text: Cannot get Brooks catsup where I live.  I lived on Brooks catsup and lettuce sandwiches in college in the '60's.  No other catsup has the great flavor of Brooks; just a tangy taste with other great ingredients. Brooks catsup is my secret ingredient in baked beans and is awesome wherever catsup should be used.  Hometown Favorites was prompt about filling my order and delivery arrived on schedule.

review/summary: best catsup in the world.....
review/text: I learned about Brooks Hot Catsup in the early 1950's. I am 67 years old. My Grandmother had bad arthritis and cataracts. She could not drive nor walk very far so Grandpa did all the grocery shopping. I was about 5 when he was shopping at Worth Food Market on Henderson and Pennsylvania on a Saturday afternoon after he had gotten off work around noon. He liked to try new things so he bought a (glass) bottle of Brooks Hot Catsup. He loved it and he had it from then on. About 1979-80, Worth Food  Markets went out of business in Fort Worth and Arlington. I found Brooks again about 1999-2000. Same wonderful flavor. I am buying more now.

review/summary: Greatest Catchup on Earth !!!
review/text: [Quote from The Wizard of OZ] "Never mind that transpizzle behind the curtain, he knows not what he's talking about"<br />Quite literally Brooks is a thick natural tomato flavor with Earthly spices added to perk up the pallets of the best chefs on Earth.<br />I grew up the main 3 catchup's, Hinze, Hunt's and Brooks. All 3 have their places in foods so this is not a knock on any, unlike transpizzle. He obviously has a ONE TRACK taste bud. Totally unworthy to make his review. Catchup on catchup? He also must like sugar on sugar.<br />Once you try Brooks you'll appreciate it's down to Earth flavor you WILL be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Doesn't Go Far Enough
review/text: This cereal makes a yummy start to the day, and has a hearty, filling texture. It also has a subtle flavor, far less sweet than the kid-oriented products cluttering the cereal aisle. At less than five dollars a box, it's also less expensive than the mainstream brands, which practically require a second mortgage if you want to eat breakfast. And it's made without the synthetic ingredients that make other cereals kind of disgusting if you research them at all.<br /><br />But I looked at the nutritional information, and found there was almost no nutritive value. Almost no vitamins, minerals, fiber, or, well, anything. You get more nutrition from the milk you pour over the cereal than from the cereal itself. And I'm a bit squeamish about the repeated use of the word "natural" on the package. That word has no legal definition. Organic? Unprocessed? Who knows? They never bother to say what they mean by "natural."<br /><br />I need something I can rely on to start my day. Yummy is definitely a good trait. And this is probably better than most of the processed filth advertised to kids on TV. But you're better off with fruit, toast, and jam. I like this product okay, but it just doesn't go far enough.

review/text: I was initially reluctant to purchase this, but I finally got tired of paying $6.00 for a 1-pound Rice Select container at the local grocery store.  I found that this Roland Italian rice made better risotto than it's expensive California cousin.  It was creamier, faster, and tasted better.<br /><br />Let's face it, it's a little arrogant to package and sell ELEVEN POUNDS of arborio rice.  I mean, who really eats that much arborio rice?  Well, after trying it, I do.  Order a bag, turn on the Food Network, cut up an onion, and be a culinary rock star.

I will purchase this over and over as it is one of my family's new favorite foods and I can make it in 7 minutes flat using my pressure cooker.  I just saute any vegetable on hand to stir in right before serving.  Top with a pat of butter and some parmesan cheese . . . yum.

review/text: I love using Arborio rice for risotto dishes a couple times a week. It's one of those dishes that you can dress up to be anything you want it to be; lemon and zucchini, basil and tomato, herb and cheese. This bag has lasted me about three months now and I'm about 3/4 of the way through it so far. I cannot really speak for the quality of the rice itself; it all seems to be uniform in size and color with no oddballs. The price is well worth it, however! This rice stores well and the price is unbeatable!

review/text: The Package arrived in good order and consisted of mostly whole, unbroken grains. After following one of the recipes on the packaging label, I found my first batch to be a bit more toothy than "al Dente". Be prepared to add additional broth as needed until the proper doneness.<br />I prefer to use a mixture of equal parts real sweet cream butter and extra virgin olive oil when starting the dish with onions and then the rice followed by the addition of room temp (or warmer) brut Champagne before adding the heated broth a cup at a time. Additionally, sauteed mushrooms added into the dish at the end along with some crumbled crisp bacon and plenty of fresh grated parmesan cheese,then topped with dried parsley will make this a very satisfying meal with a fresh green salad and some crusty sourdough bread.

review/summary: I love the rice, makes great risotto
review/text: I have tried a lot of different Arborio rices through the years.  Some are more fussy than others, I personally found this to work very well.  My family makes all their own food if it's possible to do so.  I used our homemade rabbit stock, some apple wine that's about ready to be bottled, some artichoke hearts and made some basic risotto.  Everyone loved it, my kids are spoiled when it comes to food, I didn't know what risotto was until I was 27.  This rice seemed to take a little less stock than the "fancier" rices I've used before.  It was very creamy while still holding a little bite.  Personally I will buy this rice again.

review/text: Great price, check.  Free Prime shipping for 11 lbs of rice, check.  But how does it taste?  Well, this rice made perfect risotto when combined with homemade stock, fresh ingredients, and proper technique.  We've been working our way through this large bag for several months, but we divided it down into smaller sealed packages to keep it fresh.  It has shown no sign of degradation so far.<br /><br />This Arborio rice cooks nicely and evenly when making risotto, resulting in the characteristic sauce around the grains from the slow release of starch.  It does not get mushy or too soft, but maintains a nice tooth while absorbing the flavors provided.<br /><br />I will be buying another 11 lb bag of this Arborio rice when I run out.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: I ordered a bag of this risotto a couple of months ago after reading the great reviews.  We cook quite a bit of it, so I always like to have some on hand, and the price for this product seemed very good.<br /><br />My wife and I used it for the first time a few days ago.  As she was cooking it up she asked me what the black things were.  I looked down and said it was probably just some husks or something like that.  She pulled one out and it was very clearly an insect, legs and all.  Stirring the contents of the pan turned up at least half a dozen of the little beasts and this was in just a 1.5 cup serving.<br /><br />I next looked at the bag.  It had no holes in it other than the one we had made to start using it.  I poured out more of the rice and saw that not only were there many more insects in it, but other "debris" such as a couple of pieces of corn and other random things that looked like they were the result of poor processing.<br /><br />Now, I know that you can't harvest food without having insects and other things in the rough product, but normally insects and debris would be filtered out in the processing stage.  I don't know if we got a bad bag, or one that contained all of the "goodies" left over from a full day's sorting, but it was extremely disgusting and has put us off from ever buying this brand again!

review/summary: I bought this for both emergency and daily use and it works perfectly: the Details
review/text: As a consumer, I've been alarmed at how quickly food prices have soared, including cheese and similar dairy products. Also, a power outage last winter convinced me that it would be good idea to have some items on hand which could be used to create cheese sauces, perhaps if we had to use alternate ways of cooking, such as the fireplace.<br /><br />This produce exceeded my expectations. We not only have extra for emergency use but I've found all sorts of ways to use it weekly. It is the ONLY cheese powder which my family truly loves on popcorn, neither too salty or bland. It adds just the right touch.<br /><br />When it comes to adding an accent to my homemade white sauces or giving some zest to buttered broccoli, the nice cheese flavor is perfect. Try adding it to melted butter and some garlic as a spread for toast. The possibilities are limited only by your cookbooks and imagination.<br /><br />Also, this is an item that can be used by both beginners and professional cooks. You really can't go wrong by having some of this in your pantry and the ingredients are far healthier than the typical Cheese product sold at a local grocery store. Unless you want to subsist only on peanut butter sandwiches for two weeks (we thought we might have to do that during the winter at one point, car stuck in garage, roads icy and temperatures below freezing), this is a nice, reassuring cheese powder to keep in your pantry and versatile enough to add to popcorn, liven up sauces and keep vegetables from being boring.

I don't really cook much so i thought what the heck am i gonna do with all this powdered cheese???<br /><br />So far i have added it to a steamfresh package of cauliflower with cheese sauce that i was disappointed to find had virtually no cheese flavor at all. Thankfully this stuff cheesed it up up up and saved the day (i was quite happy to have my random powdered cheese package laying around that day.)  Another time i was having major cheese cravings, I added it to an Annie's microwave mac n cheese packet and i was in heaven.  Oh and i also slapped some on top of microwave popcorn, which was quite tasty as well.<br /><br />SOOOO.....I'm glad i bought this stuff by mistake.  I don't know much about cheese powders in general, but i can say that this particular cheese sauce powder has a great cheesy flavor and nice consistency when you mix it up.  I will order more when it runs out. :)

review/text: I make mac and cheese a lot for my hubby and I usually make it with real cheese. I wanted to save some money and try and use this. It is great! I received it a week early an just tried it. I make mac and cheese and use mostly this and a cup of real cheese to give it texture.

review/text: I really enjoyed the flavor of this powder.  It was great on popcorn!  My only gripe is that it would be nice if it came in a recloseable bag so I didn't need to make sure I had large enough zip-close bags for it to be transferred to (which just caused a lot of wasted plastic).

review/summary: Know the ingredients before you order
review/text: This product has two types of hydrogenated oil, artificial colors, and two types of MSG (MSG and hydrolyzed yeast extract). The company can be difficult to deal with- no notification if your shipment is delayed due to unavailable ingredients for example. It took several attempts via e-mail and phone calls to get anyone to answer why the order had not even shipped after the estimated delivery date. The shipping is outrageously high for the weight as well. Not what I have come to expect from an Amazon related company.

review/summary: Great for broccoli and cheese soup, or just broccoli and cheese!
review/text: Disclaimer: if you're looking for the cheddar cheese powder that makes Kraft mac n' cheese, you'll find that here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9ZM7M?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8<br /><br />This cheese sauce powder is intended for making the cheese sauce you'd normally find on broccoli, cauliflower or other veggies. But this is the GOOD cheese sauce, not the cheap knock off stuff found in off-brand veggie n' cheese mixes.<br /><br />I didn't think it was that great for use in making mac n' cheese, as foretold in the above disclaimer, but you might find it more to your liking for that sort of thing if you enjoy off-brand, cheap, cardboard-like mac n' cheese.<br /><br />Mixed with salt, this does make a great popcorn topping though. The cheddar cheese powder is just a touch better on popcorn than this, but we usually run out of the cheddar cheese powder pretty quickly, so this tends to make a great alternative.

review/text: I wanted to start making my own mac and cheese instead of buying it, and had hoped this would work well.  What I found was that it tastes terrible, I only managed two bites before I spit it out and threw it away.  I guess my first clue should of been the greenish tint to the sauce in the daylight.  I would not buy this again, and I would not recommend it to others.

review/text: I got a box of 479 Popcorn sent to me as a birthday gift. the cool presentation made me think, "what did I do to deserve this?!?" I'm definitely going to regift this box.<br /><br />the gift box had four flavors in different sized bags (more on that in a second) -- and it was almost like a tasting menu. there was Black Truffle + White Cheddar, Fleur de Sel Caramel, Chipotle Caramel + Almonds, and Ginger Sesame Caramel.<br /><br />I liked all the flavors. each time you opened a bag, the flavor hit you fast. pretty cool. the Black Truffle + White Cheddar was really good, really rich, and not overly salty like you have w/other flavored popcorn ... and + my room still smells like white cheddar, which ain't a bad thing.<br /><br />and I'm a big fan of salted caramel ice cream -- so the Fleur de Sel Caramel was a treat. but my FAVORITE (think bold/underline/italic FAVORITE) was the Ginger Sesame Caramel, as the ginger went really well w/the caramel -- too bad this came in a small bag.<br /><br />and one last thing, there was not ONE single unpopped kernel of popcorn. loved it and big thanx to my friend for sending.

review/text: Let me start by saying thank you to DeliDirect for shipping this basket out to our troops in Afghanistan. This basket arrived the same day riots happened over in Afghanistan and I received multiple thank you messages from our troops as this basket was actually taken into a bunker with our troops during a rocket attack. As I was told the cheeses and meats were shared by soldiers huddled together in a freezing bunker and helped immensely in the moral as they sheltered from incoming rocket fire. I also have to say I had ordered from Swiss Colony another basket alongside this one, but Swiss Colony notified me 5 days after I ordered that they canceled because they would not ship items to APO addresses, so again DeliDirect, Thank you so much for supporting our troops when another would not.<br />  Soldiers mentioned they loved the Pepperoni/ Peppered Cheese/ Grained Mustard Combination. The Havarti Cheese and Merlot were also big hits. There was one comment that said soldiers joked, "Hey if this is my last meal I am glad it's Wisconsin cheese and not that MRE Peanut butter." You guys are Awesome!

review/text: For anyone who simply wants a basic, American-style cup of coffee, this is perfectly fine. No, it's not as full-flavored or (arguably) as good as most of the higher priced Tassimo offerings, but it isn't intended to be. This is a simple, inexpensive cup for everyday use.<br /><br />That said, I knocked off a star due to Amazon's current pricing. The unit price for the "Friday Sale" is roughly the same as the individual retail price at many stores. That's not a deal -- and certainly doesn't represent the sort of discount one would expect to receive when buying a 5-pack.

review/summary: Good basic coffee
review/text: As the title says, this is a good basic cup of coffee.  We feel a little frustrated by the 6 ounce default pour - does anyone still drink coffee in these lilliputian quantities? Still, with a little time spent pressing the "give me more" button, we can get a nice full cup of medium bodied coffee. We generally alternate cups between this and Gevalia Vanilla Hazelnut on the weekends.

review/summary: It's Terrible.
review/text: Do you remember what it smells like to add water to an ashtray full of cigarettes? That's how this coffee tastes. I added a caramel, some hazelnut flavoring, a packet of hot chocolate with miniature marshmellows, and Coffeemate vanilla chai creamer too it. It still tasted bitter, like wet cigarettes and metallic. I think the metallic flavor comes from the t-disc packaging. It doesn't make sense to buy a $100 coffee maker and drink trashy coffee. Especially when you can take that same amount of cash and buy some good coffee. I ignored the bad ratings of other reviewers because I believed the positive reviews. The only redeeming factors are that it is cheaper (less than $7 at Walmart), and that you can make a single cup of coffee. If it were allowed, I'd give it a -5 rating (or &lt;-> -,  for infinitly horrible).

review/summary: The Best Stuff.
review/text: I cannot say enough about The Honest Kitchen. I have used all of their dog food products and a lot of their treat line and would, and do, highly recommend them to anyone who asks me what I'm feeding my dogs.<br /><br />I have a 7 year old Beagle and a 4 year old Plott Hound and I get a lot of compliments on how shiny their coats are, and how healthy they look. The Plott Hound has been on THK since she was a puppy, my Beagle since he was 3. My Beagle had severe food allergies and seasonal allergies, and I had a hard time getting him to eat until I switched over to THK. He use to get really bad hot spots in the spring and summer months as things were blooming, which were treated with a wide variety of antihistamines that can't be good for his little system. He had anal gland issues due to gastrointestinal irritation, (probably from all the pills). Thanks to THK's Preference, the anal gland issues are a thing of the past and he's happy to eat every time I put a bowl in front of him. (Salmon Oil has helped tremendously with the skin irritation).<br /><br />I feed THK Zeal, (white fish), Embark, (turkey) and Preference, (base diet that you add a protein source to). My dogs love them all.<br /><br />This is a great product for someone who is seriously thinking about feeding a raw diet, but like me, doesn't have the nerve to fully commit. THK is the only dog food on the market that is FDA Approved for human consumption -- and that's important in this day and age when commercial dog foods are full of who knows what and are prone to toxic contamination.<br /><br />This product saved my Beagle from miserable summers and a lot of visits to the vet, (and has actually saved me money in the long run by preventing the problems).<br /><br />If you care about what your dogs and/or cats eat, give it a try.

review/summary: Good stuff but pricey
review/text: I have been feeding my dog home prepared raw with occasional meals of this stuff. Lately he started having trouble with some of the heavier boned stuff I was giving him (he is 10 1/2) so have shifted to feeding more of this. About the time I started that he started being more frisky and puppy like. He has never acted his age but it seems like something changed and the change in food seems like the only thing that happened around the same time. Aside from that I trust this company and like that they use human grade ingredients. The food does not smell bad either. I wish it was cheaper but guess you get what you pay for. My frisky senior is priceless though, for everything else there's MasterCard, right?<br />Oh and he loves the taste but that is fairly meaningless as he will eat anything. He gets really excited about this stuff though!

review/summary: Dog absolutely LOOVES this food!!
review/text: I acquired several samples of THKs food when they were running a big sale for ~$1.00/ea. We found out that he loves Embark. I'm actually shopping for a control bowl because he chokes it down too quickly. It is also a nice comfort to know that the food is being dehydrated/packaged/shipped from a factory that produces cereal for humans.<br /><br />To the person complaining about the bowel movements. At least with my dog, you can compare the big(huge, yes) movement to the amount of reconstituted food in the bowl. It will likely be the same volume/mass. That sounds healthy and regular to me. Anyway, sorry for the rant. It's some good food and you should buy it.

review/text: We use this as a back-up for raw feeding, and our pup absolutely loves it. Although THK isn't technically raw, it doesn't cause much digestive upset when we use it between regular raw meals. The one gripe I have about this food is the poo factor; this stuff produces a HUGE amount of stool in comparison with real raw. When our Darwin's shipment was delayed last month, I had to use THK exclusively for a week. I was shocked when I cleaned up the yard that Saturday--the amount of poo had nearly tripled! Hence, we use this food only occasionally.

review/text: I gave these a try with finicky, picky Emmy, only because everything else--Pounce, Friskies, the gourmet little cans--had pretty much failed. (I have no idea what she lives on, because she's determined to show me she's above eating anything I offer her.)  Much to my amazement, she's crazy about these Greenies' treats and would easily consume an entire package, even in my presence, if I let her.  She's making me feel a little bit like her "dealer," and now that we're momentarily out of her drug of choice, I'm feeling a bit guilty, as though it's my fault she's going through cold turkey withdrawal.  I guess I have no choice but to order another supply and, in the meantime,  endure the combination of her loud complaints and constant tapping of her forepaw on my shoulder to remind me of my duty and heartless dereliction.  I just hope I don't have to bring her to a specialist in feline addictive counseling.

review/summary: My cats love them
review/text: I wanted to point out that these treats are different from the dog Greenies. Dog Greenies are chewy, cat Greenies are crunchy, like dry cat food. Because of this I don't know if they actually work (if they're the same texture what makes them different from cat food?) but I don't think they're dangerous, as a previous reviewer said. Canine Greenies have caused health problems, but from what I understand it is because the dog didn't chew it well (like most dogs) and because of the softer texture it swelled in the dogs stomach.<br /><br /> My cats love the salmon flavor, the package recommends six pieces three times a day, not to exceed 18 pieces a day. I give my cats about six a day, all at once. They don't always chew them though, which is the only problem I've had with the product, swallowing them whole doesn't bother my cats at all though. I have one cat, Garfield, who is very picky, but he loves these treats. So I think its probably safe to say that these shouldn't cause health problems like the canine Greenies can and also that your cat will really like them!

Normally Greenies are great treats for my cats but rancid products are not acceptable. EntirelyPets and other suppliers have to be aware of the age of the product they are selling according to when they buy it from<br />Greenies.  I could not find an expiration date on the packages.  Greenies is manufactured by S&M Nutec and they should be providing expiration dates.

review/summary: Poison for your cats!
review/text: We received a free sample of Feline Greenies in the mail today from PETCO. Our 13 indoor cats gobbled the entire 1-oz. package in less than 10 minutes. Even our finicky eaters loved them. We are very careful pet owners, double-checking every ingredient in anything that they eat (in the same way that we watch our own food). Unfortunately, I fed first and checked later (something that I have NEVER done before and will never do again)!<br /><br />Imagine my dismay when I found menadione sodium bisulfite in this product. This toxic, unapproved ingredient has no business in our pet food. Its use is prohibited in many European countries, and our own FDA won't approve it.<br /><br />We have requested that PETCO discontinue the sale of this product immediately, until the manufacturer removes this poison.<br /><br />If you love your cats, you will not feed this product to them. Just do a web search for "menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB)". You'll be a better cat owner, that's for sure . . .

review/summary: I thought they were great until I learned about menadione sodium bisulfite
review/text: Thanks to another reviewer, I learned today that Greenies contain a synthetic, controversial ingredient, menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), that is highly questionable and considered by many experts to be toxic. I will no longer take that chance with my pet just because the FDA hasn't gotten around to banning it. Based upon the information I have read about it, the only apparent reason to add MSB to pet food is to claim it as a nutritious ingredient, namely, the k-vitamins that come from green plants. In other words, the basis of "Greenies" is a cheap synthetic version of the real thing. That must be why the ingredient label describes the stuff as "source of vitamin k activity."<br /><br />Furthermore, although my 3 year-old cat has been eating between 6-12 Greenies every day, he is currently in need of advanced dental work. I see no evidence that these so-called dental treats are effective and they may very well be harmful.

Neither of them like any one flavor more than the others.

So, I'm not saying Greenies are bad for every cat, but maybe some cats are too sensitive to their ingredients.....<br /><br />anyway, always, always look at your pet's food when their health declines in anyway......its the single most important thing we do for them everyday.<br /><br />oh....and as far as tartar and dry food/treats keeping their teeth healthy....that's bunk! that would be the equivalent of saying that if humans eat pretzels, their teeth will stay clean.....it does not work that way with US or our pets.

review/summary: Matt the cat loves these
review/text: Matt the cat turned 11 yesterday.  Matt is our tabby who resembles a miniature mountain lion at 19 inches from head to toe and pushing 20 pounds.  He really loves greenies as treats.  The package says they are low in calories and are good for dental care, supposedly preventing tartar.  That would be great if Matt actually chewed them first; he probably crunches less than half of them (yes, he does have all of his teeth).  We have a regular session on Saturdays when my brother visits, and we make Matt "work" for about 10 of them.  That is, my brother bounces greenies onto the coffee table, and it is Matt's job to jump up and get them or, if too lazy, just stand up on his back legs and snag them off the table with a front paw.  Matt has only been "off his feed" once in 11 years.  Something may have upset his stomach, and the only thing he would eat for about a day was greenies, so imagine my emotional attachment to this product.  With all of the different flavors there are, I wouldn't give Matt anything else for a treat.  What is truly amazing to me is that I can open a bag of potato chips, or an energy bar or any other cellophane container besides the greenies bag, and Matt takes no notice, but when I open the greenies bag, he always knows and comes out like a shot.  All of my packages came marked with expiration dates that are at least six months out; for me, a good price is around $3 for the 3-ounce package.

review/summary: decent, but not very 'dental.'
review/text: I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. Also the only breath freshening ingredients- rosemary and chlorophyll, are at the very tail end of the ingredient list as dead last and third to last. I am glad that these ingredients are present, but they are in such small quantities, that they can't be helping much. From personal experience, I have not noticed and breath freshening results.  I think the only reason why they are "dental" treats is because of the small amount of rosemary and chlorophyll as well as the fact that they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would recommend Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. However, this is still a MUCH better treat than Pounce brand or Meow Mix or any soft treat that can stick to your cats teeth and smell bad and cause dental problems. This treat may not help teeth significantly, but they definitely won't hurt them. Also there are tuns of vitamin in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 4 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as "dental," they really should have enzymes or more prevalent dental ingredient.

review/text: I always love to find a new treat to give to the cats. So I tried these "Greenies" on them and they loved them. The other great thing is they have a nice variety of flavors so I give them a different flavor everyday.

review/summary: Feline Greenies Variety Pack
review/text: Our two cats are 4.5 and 7.5 years old (so their teeth are good) and they love the crunchy consistency and flavors.  They are fish- and chicken-oriented, not beef nor liver eaters; maybe those flavors (in all products) are too strong; so it helps to know your cat's preferences before you buy.  This is a great product we include in their feeding rotation (some wet food, some dry food, some treats).
