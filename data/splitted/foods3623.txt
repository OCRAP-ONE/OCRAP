review/summary: Ugh - Take out the mint!
review/text: We used to drink this all of the time - for years - then it disappeared.  When I found a box I was thrilled!  Until I brewed it...<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings changed the recipe and added peppermint!  Seriously?!?!  So instead of that lovely bright flavor we remember so fondly you get something that tastes like liquid chewing gum - yuck.  Our family is not fond of mint teas.  Guess we are back to SV Teas until CS (HOPEFULLY) change it back.

review/summary: Mint and lemon overpower everything else
review/text: The mint and lemon flavors are the only ones you feel and together with the others create a weird taste.<br />I typically can eat or drink anything irrespective of how good it tastes, but I just cannot drink this warm !<br />I tried to make iced tea with this which is bearable, because you don't feel the taste.

review/summary: Might eliminate need for prescription drugs
review/text: Have not tried RED ZINGER TEA yet.  Just bought some today after reading in a health magazine that the Hibiscus component of this tea is rich in anthocyanins which can dilate blood vessels and block the enzyme which triggers hypertension in the same manner that ACE inhibitors work in common prescription drugs without their side effects.  The claim in the magazine article is that RED ZINGER can lower blood pressure up to 11%. after drinking it for about two weeks.<br /><br />One can also get these benefits of the HIBISCUS flower as a snack eating sweet dried flowers available in health food stores.

review/summary: Fascinating and Delicious!!! I'm glad I decided to try it.
review/text: I found this at a local health store, much to my surprise, so I bought it, but I didn't know what to really expect from trying it. The first time I got the chance to try it, I was amazed at the flavor. I think the added peppermint was a good idea. It's not a strong peppermint flavor, but you can definitely tell it's there. I'm glad I decided on trying this, and I think I'll be getting more, once I'm done with the first box. I'm still relatively new to Celestial Seasonings tea, but I have to say after trying the Lemon Zinger, Wild Berry Zinger, Red Zinger, Mint Magic, Acai Mango Zinger, Perfectly Pear White Tea, China Pearl, and loving them all, I think I'll stick to drinking their tea, and their tea ONLY. No more Lipton tea for me!!!

review/summary: Lose the mint, keep the hibiscus
review/text: This is, by far, my favorite tea, and the only one I always drink without any flavorings.  When I found its ingredients promote lower blood pressure, I decided to restore it to my daily regimen.  Local stores, however, were either overpriced, or out of stock.  Amazon's product comes at a lower than local price, and, of course, with the Amazon rep for superior customer service.<br /><br />This last is a significant factor.  When a case of soup contained several cans that were severely dented, I contacted Amazon customer service, and in less than three days, they had delivered AN ENTIRE NEW CASE - FOR FREE.  When I read reviews denigrating Amazon's customer service, I laugh, certain that the person was not dealing with a full case.<br /><br />The only negative is that the maker, Celestial Seasonings, decided to jazz up a perfect product with peppermint.  The scent is aggravating.  It seems to be less noticeable with recent deliveries, and the positives far outweigh this glitch.

review/summary: Herbal tea with a twist
review/text: I tried this tea on a whim because I was intrigued by the ingredients. Anything with hibiscus and especially rosehips is a must for me. Red Zinger tea did not disappoint! It reminds me of an "adult fruit punch" because it tastes a lot like fruit punch from the wild cherry bark and the rosehips, but the hibiscus and the peppermint give it a nice herbal flair. The reason why I opted to give this four stars rather than five is because, even though it's delicious, I felt that this tea was a little too overpowering for me at first. Then my best friend gave me a really good idea--split one tea bag between two cups of tea. Not only does this make this delicious tea last a little longer, but splitting one bag between two cups gives me just the right amount of flavor that I want. Very nice tea!

They cheerfully offered me my choice of a refund or replacement, and sent out another batch right away. I'd give the second batch 3.5 stars-- pretty good but I've had better-- but at a much more reasonable price than any other seller right now. Altogether, a very good value for a decent product, and solid customer service to back it up.

These are uniformly good (I opened one of the five pouches, but we have eaten about half of it without finding any problem).  No discolored nuts.  Very uniform, mostly whole.  Various sizes, but uniform good taste.  highly recommended.<br /><br />The only cons are the very high caloric content (I cut them with almonds), and the price, although this was the best price I found.

I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care.  I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent.  My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy.  Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing.  I don't know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good, or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better, a sense of calm.  I highly recommend the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care.

review/summary: An Apple A Day...
review/text: Now, I'm already a big fan of Red Leaf Tea's green apple matcha, but that one really does taste like a green apple, tart and sweet all at the same time. Which is great, but every once in a while a girl needs a smoother apple, a juicer, sweeter apple, which is what I hope to gain from this matcha. I'm eager to try it as a latte with vanilla soy milk and some of their Cinnamon Matcha...I'm hoping for a apple pie with ice cream kind of drink. I love apples and apple juice, so whenever I spot an apple blend, I have to try it. And there are so many things you can do with apple that I'm hoping to be able to do with this apple matcha. Apple matcha pie, anyone? Or apple fritters with an apple matcha icing...yes, please! I make homemade donuts occasionally...can you imagine a big apple cake donut covered in cinnamon sugar? I may have to make donuts in the near future. I hope this matcha lives up to all of the plans I have for it. And I hope it gives me the energy to follow through on those plans! Because now that I've mentioned it, if I don't make donuts in the near future, my wife will be devastated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is just not for me. The smell of the dry matcha has the smell of the more bitter matchas I've had from Red Leaf Tea, and that smell carried through into the taste of the brewed tea. It tastes something like apple candy when you power through the bitterness, which is nice, but far from the apple juice I was craving. I'm not an apple candy type of girl, unless it's a sour apple. It might still be good as a latte, but I won't be cooking with it, sadly. Still it isn't terrible, and the bitterness seems to fade over time. Maybe it will still hold up to donuts, as the amount of sugar in them will balance out the bitterness. I don't really think this is one I need to get more of, and if any of my local friends want a taste, I'm happy to share. I'll experiment with what I have left, maybe I can find a way to fall in love with this tea. But personally I'm going to stick with the Green Apple matcha, also from Red Leaf Teas.

review/summary: Finally a food that works!!!
review/text: I have a 3 1/2 year old American Bulldog that has gone through thousands of dollars in vet bills and worthless speculations. She has been on Grandma Lucy's Rabbit Pureformance for several days now and I have already noticed the vast improvement in her demeanor and energy level. My dog used to violently scratch at herself till she made herself bleed. We discovered that she was allergic to beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and duck. Due to the simple yet nutritional ingredients of Grandma Lucy's she is doing excellent. It's been several days and NO MORE SCRATCHING...I am so excited that I had to write a review. My dog was so allergic to the many different other foods that we have tried with her that we almost lost all hope and we were going to just highly medicate her for the rest of her life. I didn't want to do that and after looking at the excellent ingredients contained in this brand of food I was hoping for the best. I couldn't be more happy and delighted! She's been on various raw, dry, wet, home cooked, and everything else with no luck. Please Grandma Lucy's never change your ingredients on the Rabbit Pureformance line of food because you have just made our lives a whole lot more stress free, thank you! Anyone with a dog that has bad allergies should really give this food a try...it might be the best decision you've ever made for your dog. I'd also like to add that the preparation for making her food is very simple. Just add warm water to the freeze dried food until you get the desired consistency that you prefer. Let it stand for a few minutes and then it is ready to serve. The food honestly smells amazing and at times I have thought about trying it myself. It's made with all human grade ingredients which is good to know. My dog Sadie is 75lbs and a 10lb bag of this fantastic product lasts us approximately 20 days. It's a good deal and so easy to prepare...give it a try and you'll see what I'm talking about.

review/summary: Great product for itchy dogs
review/text: Each 3 lb bag ends up making around 15 lbs of fresh moist food, once you add water. The rabbit has a slightly stickier texture than the chicken <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006COERA2">Grandma Lucy's Pureformance, Freeze-Dried Chicken Dog Food, 3lb</a>, but my dog loves both of them (and he is picky!). It is grain-free and low-fat. I use the Purformance as a large part of his diet rotation. He is healthy and itch-free and has optimum digestion. You add equal amounts mix and warm water, wait 5 minutes, and done! I even tried a little bit and it tasted like human food. You can also easily stir in some kibble if you want to do that, the texture matches well with kibble.<br /><br />P.S. They also have a cheaper Artisan line, which I don't feed anymore because it contains white potato. If your dog isn't as sensitive, it is worth a try. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FZLJWG">Grandma Lucys Grain-Free Chicken Dry Dog Food 3lb</a>

He runs to the fridge when anyone opens it to see if they will give him some.  My dog also takes meds for his joints and this is pretty good to hide the pill in so he will eat it!  Hope this helps anyone who was undecided!

review/summary: dogs fav but too expensive
review/text: my dog loves this as a supplemental treat to his food.  it's also used to give him medicine.<br /><br />my only complaint:  the price.  cheaper to buy this size in the store.  you can get a larger "log" at the $7 and change.<br /><br />word of advice:  shop around and know the weight size.  i made that mistake

review/summary: The good and the bad
review/text: The Good: Easy to use and the mutt (my sweet Doberman, Zoe Washburne) loves it so much she'll go to the refrigerator and hope I get some out for her.<br /><br />The Bad: And this one is "my bad" as I was in a hurry and didn't take the time to check out the shipping costs. $6.99 for the roll and $7.99 for the shipping makes sure I'll never order it from these folks again. Not their fault, mine for not looking more closely.<br /><br />A little more Bad: Natural Balance appeared on my list of tainted pet foods and treats. I don't know if the lamb and rice treat was one of the banned items but, guess what?, the dogs doesn't get any more of it until I know for sure it's ok.<br /><br />If I ever get to a store that has it after the pet food scare is over I might pick up a few rolls. Otherwise, no. Just too freakin' expensive to order here.

review/summary: Sasha loves it but.......
review/text: I bought this as a supplement to dry Natural Balance kibble. Though a bit pricey,(I wouldn't spend this much for a good t-bone), I thought I could use it in small amounts, chopped up and mixed with the kibble to stretch it out. Sasha went through the mixture, separated it, left the kibble all over the kitchen floor devouring the meat leaving the kibble untouched. I want Sasha's primary food to be kibble because of her teeth. The mixture is counter productive. End of experiment.

review/summary: This Soup Tastes Homemade!
review/text: In the winter I always cook a homemade soup for one or two meals a week.  My husband and I both cook, and both love good food, rarely purchasing anything that is pre-made or comes as a mix.  Over the past year I have increased my volunteer work to 5-partial days a week, and find that sometimes on my nights to cook I really just want to make something delicious, but easy and fairly quick to make.  I am always the soup maker, and decided to try the Frontier Soups Red Pepper Corn Chowder.  I am so glad I did, this  soup is a real winner!  The soup exceeds my expectations.  I have added just a few additional things, and my husband didn't even know that it wasn't homemade!  In fact he told me, "This recipe is a keeper."  The only  change I made in the recipe is that I added a 10 oz. can of drained whole clams, a small baked (or microwave baked ) potato cut into small cubes, and topped each bowl of soup with grated Swiss cheese just before serving.  The recipe says to use cream, and I used  half & half.  This was a great find!  I have now ordered two other styles from Frontier to try.  I hope they are also recipe keepers!

review/text: I love Tchibo mellow roast. It tastes good and it does not disturb my stomach. So I was really happy to find it in Amazon. The thing I liked about receiving 4 smaller vacuum packs was that I did not have to worry about how to preserve my coffee for the next few weeks. But what I did not get this time was the intense fresh smell of a newly opened pack of coffee (off goes a star). I am not sure if this was a one time mishap in the way the coffee was preserved or packed. The overall taste is still good. I will give it another go and update this review if I get the full fresh coffee smell next time.

review/summary: Have you Ever had Unfiltered Water from an Artesian Well?
review/text: One of my friends bought a case a few weeks back, and could not get the mind over matter to drink it once he realized it was actually black so I grabbed it and stuck a bottle in the fridge for a few hours. When I pulled it out and took a swig I nearly melted. I grew up on a farm with a natural artesian well, so when I moved out of state and into a big city for Uni a few years ago I thought there was something wrong with it, as it reeked of chlorine. blk. tastes like what I grew up on. I could see why it might taste off, if you know what copper and iron taste like you will taste them, but its in trace amounts and only really noticeable if 1)you WANT to taste them, or 2)you grew up on city water and have never had actual fresh water that has not had absurd amounts of chemicals pumped into it.

review/text: Havent tried this stuff myself yet, but, managed to get my EXTREMELY pick boyfriend to try it (he thought the whole black water idea fascinating) and he loves it. We got the case today and hes already gone through 2 of these rather large bottles. He did say its got a bit of an off flavor at first, but that after you get past the first few sips it tastes just like normal water and that its very refreshing. If he drank it, it has to be good.<br /><br />3/30/12<br />Finally got a hold of this stuff and tried it myself. Love it. Tastes just like water. Its not think and sludgy like some people have described (my guess is they bought some knock-off brand) very clean and refreshing taste. Every now and then I think i taste a bit of off flavor, but cant tell if its the water or my lip gloss lol I recommend. Only giving it 4 stars cause of the price.

Taste: like normal water, Color: like black coffee, Smell: None, Texture: like water.  Typically by the end of the day I'm dragging my rear end out the door completely exhausted from a 10 hour day.  By the end of the day and after 3, 2oz shots around 1pm I felt like working out, hitting the clubs and in a really good mood.  I plan on drinking a bottle a week.  I just wish there was real research and not by the FDA.

review/summary: Hard to get over, at first.
review/text: So, I got my delivery today, and it's a cold day, so I didn't worry hardly anything about refrigeration and popped my first one open right away, stowing 6 others away in the fridge, and giving one to my brother. I try it, and, like many of the others have said, it tasted like normal bottled water, having that mineral taste that I tend to dislike about bottled water; I trudged through it anyway, and sitting, here, with a nearly finished first bottle, I'm feeling better than I did this morning. I have been suffering through sinus problems and a sore throat all week, and it suddenly is gone.<br /><br />I'm not saying that is was caused by the water, but I'm not doubting that it didn't help. Getting past the color and the metallic taste, this product is fine and I'd recommend it to just about anyone.

review/summary: BLK is GREAT! Why are people such haters-
review/text: I am the newest fan of the BLK water.  I am uncertain what water the other people are drinking but certainly they have an air for the ridiculously exaggerated.  The BLK water is very clean tasting and yes it has faint taste of minerals but nothing like what some of the haters have posted.  It does NOT taste like 1. motor oil 2. old stump water, or any other absurd examples posted.  Yes the water is completely black but that is about it.  I find it chic looking in fact and the fact that it normalizes my pH levels are the plus plus and worth buying factor.  The price point is also nothing sticker shocking.  It is what you would pay for any other specialty water available on the market.  I intend on continuing to buy BLK water and take in the benefits of the dark side.  As for the folks with some over the top gnarly reviews, please stop with the lies.

I love all the benefits I get from drinking it, and to be honest it feels pretty cool to drink something that looks so mysterious. People at the gym all do double takes, but inevitably I get lots of people asking what it is.  I am hooked now, and it costs less then the smartwater I used to drink, plus it comes with so much more.  It's just fun!

review/summary: Great after a day of food and drink binging!
review/text: I'm on a low-carb diet where, once a week, there's a binge day where I'm allowed to overeat from dusk till dawn.  The morning after I binge, I don't feel lousy, but not the best, either.  Anyway, I picked this black water in a health food store on a whim, as the label states that the fulvic acid and added minerals will help to normalize the body's PH level.  Zero calories, so why not give it a try?<br /><br />It really made me feel better, like I didn't even binge the day before.  Good stuff!  As for the taste, it's very much like plain water.  A very faint taste, much like very weak coffee.  Imagine a cup of water, and you put a couple tiny pinches of instant coffee.  Something like that.  I'm buying more of this today and having a bottle a day!<br /><br />When you drink the water, the words "WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE OF WATER" appear on the bottle (the words are black so you can't see it when it's still full).  Nice touch!<br /><br />Anyway, if you try a bottle of this, give it a try when you have a bout of indigestion, heartburn, etc.  You should feel better.

review/summary: This Stuff ROCKS! I bought my store out today...
review/text: OK...I'm not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from, but I'd say that you OWE it to yourself to try BLK. I truly hope that they continue to maintain the quality.<br /><br />As I stated, I bought my grocery store OUT today. BLK is less than 2 bucks a bottle, so I don't understand the pricing for the suppliers here. I have drank it right from the grocery store shelf and I've refrigerated it. I don't notice ANY aftertaste either way. However, it is 'fresher' on your palate colder, and you will probably drink it much faster cold. This stuff DOES something...something other bottle waters just don't do. My checkout boy agreed - that BLK makes you feel GOOD.<br /><br />It also allows me to continue in highly cerebral tasks for LONG periods of time. It helps my body rejuvenate much quicker from exercise and decreases soreness in my muscles. My eyesight is sharper, my body feels stronger and I seem to walk more upright, like I'm taller. Fat is being mobilized and liquifying (a good thing). And my appetite is tamer.<br /><br />I've decided to start drinking a bottle a day (16.9 oz). I used to add ORME minerals to my other water and even have had humic acid supplements (liquid and capsules). Even that did not do what BLK does.<br /><br />Somehow, whatever the manufacturers did to blend this, they did it right.<br /><br />I've been using BLK for less than 2 weeks. I'm looking forward to how I feel in another month.<br />And I'm gonna get TWO BLK tee-shirt to celebrate it! I like it that much.<br /><br />````Dr. C Jack, MD````````

review/summary: Just don't look at it while you're indulging
review/text: Bought a case of this water after seeing it at an Aston Martin event.  It really is black (well, dark brown) and looks like a cola product.  No fizzies though.  There is a "flat" aftertaste (otherwise I would have given it 5 stars), but it's not really that bad.  It does not taste like "dirt" as stated by other reviewers.  You just have to not look at it while you are drinking it -- doesn't taste at all like cola which is what your brain may think you are drinking.  A blindfold might help.  I was able to go outside and lift large objects after drinking this product.  Buy this product and give some to your friends and they will think you are really cool.  Who else that you know has black water to drink out of a cool bottle?

review/summary: It tastes like you'd expect: Not like tap water.
review/text: The main complaint that other people seem to have is that it doesn't taste like the water they're use to.  The problem with that is the "Apples to Oranges" scenario.  Water in and of itself has no flavor.  It's the minerals and what is containing the water that gives it the flavor.  In this scenario, the plastic doesn't affect the flavor like you'd find in cheap bottles of water.  Instead the flavor that's tasted is from the various minerals (including the Fulvic Acid) that give it the flavor.  To me it tastes no stranger than Vitamin Water tasting sort of like those Flintstones Vitamins.  It's a taste that you have to get use to and once you do it's pretty good.  It's technically good for you with the random assortment of 77 different trace minerals, elements,  electrolytes, and antioxidants.  So if you're gonna drink Spring Water, why not make it something with an extra kick?  I know that I'll definitely be getting some more of this.

review/summary: BLK is AWESOME
review/text: I initially bought a bottle of BLK from a local retailer and was intrigued by the bottle and color. This is now my beverage of choice after I wake up in the early morning and after a hard workout on the road or gym. The BLK spring water needs to chill very cold and becomes extremely smooth and has little taste, just very refreshing. I read others reviews and am truly unsure if we are drinking the same product..... BLK is OUTSTANDING!

review/summary: Better than I expected
review/text: After reading about how other users had difficulty getting used to th taste, I was very hesitant about buying it. I went to an event last night and the whole table was set up for BLK water. I figured I would give it a try since I wouldn't lose any money. I tried it and it was delicious. There was no metal taste, it tasted just like water. The only thing different is the nutritional value and the color.<br />I ended up leaving with four bottles of water for myself.<br /><br />On a note, I'm not sure if others realize it, but the water is supposed to be served chilled, it says it on the bottle. Maybe if people are drinking it warm, that's when the metallic taste comes. I'm not sure.

review/summary: Great
review/text: I found this product while on vacation in Williamsburg, VA.  We were in Martins near Ironbound Rd, we were staying for a week. While at Martins shopping I saw this water and decided to try it.  I actually read the bottle, it states right on the back in nice big bolded words Server Chilled.  I did not find much taste difference in that and the tap water in Williamsburg or Dasani Water.  I too thought the bottle would be the black part, but after drinking it first I had no issue with it.  The problem I have is no one local carries it. Like someone said if you have been brought up on City water then you have no clue about well water or natural springs.  Living in the mountains we have several natural springs in which to get water from.

review/text: I randomly was driving to the airport and started to feel awful. My stomach hurt and I felt nauseated.I stopped at the gas station and weirdly picked this out of the cooler.<br /><br />I drank two big gulps of it and noticed it has a unique, waxy quality.  It sort of reminded me of burnt paper, in a good way? Whatever that means.  About 1 minute went by and my stomach seriously ceased hurting.<br /><br />My friend googled it and it has some crazy minerals in it.  After drinking the whole bottle, I feel super refreshed.  I guess it's true that your body really knows what it needs.<br /><br />Would be good for hangovers, I'd imagine.

review/text: I bought 4 cases of this because I HEART Housewives/NJ!!  Now I am going to start by saying that black is not my favorite color AT ALL, but I will try anything that is like..you know...healthy organic.  I'm really healthy like that ;  So I invited some of my best girlfriends over for a tasting party and OMG things got CRAY!  I have to add that my boyfriend and I got into a huge fight earlier that day about him not wanting me to wear these really cute shorts that I found on sale at TJ Max that were like short but not THAT short, and I had this really cute top that I wanted to wear with them but he was like "you look super slutty in those shorts" and I was all like "Whatever Ramondo, you wear like those cholo shirts out every day and I don't say anything about that!"  Anyways, point being I was ready to try something new!  So the water arrived and all my girlfriends and I each took a bottle.  My first reaction was..."I don't think i can put something THIS black in my mouth"  But I had spent 55$ a case on this so I just sucked it down (that will show Ramondo LOLOLOLZZZZ....)<br /><br />It sorta tasted like I expected...like dirt water...but like not bad dirt water..like dirt water you drank when you went with your uncle to the river when you were six to go swimming with him and then you would jump in and accidentally drink a little river water.<br /><br />So overall i was pretty please with it but I was really upset about the TJ Max shorts and Ramondo so 2.5 stars<br /><br />XOXOXOXOXOXO-

review/text: I often drink vitamin and oxygen enhanced water so I thought I'd try this water due to the trace minerals.  This was difficult for me to drink, the flavor is not water like and while it doesn't taste dirty or gritty, it's a mental thing. The water is very very black almost like a strong dark coffee.  I'd strongly suggest trying a single serving before buying an entire case because out of 4 people in my family no one really liked it,...that leaves 20 bottles.

Well, I didn't die drinking it, but it didn't taste great either.  And for marketing purposes, as others point out, looking at black water just doesn't sit well with my mind and I couldn't get past it.<br /><br />It left me a slightly bitter aftertaste, and all in all, while I wouldn't say it's the most vile thing I've drank by any means, I would never buy another, and certainly at the prices they're asking.

review/summary: SNAKE OIL ON TAP - save your money
review/text: SNAKE OIL ON TAP! Just like all those companies that claim to sell "alkaline" water. The body does not need help balancing its pH. The body's pH is normally between 7.35-7.45 (this is the blood and body cavities; stomach pH and certain other areas might have their own unique acid-base balance). Any deviations form this and you're talking SERIOUS health consequences (metabolic alkalosis/acidosis for starters).<br /><br />There is NOTHING on the market and approved by the FDA for food use that will alkalize the body - nor should you want something like it. This is purely a market gimmick, that will fade over time. This water is a waste of money!

There is a VERY SLIGHT metallic aftertaste - which one might expect if something has "over 77 trace minerals and electrolytes" in it and does not contain any additives to HIDE these things.<br /><br />One post said it was greasy or thick - that person wasn't drinking BLK. Maybe they poured themselves a cup of motor oil and are mistaken. Obviously, if allow your mind to play tricks on you, this item will not be very enjoyable as you will associate the color with other things of this color (ahem...motor oil). But, if you can get past the mental part of it - I think it's worth a shot. The price, however, is a bit outrageous.

review/text: I have to say, this is an interesting product that I was very excited to try. It's different! I mean how often to you hear someone say they drink black water!<br />When I received my package, first thing I did was open a bottle and took a whiff. I wasn't expecting any smell considering it's supposed to be just like water. I have to say there is a slight subtle smell to it initially, but after a while it was gone. So now it's time for the taste! I took a sip, expecting off-putting flavor and quite frankly, my body was prepared to gag because we don't normally drink black water. I couldn't get past imagining I was drinking a mixture of gasoline and water. Unlike regular water, blk tastes a little bit smoother. I do also detect more of a metallic taste to it but it's very subtle. Once you swallow, it leaves a little dry feeling in the back of your throat like when you drink gatorade. I wouldn't consider blk to be very refreshing. I find myself needing a drink of regular water after the sampling. The only reason I can see anyone drinking this is if they're wanting the benefits of fulvic acid.  Other than that, I can't see myself repurchasing this again. It seems to be like when Heinz released blue ketchup and it failed. Food/drink needs to be visually appealing.  Unless it is flavored, regular blk is just going to make people gag. I wouldn't recommend this product.

review/summary: Blk is YUK!
review/text: I saw this in Bevmo when I was wandering around, and I thought it was interesting. How can black water NOT spike someones interest?<br /><br />I went back today to buy a bottle, just to test it out. After letting it sit in the fridge to get nice and cold, I closed my eyes and took a gulp. It was disgusting. It doesn't feel like water, it seems thicker, almost greasy going down. It tastes coppery like you have blood in your mouth. It smells like your hands do after you handle a large amount of change. Sure, it seems healthy and all, but the taste isn't something I'd be able to deal with. It's just gross.<br /><br />To each their own, though. Maybe someone else would like it.

review/text: This water look great and tastes terrible. I think it tastes like they bottled old water they found sitting in a stump. Also the grammar of the description on the back of the bottle is incorrect. So maybe it is just some fools bottling old water to the fool who bought it!

review/text: I drink a lot of water for health reasons and thought this might be a nice change from just plain water.  Wrong.  It was hard enough getting past the color but the aftertaste was just too much.  Back to plain water for me!

review/summary: Insanely Overpriced Discusting "Beverage" (if you can call it a beverage!)
review/text: I was excited to try it and assumed it would be REALLY GOOD! WOW! Was I wrong! It is INSANELY overpriced and tastes SO AMAZINGLY NASTY! Who in their right mind would put this DISCUSTING stuff on the market! It's not the color that bothers me, as one review suggested, BC it tastes exactly the same when blindfolded! We did a blindfold taste test and EVERYONE identified the NASTY metallic flavor-like chewing or sucking on dirty change! It is NOT thirst quenching at all AND to top it off the whole alkaline gimmick is ridiculous! I'm a scientist! I knew that buying it, but I thought it might be a tasty water drink like other tasty water drinks! NO WAY! STAY AWAY! BLK is FOUL!!!!!!!!! REALLY FOUL! Didn't anyone taste it before putting on the market?????? I wouldn't give this to even my least favorite person to drink, as NO HUMAN deserves being subjected to BLK! RUN AWAY FAST!
