review/summary: Delightful Treat
review/text: I use this to make frappuccino. I don't add sugar or sweetener for the mix is perfect. With just ice and milk blended with Folgers cappuccino, the result is a delicious, creamy smooth taste. This is my daily mid-afternoon drink, a very delightful treat. I have the cappuccino flavor while my husband enjoys the vanilla. We are not coffee drinkers but find this just perfect for us. We find the ones sold at the mall, cafes, etc too strong for us.<br /><br />I discovered the cappuccino flavor is no longer available locally but glad that it's available at Amazon.

review/text: I love hot chocolate epecially around this time of year. Swiss Miss is definitely my favorite hot chocolate mix. I especially love hot chocolate with marshmallows. A lot of hot cocoa mixes have a chalky after taste in them (including Swiss Miss) but this cocoa mix is more chocolate than chalky. Unfortunately the marshmallows in this mix pretty much melts the second the hot liquid hits the cocoa powder. It is much better to buy the regular hot cocoa and a bag of marshmallows separately.

review/summary: Delicious but the flavor doesn't last long
review/text: I chew a lot of gum to help me control my food cravings so I look for a soft chew, good taste and long lasting flavor.  Ice Breakers Ice Cubes gum has a soft chew, without being sticky.  I've even been able to blow small bubbles with it (I like bubblegum, what can I say?).  I've tried several flavors, including Dragonfruit Freeze and Raspberry Sorbet, in addition to Kiwi Watermelon and have enjoyed them all.  However, I find that the flavor doesn't last very long - maybe about half an hour tops.  Which for me at least, means I end up going through a pack or two a day.  This gum would be perfect if the flavor lasted a bit longer.

review/text: They must be good. My dog loves these snacks. The ingredients are all healty. Quick and easy to get to in their easy open jar. The jar even has a neat handle that can help if you make the top too tight.No plastic bag here. I find the plastic bags a real pain to keep the little balls fresh. I suppose once you by a jar you could always buy the bags as a refill. There is no price difference in cost though, so why bother.<br /><br />The only thing my little girlie seems to enjoy more are the chicken fillets. These are quick and she seems to enjoy the texture as a change.

review/summary: So that's why it costs so much!
review/text: I was really hesitant to buy this food because it costs about twice the most expensive premium brand grocery dog food costs at the pet food store, but decided to give it a shot since Amazon offers a deal for subscribing. (I bought the 15 lb bag, which is why I don't have a verified purchase in the 30 lb listing) I honestly wouldn't even know about this product if our new puppy's breeder hadn't recommended it, and was using it on their pups. I'm not one of those people that have to eat organic, or those guys that have to have the word "holistic" on their animals' food. In fact, I usually just buy what's on sale, as long as it meets my personal quality standards. But after trying this, it kind of makes sense why they cost more.<br /><br />When I first opened the bag, I noticed that it did not have that strong dog food scent that most dog foods I've purchased for my dogs have. It actually smells kind of good, to where I would almost be brave enough to taste it. Second, the kibble size is perfect for my golden retriever puppy. Not too big or small, and it perfect for training treats. In the morning before feeding my dogs in their bowl, I usually let them earn their meal through training, and these are perfectly sized and tasty enough to use for that. The outer layer seems almost coated, so you don't get kibble crumbs in your hand and into your fingertips. Third, and most importantly- It's really good for your dog! Prior to buying our new puppy, I did a lot of research (as a good prospective dog owner should) on raising a healthy dog. One of the biggest things that stuck with me was that you WILL pay for your dogs' health- either in the form of good dog food, or in the form of a vet bill. Have a nice day:)

review/text: We are relatively new pet owners.  We've had our goldendoodle for 10 months and during that time, we've tried a variety of products.  Started out with Wellness, moved on to Chicken Soup, I think there was another one in the mix, and then landed on this one.  I don't have anything negative to say about the others- our dog likes them all- but this one made a huge difference in her bathroom schedule.  She is so regular right now, I could set a clock to her.  I attribute it to the food.  We are very happy with this product.

review/summary: gassy puppy!
review/text: Our puppy was being fed this food for a little over a month with no problem. She eagerly awaited to be fed, and wagged her tail the whole time she was eating. However, in the past couple of days she has been very gassy. It seems to be related to this food, because when we switched back to a raw diet, there were no problems. It seems like all of a sudden her body changed, and is not accepting of this food. She was farting every 5-10 minutes... very SMELLY gas that would clear the room! Her stools were also soft and very smelly.<br /><br />I'm going to switch to the grain-free "Instinct" line of food by the same company, and see if this helps. I'd like to go 100% raw, but it just is a bit too much work.

review/text: I absolutely love the convenience of K-cups and Pumpkin Spice is a favorite flavor of mine by Green Mountain coffee.  It's not always in stock so if you think you might want it, grab it before it's gone.  The price will vary on it as well, so as a general rule the closer you can get to thirty dollars on a 50 pack for k-cups the better.  I scored mine for thirty-one dollars.  There is a good spice flavor with the pumpkin and it goes well with my efforts to eliminate sugar from my coffee.  I'm just trying to enjoy the natural flavors with a hint of milk.  This is a great flavor for that goal.

This coffee has just the right amount of spice - not too heavy or too light, and just makes the perfect cup. Don't try Millstone's - yuck! Had SO much troule just choking that one down. This one, hands down, is my favorite flavored coffee of all time now. I just ordered 3 bags of the ground on Green Mountain's website since Amazon didn't have it. If you call Green Mountain, you'll find out that this is their NUMBER 1 selling flavored coffee. Highly, highly, highly recommend!

review/summary: Lacking in Flavor, not what I remember!
review/text: I normally love Green Mountain's flavored coffees-- I buy them almost exclusively. I was very excited to see the Pumpkin Spice flavor back for the year so I eagerly bought them. The first time I made it, I thought I accidentally reused the K-cup because it tasted so watered down. I tried again and again, and every cup is the same. It smells great and has some pumpkin flavor, but it is not strong enough because my coffee has never tasted so watered down before. I have to add quite a bit of creamer and sugar to hide it.<br /><br />I haven't had this problem with my Keurig before or since. I am still going to go through my 18-pack, but I don't think I will be buying these again. Hopefully next fall's batch will be better!

review/text: My daughter loves the pumpkin spice coffees in the fall.  Got a pack of these for her to try since we just got a Keurig and she was pleasantly surprised.  She uses milk in her iced coffee and the flavor holds up with that addition.  Happy to be able to find it this time of the year at such a good price and fast shipping.  Will be stocking up.

review/text: I was so happy to find the Green Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice on amazon.com.  It is a seasonal product that I absolutely fell in love with over Christmas!  Some of the other pumpkin spice flavored K-cups that I have tried smelled really nice, but had absolutely no flavor.  This one fills the kitchen with that spicy aroma and has a full flavor!  I even run through a 2nd shot on smaller cup size.  It has that much flavor!

review/summary: Delicious Pumpkin Coffee
review/text: I really enjoy pumpkin coffee, even in May.  I love that I can order it from Amazon when I cannot find it in any stores.  In fact, I've started ordering all of my k-cups from Amazon since it is so much more convenient than running around trying to find what I want then standing in line.  I think it's a better deal, too.  This Pumpkin Spice is a mild roast and is not as rich as some other coffees I like but it certainly does the trick.

review/summary: Love this flavor!
review/text: I absolutely adore this flavor. Not only do you get a nice amount of pumpkin spice flavor per cup, but it keeps rather well- meaning that you can continue to enjoy this flavor even after other places stop carrying the fresh brewed stuff that they make themselves.<br /><br />OK, the basics of this are good. You've got a decent coffee bean base and as long as you don't add too much water, you can have a decently strong cup of coffee without it being too watery. (Unfortunately one of the problems with the Keurigs is that you have to measure the water to your personal preferences, otherwise you get an overly watery cup of whatever you're brewing.) The spice flavor is not only nice, but it isn't overwhelming. You can still taste the coffee over the spice, which is something that occasionally bugs me about some of the other flavors out there on the market. (Such as the Dunkin Donuts Strawberry Shortcake blend. Blech.)<br /><br />Would this replace a cup of freshly brewed Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, or WaWa coffee completely? Not really. It's good and I'll definitely purchase this stuff again when I see it, but it doesn't completely replace the stuff that you can brew in a bigger coffee pot. Like most Keurig products, this is ultimately a product of convenience. It's delicious and worth buying in my humble opinion, but it still won't replace "the good stuff".

review/text: I have tried probably 40 types of k cups so far.  I wanted an everyday coffee that was like Tim Horton's used to taste, almost like it had a faint taste of chocolate.  I wanted it rich, but not smokey, charcoal-like, or just BITTER. So I seen this Pumpkin Spice in a mixed box and I love pumpkin, but was leery I have never liked flavored coffees or creamers.  This blew my mind! I'm in heaven and now back to order several boxes to tide me over before its gone. As for my search for my regular coffee Caribou Mahogany soooooooo good. Also, using amazon prime, I have my orders in 2 days, and save more than at a grocery store (which carries no selection).

review/text: I can definitely taste the "spice" in this pumpkin spice flavor, but I had tried two k-cups from this batch and could barely finish the cup.  There is an odd taste to the spice which I can't pinpoint.... even when choosing the right size cup, it still tastes like watered spice barely any pumpkin and even with the help of cream and sugar, I still can't get this to taste good enough for me to finish a whole cup.  This is for my family a wasted purchase as it will just probably end up sitting in the box for a very long time, if I don't throw it out before then.

Hazelnuts, sometimes works but depends on the brand.<br /><br />But this, pumpkin coffee, is awesome! I've tried the actual one you can get at Starbucks and this taste almost identical to the $8 medium size ones you can buy! Even better, you don't have to leave your friggin' house to drive for a cup lol Ahh the beauty of keuring :)

review/summary: Good flavor but not great
review/text: My fiance loves pumpkin spice anything to be honest and is chugging down cup after cup of the stuff each winter so I decided to try this brand. The smell when brewing makes you drool just a little bit to be honest but the taste isnt quite there and leaves some room for improvement.  It still makes a good cup of joe on a cold day but could be better.

review/summary: Its Pumpkin
review/text: We absolutely LOVE our Keurig.  I find myself drinking more coffee throught the day because it is so fast.  That being said, I like the Pumkin Spice coffee as a Fall seasonal item, but it seems to become available a little to late in the Fall.  So I make sure there is a little extra leftover from the previous year.  The biggest downside for me is that this coffee is weaker than most k-cups. I make a medium instead of a large.  My wife will combine a medium Pumkin Spice and a medium Green Mountain to get her desired taste. Smaller cups of coffee and having to mix coffee together really adds to the per cup cost too. But overall the flavor is good and has a nice pumpkin taste.

review/text: At first, I had some cups of this coffee on the 10 ounce setting.  It was watery and lacked flavor.  Then I decided to set it on 8 ounces, used a pack of artificial sweetener, and whipped cream, and found it to be quite delicious.  Could be spicier, could be more pumpkin-like, could be creamier, but all in all, a flavor I enjoy and would order again if offered at other times during the year.

review/summary: Favorite Coffee
review/text: I come from a family of hard core coffee drinkers. They do not like this coffee. Their coffee eats away the inside of their coffee mugs. This coffee is enjoyable and has a very nice flavor. I find I stock up in the fall and try to make it last through the year. This is a light to medium roast coffee with a spicy, fall flavor. If you look for a coffee that does not have that burned dark roast flavor this is worth trying.

With cream and sugar added it tastes similar to a chai latte, just coffee instead of tea.  Green Mountain products are Fair Trade Certified and that makes me feel even better about purchasing their products!  I will definitely be buying more pumpkin spice Green Mountain coffee!

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I've had my Keurig for about two years now, and I usually only use it to make regular black unflavored coffee or iced tea.  My husband knew how much I loved pumpkin spice lattes from Starbucks though, so he ordered me a case of this thinking it was the same thing.  I usually never drink flavored coffee (flavored lattes are okay in my book, but flavored coffee weirds me out mostly), however I was pleasantly surprised by this coffee.  It doesn't smell or taste artificial like I usually think flavored coffee does.  I think it tastes great black (for all you Janeway types out there) but it's also not bad with a splash of cream and sugar.  In fact, with some warm milk and a spoonful of sugar added to it, it sometimes saves me from taking a trip to Starbucks to get one of those pumpkin spice lattes.  Even if you usually shy away from flavored coffee, I recommend giving Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice Coffee a chance.  Your kitchen will smell fabulous after you brew a cup too!

Green Mountain Coffees are usually good, and I loved the Timothys pumpkin I got last year, so decided to try this and was disappointed.<br /><br />Like others have said it is weak and taste nothing like pumpkin.  The flavor isn't bad if you want a weaker nutmeg/cinnamon flavored coffee, but it tastes nothing like pumpkin.

review/text: I was lucky enough to receive a bag of Green Mountain Fir Trade Coffee in Pumpkin Spice to try. The flavor of the Pumpkin Spice Coffee was wonderful and perfect for the season. The nutmeg and pumpkin flavors were delicate. I hate when a flavored coffee overwhelms you. This was just the right amount flavor. And the smell was great, my kitchen smelled like a fall celebration. Besides the taste the ethics of this company is admirable. They support fair trade and donate 5% of their profits to socially and environmentally responsible causes. Which is another reason to buy this coffee.
