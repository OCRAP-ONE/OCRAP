review/summary: Unpleasant After Taste
review/text: I was so excited when I got a coupon for this product since it had my two favorite ingredients, dark chocolate and peanuts.  My excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I tasted the bar.  It was very bland and had the same distinct whey protein aftertaste that most of these high protein bars have.  I could not eat an entire bar and my husband refused to eat the remaining claiming it was the worst.  Although I applaud Nature Valley for stepping up with more high protein options, they missed the boat on taste.  There is no dark chocolate or peanut butter flavor in these bars whatsoever.

review/summary: horrid, you can do better
review/text: Although high in protein, these bars lack anything that can be called a pleasurable experience. I eat a lot of different protein bars and I will not buy these again. They are just plain awful. Very little taste and what there is it leaves a terrible after-taste in the mouth. Try one first at the grocery store before buying a 4 pack.

review/summary: I'm sorry but I couldn't finish the can.
review/text: Bumble Bee typically gives the consumer more "bang per buck", at least in sardines.  I'm a budding sardine connoisseur so I decided to try all the brands I could, and not just buy one or two that I liked over and over.<br /><br />So, I picked up a can of these and all I can say is that I must be a spoiled sardine brat because these tasted oily and synthetic, and the sardine meat was a bit greenish rather than the beige and pink color palette that greets me when I open my favorite brands.<br /><br />Now, sardines are a matter of personal taste, and I do respect the Bumble Bee brand, but by all means I recommend buying a can and trying them before you commit to buying in bulk.

review/text: I get these for less than a dollar at Walmart.  I compared them with King Oscar and others from two to three times the cost.  I honestly don't feel that the extra money paid for those is particularly worth it.<br /><br />One minor correction from the description shown above is that it is stated on the can that these have "natural smoke flavoring" and not artificial.  Others including myself like the small bones.<br /><br />Soybean oil is not supposed to be as good for you as olive oil, but that doesn't bother me.

review/summary: Good Snackin Stix
review/text: It took a little getting used to, at least a couple of bites, but it was well worth the effort. There's the obvious difference in shape and size and a slight increase in saltiness, but the Wheat Thin Stix are just as tasty and addictive as their little biscuit cousins. Luckily Mrs. Spudman keeps an eye on my portions; otherwise I could finish up a box of these in one sitting.<br />For those who like to dip their Wheat Thins, the Stix are perfect. This newly shaped Wheat Thin won't break in the thickest of dips and its length precludes getting any dip on the dipper's hand.<br /><br />If you like the Wheat Thin crackers, you'll like the Stix too. The biggest problem with these is knowing when to stop and then doing it.

review/text: My wife is from the Philippines and after moving to the U.S. the only place we could find rice sticks for her favorite dish called pancit involved a drive of 50 minutes to an hour round trip.<br /><br />  After finding them at Amazon we save time and money by buying a larger quanty (rice sticks can be stored for quite awhile) and having spent over 25 dollars we got free shipping. Who could ask for more?<br /><br />  Although we had never tried this particular brand before. We noticed no difference in the quality and it is a product of the Philippines!<br /><br />  Excellent Rice Sticks are excellent!

review/summary: Lowest protein snack on the market
review/text: My dog was in early kidney failure and I was told to keep her protein low as possible.  Most dogs treats that she loved were high in protein.  After searching the supermarket isles I never found one that was very low.  I checked out the Three Dog Bakery and they told me these were the lowest they had which is 4% protein for the vanilla flavored.  After changing her dog food to lower protein, and also her treats she was retested and found to be back in the normal range.  Not to mention, she eats them up!!!!  I think they can also be purchased at Walgreens.

I plan on buying more shortbread in bulk and using this tin to keep it in.

review/text: I love making nut milk!  I'll make nut milk everyday if I could.  Maybe even three or four times a day, but who has energy?  It is just, the best feeling.  When you've worked so hard and want to relax.  There really is nothing as centering as making nut milk.  It makes me feel good knowing I'm making plenty of healthy and low calorie nut milk to drink later.<br /><br />I used a strainer and cheese cloth but it was just to messy.  I searched the internets looking for a solution and found these nut milk bags.  They are great.  The whole process is allot less of a hassle to clean up and it's reusable.  Unlike the cheese cloth.  I can fit the entire bag, nuts and all into a one gallon tupperware and just let it sit.  I wrap the edge of the bag around the rim of the tuppper and put a rubber band around it.  Then loosely put the cover on.  It does everything else.

review/summary: A must have
review/text: This product has taken my juicing experience from so-so to absolutely wonderful! I wish I had purchased one of these years ago when I first started juicing. I bought a Breville Elite juicer but my juice still came out with too much pulp in it. After trying cheesecloth with not much improvement, someone recommended that I try a nut milk bag and it makes my juice just as good as the juice I would buy from one of those high dollar organic juice bars that use commercial sized juicers. My juice is pulp free and just delicious now. My kids also enjoy homemade juices more because the juice isn't pulpy at all. I've only had the nut milk bag a few days, but it seems durable and it's easy to clean. Just flip,rinse, wash and dry - I do it my sink. To dry it, I just roll it up in a kitchen towel and wring it.  I think I'm going to buy another one just to have more than one on hand so that I don't wear the one I have out too quickly.

review/text: I make 3 batches of soymilk every other day (family of 5) and this is so much easier than cheesecloth.  I found that I do not even have to prestrain it before using the nutbag (but I have a SoyQuick soymilk maker, and I think the filter that holds the soybeans helps).  I've also noticed since using this bag, that I do not need to rub off the outer shell on the beans after they have soaked...the bag is so fine, it strains it enough so that it tastes just as good without that extra step.  I am planning on getting a second bag, so that I do not even have to move it between my two containers when I make my 3 batches.  Great buy, and heavy duty! Highly recommend

review/summary: I Never Knew I Needed This So Bad
review/text: I just started making almond milk and I thought I would be all prepared. I had a very highly recommended fine mesh strainer and lots and lots of layers of fine cheesecloth. First it was such a pain to get all the milk out using both methods together, it was very time consuming and I had to do it in stages. I also don't feel like I got every last bit of milk out. Afterwards, my milk was still a bit gritty. So I looked up other solutions and found this product. Used it when it first came on my current bottle of almond milk, and boy did it do a great job. It was so much easier to use, I got so much extra milk out, and the milk after was silky smooth. It was also such a breeze to clean this bag after use. So amazed by this product. It feels really solid and feels like it will last through many uses. Highly recommend this product.

review/text: I have been making almond milk for about 6 months and it has taken me a while to dial-in how to make it the way I like it.  While I was able to get the taste right, I had issues with consistency.  I had been filtering the milk through a jelly strainer bag to some good effect, but what a pain that was.  I decided to try this nut bag on a whim and it cut my workload by half and gave great results.  Now I do one quick pour of the hot milk through the strainer that came with my soy-milk maker and I pour the results into this nut bag and give it a good squeeze.  The holes seem to be just the perfect size for the job.  I am glad I decided to give this product a go.

review/summary: The Best Microwave Popcorn?
review/text: Pop Weaver popcorn is a privately owned family company in Indiana that has been around for over 80  years and is more popular than any other popcorn. They produce roughly 30 percent of the world's popcorn using a specially bred corn. Their hybrid corn is grown on the farmlands of the U.S. and Argentina. They have attempted to make their popcorn as healthy as possible. This whole grain popcorn is gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free, hydrogenated oil-free, trans fats-free, GMO-free (genetically modified organisms), and Kosher certified. Real butter and dairy ingredients are used. Although this popcorn has extra butter, you will not get extremely greasy hands eating this popcorn like some other popcorn brands. A bag of Pop Weaver Microwave Popcorn can be popped in approximately two minutes, and few kernels will go unpopped. This item can be purchased at discount retailers like Wal-Mart for one-fifth the cost and has a shelf life of 18 months. A "Freshest Before" date can be found on each box. I gave this popcorn only three stars because I prefer the old-fashioned taste of popcorn popped in a stovetop kettle. However, if you are a big fan of microwave popcorn, I give this product two thumbs up.

review/text: Yes, I got the product (all 60, I counted) and none of them were melted! This was a concern for other Lindt chocolates ordered online. This may also be because I ordered it in December. It tastes just as I remembered from eating them in-store.<br /><br />Tip though - it is cheaper ordering them online at 0.31 per candy than in-store, EXCEPT during the holiday season. I went to my local CVS during the Christmas season and got those two 5 ounce packages of Lindt chocolates for 5 dollars, 2.50 each. With 12 candies in each, it comes down to 0.21 for each candy. So stock up during the holidays!

review/text: I'm not a big chocolate eater, but these babies are like heaven in your mouth. They are so good when they sit at room temperature and the inside filling is just smooth enough to send your taste buds soaring. Chocolate has got to be the best chocolate I've ever tasted. Be careful because you cannot eat just one.

review/summary: Made in China and my dogs got sick
review/text: Maybe what the box claims is true, no additive, no coloring, etc. However I did not notice it was made in China until I have looked at the bottom tip of the bag. Using tiny font size (more like 6pt), it states the product is made in China. While I appreciate the honesty, I could not trust the quality of the sweet potato itself. And I found that out after feeding a couple of them to my dogs. I am not stating all Chinese products are bad. However, most of produce I have dealt with came with great disappointment. To make matters worse, My two little dogs got sick. I have stopped feeding them and now they are ok. I still have 4 bags left but I plan to throw them away.

review/text: I bought 6 of these in Jan 09. They had an expire date of 2010. I opened up one of the packages and I found two moldy pieces. I didn't want to risk mold in the other packs so I tossed them out. I email Dogswell for a replacement, I asked for a different product and they wouldn't do anything unless I shipped them. Not a huge deal, but really you want to ship back dog treats that were moldy. I use Amazon Prime to save time, not waste it.

review/text: My dog seems to really like them, but the sweet potato gets very, very hard once the bag is opened.  My concern is they are about and inch and half long and do not want to have my dog swallowing something that size and  hardness.  As canines are gulpers, I am concerned.  The same product with the the chicken and apple is much softer.

review/summary: Made in China
review/text: I didn't realize when I bought these that they were made in China.  In fact, I fed them to my dogs until someone looking at the package pointed it out to me.  I'm a little leery of buying dogs treats from China and other developing countries since the melamime incident.  Who knows what oversight there is on the production.  So, now I order *only* Snook's sweet potatoe dog chews from Healthy Happy Pet (through Amazon).  These are organic dried sweet potato chunks made in the US and my dogs **love them**.  I also get Sam's Yams but the Snook's are nice and crunchy.  I got a small bag for my sister's Shih Tzus and they loved them as well.  If Dogswell would find a place in the US to make their products, I'd be willing to buy.  But as long as they are made in China-- won't do it anymore.

review/summary: Stay away
review/text: I will admit at this moment I have no hard data to back up my suspicion, but we have been feeding these to our two dogs, one of whom is diabetic. Due to the fact that the chicken and apple treats boasted such bona fides as "no hormones" and "no antibiotics", we felt good about serving these up.<br /><br />The other day, the diabetic dog began throwing up, and I took her to the vet yesterday. The vet called with the results of the blood work and said the dog's liver enzymes had spiked. She asked me if we were feeding her chicken jerky treats which might be made in China. I knew about the Dogswell treats, but I was certain they weren't of Chinese origin. When I was at the store later, I picked up a package and found to my amazement that they are, in fact, Chinese.<br /><br />The vet will run tests on the remaining treats in the package to see if there is any melamine in the meat, but the change in her liver coincides with her getting these treats. I wouldn't advise anyone feeding these to their dogs without first checking the health of their dog's liver and the chemical composition of the treats.<br /><br />Rated One Star, only because Zero Stars is not an option.

review/text: "Sweet potatoes?! My dog will eat sweet potatoes????"<br /><br />Yes, you may be surprised!!  I've fed my English Bulldog pup more treats than I care to mention and these are his favorite.  An especially a good choice for dogs with allergies!  From a taste standpoint, if he had his way he would eat the whole bag.  This is the closest thing to "scraps" that I've intentionally fed my dog.  From a health standpoint, bullies are know for their skin problems.  Kingston's coat is very shiny and his eyes and nails look great, too.  Due to his breed's susceptibility to hip dysplasia I also plan to try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F9AHN0">Dogswell Veggie Life Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews Dog Treats (15 oz.)</a>.  But with 6 bags, each holding 10- 15 treats, this has lasted me a while.  RECOMMENDED!!!

review/text: I have two 13-20 pound dogs (Yorkie-Poodle and Chihuahua-Doxie mixes) and these treats are perfect for their size.  The look and smell like dehydrated apricot with banana.  If I didn't know they were dog food, I could be fooled.<br /><br />The only thing that wasn't mentioned in the description is the place of manufacturing.  I would feel more comfortable with their claim of "natural" and "healthy" if I knew where they were made.<br /><br />Edit:  Once you open the package, you should put them in the refrigerator, as a previous reviewer stated.  I found that one of the pieces had gone bad (which, in turn, shows that they have very few preservatives).

My dog has had the biggest variety of treats but the only ones she will jump and whine for are these Dogswell chicken treats. She gets the chicken breast strips during her daily brushing, and then the chicken/sweet potato or chicken/banana ones whenever she is being left at home by herself. She loves them all. The sweet potato doesn't need to be refrigerated but the banana does. All retail stores sell these packages for at least $16.99-$19.99; Amazon.com offers a truly unbeatable price!

review/summary: My dogs go crazy for yams!
review/text: I have 2 pomeranians who go absolutely bonkers for these treats.  You would think they have some sort of meat in them!  They are hard, but they are meant to be a rawhide alternative, meaning, the dogs are supposed to gnaw on them!  We started with these because I read the oldest dog in the the world (who has since passed) ate Dogswell treats.  We started with the Chicken Vitality Treats, but have since found out that one of our Poms has allergies to chicken.  These are amazing and my dogs cannot get enough.  I love the price on amazon and the delivery is SUPER quick.

review/text: My 9 year old llasa apso is so picky with her treats.  I buy many different kinds of treats and she just won't go near them so I have been donating them to the Humane Society up the street.  However, once I bought 1 bag of these sweet potato and chicken treats about 3 months ago while I was in Houston ,TX and brought them home and she just loved them! The price is great for 6 bags and free shipping.  I will be ordering from here for a long time.  Thanks again!!

review/text: I found this product first at my local Target.  I was totally grossed out by the animal parts on display as I looked for a treat for my Pomeranian.  When I found these I was thrilled but not as thrilled as my dog when I gave her one!  She loves them and runs to the drawer I keep them in when asked if she wants a sweet potato!  The next time I tried to purchase them, Target no longer carried them.  Amazon to the rescue!

review/text: I was thrilled to find these for our three labs.  Sweet potatos are packed with tons of vitamins and good fiber.  The pups loved them and I would rather they have these as treats than Milkbones any day of the week.  As with introducing anything new into your dog's diet, expect some not-so-sweet potato gas from your dog.

review/text: I bought the sweet potato snacks on a whim at Target.  Our beagle LOVED them.  To the person who commented that the potato gets tough, they are supposed to be that way.  Raw hide bones, pig's ears, etc. are much tougher and dogs don't choke on those either.  Your dog won't choke unless it is a toy breed in which case you should consult with your vet about what treats they should not have.  The toughness of the snacks is actually great since they take a while to eat and our beagle doesn't scarf one down in two seconds.  Also, it's nice that they don't have artificial coloring or preservatives.  I'm buying them in bulk now that I see Amazon carries all the flavors!

review/summary: She Eats 'Em
review/text: A picky 14# Westie likes 'em so much she ripped open a bag by herself and ate it all!<br /><br />I like to cut up a piece and stuff it in her Kong... make her work a little bit if she wants it.  (Keeps her occupied and away from me too especially when she is being her attention hogging self.)<br /><br />I like the ingredients, all natural, although I am not expecting this product to give her much of "vitality" or "healthy hips" (Vitamin and supplements are just way to low a dosage to do any good really.)<br /><br />It does feel pretty moist, and if she didn't rip open the last bag and ate it all, it probably would go rancid pretty quickly.  I also recommend refridgerating after opening.

review/text: All 3 of my dogs really enjoy these sweet potato chews. It doesn't take them very long to chew them up, though.  Still a better alternative to rawhides, and certainly better for them.  There are different sizes in each bag, from about 2" x 1" to 1/2" x 1/2".  There are about 9 to 12 pieces in each bag.  Some pieces can be broken in half, to accommodate smaller dogs. I do recommend these treats.

review/text: These sweet potato chews are perfect for my dog. She has extreme food allergies and they are one of only 3 treats she can eat that I've ever found. They're very expensive in stores, so I was overjoyed to find them available on Amazon. Not only are they mega-cheaper here, BUT if you order them on the auto-delivery program, they're even less! Plus, it's been so hard to find them where I live, that it's great to have them delivered to my door. The only problem is, my doggie loves them so much that I had to increase the frequency of my order, LOL. I like it that they're really good for her too with no chemicals or weird ingredients, and they're made right here in the USA.

When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as "MADE IN CHINA". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!<br />I had to throw out all the Dogswell products I purchased, Shame on Amazon for selling without disclosing the source!
