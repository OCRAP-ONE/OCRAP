review/summary: Happy Dog
review/text: I received a free sample of Science Diet for our Papillon as  part of a Bzz Agent.  I was a little hesitant to try it because I had heard some stories from others who used it and were too happy. We tried it out and our dog is very happy. With her old dog food we would feed her in the morning and she wouldn't never want to eat until later in the day. Now since we have  switched she is real excited when we are getting the food out, she eats it right away.

review/summary: Vet recommended diet food
review/text: My dog is sick and on prednisone.  The vet recommended this food because of weight gain from the prednisone.  My Yorkie Loved it! I was really surprised.  He eats every bite.  It's really tiny pieces so its easy for a tiny dog to eat.  I mixed a bit of his old food with it at first and gradually lower the amount of his older food.  Now he is just eating this food. That way there's no stomach upset from drastically changing his diet. I would definitely recommend this food for weight loss and it was neurology vet approved.

review/summary: My cats think they are okay
review/text: When I first got these, all 4 of my cats FREAKED over them. Now, they don't seem as excited about them but they do eat them. I don't know if I will purchase them again after this bag is gone, I would rather have some treats that help with tarter control.

review/summary: Great if you like treats for home decorations rather than food
review/text: I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 5-20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether, and walked AWAY when i got out the treats.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.

review/summary: Absolutely THE BEST chocolate you can buy
review/text: Headline:  Once you try them, nothing else will compare.<br />They may seem a bit expensive, but they use quality ingredients.  Also, it doesn't seem that much when you compare the cost to a per-piece price of a box of G***** or another quality brand.<br />I worked at a company that owned a chocolate company.  I lived in Switzerland, the UK, and other places who lay claims to having the best chocolate.  Ice Cubes have been around at least 35 years, because I can remember having them as a kid, and I've never tried anything that compares.<br />I would like to be able to buy less than 120 at a time, and think more people would give them a try if that was possible.<br />One tip from my friend:  when you have a piece you won't want to talk or be distracted by doing anything else;  you may just want to concentrate on enjoying the taste!

review/summary: A Bit of a Disappointment!
review/text: I really looked forward to getting and using this tomato paste - I envisioned a paste that didn't have the usual overcooked and slightly bitter quality of canned paste, and one that had a nice concentrated quality that allowed it to be used in the same ways a cook uses regular tomato paste, but with the promised good taste of this product.  However, I was disappointed in my uses of this product, in that it was not as concentrated as I expected it to be, and therefore had to be used in larger quantities that I wanted to use.  Yes, its taste is better than a traditional canned tomato paste, but again I was finding that I had to often use more of this to get the flavor impact I wanted - and at this price, I don't think you should have to use a quarter to a third of a tube each time you put this product to use.<br /><br />I'm going to next get some oil based sun dried tomatoes, and use them to create my own concentrated paste - I may also be disappointed with the result of that experiment, but something tells me it will prove to be a success.

review/summary: Amore Sun Dried Tomato Paste
review/text: Just love this. I have been using it for several years. After having a very hard time finding this in any local supermarket, and then finding the price well over $5.00 per tube, this deal on Amazon was just great.<br /><br />Amore Sun Dried Tomato Paste has a lot of that deep sun dried tomato flavor in a paste form. Very concentrated. You really only need a small amount to add to pastas, sauces, pizza. Great if you add to cream cheese with a little garlic powder, touch of salt for a lovely cheese spread. I make squash and use this as a base to add just that perfect amount of extra flavor to my dish!<br /><br />The 6 tube deal including shipping is a great one!! I am going to see how long it takes me to go through these 6 tubes and then possibly add myself on to the auto ship list. That drives down the price even further. Thank you Amazon for adding this to your list of available items!!

So even though I'd never tried coconut sugar before, I was intrigued about how it tasted.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, as it tastes like a mild brown sugar, and most importantly I don't feel a sugar spike after eating it.<br /><br />I've put it in my organic coffee (yummy!), and cooking with it seems to work just fine (the company says to use it 1 to 1 as a replacement for sugar in recipes).<br /><br />I like that this company uses the profits to support the economy of small farmers in Indonesia. Good karma and great taste!<br />Recommended!

It's not maple syrup and does not pretend to be.<br />At a ticket price of under 5 bucks, it's a more affordable and MOST natural product of its kind. Not everyone can afford 15 bucks for maple syrup.<br />My family has been using this table syrup for as long as it's been available.

review/text: My older recently adopted greyhound was diagonosed with stage-4 peridontal disease and had several teeth removed.  As part of her dental care I purchased C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews.  They help with the tarter control, she likes chewing them and her breath smells nice. I bought the large dog size and ended up cutting them in half only because Mattie had difficulty chewing them due to lack of pre-molars, (tip-cut the large size in half rather than buying a smaller size, now I have 60-chews.  I had to use tin snips). The product arrived as stated and in excellent condition.  Really good price compared to stores or vet offices.  I will be buying more chews.  A happy repeat customer.

review/summary: These are worth an "8 ears up" rating, almost.
review/text: All four of my dogs, ranging in size from 30 lbs to 85 lbs absolutely love these.  As soon as they hear the crinkly sound of the package they come, sit, and intently watch me with all their ears up and alert (the 8 ears up rating) until they get their chews and then go off to enjoy them.  From the dog's point of view, they're perfect.<br /><br />From my ponit of view, and the reason for deducting a star, is the price for the benefit.  These cost more than ordinary chews and I'm not sure they are any healthier for their teeth and gums than the plain rawhide chews.  One of my dogs is prone to gum disease and often has bad breath, if these worked as advertised, her gums would be healthier and bad breath should be eliminated by the enzyme action.  I've tried giving the dogs nothing but this brand of chews for over a month and there was no detectable improvement.  I'll still be using one bag per month of these in hopes that there really is a benefit, but the bulk of their chew treats will be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZF06JI">Green Cow Rawhide Dog Bones, Natural Chips, 5-Pound Bag</a> because of the cost savings.

review/summary: What Can I Say - The Dog is Wild for These Chews!!
review/text: These chews have been a staple for us for about 8 years.  Our Tibetan Terrier would be miserable without them.  He gets one each evening and it is ceremonial.  When this ultimate treat is given, he takes it and goes off racing around the house.  Still doing it at the ripe age of 12! His enthusiasm hasn't diminished even one bit in 8 years - its amazing.  I have often wondered what the heck they have in these chews - but I am just glad to see him sooooo happy each evening when he receives it.<br /><br />Oh....I almost forgot....the other tangible thing is that his doggy breath is decent and his teeth are in very good health - so I guess the enzymatic nature of the chews is working!

review/text: My dog loves these. He is able to finish it, so we have no pieces of rawhide lying around. He can usually chew it completely so I do not worry about him having an intestinal blockage from the rawhide. They do not have an offensive odor, and they do not stain the carpet. I don't see any real benefit to his teeth though.

review/summary: Awesome product!!
review/text: My 11-year old Akita's teeth sparkled after 2 weeks of use.  She chews it for at least 10 minutes.  She breaks part of it off, softens it with her saliva and then swallows it with ease.  No more doggy breath and her teeth looks amazing!  I read how other dogs choke on it, but mine did not have a problem.  I suspect those other dogs were not used to chewing on things like rawhide so they don't know how to chew it to soften it up, then swallow. They probably try to swallow it whole or in parts (not a good idea).

Buy the big ones. they provide more chew time.

review/text: Sara has been a user for most of her adult life(seven years). Her meals are not complete until she has her chewie. We have been happy with her contentment until recently when the quality of the product deteriorated. The length of each item seems smaller than before and many in each bag are sorry looking pieces that, as a QC inspector, I would have rejected. We buy by pieces so it is also a matter of getting what we pay for.<br /><br />Hope this reaches the manufacturer and it makes changes. It is unfortunate that a good product is allowed to go downhill.<br /><br />Good news is that Sara has NEVER had cause for any dental treatment.<br /><br />Gerry Hosking<br /><br />4/21/11  Recently the Amazon price was raised from $11.43 to, currently, over $16. There are others<br />out there selling for less but how does the price rise that much in a few weeks?

review/text: This is one of the most affordable dental chews I found. Greenies are good but a bit too expensive (less tasty as well). My dutch shepherd 55LB also got choked while chewing it, exactly like the previous reviewer's Lab. Maybe it's too tasty that they try to swallow the whole thing. I found a good remedy for it--I usually soak a piece in water for 5-10 minutes. It gets softened but not that soft. This will eliminate the choking. It works at least for my dog.

I orginally purchased the beef flavored but opted for these because the flavored have an odor.

They don't even look up when I shut the door...just happily chewing away.  I definitely think it helps clean their teeth too. My dogs LOVE this product and it's definitely a good price (about $5 cheaper per bag than at the vet.)

review/summary: Hygiene Chews Work
review/text: These chews were recommended by my vet and I found they removed remarkably well what looked like stains. They aren't perfect but my dog is 12. I got twice the quantity on Amazon for the same price as I paid at the vet's. I do not like raw hides but these seem to have been well digested

review/summary: CETs for easier dental maintenance
review/text: Who would have thought that my dogs would enjoy something that helps take care of them? The CETs work reasonably well at removing plaque from their teeth - though if you are expecting heavy buildup to disappear you will be disappointed.  Good way to maintain good oral hygiene between cleanings though.<br /><br />If only I could get them to chew them longer...

review/text: My vet recommended these chewies because i'm so awful about brushing my dogs teeth.  These treats are amazing.  I have been giving my two Bearded Collies these once a day for the past 4 months and their teeth look great and their breath is so much better.  They just love them and it usually takes about 20 minutes to a half hour for the dogs to chew them all up.  I will continue to buy these and the Amazon price is fantastic.

review/text: These chews were recommended by our vet and our dog loves them.  Our dog is a lab and as such, my husband is training her to retrieve things. He'll smear peanut butter on the chew and hide it in the backyard for her to find with her nose.  It works everytime.  Good stuff.

review/summary: Oral Hygiene Dog Chews
review/text: Our vet recommended these chews for our standard poodle; we bought our first bag from them. Amazon's price is much better than we paid at our vet's office. Our dog LOVES these chews, and they never upset his stomach. His teeth look much whiter; they really help with tartar buildup. At the vet's recommendation, I cut them in half. They still work great and last twice as long.

review/summary: Excellent product!!!
review/text: I love this product. More importantly my dog loves it.  He is definitely a chewer so this helps his teeth, he loves the taste, and it satifies his urge to chew.  As with any product..please know your dog.  If your dog does not chew this product and just gulps it down, then it won't be beneficial to his oral care.  Also, as with ANY product that can be chewed or ingested, please monitor your pet while they are eating/chewing this product.  Overall this is a great product, I will continue to order it for my dog.  This product does not replace routine dental care, but it is part of a dental care routine.  The reason I sound so "informercial" is becasue I actually work in the animal care field.  The practice that I used to work for stopped carrying this brand and switched to a cheaper brand. ICK.  I hate it.  So now I just go online to find the real CET chews.  Don't accept a poor substitute.  Especially those cheap ones sold over the counter in places like Walmart or grocery stores.  All rawhide like chews are NOT the same.

review/summary: Keep Your Dog's Teeth Cleaner
review/text: Our vet first introduced us to this very excellent chew for our three dogs.  Her price for a bag was (as far as we were concerned) too high.  But on Amazon we found the best price on the net, so our dogs have a treat they love (given to them after their meal), we pay a price we think is reasonable, and their teeth and mouths are better for it.

review/text: This is a really great price for these chew sticks. My dog absolutely loves them... He sits in front of the cabinet we keep them in every night after we settle in and waits for us to give him one... Our vet says they are great for his teeth. The only thing I don't like is that he tends to swallow them whole, and they sit at the back of his throat. Not sure if that is just my pooch, but we never give them to him if he's is going to be alone.

review/summary: CET Chews are grrrreat!
review/text: Our vet stocks these dog chews and we found our dogs loved them.  The vet charges way too much (because everyone needs to make a profit), so I searched the net and found that Amazon carries them for far less.  Even with shipping!  These chews are not rough (as so many bought in the store are), enzymes have been made a part of what the dog chews, and they come in varying thicknesses within each package.  We have three dogs with individual chewing preferences (a retriever's teeth are far different from an Aussie's, in our case) and each bag has plenty for all our dogs.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Daisy the Yellow Dog takes care of her teeth--
review/text: My buddy (some prudes would say "my master" but my guy is just another big dog to me) bought these chews for me.  We have long walks and long talks and both have better days.  He scratches my ears and that really itchy spot just in front of my tail.  I wag my tail and sleep beside his bed.<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't buy the C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews, he did.  I really like them!  I cannot wait to get one every morning.  I jump and whine and wag and do everything I can to let him know how great they are.  My doctor says my teeth and gums are better because I get them.  Personally, I would rate them as "four paws up!"<br /><br />Thanks for asking.  If you ever get near the Oregon Coast, look me up.  I will take you for a run on the beach.<br /><br />Daisy

review/text: I have two German Shepherds, 8 years old. Every morning I give them each a CET Chew, which they enjoy. Their teeth are sparkling white, and their gums are healthy, which eliminates the need for costly dental cleaning and the dangerous anesthesia.

review/summary: Good Quality Dog Chews
review/text: I don't buy anything that isn't in a sealed bag for my dog, and I won't give her raw hide that is bleached white and hard as a rock.  This stuff comes in wide, but thin pieces that she can easily grasp with her paws and eat in one sitting.  I like the fact that there isn't a lot of bulk, so that it works more for her teeth than as a snack.  She will generally reject other raw hide, but likes these quite well.  They are worth the extra money.

review/summary: CET Dog Chews
review/text: The CET dog chews for large dogs are getting smaller every time we have ordered lately. The intent is for the dog to take his time chewing the larger chews., but they are done with them almost immediately. The Petite chews are always good for small dogs and the same size each time.
