review/summary: I never thought I would like something like this.....
review/text: ....but I was WRONG. Wow! I am normally just a plain old soap kind of guy. I don't really care much for anything too smelly, and the body washes I have tried (received as a gift or used in a resort) have left me feeling that I would never want to try a body wash. Either I got hives (yes, that happened with H20 brand), or it just left a film. Well, Dove Men + Care is a different story. It smells good, not just nice, but really good....and my wife likes it, too, she said, "It has a manly smell." I'm not sure what that means, but it was said in a positive way, so that's good with me. It also rinses off easily, and my skin did actually feel softer without feeling filmy. As for the "smell," it's a crisp aroma, not musky and not woodsy. If you can imagine what "clean" ice would smell like (if there were such a thing), that is as close as I can get. It is not an overpowering aroma at all. Lastly, the container is perfect. It stands upside down very nicely and allows gravity to keep it at the dispensing end, which is great. As for value, well, I believe there is some value here. Each of these are fairly large, and should last for a while, so for the price, you are getting quite a lot. All-in-all, this is a winner!

review/summary: Great texture, Nasty smell
review/text: I love the smooth yet granular feel of this body wash. I do feel like it cleans well and I haven't had any of the negative reactions to it that others here have. What I dislike most about the product is that is really doesn't smell good, in my opinion. The fragrance is Old Spice-ish and I just don't like it. I feel like the fragrance is too chemically strong. The first time I used it I though, "I'd better not strike a match right after using the product" because literally it feels like you're covered in chemicals.

review/summary: Maybe I should wait a bit before reviewing this...
review/text: I've been using for a few days now and I don't really have any complaints about this product.  I have sensitive skin (have always had it) and so I'm always weary about how different products are going to affect my skin (positively or negatively) but I haven't had the issues that some of the other reviewers have had.  My skin has not broken out after use, and my skin does not feel dry at all, in fact with all this cold weather we've been having, my face especially feels better than it has in a while.  Like others have mentioned (even when complaining about other things), the soap lathers up great, washes off easily, cleanses nicely with the grains and it smells nice (nothing spectacular thought).<br /><br />I do have an issue with the chemical contents, but I have yet to see any adverse reactions to me or my family (and like one reviewer, I have a young daughter, but she hasn't broken out from exposure).  If something like this happens anytime soon, I'll be sure to amend my review with a cautionary blurp.<br /><br />One minor issue with the bottle itself is the cap.  It isn't the easiest to open when you're wet or cramped in the shower.  It doesn't have an easily `poppable' cap.  Like I said, minor issue.<br /><br />Like the other reviewers, I have always been a fan of Dove (sounds weird to say that I am a fan of soap, but they make good products and are really the only supplier of soap to our home).  At this point I'd recommend this, based on my own experience, but I'd also take into consideration the other reviews because every situation is different, and I may be singing a different song in a week or two.<br /><br />For now, I'm happy.

review/summary: Too drying
review/text: Dove Men+Care Deep Clean with Purifying Grains is one of those total body washes that is supposed to do everything except wash hair.  I have used other Dove bar soaps and found them to be fairly good at moisturizing the skin but not this product.  It tended to be too drying on my face.  That makes me not recommend this for anything but the body and even there it still strips out too much moisture.  If your skin isn't sensitive this maybe alright, but with all the patent filled ingredients inside it just isn't the claimed "total skin comfort."  On the positive side its' scent isn't overpowering but this isn't something that would make me buy it very often or at all.  Not recommended for any sensitive skin types.

review/summary: Miracle...READ
review/text: The simplicity of this product! These days skincare products are jam-packed with different ingredients to add this benifit or that benefit to your skin (you name it), BUT those ingredients really don't make a difference. While this product does have a scent and I don't know about the micromoisture effect it claims (might need to work on the labeling), it does one thing phenomenally well; cleanse your skin without overdrying it.<br /><br />Okay there are some game changers...Vitamin A (Retinol or Retinyl Palmitate) can effectively speed cell turnover. Glycolic Acid and Salicylic Acid are Beta Hydroxy Acids that increase cell turnover too (exoliating by penetrating the skin). So there are those active ingredients which promote exfoliation...BUT the reality is you don't really need to have that flaky dry, plastered feeling everytime you want to cleanse. Everyone wants a scrub or deep clean "rich" lather. BUT that is what's wrong with 100% of face washes out there. You are simply damaging the outer surface of your skin and breaking down it's defense barrier similar to using an imbalanced PH product (Sebamed scientifically proved that). The answer all lies within one ingredient, one that Sebamed never discovered. One we've been told never to use!<br /><br />Petrolatum. Unlike other emollients like alcohol derived ingredients (glycerin, glycol etc), Petrolatum doesn't sink into your skin it only sits on top protecting your skin. In a wash the Petrolatum keeps detergents like SLS from penetrating and damaging your skin's hydrating lipid barrier. As a result you have clean skin that has remained well hydrated due to the fact that all of the water, chemicals like chlorine, air pollution, and harmful UV rays have not penetrated your skin. It doesn't make much difference how much bottled water you drink if you take 2 showers a day in chemicals. Your skin is your largest organ and it absorbs too many bad things already. Protect it! Makes sense right!!!! FINALLY A SKINCARE COMPANY FIGURED IT OUT...EUREKA! (I'm not talking bout the vaccum) YOU DON'T NEED TO USE "NATURAL" OILS which aren't natural because they aren't naturally part of your skin (with the exception of squalane, still wouldn't be natural unless it was already there). They make 1)people break out 2) sticky skin 3) unbearable shine. And as for all of those moisturizers what's actually beneficial about them? You are just trying to draw moisture out of the air and into your skin making it HEAVY and WET that is GROSS and definately going to have a DRYING EFFECT on your skin over the long run! Take charge! Simplify your life and beautify your skin by not destroying it.

review/summary: Good but not moisturizing enough
review/text: Knowing this is Dove for Men I had to compare the ingredients with Dove. And lo and behold the ingredients differ, but not in a good way. What I noticed is that one of the first ingredients is a "sodium lauryl sulfate" which is used for foaming. Unfortunately it does this at the expense for moisturizing. Dove is supposed to be moisturizing - remember those commercials bragging about 1/4 moisturizing. Yeah not so in this case. But I guess for men means you just want a good scent. Well at least it has a masculine scent.<br /><br />I much prefer the Neutrogena exfoliating body scrub. It has a masculine scent, provides moisture and exfoliates.<br /><br />But I digress. The Dove for men line is ok, good for those who don't care for moisture and appreciate a good scent (Axe anyone)?<br /><br />3 out of 5 stars for the scent and suds.

review/summary: Smells nice, but leaves you dirty
review/text: I'm typically a bar soap kind of guy, Irish Spring or Dial depending on the day. I got some of this to try though and I was pretty stoked. It smelled all manly and stuff; my girlfriend seemed to enjoy the scent as well.<br /><br />Let's just say the enjoyment didn't last long. This junk makes me feel like I have a film on me when I leave the shower. I figure it's all moisturizing or whatever, so that was ignored. What bugs me though, is that I can't make it past 5pm without feeling completely disgusting. My taint gets all tainty and before I know it, my day is ruined and I still have 5 hours to go. I could take another shower, but I'm a busy guy.<br /><br />Here's to switching back to bar soap. I feel clean all day and smell clean, not manly, but at least clean. That's enough for me, I'll wear cologne if I want to smell like what society has deemed 'manly'.<br /><br />Summation: This stuff leaves you gross and dirty. Major Fail.

review/summary: Slight discount, Great product
review/text: This body wash was recommended to me by my dermatologist - as part of a regiment for both acne and eczema. Now, I can see why it was recommended. By far, this is the best body wash I've ever used. I've tried many brands - Old Spice, Axe, plain Dove bar soap. All over dried my skin or irritated. This one doesn't, and also hasn't caused any breakouts, and hydrates my skin. Thanks in part to this body wash my skin is in amazing condition.<br /><br />This pack was only slightly discounted as compared to buying in store, but with shipping options and other items bought at the same time it was a steal. I can only ever find this size bottle at Target; with 'Subscribe and Save' discount on top of a dollar discount coupon from Amazon, this was a steal.<br /><br />Quality outer box and quality sealed plastic in side...almost seems wasteful to double package...but regardless, quality in every department.

review/text: I received one bottle of this stuff awhile back and have been using in consistently for weeks. I'm not impressed. I don't see any change in my skin moisture wise and no real reason to buy this product. It seems to perform no better or no worse than any product I would have bought using a coupon for whatever is on special down at the store.<br /><br />For grins, my wife used it a number of times as well and saw no difference either.<br /><br />So, if you have a coupon and it is on special, go for it. The scent is little strong, but not bad and it will foam up well and get you clean. It just isn't any better at moisturizing than anything else out there.

review/summary: Soap is Soap, Nothing Special
review/text: The soap cleaned my body without irritation, so I guess it did it's job.  But I expected more from a product that costs more than my Suave shampoo ($1.47/bottle).  I just don't see the point in spending more on a product that does the same thing.  It didn't do it any better, and it didn't smell better (in fact, I like the variety of scents that Suave offers).  But it did the job and it isn't a ton more, so I only took off one star for not living up to my expectations.  I think this product hooks people on the idea that it is just for men, like it's some sort of secret club or something.  Soap is soap, if a woman uses this product she'll get the same results.  I don't know, it just seems like false advertising to play on people's insecurities.  Perhaps I'm just in a cynical mood...

review/summary: Same gooey stuff, a manlier smell
review/text: Here's the short review: It has a decent scent, more manly than the creamy, sweeter smell of regular Dove body wash. If you're looking for body wash to maybe give you a bit more moisturizing effect, then this is a decent choice.<br /><br />But I think I still prefer a good old bar of deodorant soap. It's simpler and, well, cleaner. It doesn't leave a slippery feel on the tub floor like most body washes do. And most deodorant soaps give a fresher smell and wash off more thoroughly.<br /><br />I'll keep using it for a while and see if it gets better than this, otherwise I'll just stick with a mediocre 3 star rating.

review/summary: It's Soap, I'm Clean, and It Makes My Skin Feel Nice
review/text: As I get a bit older, my skin does not seem to hold up so well to the cold dry winters anymore.  Since I hit my 30's, I usually use Dove Moisturizing Body Wash (if you are like me, I refer it to Dove in the white bottle) and to be honest, I have had lackluster results with it.  It helps quite a bit, but it never seemed to do a great job of moisturizing.<br /><br />I agreed to try Dove Men + Care (I guess this will be dubbed Dove gray) and to be honest, expected similar results.<br /><br />After using it for a few days, I have to say my skin does feel better than with the standard Dove in the white bottle.  The dry, burning, itchiness feeling I get in winter really seems to have diminished.<br /><br />The scent that it leaves behind is pretty long lasting and is what I would describe as a musky scent.  Strangely, what my skin smells like after I wash and what the soap smells like in the bottle do not seem to have the same scent to me.  My wife calls the scent nice (she is the most important judge after all), but I thought it was just so-so.  The scent is not bad and is nothing I would find embarrassing, I just was not overly impressed by it.  I do like the fact that the scent lasts a lot longer than other body washes I use.  I think it lasts quite a bit longer than Old Spice High Endurance body wash.<br /><br />Also to me a big improvement over Dove white is the lather.  The Dove in the white bottle does not have a great lather, but Dove Men + Care is easy to lather up in a pouf and a little soap seems to go a long way.<br /><br />The only thing I really did not like about the product was the name.  Minor point, but I think Dove Men + Care is too wordy.<br /><br />Overall, I do like how this makes my skin feel after only a few days.  Most likely, this will be my new "winter" body wash as I really did like how it makes my skin feel.

review/summary: Like the fragrance and how it includes exfoliation to the body wash
review/text: As a guy who tries various types of body wash, what's important for me is price, volume and exfoliating properties.  Dove's latest Care Deep Clean Body Wash for men features a good fragrance, not so overpowering.  Also, a clean body wash from a reputable brand.<br /><br />Opening for the bottle is at the bottom and didn't experience any of the body washing running out.  You also get a lot for 18-ounces.  Also, it does include the exfoliating particles that is important, in my opinion for a body wash.<br /><br />Overall, it does the job, smells great and it all comes down to price. If you see a good deal for the pack of three or individual, definitely give it a try!

review/summary: WHY must you add all these chemicals? Not safe to use around my infant
review/text: Ok - I have historically liked Dove products. This is a body wash specifically for men. It seemed to work great after the first use (though I'm still not sure what "micromoisture" is).<br /><br />Problem is, after using it, it made my child's face break out. (No, I didn't use it on her). After touching her face to mine, the chemicals must have transferred.<br /><br />I normally read ALL ingredients of everything I use (laundry detergent, soaps, hand soaps, etc). But this was a new product, it was by Dove (I assumed they had higher standards), and I only tested it on a small area (my face & upper body).<br /><br />I'm so confused because Dove is the company that advertised gentle formula, pure ingredients, etc. But why are there so many malicious chemicals included in this product?<br /><br />* DIOXANE is a known chemical carcinogen (aka Sodium Laureth Sulfate, the first ingredient here)<br /><br />* PETROCHEMICALS petrolatum (second ingredient), derived from crude oil. As you would expect, it fills in your pores and doesn't allow skin to breathe.<br /><br />* ACRYLATE COPOLYMER is a synthetic polymer (plastic) which also comes from crude oil - highly processed, creates toxic by-products.<br /><br />* COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE  - known to irritate the skin, and cause allergic reactions in some people.<br /><br />* FRAGRANCE - sounds simple, but perhaps the most dangerous ingredient here. Due to deregulation, they are not legally bound to tell us what's really in it! Almost always contain phthalates,  chemicals commonly used to stabilize shampoos and liquid soaps, But they are "endocrine disrupters" which mimic hormones and may alter genital development, especially in little boys! When put in the lakes or streams, this chemical will cause male frogs and salamanders to turn into females!<br /><br />* POLYETHYLENE - also a Dioxane.<br /><br />* DMDM Hydantoin - preservatives that have the potential to release formaldehyde in very small amounts. Causes contact dermatitis, perhaps what caused the rash in my daughter's face after touching my skin.<br /><br />Simply put, it's RIDICULOUS that something as simple as soap contains KNOWN cancer-causing chemicals, and other insane chemicals that aren't safe!! And, why are we the only industrialized country in the world without laws to protect consumers and children?<br /><br />Many products, including some top-selling Johnson & Johnson products, are banned in Europe because of unsafe ingredients ... but shouldn't we have the highest standards of everybody? Why do we have the ~lowest~ standards?<br /><br />And, isn't it ridiculous that something as simple as soap is so politicized? Unilever (owns Dove & Axe), Proctor & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson each donate millions of dollars to politicians so they can continue putting unsafe ingredients in our products. Thank God we have politicians (on both sides of the aisle) to take their money and look the other way.<br /><br />Dove, please clean up your act.

review/summary: UPDATED::it is the real deal now
review/text: ::::::UPDATED 9/8/2012:::::::: No longer fake solution being used. Real thick solution now::::::::Read below original comment.<br /><br />The 3 pack of Dove for Men Liquid Soap was opened already and was far more liquidy then the store bought brand. Normally this soap is much thicker, but the soap available on Amazon seems to have a thinner viscosity(like someone added water to it). It's like someone took 1-2 bottles and added water to them to make them fit into 3 bottles. The 3 pack I received had Skotch clear tape holding the lids on and I believe if this wasn't on the thin formula that Amazon provides of this Soap would more than likely leak out if this wasn't done. This soap isn't cheap and the 3 pack sounds like a deal, but when you get it you'll realize why. By buying it on Amazon you save some money, but your getting screwed since the soap is not the original Dove for Men formula, but instead a much more watered down version of this soap. A real disappointment!<br /><br />:::::UPDATE::: After running out of the water downed Dove for Men 3 pack I had, I decided to give Amazon one more try.  Since a year has passed and the price is amazing, I figured I'd see if the solution was still a problem and I can gladly say it's now the real thing. The Dove for Men solution they are now using is the same thick solution you can find in stores. Thanks for fixing this Amazon.

But, this cleanser is a body AND face cleanser and personally I just don't like the feel of the grains on my face.  Putting aside the issue of the grains, I really do like the product.  It is a pretty luxurious detergent with obvious moisturizers that feel nice on the body.  It has a very pleasant smell and rinses well.  I feel very CLEAN after using this wash.  I only wish they  (and maybe they will) offered a "grain free" version of this cleanser.  I would buy it.  And if the little grains don't bother you then this is a top drawer product, for sure.

(All Dove Men+Care Body Wash products contain petrolatum.)<br /><br />I strongly recommend sticking to Dove Men+Care soap. From my knowledge, those are petrolatum free.<br />If you are not a soap person, I recommend giving Irish Spring Moisture Blast a try. That's one of my favorites.<br />Gillette is also a good brand as well.<br /><br />Once again, Dove Men+Care is only a good brand when it comes to soap.

review/text: Tried it a few times now and not thrilled. A bit harsh, fragrance is on the strong side, doesn't lather well, grainy and too many chemicals for a soap. Skin had a rash look afterwards for awhile. Gillette is much better in my opinion, in every way. Would not purchase this on my own.

review/summary: Nice fragrance, gentle body wash, questionable ingredients
review/text: So far, I have mixed feelings about this product. I don't find that it is overly gritty as some other reviewers have stated. In fact, I've used it on my face a time or two and didn't think it was that harsh. The fragrance is nice but not something I would want to linger and fortunately it doesn't. It does leave you with a clean, refreshing feeling. The chemical ingredients are alarming and for that reason alone, I'm not sure if I would purchase it.

review/summary: Finally, a great body wash for men
review/text: The first thing I noticed was the fresh musky scent. It was refreshing but not overpowering. The viscosity of the body wash was thinner than what I'm used to, but it lathers up nicely even without using a scrubber. The microbeads aren't large enough to feel like sand in your eyes or be large enough to hurt your feet when you step on them. However, I still don't recommend getting any of the wash into your eyes as it will sting!<br /><br />The wash was easy to use and it rinses off without leaving a greasy feeling, yet it does not leave a dry feeling either.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to use, great scent that isn't overpowering, cleans very effectively<br /><br />Cons: None<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars

review/summary: Great body wash!
review/text: The most appealing aspect of Men+Care Clean Comfort Body Wash for me is that it manages to avoid the Old Spice/Brylcreme definitions for men's products without sliding down the metrosexual path.  It has a very agreeable scent that I like, and one that met with compliments (or more importantly, a lack of "what is that..." type) comments from my lovely wife.<br /><br />I've used body washes that produced more lather, however this one just might be the best moisturizing soap I've used.  Perhaps there is something to the "micromoisture" technology, though I tend to look askance at newly coined phrases like that.<br /><br />Cheapskate so and so that I am, I appreciate the design of the bottle.  It's flat on the cap, so that you can always open it from the bottom without having to flail about to get those last few drops of soap.  Also, you don't have to worry about it falling off the shelf mid-shower, because the bottle's center of gravity has been disrupted by turning it upside down.<br /><br />Nice job Dove!  I'll be using this for a long time to come.

review/summary: A body wash you won't have to turn in your man card for.
review/text: Soap is soap.  At least that's what I thought.  Frankly, I could care less about what soap I had used in the past.  Bar, body wash, whatever was available, I'd use it.  Maybe I'm in the minority here, but my biggest goal in the shower as a guy was to see how quickly I could get out.  Speed is the name of the game in the shower for me...no 5, 10 or 15 minute showers.  Get in and get out.  Just like at the mall.<br /><br />However, this body wash may have me extending my shower time.  It smells good, not "nice" but good.  Not manly per se, but not girly either. It lathers quickly and holds the suds.<br /><br />Now for the kicker.  I live in a dry climate and would always have to use lotion on my hands by the time I had gotten to work.  I haven't had to use it since I've been using this body wash!  Great news for me as I can kill two birds with one stone.<br /><br />All in all, I really could care less about my shower routine and how I smell coming out.  However, if this stuff keeps me from having to use lotion on my hands afterwards, then that just might make me keep on using it.<br /><br />And I can keep my man card in my wallet for now.

review/summary: I am not sure whether men need this...
review/text: I am not sure whether many men would use "Dove + Men Care Clean Comfort Body Wash." At least for me (a middle aged & married man), I am used to just washing my body with a bar of soap. Sure, sometime, it does dry up my skin, but after the shower, I do at times put on a lotion to soothe dry skin. As for this product:<br /><br />1. While the product promises, "(its) micromoisture technology to fight skin dryness," I have not seen any difference between using a bar of Dove soap or even Lever 2000. Even after using Dove's Men Care, I still needed to put on some of lotion to soothe my skin.<br />2. The scent of the item is somewhat like aftershave smell. Some men might like it, others may not. However, the scent is not too strong, but mild.<br />3. I do not know how clean it cleanses my body. I really can't tell the difference.<br /><br />Overall, I am not sure whether it is better than simple bar of soap.

review/summary: It's soap... For men!
review/text: In recent years, there's been a boom in the "for men" category of personal hygiene products. I guess the companies figured we guys were sick of seeing women get special soaps, shampoos, razors, deodorants and skin treatments, and sought to narrow the gap by giving us men something to claim for our own. Give it another decade and there may not be any unisex products in the personal care aisles anymore!<br /><br />And what's to review here? Soap. Fine, fine, fine-- Call it "Body Wash" if you want, but that's just the long-hand for "soap". Some marketing wizard decided to differentiate soap for your hands from soap meant for the rest of your body (but not your hair) as a means to get us to buy the same product twice. For the record, this soap works on your hands just as well as it works on your butt.<br /><br />It smells nice, like a typical men's deodorant or low-cost cologne. No fruity sweetness here! We're MEN (grunt!) If we can't smell like grease and dirt, then we like to smell like chemicals, not flowers or fruit! So this gets a good grade in the olfactory category.<br /><br />It gets me clean. Dirt was there, and now it's gone. My butt has never been shinier (except for that incident with the oil and the floor buffer). It makes me feel clean too, so I know it's not a mere illusion. LO, I AM NOW APPROACHABLE!<br /><br />Supposedly this soap has long-term effects on my skin, and makes my epidermis more healthy because there are little exfoliating beads in the soap. I'm not sure I can verify that, because I haven't run a long-term test course, but I'll take their word for it. After all, being clean has health benefits in and of itself.<br /><br />There's really no reason to complain about this product. It's a good soap. It comes in a nice squeeze bottle that makes it easy to lather up. It doesn't smell like wet dog or old spinach. It makes me cleaner than I would be if I didn't use soap, and it even works on my hands (despite the conspiracy to get me to buy separate hand soap!) so what else do you want in a soap? Tyler Durden-style lipo fats? A keen chemical burn? You won't get that here!<br /><br />But you will get clean, and you might get some action if you no longer smell like a soiled goat covered in Cheetos dust. That makes it SO worth it.

review/summary: Something For My Husband
review/text: My husband uses Dove body wash products regularly so I ordered this product for him to sample.  He thought it was a fair/good product --lathered well, smelled good, overall good feeling.  However, he wasn't impressed by it enough to want to spend two or three times as much for this item as compared to other similar items on the market.  Additionally the product's grainyness while fine for the body wasn't a good idea on the face...especially if one shaved before or after using.  Overall a nice product but not necessarily one that he has to have or purchase.

review/summary: Clog Your Pores, Stay Dirty, Feel Stale
review/text: This is the worst body wash I have ever used and I have used a few (from most regular mass market products like Axe, Old Spice to designer brands like Armani, Dunhill). The things that I expect from a bodywash/shower gel are:<br /><br />1) It should clean you very well and leave you feeling fresh (BUT while doing so it should not dry your skin). In the long run it should be good for the skin.<br /><br />2) It should not have any ingredient which is harmful for the skin. Specifically I avoid the following like plague: Petrolatum, Parben, Mineral Oil (apart from these, I also try to avoid SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate) but it is hard to find a body wash or shower gel without SLS - its pervasive).<br /><br />3) Have a good soothing or invigorating fragrance (while not being so strong as to cause a headache)<br /><br />Before beginning this review let me tell you why I avoid the ingredients Petrolatum, Parben and Mineral Oil - all these ingredients, in the name of 'moisturizing your skin by locking in vital moisture' actually form a sheath on top of your skin and clog its pores. This is extremely unhealthy for the skin since skin, for being healthy, needs to be able to breathe freely for expelling impurities out of the system. The implication of using products (body washes, shower gels) with these ingredients is that you do not feel as fresh after the shower (compared to products  without these ingredients) since your skin pores are clogged and suffocated. Though I noticed that this Dove Men + Care Clean Comfort Body Wash contained Petrolatum (and SLS), I wanted to give it a try since I hold in high regard Unilever in general for their well engineered products and the Dove brand in particular for their moisturizing bar soap which is one of the best soaps for skin and is a fantastic product.<br /><br />However I was shocked when I used this. It is the worst of all worlds - This body wash almost does not clean you at all but leaves such a heavy residue on your skin that you will feel horrible - as if you did not have a shower at all. And dare you use this when you are a little more unclean than usual - when you come out of the shower you will wonder whether you had a shower at all. There is absolutely NO feeling of freshness OR cleanliness that you expect from a shower. Now some might argue that usually 'moisturizing' body washes are intended more to moisturize than to leave you feeling squeaky clean - well I'm not talking of anything even close to squeaky clean here - when you have a bath (even if it were with the world's most moisturizing soap/body wash) you expect to feel a minimal level of freshness (otherwise there is no point of a bath - you might as well smother yourself with moisturizing lotion instead).<br /><br />Ok - so this does a horrible job of cleaning. So what about its claims of moisturizing ? The only thing this body wash does is clog your pores and leave your skin feeling suffocated - not supple and well cared for. So if you have an oily skin or if you are a little stale from perspiration and get into the shower with this, you will feel horrible since this will 1) not clean you in any way 2) lock in the dirt that you had before the shower - can you imagine how bad that can feel ? I wonder whether this product was well tested on actual people (which is a basic requirement and the norm with any cosmetic manufacturer of credibility/repute) before being rolled out.<br /><br />As for the fragrance, its just OK. Nothing that you would look forward to.<br /><br />I'm thoroughly disappointed with Unilever for releasing such a badly engineered and tested product. This is extremely uncharacteristic of this very good FMCG company. I threw this in the bin after using it thrice (I was disgusted after the very first use but wanted to give this a chance just in case the first day was a 'bad bath day' - but alas the bad was not in the day - it was in the gel).<br /><br />Well this review was a passionate one and so could come across to some as bordering on the weird - for after all its a body wash isn't it ? Your life does not depend on it. But well, I am very particular about the decisions I make for my health, grooming and well being. This product was so horrible that it disgusted me to the extent necessary to elicit such strong feelings of dislike and disapproval. However, as I always suggest, do not take my word for it - try this yourself (if you want) with an open mind but at the same time being conscious of what to test/look for after reading this review - because after all you are the best judge of what suits you and what is good for you. Also, I strongly suggest that you try to find a cleaning product without SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate), since SLS penetrates the skin and even the internal organs easily and can cause havoc like endocrinological imbalances, neurological disorders, organ toxicity and cancer on long term use.

review/summary: Good body wash - refreshing, but lacking
review/text: I have sensitive skin that is prone to getting dry, particularly during the winter months and dry weather. I thought I would give this new line a try and it was alright. The scent is just right as it is not overpowering but definitely detectable, although I can understand some people being turned off by it.<br /><br />The primary moisturizing ingredient in this body wash is the same as in many others - petrolatum. Those saying that this body wash does not moisturize enough - I would recommend letting the lather set on your body for at least a minute or two. Petrolatum is not an instantaneous moisturizer and needs some time to settle on the skin to do its job. Try aiming the water off of you as you lather and let it set for a couple of minutes. Even with this technique, however, this body wash just isn't as moisturizing as it says, especially in comparison to Dove 'Deep Moisture'.<br /><br />Overall - I liked this body wash. I'm rather picky with my personal hygiene products and Dove For Men passes with an average score.

review/text: Normally I use Irish Spring soap but noticed recently that it has been drying my skin out during the winter months. The Dove Men Body and Face Wash works great so far, cleans especially good as a face wash. I like that its a combination body and face wash, for a guy its very convenient not having to use multiple products. I tried two of the three scents. The Clean Comfort has a clean and cool scent to it (Coolwater'ish). The Extra Fresh has a fresh lemon type of scent to it. I like both, clean out of the shower smell but not overpowering like the usual cheap drugstore stuff. Best face cleanser Ive used and will continue using, highly recommended.

review/summary: Dries out skin, causes heavy irritation, hard to undo its affects
review/text: This product seemed very good at first and at first, i loved it. However, around 2 months after using it, i discovered i was always itching my outer thigh and the area directly behind my armpits (i was using the new dove deodorant also) was getting very dry (something very uncommon for me because my skin rarely dries out). After changing my body wash and deodorant (about 3 weeks later) my symptoms are beginning to leave. This product is very harmful to your skin and it doesn't manifest its negative consequences until it's too late. The dry skin is almost impossible to get rid of and even now (almost 2 months after i stopped using this product), my itchy skin is still evident. I went to my dermatologist and he said that the irritation was caused by the chemicals in this body wash and it could take a long time for the irritation to recede because of how long i was using the product. I would never recommend the men's product line to anyone (but "regular" dove products have always been a favourite of mine). Stick with the brands that have been around for a long time - Axe, old spice, etc

review/summary: Micromoisture? Really?
review/text: What can you say about a body wash? Does it get you clean? Yes. Well isn't that enough?<br /><br />Apparently not because this one has MICROMOISTURE technology. All these jargon words really make me laugh. You know there is a room of marketing guru's just sitting around thinking, "what words can we put together that will make our product sound revolutionary?"<br /><br />This team came up with: patent filed technology (yes that's right, "filed"), micromoisture technology, clinically proven, dermatologist recommended, and total skin comfort. I'm sure one of these is a typo on the container.<br /><br />But let's talk about the product now.<br /><br />Smell - it smells clean, masculine, not overpowering. It reminds me a bit of an Axe body spray.<br /><br />Texture - it has "purifying grains", which means it's sort of like using lava soap but in liquid form. It's gritty but not in a tear-up-your-skin way. That grit is supposed to help wash away dead skin cells and leave your skin refreshed and clean. I would have to say that yes, it does make my skin feel nice afterward.<br /><br />Where to use it - it says "body and face" but I don't really like micro-beads getting into my eyes. Be cautious about that. Great for body, not for the eyes - so when you're scrubbing your face be sure to squint really tight until you wash all the grit off.<br /><br />So what do I like? It smells good and it leaves my skin feeling like it's been cleaned very well.<br /><br />So what don't I like? It's not a shampoo & body wash, just a body wash, so I wind up having to use shampoo as well. This won't apply for bald men, but for the rest of us - I don't recommend using this as a shampoo because it takes forever to wash the microbeads out of your hair.<br /><br />As advertised the product gets 4 stars. Improvement idea would be to make an all-in-one product so I don't have to spend longer in the shower or use two products to get clean.

He likes the way it lathers up and rinses off easily even in our hard water, but neither of us care for the scent. I'm not sure what the smell is....maybe a sandalwood or something of the like, but neither of us cared for it. The scent didn't last long on the skin after showering, so that was a good thing for us. Scent is a very personal thing and some may really like the scent of this wash, we just didn't. I would like to see this product is some other scents or even in a non-scented variety. Overall, great product and would pick it up again if I could get a different scent.

review/summary: My new gym wash!!!
review/text: I don't know if it's just marketing, or something different about this body wash, but it's the only one I see labeled body wash AND face wash.  That makes it very convenient for going to the gym, since I can carry one less bottle.  (Nivea has shaving cream, body wash, shampoo, but I love my shampoo... and again, the label there doesn't actually say it's a face wash.)<br /><br />It rinses very cleanly, which is nice.  I'm not sure if it's terribly moisturizing, which is funny for Dove, since that's what they're known for.  The claim that it is...  but after using Dove Nutrium, my skin feels a definite difference.  After using using this, it didn't feel dry, but definitely didn't feel nearly as moisturized.<br /><br />The most surprising aspect about this wash was the fact that there is virtually no scent.  I expect Men's stuff to smell spicy, and other lines of this body wash definitely do, but not this mild formula.  I was initially somewhat disappointed, since I usually like smelling "manly", but it turns out it's actually makes it very good for going to the gym at noon, because when I get back to my office, I'm not knocking anyone out with my formidable scent.

review/summary: Amazing Product!
review/text: The only way I can compare this body wash is with another Dove product: the Exfoliating Body Wash. They are both great and refreshing. It's amazing how this brand of the British-Dutch multinational corporation, Unilever, makes such a positive gentle impact on how we start a day.

review/summary: A satisfying body wash & facial cleanser!
review/text: Over the years I've become a bit of a soap snob. I typically use separate products - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB5IO6">Nivea</a> for my face and a generic soap for my skin. This body wash advertised "total skin comfort" so I figured I'd put it to the test.<br /><br />I uploaded a picture of a dollop of this wash - it has a somewhat cloudy look to it, and initially I was worried it wouldn't smell good or get me clean.<br /><br />I was wrong on both counts.<br /><br />After using this wash, I noticed a very faint smell, similar to talcum powder. Not overpowering, just enough to make me feel refreshed.<br /><br />My face felt clean and it didn't feel dried out, nor did the...rest of me.<br /><br />The price is a little high for this, but you can increase the # of uses per bottle by using a bath sponge or a regular washcloth. Gents, If you're looking to spoil your skin, this is a good choice (if you haven't already devoted yourself to Nivea).

review/summary: Nicely scented with a good texture, but a bit expensive
review/text: I was quite happy with how this product worked as a body wash, but I won't be buying it until the price comes down.  Given that every body wash that I've used has gotten me clean, my criteria for choosing one over another are pretty simple:  I want something with a pleasant scent, I want a product that isn't overly thin and watery, and I want to feel like I'm getting a good value.  This Dove body wash met the first two of those, so I give it a thumbs up in regards to performance.  The one balking point for me is that it costs about three times as much as the Suave men's body wash that I typically use, and I don't like it all that much more than the Suave.<br /><br />Overall, I gave it four stars.  Performance is a solid five stars, but value is closer to three stars, IMO.

review/summary: Definitely not my choice of body wash...
review/text: I have sensitive skin and have a tendency to breakout easily when using most body washes. Personally I've always loved Dove's products, especially the ones for sensitive skin... and I'm going to keep using those and toss this.<br /><br />Dove's Men + Care does an awesome job lathering up and cleaning. The smell isn't the least bit offensive and it washes off cleanly. It doesn't leave your skin feeling itchy or dry, which is very nice, and does leave your skin feeling soft<br /><br />However after using it I started to breakout. I looked at the ingredients and saw a whole heck of a lot of things I've never seen in my previous body washes and soaps. Out of all of the stuff in it, I'm not sure what particular ingredient it is, but there is something in it that I am sensitive to and had to quit using it.<br /><br />So other then being allergic to the body wash, it does a great job cleaning and the smell is quite pleasant. If it didn't break me out, I'd continue using it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cleans well.<br />Lathers up great.<br />Smells good.<br />Well priced.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Broke me out after a few uses.<br />Has about three times the ingredients as my normal body wash that doesn't break me out

review/summary: It's OK but check the ingredients label
review/text: I thought this was pretty decent. I found the scent pleasing without being over-powering and the scent did not linger in an obnoxious way. The body wash lathered nicely and when rinsed off, did not leave my skin as dry, flaky and scratchy as some other products I've used in the past.<br /><br />What is disappointing is that this product contains Petrolatum which is a by-product of petroleum (also known as petroleum jelly.) Petrolatum has been linked to causing or inflaming acne, it can actually clog your pores and of most concern is that it has been recognized as being a possible cancer risk. A bit of Googling will reveal all of this and more.<br /><br />Bottom line for me is that there are plenty of other skin care products that do not contain Petrolatum. I would not buy this again.

review/summary: Decent Bodywash; Misleading Labeling
review/text: Just to start with, I'm typically not the type to use Dove bodywash, though my fiancee is a huge fan of the female version.<br /><br />However, due to a pregnancy and the associated hypersensitivity to smells that come along with it, I had to give up my Old Spice Denali bodywash and went in search of an unscented one. My fiancee sent me to the store with "advice" to pick up a bottle of Dove unscented bodywash.<br /><br />Turns out Dove unscented, isn't; at least, not exactly.<br /><br />We found that out the next morning as I was getting ready. Despite the "unscented" label, while using the bodywash in the shower, the stuff has a very heavy fragrance, not really any different in strength than my usual Denali. So...Wasn't too surprised to get out of the shower only to find my fiancee on the other side of the apartment and every single balcony door open.<br /><br />That being said, the scent did seem to dissipate quickly and left only a faint odor after 15 minutes and no detectable scent within 30, but still.<br /><br />After a call to Unilever, customer service told me what April discovered. Namely, that the unscented bodywash did contain a fragrance (malfa or malta or something like that), but it was intended only to mask/neutralize the natural odors of the ingredients and definitely shouldn't have come across as a "heavy" odor in use, so...<br /><br />I don't know if we just wound up with a bad bottle or if that's just how the stuff works/smells, but. It obviously wouldn't work for our needs, so I'm back to basics with a plain, unscented bar of soap.

review/summary: Dove Men Body Face Wash for Sensitive Skin
review/text: This is quite possibly the best body wash I have ever used.  I usually don't give a perfect rating unless a product deserves it, but I was exceptionally pleased.  I should have removed one star for the fact that it does have a scent as others have mentioned, but due to how well it is for my psoriasis, I will give it 5 stars.  I imagine this would be just as good for other dry skin conditions such as eczema.<br /><br />pros:<br />-Foams very well<br />-Lowest amount of skin drying compared to every other product I have used<br />-Smells well<br />-Good Package and large amount<br /><br />cons:<br />-should let set for 2 minutes to allow product to set in<br />-does have scent (not bad though)

review/summary: Only product that has given me clear skin
review/text: I am not quite sure why so many reviews say this product causes them to break out.  It does the total opposite for me.  I have been searching for years for a product that can take care of face and body breakouts and finally found this.  It's not even advertised as an acne treatment, but it is the only thing that has ever worked. I have naturally oily skin, I suppose, so the drying effect described by many is beneficial for me, as it returns the skin to normal.  It leaves your face feeling tight, but not dry.<br /><br />I will definitely attest to the fact that this is a different product than the same label in the store.  The review that mentioned this was much more watery and less scented hit the nail on the head.  However, It still does the job. It's just curious that it's different.<br /><br />I could by 3 smaller bottles at my local grocery store for close to $20 or get three huge ones here for 15.<br /><br />All in all, if you have oily skin all over, this works.  If you don't, I figure it may dry it out...

review/text: I like the Dove products for men. This product does not dry out my skin, smells fine, and works well.  I paid for 3 bottles of item.  The packaging was poor and one bottle broke open spilling most of it's contents.  I was able to recover about 25% of the third bottle. The bottles were placed in a plastic bag with no other padding, i.e. anything to keep the bottles from getting damaged.  No air bags, no peanuts, nothing at all for protection.  At this point, sending them all back is not an option.

review/summary: I like it quite a bit.
review/text: I'm quite choosy about my hygienic products -- toothpastes, soaps, washes and so on. In an effort to find a bath wash that wasn't too obnoxious or coarse in it's ingredients, I've been through a couple brands. Knowing this, this one came as a gift from my girlfriend at the time. So far, this is one of my favorites. I don't really have sensitive skin per se but the mildness of both it's fragrance and it's texture, or lack thereof, work good for my skin. The only minus, though I personally don't mind, is that it is advertised as "unscented" yet a scent is clearly apparent.<br /><br />It has no impact on the actual relevance of the product as a cleansing agent but I really like the look of the graphic design and industrial design of the product itself. The color scheme is nice and the bottle is easy to handle without slipping out of my hands. When the bath soap is getting low it also seems to do well at getting the last bits out unlike a lot of other brands I've tried where you have to pound the thing to get the last quarter of liquid out. The upside down orientation of the nozzle helps with this tremendously as does the shape of the bottle, I assume. Pretty good!

My back and top of my arms get very very dry as soon as I get out the shower and my skin is very tight as if I just washed with straight alcohol. This is why I had to give it only 2 stars.<br /><br />I'll have to use a different wash.

review/summary: Laundry Detergent
review/text: Like for many reviewers, initially this product was fantastic. Besides the smell that made me sneeze slightly, my skin became soft within a few days. I was recommending this product to everyone at that point. A few months later, I started having breakouts: I had not had any pimples in over 20 years. My skin started to itch more and more. I thought initially I was attacked by some type of microscopic bugs all over my body. It became unbearable. I finally made the connection with the soap. Smelling it was making me sneeze more and more. My skin was burning after each shower. It was as if I was washing my face and body with laundry detergent.<br />Allergies develop over time. It is often hard to make a connection with the allergens. As soon as I switched to another brand, the symptoms disappeared. I was taught in medical school that Dove is amongst the safest hypoallergenic products. This new line of products for men is to the contrary incompatible with my skin. I don't have any other allergies.I don't know if the regular white bar is still as safe as it used to be, Unilever lost my trust for ever. Just look at the ingredient list if you are still sceptical.

review/text: Let me start by saying I don't fall much for marketing hype and to me soap is soap. That being said, the Dove Men+Care line is pretty good. It gets me clean, doesn't have an overpowering smell (just a clean one) and works pretty well. I also use the deodorant and that is a good compliment to this as well. I'm not one for a lot of frills - I had been using Old Spice or Suave, but tried the Dove during the winter because my skin was dry. It works. As a bonus, it can usually be found on sale somewhere at a big box store. The only thing I will say is it doesn't lather quite as much as some other soaps - to me that's a positive, but it might not be to others.

review/summary: Best body wash ever!
review/text: I read some other reviews and saw that Dove's Body Wash for men dried up skin, clogged up pores, etc...  But remember, everyone's body chemistry is different.<br /><br />For me, this is the best body wash ever as it fits my chemistry perfectly.  I've used so many different face washes in the past, from Jack's to, Niveas, to Adidas, Old Spice and all of them caused me to break out on my face.<br /><br />Only this product does not cause me to get more pimples.  Yes it does dry my face out a little (but every face wash does that).  To remedy that, I put lotion on my face after I shower.  HOwever, after about 2-3 weeks of putting lotion on, I started to break out again so I took a 1 week break from putting on lotion and my skin was clear again.<br /><br />Anyways...<br /><br />Basically, if your body chemistry is anything like mine, this will make your pimples disappear.<br /><br />It also smells really good - not too overpowering so that it'll mess with any cologne I put on.  As for how it works as a body wash, well I'm not too picky and I don't see any difference from this product than Old Spice or any other men's wash.  But for washing my face, this thing is absolute magic.

review/summary: Stick with regular unisex Dove body wash
review/text: Ever since I was a young lad, I can remember using Dove products in the shower. Dove bar soap has always been a mainstay in my routine. Then a few years ago I tried Dove's body wash. Great products all -- moisturizing, rich and without overpowering scent. I'd always hoped that Dove would introduce its products for men, perhaps with more masculine scents and packaging. Finally, Dove introduced its Men+Care line.<br /><br />I've tried out just about every body wash in the line and unfortunately, these are nothing like the "unisex" Dove body washes. The men's line is like any other typical gel you'd find among the Old Spices and Irish Springs of the pharmacy aisle. This product does little to moisturize, it's hard to squeeze out of the bottle (there's a very small opening and the plastic walls of the bottle are thick and rigid) and it doesn't wash off cleanly.<br /><br />Dove's standard body washes are thicker and richer. They are also far more moisturizing thanks to Dove's Nutrium Moisture system. The men's line does not have Nutrium Moisture. So unless you've just absolutely got to use products that say "for men" on the bottle, I'd stick with Dove's unisex line.

review/summary: It's for men
review/text: It's a bit strong immediately from the bottle but after it's been rinsed off, it is not too imposing.  Like other Dove products it is gentle on sensitive and dry skin and is a good option for those of us who have chronic dry skin.

review/summary: It gets you clean
review/text: To some extent, soap is soap, whatever the form.  What makes this Dove Body Wash better or worse than similar products?<br /><br />It gets you clean:  that's good.  On the other hand, there's nothing exceptional about the job it does.  In addition, if you are particularly sensitive to smell, the fragrance may be a bit much.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is the package.  Personally, I prefer to have the bottle dispense from the top, and while most containers can work with either side up, this one requires a bit of a balancing act if you want the dispenser at the top.  What annoys me more, however, is the opaqueness of the container, which makes it harder to determine how much body wash you have left.<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay product, but not one I'd go out of my way to get.

review/text: I asked my husband to give me his opionion of this product as I thought it would be more useful than mine.<br /><br />He likes the smell (I do too by the way - I don't feel it's overpowering which some scented soaps are).  He does NOT like the gritty texture of the soap and doesn't feel that adds to the cleaning capabilities.  The soap does not cause him to break out or give him rashes.  I have been experimenting with liquid soaps recently to reduce soap scum in his tub - this was not a winner on that front - I noticed even more soap scum than before.

review/summary: Dove for Men? Genius!
review/text: I've been a loyal Dove product user for years so when Dove decided to come out with a men's line of products, I was very excited to have my boyfriend try them out. Of course, he was hesitant about using something that was always intended for women. After a little prodding, he reluctantly tried it out. Not only did he like itbut it made his skin feel incredible and he smelled great. He's already asked me to get him another bottle soon. I think he might take my recommendations in the future. :)

review/summary: very convenient
review/text: First I really like the smell of this product, at least out of the bottle. On my husband, it didn't smell quite as good. But like many fragrances, they smell just a bit different on each person. My husband said it wasn't his favorite scent, but that it was definately a manly smell. It rinses off well, but doesn't seem to moisturize as well as Dove's other products, which in my opinion was a bit odd. It does a great job making you feel clean, according to my husband. It is also convinient as it is a product that can be used for several applications, which means less clutter in the shower. Great product for a man who is not concerned about moisturizing issues and enjoys the scent.

review/summary: Good for cleaning your body/face
review/text: It's basically shower gel for men. Definitely has a manly-smelling cologne added: some men will like the scent and some will not, we found the scent to be okay. I'd recommend smelling this in the store before purchasing since scents are such a subjective thing.<br /><br />I found this product to work and lather exactly as most of our other shower gels do. Like most shower gels, it doesn't moisturize the skin much, so if your skin is used to being pampered with moisturizing soaps, this may dry your skin out.<br /><br />For being a "wash," it does a good job of cleaning and for its purpose, I give it 4 stars. While we would appreciate a more moisturizing wash, some folks (particularly young men with already oily skin) will appreciate the lack of additional moisturizers.

review/text: So while this product may be for men, I think a woman could use it as well.  I loved the exfoliating beads that were in this body wash.  The exfoliating beads help make you feel nice and fresh.  The scent isn't overwhelming, you don't feel like you have been doused with a scent when you use this body wash.  I really think this body wash can be used by everyone in the house.  In fact, I have enjoyed this body wash far more than many other body washes I have used in the past.

review/text: I must confess that I am not a habitual body wash user, being more of a bar soap person myself.  The scent is very good, nice and masculine, and clean.  However, the consistency is too thin for my liking, it is far too runny and not foamy enough, so you end up have to use a whole palmful at a time.

review/summary: From slightly dry to slightly oily
review/text: I struggle with dry skin and I was excited to try this product, as Dove has always made gentle products that have irritated my skin less than some other brands. I have mixed results with this product, though overall I am pleased with it.<br /><br />First, I appreciate that the bottle is easy to open, which is something I have learned not to take for granted. I have used bath and body products that are packaged such that it is next to impossible to open the packaging. This is not one of them.<br /><br />The fragrance is actually very pleasant, on the masculine side but not overpowering. After a good shower there is still the slightest hint of the fragrance left behind, enough that it can be picked up when close but not enough to tell when more than a couple of feet away.<br /><br />The gel lathers up nicely and washes off nicely too.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that after using it, my skin is no longer dry but is actually slightly oily. I do not have severe dry skin so perhaps this product is meant for people who have more of a problem with dryness. The oiliness is short-term, though, and after skipping a day my skin returns to normal.<br /><br />This is a nice product for men with dry skin. It smells nice and it leave you feeling clean. If you struggle with severe dry skin this product will please you. If, like me, you have slightly dry skin you may feel a little oily afterward - keep this in mind when shopping for bath products.

review/summary: Smells Good, Gets Me Clean
review/text: I've used many different body washes over the years and this one is one of the more masculine smelling ones when you compare it to the normal brands of body wash, so that is nice if you would prefer not to smell like roses or peaches.  It has a good lather without being too overly soapy and rinses off without any soapy residue after feel.  The flip top cap is nice and easy to use and I like how it is stored with the cap down so you don't have to shake it to get it out like you do with ones with the cap on the top.  So it an overall good body wash with a well designed bottle.

review/text: I really liked this product.  First of all the size is much bigger than most body washes I have purchased.  I really liked that the cap was on the bottom and flat, it makes it easy to store, and reduces product waste.  The smell is a nice musk, and not strong at all, very pleasant.  The scrubbing particles are smaller than most body washes I have used, but still too big to be very useful.  To exfoliate well, they really need to be about the size of sand.  The product does clean well, and is very pleasant.

review/text: My husband complained that this left a film on his skin, so I tried it to see what he meant.<br /><br />I love it.  It has a pleasant, masculine scent, nothing like those teenager-targeted body sprays. It's not so overpoweringly manly that I can't use it, but it's definitely not a girly scent. It leaves my skin feeling nice, not stripped like most soaps.  I tried to explain to my husband that he was getting clean and putting light moisturizer on at the same time, but he refused to try it again, which is his loss.  It has a nice texture and make a good lather and won't leave your skin feeling dried-out.

review/summary: A great product!
review/text: Dove has a long history of making quality bath products.  This one is no exception.  Dove has expanded its line of products to include some men's products.  This body wash has a nice scent.  It is a masculine scent without being too overwhelimg.  It smells clean yet manly.  One of the advantages of this product is its moisture level.  Most bar soaps just aren't moisturizing and leave the skin feeling scaly, but this product leaves skin feeling moisturized.  This is a body wash and facial cleanser in one so it is two products in one.  It does contain some exfoliate type beads that are different for a men's body wash.  You may want to consider it that before purchasing it.  Overall, it is a good value and a great product!

review/text: This from the Man in my life:<br />Dove's Bath Gel for Men, their recent entry into the growing male skin care market, is a sure winner. The aqua-colored gel instantly turns into a rich, foamy lather when it hits the washcloth. The scent is mild and refreshing like good soap and the feel on the skin is gentle and soothing. I actually looked forward to showering with this stuff: it's a great way to start the day or to cool down after an intense workout. Highly recommended

review/summary: Lasting Fresh Neutral Scent-I am a believer!
review/text: I am not a big gel wash guy preferring the more tactile soap bar, but this wash has converted me!  Why?  Due to the small deep cleaning microbeads, the wash has the feel of really getting in to your pores and washing you clean.  I would say the best thing about the product though is the scent, which has a neutral fresh scent that is lasting on your face.  I actually wash my hands with this product as well because I love the fresh smell-that stays around for awhile.  Never fear-it is not feminine at all, but for ladies it is not too manly either as my wife uses it as well.  As a bonus, the gel is highly concentrated so a little dab will do it!

review/summary: Just for Men? not really..
review/text: Yes I know this says Dove for Men and I'm a girl but you know, it was in the shower so I was like, what the heck, soap's soap right? Also seeing as how my husband will use my girly body washes, I felt no guilt in using his. Well in all basic necessities, it did it's job, I got clean and smelled nice.  The smells not too overpowering nor did I smell like a dude unlike some other body washes who shall not be named.  Maybe guys aren't used to the "grains" to exfoliate but I liked them.  For a quick rinse shower, I could see how they could be a bother when you're trying to get in/out really fast and frantically trying to brush it off. But if you're taking your time in the shower, scrubbing with the beads was quite nice.  Husband likes it as well.  He really likes how there are now MEN lines in body washes and shampoos.  It's about time that companies realize that guys DO care about how they look and will take care of themselves.  Overall we enjoyed the product. It may say MEN but it can be totally unisex in a pinch.

review/summary: Felt clean after using it!
review/text: I was reading in "Men's Health" that washing with an exfoliating scrub can help with clogged pores that cause tiny blackheads and when your face gets dry and little bits of skin flake off.  The article recommended creamy soaps that are formulated with finely ground nuts and nutshells or other granules that slough off dirt and dead skin.  Dove Men + Care Deep Clean Body and Face Wash fits that category and I generally liked using the product.<br /><br />It's advertised as a deep cleansing gel that rinses off easily with purifying grains.  In use, I found it to be a gel that lathers up and did rinse off easily.  There are little "grains" in it, and I felt "clean" after using it.  The article I read did warn not to scrub too hard, or you'll irritate your skin.  I didn't have a problem with this and I used the wash on body and face.<br /><br />My main goal is to get clean, and it worked for that.  I'm not that concerned with scent, but I don't particularly want to smell flowery, so I'd rather use a product aimed at men.  I'd also prefer not to have my skin dry out, so I liked that this wash contained moisturizing elements.<br /><br />I also like shower gels and washes that come in ease tubes rather than messy bar soap that I used for so many years.  These are just more convenient and less messy.  Bottom line:  I felt clean after using it, my skin felt good, and it's easy to use.  It's a product I'll use.

review/summary: Effective and Pleasant Product
review/text: I don't usually pay much attention to things like body wash or soap, mostly just taking them for granted as about equally effective and as about as important as the background music in an elevator.  It's nice that it is there but I don't really notice that it's there so much as I (and others) notice that it is not.<br /><br />So, I wasn't too excited about what the possibilities for this product were so much as just seeing if it would work as well as the assortment of soaps and body washes I've used before.  When I received the product I noted that the bottle wasn't particularly fancy but somewhat similar to other brand name body wash or shampoo bottles.  So that lead me to believe that this product wasn't so much about the hype as hopefully just being a quality product that does what it says.<br /><br />In terms of what it claims for itself these are my observations and experiences:<br /><br />1.  Claim: It fights dryness -  Reality:  I found this to be true.  I don't pay too much attention to my skin but I know that when I use a soap that is harsh that it strips the oils from my skin and particularly if the air is dry and hot, that I will be uncomfortable an itchy.  I felt clean after using this product and I noted that I felt as if I had followed up with a skin lotion.  It wasn't overwhelming.  It was comfortable.  To my observation it does what it claims in this regard.<br /><br />2.  Claim:  Micromoisture Technology - Activation during lather to protect skin and keep it comfortable - Reality:  I don't really buy into this obviously marketing based type of appeal.  This is just attempting to put sizzle to the steak.  It's really just the same thing as the claim to fight dryness.  There are obviously common ingredients to this product as what you would find in a skin lotion.  So it's replacing some of the natural skin moisture with an oil based element that bonds to the skin despite the water of the bath or shower.<br /><br />3.  Claim: Rinses Clean  Reality:  I felt clean after using the product.  The water on my body beaded.  That's no doubt another result of the oil based moisturizer/lubricant it left on my body.  Also of note, was that the product is heavily fragranced and perfumed.  That also gives the illusion of cleanness and "freshness."  It wasn't unpleasant and no doubt I was clean.  If you have any strong aversions however to oils and fragrances, even ones less floral and more masculine, then this is not the product for you.<br /><br />The promotional material for this product notes that it is intended to be used with a special shower tool.  I did not have that to use so I can't comment upon it.  Just using it a normal body wash however, I found it to meet expectations, to leave my body clean but very fragranced (my wife noticed it and wasn't particularly thrilled with that element of it).  It isn't harsh.  It does leave a moisturizing layer of lotion like oils following the rinse and overall I can't fault it in terms of meeting basic expectations.<br /><br />It's not, however, something that I will purpose to buy or to continue using.<br /><br />3 stars.<br /><br />bart breen

review/text: I ordered this for my husband because I didn't like him using our Zest Deodorant bar soap on his face - thought he could use for a body wash as well. He tried it out but found he had body odor soon after washing.  He tried using his regular bar soap for his under arms after he washed with the liquid soap but had the same results - it must leave a barrier so that any subsequent soap can't be used.  He did use the Dove Men + Care Deep Clean Body Wash to wash his face ONLY* and went back to our Zest Soap (aqua or orange one) for his body.  And, no, he normally does not use underarm deodorant unless we are going somewhere special because he doesn't need it.<br /><br />*Update (11/17/11) My husband no longer uses this at all - he didn't use it after the first week.

So many of these products have such a strong smell that it can be annoying.  It is very mild and pleasant.  I enjoy the smell which is in fact so mild, that I have used it myself.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: LIghtly moisterizing
review/text: I really like the Dove Men Body Wash.  I have dry skin and find it to be lightly moisturizing without a greasy feeling.  The scent is also lightly 'manly' without being too much and it doesn't interfere with my cologne.  There are little scrub things in it but I don't think they do much as far as exfoliation.  All in all a good wash for a guy.

review/summary: pretty good
review/text: -The smell is subtle.<br />-It works well in hard water.<br />-It feels clean.<br /><br />It's great.<br /><br />Now things that could be better:<br />-It doesn't have a pump (cap is tat the bottom). A pump would help me be more consistent and not be wasteful.<br />-There is no info if it's environmentally friendly. Given a choice I'd opt for something at the local organic store that I know is eco friendly.

review/summary: Find me a dirty boy ... on a horse ... for men
review/text: I enjoyed the chance to try "Dove Men", in part because I didn't know that real men weren't allowed to use regular Dove products.  Looking back, I believe my grandparents had Dove soap at their house ... it's amazing I escaped my childhood visits there with even a shred of manliness intact.  (Remove tongue from cheek).  Ok, can you tell I'm a little skeptical when brands feel the need to develop a "for men" or "for women" offering?  Especially when they feel the need to pour millions of dollars into trying to convince people to buy it: usually a clear sign that they are trying desperately to differentiate what is at heart a commoditized product.<br /><br />I think this product has a nice fragrance--if a little strong--although I will agree with another review that it almost seemed too calculated: this smells like the consensus of what a hundred focus groups decided "manly" should smell like.  I felt no more and no less clean than from using other soaps or body washes, so if the "micromoisture technology" was at work, I didn't really notice it.  But perhaps that's because I didn't use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TSA90C">Dove Men Shower Tool</a>, which is apparently a loofah but much more manly because it includes the word "tool".  Men like tools.<br /><br />I personally did not really notice or mind the "cleansing grains", but from reading other reviews they appeared to bother a good number of people.  So, note that there are versions of this product without these cleansing grains, if you have sensitive skin but want to try this product.<br /><br />So at the end of the day, it's a body wash, no more and no less.  It doesn't matter if you add the phrase "for men", try to convince people that they are a "dirty boy", or that they should smell like a man and not a lady (Old Spice has definitely won the advertising wars, haven't they?).  These products will all get you clean, and they keep the Madison Avenue advertisers in business.  I enjoyed the product ... but once it's gone, I'll probably go back to my good old bar of soap.  But not Dove soap, of course ... I want to smell like a man, not like a lady.  I'm on a horse.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: Does it fight dryness? Yes<br /><br />Does it later up well? Yes<br /><br />Does it rinse off easily and completely? Yes<br /><br />Can you use it every day? Yes<br /><br />Can you use it MORE than once a day? Yes<br /><br />Is the scent `girly' or overpowering? No.<br /><br />How does it compare to other body washes? It' better, in my opinion, but I have by no means tried them all.<br /><br />I do still prefer a separate product for my face and neck, though, due to some oily skin closer to my hair. It really is good that I can get really clean after doing some heavy / hard exertion and scrub everything well without drying out my skin. The best process I have found for using shower gels is to get yourself and the applicator wet, turn off the water, work the product into a lather and scrub yourself, then rinse it all off. I also like to use the product on my feet using a brush like this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002NC1L">Rubbermaid Dish Brush</a> . It does seem a little more slippery on the soles of my feet until I can wash it off well.<br /><br />This is a good product. I will probably keep buying it after the sample is gone.

review/summary: Lonesome Dove
review/text: By time people read the reviews of this product, it will be lonesome.  Naive me (my husband) just started using the product without reading the label.<br /><br />My first shower was as advertised. Didn't feel any soap residue on my skin and I thought it had a nice fragrance left on my skin which lasted for about an hour.<br /><br />After about 3 showers my skin started to itch again. I nominally use a body wash that has no fragrance. I can usually get away without putting lotion on my body for about 4 showers, but not so with the Dove. I had to put on lotion after every shower.<br /><br />I'm back to using the other bodywash. So far I haven't had to put lotion on after 3 showers.  I haven't researched my regular bodywash, but I know I'm not itching a few hours after a shower.<br /><br />Dove has been around for awhile, so I have to believe people like it.  Just doesn't work for me, and the ingredients are little concerning.  Don't they make just soap anymore?

review/summary: Nice lather and scent
review/text: This body wash lathers up well, but you need to use a good amount; it isn't concentrated.  The scent is similar to "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VOLLG2">English Leather</a>" Aftershave.  The bottle is designed well, easy to use while showering.

review/summary: Feels Really Clean
review/text: What I enjoy most about this body wash is:<br /><br />Clean and feels good.<br /><br />The body wash has this nice texture, and feels very high end.  I also enjoy the very large size.<br /><br />Things I don't personally enjoy:<br /><br />The fragrance, to each their own, but this doesn't smell that good.  It's not stopping me from using it right now, but I'd prefer either something with no scent, or a more pleasing one.<br /><br />I'll agree, as another reviewer wrote AXE does smell better, as does Old Spice.<br /><br />Give me some more flavors and I may switch to you Dove, but for now I'm still "stuck on" Old Spice.  (And hoping they come up with their new Fresh line in a bodywash!  (that stuff smells AMAZING!))

review/summary: Clean, crisp, refreshing
review/text: I like this clear gel-like product so much more than the cream-textured equivalents made by Dove and other body wash makers. It foams just as well, it moisturizes just as well, smells less cloying than most and, best of all, rinses cleanly. The scent is crisp and pleasant but with no undertones (fruit, floral, or citric) that I can identify. You mostly smell it while showering, because it doesn't linger on your skin later to compete with deodorants or other products.<br /><br />But, what made my rating go from a 4 to a 5 star is that I found it less slippery in the shower than previous products I had tried. (I recently almost slipped in the shower while using a Johnson and Johnson body wash that left my acrylic shower mat a little greasy.) Those of us who are in the age group in which we need moisturizing, are also in the age group in which we have to be very careful to avoid falling. Using ordinary caution, this product rinses well off the body, and doesn't make the shower floor or surfaces any more slippery than ordinary soap.

review/summary: How to be clean AND comfortable
review/text: For someone who lives in a semi-arid high-altitude climate (think Colorado), this product is essential.  And anyone who endures seasonal dry weather should look into this product as well.  I've sworn by Dove products ever since moving to the Denver area in the `70's, and I'm happy that my "manly man" can now enjoy these benefits as well.  This body soap has a mild, clean smell - no perfume-y overtones.  If you're a male and experience dry skin at times, this one is for you

review/summary: It's soap. Not particularly special soap.
review/text: I've been using liquid soap... excuse me... body wash... for a few years instead of bar soap, and I haven't really found a strong commitment to any particular brand. Dove hasn't really changed that.<br /><br />By and large, it's not unlike any other major brand you'll see out there. It has the kitschy microbeads that most of the Axe varieties have, with a relatively strong scent that's somewhere between "designed by Old Spice" and "this is what a focus group of women at Dove think that men want or should have".<br /><br />On the plus side, the scent goes away relatively fast, so it doesn't interfere (or compete, in Old Spice's case) with your cologne or aftershave.<br /><br />It lathered pretty well in hard water, and left me feeling clean. If you don't like the gel-type body wash brands (Axe, Neutrogena, etc.) and don't mind smelling like someone cracked open a bottle of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C1VWJU">Brut</a> for a few minutes, you'd probably like this.<br /><br />Me? I kind of like gel more, and would prefer this unscented, or with a much lighter scent.
