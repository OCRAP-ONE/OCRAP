review/summary: Primo Popcorn Seasoning
review/text: One of the Kernel's best flavors.  I make popcorn for about 20 people 3 nights a week.  I tried several Kernel Seasons flavors and Parmesan and Garlic is wildly popular.  The garlic doesn't overpower the cheese.  It doesn't stick to the bag, bowl or your hands and isn't greasy. It's also great combined with their Ranch flavor.  A little goes a long way.  Tried other brands but the Kernel's is best one so far.

review/text: These flavors for popcorn are out of sight! I can only get a few flavors around home and have been ordering different kinds from amazon. This one is a keeper. I'll order it again for sure. I got Cajun and barbecue next. I love it on my air popped popcorn cause it's a low calorie complex carb. Just lightly spray with Pam to make the flavoring stick. Enjoy.

review/summary: Our Perrenial Family Favorite
review/text: Oh Parmesan Garlic, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways! Simply the best "seasoning"I've encountered, for soup flavoring, popcorn seasoning, it's actually an essential ingredient in 3/4's of the meals I cook. My husband adores savory, I like tangy, and we've managed to find a harmonizing favorite with Kernel Seasons. My husband tells me I'm an addict, and he's probably right. When our local grocery and big box discount stores stopped selling it, I nearly went crazy. Why was my favorite seasoning gone? Thank goodness for Amazon, we're back in business.

review/summary: My favorite popcorn seasoning
review/text: This seasoning is perfect for me. I thought the garlic flavor might be overbearing, but it isn't. You taste more of the cheese flavor.<br /><br />I use this seasoning on homestyle microwave popcorn. And, I really hose down the popcorn. Some reviewers here say it's too salty. It tastes fine to me.<br /><br />Alot of grocery stores carry Kernel Seasons. So, you might check the store if you want to just give it a try. The Kernel Seasons website also sells a variety pack. I'm buying the pack of 6 from Amazon to give away as gifts throughout the year.

review/text: Kernel Season's Parmesan and Garlic seasoning is very tasty and an excellent value, although a bit on the salty side.  They could cut the salt content in half and it would be even better, allowing more of the garlic and cheese flavor to come through.  That aside, it adds a nice touch to popcorn.

review/text: I ordered these to help in the training of my two dogs. They are great because they are small and they dissolve shortly after the dogs get them in their mouths. No waiting for them to chew during training. They were exactly what I wanted, and ordered, and were shipped out right away. I had them within a few days of placing the order. I would order from them again.

review/summary: Perfect size snacks for Dog Toy
review/text: Until recently I was purchasing these snacks at my local Pet Supermarket. They no longer carry them so I went to Amazon.com. The reason they are perfect for my two dogs ( a Lab and a Chow mix) is not the size obviously but because I have a dog toy that is one of those toys that you pull out the center and fill the different layers inside with treats. After putting the center piece back in you shake it around and the dog has to learn to push it with his nose or paws to get the treats to lay just right to fall out. Well my Lab learned in one day and just loves this toy. The ONLY treats that I have found that fit are this brand and he loves all the flavors but especially the cheese flavor and the yogurt brand. There are quite a lot in one bag and reasonably priced. Yes, I will buy more!<br />Buddy Bits Rocks!

review/summary: Buddie Bits Review
review/text: My three chihuahuas (4 lbs, 8 lbs, 9.5 lbs) love these little treats.  The treats are small so that they are easy on their little mouths and teeth and they are small enough not to contain way more calories that I want them to have (have to keep them trim and healthy).  They are also lightly crispy rather than hard and crunchy (many chihuahuas have dental problems), so I don't have to worry about gum  or tooth damage or pain.  From the response that I get whenever my chihuahuas just see the package in my hand and the way they dance around until they get their treat, I have no doubts about how much they enjoy these little crispy treats.<br /><br />I first purchased Buddy Bones (a bigger treat but same recipe) from my local Pet Supplies store and broke them into smaller pieces because they were larger treats and my little dogs had some trouble chewing them.  Pet Supplies quit carrying these treats so after checking Petsmart and Petco, I was getting a little discouraged.  Then I had the (its seems to most non dog lovers I'm sure) thought to try on Amazon and here they are. Not only did I find the treats my dogs love, but I found a much smaller version and I do not have to break them up into smaller pieces.  Now when it's treat time, my three little dogs don't look at me with disappointment any more.

review/summary: My Dog Loves These Treats - Far More Than Any She Has Ever Had In Her 12 Years As My Companion
review/text: I received these Best Buddy Bits for my dog about 6 weeks ago - and she absolutely loves them.  At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats.  That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one.  She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling.  However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats.  I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me.  I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.<br /><br />My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds.  However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats.  Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats.  I am certainly glad I purchased four bags of these Best Buddy Bits.<br /><br />I will have to tell you that until I received my shipment from Amazon, for some reason, I thought these treats were named Best Buddy BITES.  I do not know how I made such a blunder.  Imagine my embarrassment (in front of my dog since she was the only one around) when I realized that I had been wrong this entire time. Oh well, at least I am certainly straight on the name now!<br /><br />One last item, the Crude Fat (min) level of these treats is 13%, it is a bit more than I usually like to give my dog, but I will overlook it on these treats because she absolutely goes bonkers for these treats.  The things I do for my dog.

review/text: Best Buddy Bits are perfect for training.  I have 2 small dogs that I have trained in agility and as therapy dogs.....they won't even take another type of treat. Also, great because my hands don't get the smell on them from the other type of treats that are soft and chewy, so I can leave these in my pocket or hand without fear of the smell getting on me....so nice...people that train dogs understand this......  Will do all their tricks and listen perfectly for these treats......was so happy to find them on Amazon, my local pet store carried them for a long time then tried something new. I think they are going back to Best Buddy Bits after talking to the manager, if not I will continue to purchase them through Amazom.com.  THANKS!!!!!

review/summary: Yeah  for Best Buddy Bits
review/text: Our dog Callie loves these treats.  Her Auntie from Connecticut sent her these for her birthday and she loved them so much that after she ran out, we found them at Amazon. (of course)  We bought 2 more bags.  Callie sniffed the box they came in and got all excited.  She has the nose of a lab.  She is a 60 pound dog and these little treats go a long long ways.  They are small in size but get so much reward for the bite.  One bag will lasts for several weeks because you choose how much to give.  You can give 1 or 10.  The bag never seems to finish.  There is a lot of enjoyment out of one of these little bags because you can teach your dog tricks and reward them with like I say 1-10 little bits.  We love them also because they are healthier than other treats.  She loves them because they are good.  That's all that matters.  By the way you can't beat the price.

review/summary: Holly's Oatmeal is Just Average Oatmeal
review/text: I tried this oatmeal after reading positive reviews and listening to the sales pitch of a home shopping TV host. It's OK oatmeal. Sure, in comparison to instant oatmeal, loaded withi sugar, it's better. But any whole oatmeal product from the health food store, or even Quaker oatmeal (not the instant) is just as good. Holly's oatmeal contains bits of dried fruit and nuts which is not that big of a deal. Any steel cut oatmeal or even Quaker whole oats can be made with fresh fruit, and a sprinkling of flax, nuts, or anything you desire to make a hearty healthful bowl. Holly's is over-rated. Holly sure has some gig going for herself. I rate it average, not better, than other types of oatmeal except for the instant kind.

review/text: I hope Amazon has Holly's oatmeal available for a very long time because I am seriously hooked on it! The directions say to make it with milk, but I make it with water to reduce the (Weight Watchers) Points value to 3. I serve it with a little bit of sugar free maple syrup on top, and it's so delicious and filling. I made it with milk once and it was absolutely to die for. Holly's is naturally sweet, and the cranberries and almonds add a wonderful tanginess and texture.

Flax seeds are really good for you, they could be eaten whole, but if you grind them in a coffee grinder and eat within 15 minutes they will provide all omega 3,6,9, and bunch of fiber at the same time.<br />I like to add mine to yogurt, smoothies and sprinkle on salads.

review/summary: Organic Whole Flaxseed
review/text: The product came well wrapped in 12 - 14 OZ packets.  The product was fresh and the expiration dates on all packages were out into 2011.  The 14 oz packages are easy to store and are about the right size to last a month.  And best of all the price was reasonable.  My wife and I grind flaxseed every morning and put it into a glass of orange juice to boost our intake of Omega 3.  If you buy flax, get the whole seed not the pre-ground meal.  The pre-ground meal will not provide the freshest Omega 3 oils.

review/summary: B-V sauce: the best of the best
review/text: I first bought BV sauce in 1965 in Amarillo, Texas. Then in '66 I came to Dallas.  BV sauce was still on the shelves back on those days. In the 1970's is when I found it difficult to find at the stores. In fact I was out from 1977 to 1980; then on a trip to Oklahoma I had to stop in a small town for a bathroom break and glory-B, this little store had 37 bottles of BV sauce. They all had dust on their tops, and I bought them all. One of the happiest days of my life. This was before the internet so it was not easy to run down our beloved Manufacturer, but I did. It took several months to find them.  I have not been out since!!!. I buy 3 or 4 cases at a time. I only use 1 or 2 bottles a month but my friends love it when I give them a little sauce on their birthday or whatever day. Great PR.<br /><br />I brush B-V sauce on the top and bottom of all my grilled steaks.<br /><br />Now here is my favorite recipe. Butter, not fake stuff, and B-V sauce 2/3 butter 1/3 B-V and put this mix on a portabella mushroom...... be generous.  Bake it, broil it, grill it,  steam it. Your choice, just do not let the mushroom dry out and get a crusty bottom. If you serve this with grilled steak, you will throw a lot of steak away as you eat the portabella first.<br /><br />B-V sauce is a cooks dream

review/summary: PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT LIKE PIZZA CRUST
review/text: BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are expecting a rising pizza crust, such as what you might get from standard pizza dough, then you'll need to look elsewhere.  That being said, these are pretty good in their own right.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I rather like the way these pizza crusts taste after being toasted up.  They soak in flavor from sauce or cheese well, without becoming soggy or wilted.  They have a good bread flavor on their own, also, and make a good base for a BBQ chicken or BBQ pulled pork pizza.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />I think the texture is the only thing I can complain about with these - the Schar Crusts are a little more dense than I would like.  However, this is a usual complaint about all gluten-free items.<br /><br />SIZE<br />These are definitely personal pizza sized.  With sauce, cheese, and toppings on this crust, I can usually eat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pizza on my own.<br /><br />USES/ VERSATILITY<br />If you can expand your mind beyond making just pizza with red sauce and mozzarella, then these crusts are quite useful.  I personally love them with some BBQ sauce and chicken.  They make a nice bread/ carb base for anything I might otherwise eat on flatbread.  As a gluten-free option, these crusts are a wonderful thing to have at your disposal.

review/summary: Cheap, nutritional, but not vegan.
review/text: I was shopping around for nutritional yeast, and based on the price and the reviews I found online, I decided to go with this brand.  It is definitely packed with nutrients and is a great source of many vitamins and minerals.  It's flavor is good, although this is the first nutritional yeast I've bought, so I can't compare it to other brands.  The smell upon first opening the jar seemed a bit strong, but it wasn't as bad after using it and opening/closing the jar a few times.<br /><br />I am mostly writing this review to let other potential customers know that this product is NOT VEGAN.  I guess everyone defines veganism a little differently, but this nutritional yeast contains whey from milk, so if you don't want to eat dairy, or can't for some health reason, you should be aware of that before you purchase it.  I will quote the ingredients list from another website:<br /><br />"Other Ingredients: Nutritional yeast, calcium carbonate, whey (from milk), magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate monobasic, choline bitartrate, niacinamide, potassium chloride, d-calcium pantothenate, para aminobenzoic acid, bromelain, GTF chromium yeast, inositol, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, selenium yeast, papain, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, sodium chloride, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, biotin, folic aicd, potassium iodide."<br /><br />This is the same as what is on my jars' labels.  You can get the entire nutritional facts and ingredients from the Twinlab website [...]  It's a nice product at a reasonable price in a large quantity.  In fact, it's going to take me a while to go through two pounds of it (how much yeast can a guy eat?).  When I finally do finish it, I won't be ordering again due to the dairy, but if that doesn't bother you, I would actually recommend this product as it seems to be a good deal.  I gave it four stars because the dairy thing was really my fault.  I should have done some more research of my own.<br /><br />Happy shopping.

review/summary: Power-Packed Nurtition
review/text: Brewers yeast is loaded with many essential nutrients.  It is packed with nutrition.  I especially love this Yeast Plus product as it is even more loaded with vitamins and minerals.  Brewers yeast is not something to write home about as far as taste goes.  So, I mix a heaping tablespoon into my smoothie every time I make one which is several times a week.  That covers up the taste.  I especially take this product because it is loaded with B vitamins and potassium.  Though brewers yeast is not great tasting, another advantage of this product over others is that it seems to have a much milder flavor.  Sure, it's not ice cream, but it will do a whole lot more to benefit your health and well-being.

review/text: Bought the 2 pack to try this tea out.  My wife and I both like the flavor and richness (quality) of this tea.  I recently started a low oxalate diet to prevent kidney stones.  I can only drink oolong, green or white teas (according to the DR).  I now have a case of Organic Black Tea to give away as gifts at Christmas.

review/summary: Yummy Good!
review/text: I appreciated being able to purchase this item over the internet.  I live in a very small town and do not get into larger areas to shop very often.  This item is something not carried in small convenience stores.  I like the item because it is sugar free and fat free making it a good drink when a person is watching calories.<br /><br />I have used the product for quite some time and, in the past, was able to buy it in a canister.  I have not been able to find the canister packaging for this item for a long time and would really prefer that because so much of the purchase price wouldn't go to packaging.<br /><br />Thanks so much for sending this item out so quickly.

review/summary: One of the best seasoning sauces around
review/text: Maggi Seasoning Sauce, or just Maggi for short, is a staple in most of my friends households.  It is similar to typical soy sauce, except it has a much bolder and more flavorful taste.  It adds that little extra pizzazz to almost anything!  I eat it mainly with asian dishes, but the possibilities for this sauce are endless.  Add a splash to a beef marinade,  a few drops to your pot of soup, or just a dash on your chicken and rice, and your taste buds will be thanking you.  If you've never tried Maggi sauce then I really suggest you give it a shot!

review/text: I have been using Maggi seasoning for years. I have introduced several friends to it after they were raving about the food I served them. I use it in soups, brown gravy and a few squirts over pasta when you have no gravy will do the trick.<br />My oriental friend switched to this product and abandoned her soy sauce altogether. Also try Aromat seasoning over veggies to enhance the flavor of each vegetable.

review/text: This is the king of all Kool-Aid flavors. I used to be a fan of the original cherry flavor, that was, until I discovered this flavor. The original cherry was/is too artificial to me and too tart. But the black cherry flavor, it's quite different. It's like squeezed chilled ripe cherry and your mouth just soaks all the juices. It leaves you smacking and has a much more natural flavor.<br /><br />The recipe calls for 1 packet and a cup of sugar in 2 quarts. But I am a man, and a man demands flavor. So I mix 2 packets and cup of sugar in 3 quarts. You can substitute the recipe for Splenda.

review/text: My gf and I did a taste test of this and Kool-Aid Twists Blastin' Berry Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZED2M">Kool-Aid Twists Blastin' Berry Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.17-Ounce Packets (Pack of 96)</a>).<br /><br />The Black Cherry has a richer darker color. We found it hard to pick a favorite flavor as they are both good. I preferred the Black Cherry while my gf preferred the Blastin' Berry Cherry. We will probably alternate the two.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste. We have changed to using slightly less than 8 cups of water to make the taste richer. We have also increased the Splenda to 12 packets to make it sweeter.

review/summary: Made both my dogs vomit and eat less.
review/text: We switched to this food from Purina One because the ingredients are advertised to be of much higher quality, and we wanted to improve our dogs' diet. We made a smooth transition to this food by slowly mixing it in with their existing food, as vets recommend. Once the transition was complete, they were vomiting their meals several times per week, which they had never done before the switch. We continued to feed them this food for about a month to see if it changed, and they still have problems keeping it down. I often see them eating grass to induce vomiting as well, so I think its giving them a stomach ache. They also got to the point where they just didn't want to eat the food at all sometimes, which I've never seen them do. We switched to Newman's Own dog food now, and they're eating much better already.<br /><br />I wish I had done some research on this food before purchasing it. Type "Wellness dog food vomit" into Google, and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.

Wellness keeps my beagle regular with no indigestion or diarrhea. I've tried switching to cheaper brands, but they leave him gassy, listless, and constipated. My dog isn't crazy about the taste. Of course, he'd prefer canned or, even better, table scraps. But he does eat the Wellness, and it keeps him healthy.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: A sub-par version of store bought Wellness
review/text: We've been buying this exact formula of Wellness for our Cocker Spaniel "Lucy" for over a year now.  We thought that it would be worth purchasing on Amazon since it was priced almost identically and it would be more convenient than going to Petsmart since it would be delivered to our front door.  We didn't receive the food for well over a week after we ordered it so we were forced to buy a small bag at the store until we received the food.  No big deal...we figured next time we'll just order it a couple of weeks in advance so that Lucy's food supply isn't as low and we have plenty until we get the next bag.  After feeding her two meals of the bag we got from Amazon, Lucy started having violent diarrhea.  I'm familiar with the fact that changing foods can cause an upset stomach with dogs but this is the exact same food we have been feeding her for a very long time.....or so we thought.  We knew that the only thing that changed in Lucy's diet was the fact that we ordered the food from Amazon.  So we went and bought another small bag of the same stuff from Petsmart.  Much to our disappointment, there was an obvious difference in the appearance of the food.  The bag from Amazon had chunks that were misshaped, very porous and even smelled different.  Our conclusion was that Amazon received the reject bags at a discount and sold them as the same product.  We then stopped feeding Lucy the Amazon bag and switched her back to the store bought bag.  Immediately her bowls improved.  Although we were refunded for our purchase we had to jump through a few hoops that weren't worth the time we wasted to do so.  Please reconsider before you purchase this food.  Wellness is an Amazing product and we're proud to feed our little Lucy the best food that we possibly can but this is not up to the quality that Wellness is known for.  I'm going to post pics of both the Amazon bought food and the Store bought food so that you can see the difference.

review/text: My dog has severe allergies as well as a sensitive stomach. After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble.  Well, let me say...I'm disappointed.  It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching.  The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my "stomach of steel" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.<br /><br />While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this. Could it be just my dog, sure. But all in all, if you're looking for a magic cure, sorry to say this isn't the one it's hyped to be.

review/text: I have had my German Shepherd on Canidae (chicken) since she was a puppy and did wonderful. Well, Canidae had a recall last winter & I had to switch her, so I tried Wellness (chicken).  I have to say, I am really disappointed with this dog food. Besides her not really liking it, her breathe smells bad, has very loose to diarrhea stools, and she has been licking her paws & shaking her head like her ears are bugging her ( which she never has done before and that is a sign of allergies). I noticed the chicken formula is back on the market and I will for sure be switching.

review/summary: Incorrect Ingredients
review/text: The ingredients listed are NOT for this particular recipe! The lamb, barley mix does not include chicken as this page indicates. Love the potato, whitefish mix by the way. My 12 yr old is doing well on it.

review/summary: Dog Food was excellent - but, don't count on it...
review/text: Our dog has many allergies, and - finally - we found a dog food that he can tolerate.  Happy Days!!  But, Wellness wasn't selling enough of the Salmon and Rice - so, they took if off the market.  No Warnings, no advice to begin to seek out an alternative - just, gone.  He is now vomiting on the Wellness replacement - and we're seeking yet another alternative - but, it won't be from this company.
