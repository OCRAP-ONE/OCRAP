review/summary: Only One Cup Needed
review/text: This coffee is ok...if you truly love cinnamon. I can only take one cup and then I am done with that. I would buy if one or two were in a multi-variety pack but I will never buy it in a package alone. I did share some cups with my sister, niece and a couple of friends and they all had the same opinion..only one cup needed.

review/summary: weak???
review/text: This flavor was a little weak on cinnamon...or it just might be me!!! I had to add a dash extra cinnamon to my cup to get the flavor I like. The coffee note was very good though and if it was not a flavored coffee I would give it a higher score.

review/summary: This is a great tasting coffee
review/text: I love this coffee.  It isn't a super dark roast and there is just the right amount of cinnamon.  Its a coffee you can drink everyday or keep around for that special occasion.  If you are in love with the darker roast or extra bold coffee flavors this isn't the one for you as it has that great coffee taste without the charred taste of over roasted coffee beans.

review/summary: cinnamon coffee
review/text: I found this particular brand to be very weak tasting.  Not only that, but I could not even taste any cinnamon.  At first I brewed the 10 oz. cup size, which was way too weak, and then I brewed the 8 oz. cup size, which did little to improve the boldness or flavor.  One of the weakest brews I have ever tried.

review/text: I LOVE the flavor of this coffee but my normal portion size on my Keurig Brewer must be changed to the next smaller size down or it's like drinking water.<br /><br />The flavor with the smaller portion is really delicious so it's worth having a smaller cup.

review/summary: Not So Good..
review/text: I really wanted to like this flavor of K-Cups but it's just not that good. It smells incredible when it's brewing but I think that because this isnt a true flavored coffee you come in thinking its going to taste sweet. Its bitter to me and even the  undertones of the cinnamon seem a little tart. I tried even putting creamer and sugar and still found it to be too bitter. I love the regular and deacaff versions(unflavored) of Donut House coffee but this is not too good.

review/summary: GOOD but not Great
review/text: The reason I bought this " besides the three 5 star reviews " was my wife and I love fresh Wild Nova Scotia Canadaian salmon in a dairy package that we get in our local supermarket. We thought this would be similar with the convenience of a spread in a small can.<br /><br />When we received the Pate we tried it and it did not taste very good and possibly thought it might be out of date. We could not figure out the date on the can so we called the company up. They told us the 3rd number of the 5 stamped on top of the can was the year it was made. The 3rd number on my can was 6 meaning it was made in 2006. They also said that you should not use it after 3 years of that date. My cans where nearly 5 years old. I must say they where extremely nice and helpful considering Amazon is the one that shipped the out of date cans. They said to throw my cans out and they would send me 4 more, which they did.<br /><br />When we received the new cans, we tried it and yes it did taste much better. But my wife and I both agree it definitely was nothing we would call great, it seemed slightly fishy and did not have a natural flavor even though it is all natural. We did try mixing it with cream cheese which we thought gave it a more pleasant flavor. Because of the three 5 star reviews is the reason I bought it, obviously we have different tastes.<br /><br />We much prefer the Vita Wild Nova Scotia Canadaian salmon Family Pack or most other Nova Salmon from our local supermarket. Per weight its price is about 1/3rd less than the Pate, plus it has less than half the calories, nearly no fat, cholesterol or carbs.<br /><br /> Note ::: This Pate is made with wild smoked salmon which is not the same as Nova salmon " Lox " which does not have a fishy taste.<br />.

review/summary: Yummy - IF you like salmon and don't expect too much
review/text: Bought these to try and boost the fish in my diet.  I'm used to smoked salmon in strips, so a paste seemed quite novel.  I used these in sandwiches I take to work.  In a word, yummy!  They are a lot subtler and closer to salmon taste than other fish pastes/spreads/pates out there.  They also don't stink and irritate your coworkers.  (There is a bit of a smell but nothing like opening a can of tuna.  If I ate them in my office kitchen instead of at my desk, no one would notice.)  The spread itself is quite moist and easily spread.  It shows great protein content and is only 330 calories/can.  One can made about 4-5 sandwiches regularly.<br /><br />BUT, keep in mind this is a FISH PATE! It's going to taste like, well, FISH!  It is most definitely NOT like cat food - trust me, I have 3 cats to prove it.  Just set your expectations and you will be happy.  But don't buy it if you don't like fish.<br /><br />Overall, two thumbs up.  I ordered more.

review/text: SEABEAR SMOKED SALMON PATE CAN, 3.5-Ounce Wild Alaska Sockeye Salmon, is VERY tasty.  That said, however, it does NOT taste like NOVA salmon, ("lox"), as I hoped it would have.  It tastes basically like what it is: wild-caught, dry smoked salmon, with a lot of salt, plus other ingredients.  The salt is ingredient number 2 -- so there's a lot of salt in it.  It could taste better, it's true....but once started, it was hard for me, at least, to stop!  Yummy in its own way.....<br /><br />I think I'll try other types of smoked salmon pate before I go back to the SeaBear brand of smoked salmon pate, (or try to make some myself.)  But I won't rule out buying it again...  Though it doesn't taste exactly as I would have wanted it to taste, it still does taste very, very good!<br /><br />U P D A T E.................H O W could I forget?  VITA brand makes a WONDERFUL smoked-salmon-cream cheese combination, with REAL LOX!  THAT is the type for me!  I'm going to get some of that soon, at my local Waldbaum's.  (Waldbaum's is a famous New York supermarket, now owned by A&P, who graciously allowed their Waldbaum's subsidiary to keep it's own name.  Probably because Waldbaum's supermarkets always hada "family feeling" about them...and in fact, Julia Waldbaum, wife of the originator of Waldbaum's supermarkets, used to famously drop in at all the branches of her store!)  I hope too, to be able to order it soon, from Amazon as well!  And that everyone who wants to, will be able to, as well!

I use the hard ones in cooking hot breakfast cereal or baking so I don't mind as much as if I had bought this entirely for eating.  Will I purchase these again? Absolutely. The price is right and since I use them mainly for cooked breakfast cereals and baking I don't mind the hard ones.  And the soft ones? Well, I LOVE eating those just as they are.

review/summary: Good price for dates
review/text: We usually get the Mariani dates, which comes in one big bag.  I saw this when I searched on Amazon for dates and thought I'd give the Sun Maid dates a try since they were less expensive (by per ounce cost).<br /><br />I love plump, soft, sweet dates.  Not soft enough to smear and not al dente.  In a bag of Mariani, I'd say about 40 to 50% fit the bill.<br /><br />In these Sun-Maid bags, about 20 to 30% deliver the perfect luscious plump goodness.  Many are just a little harder than I like and some are close to dessicated.  Very few are so soft that they're smeared onto another date.<br /><br />That doesn't mean that they aren't good (except for the very dry ones).  They are sweet and delicious and my 3 year old asks for some every night as an after dinner treat.  I just wish they were softer.<br /><br />I like the convenient small bag size and I would buy them again for snacking (considering our budget), but with a mind to put the harder ones aside for baking.

The second problem is that the packaging is not clear - so you cannot see clearly inside. Food packaging should always have clear windows so you can note the quality of the product before opening the package. I prefer dry dates and this product did not meet my needs (some consumers complained about dry dates - but I got mostly rather soft dates - ones artificially humidified which in turn probably caused the growth of fungus in one of my pouches).

review/summary: Hits the spot
review/text: I first tasted the Gold Kili ginger tea at a local Thai restaurant. I loved it and after ordering pot after pot asked the waiter what brand they used. Since the restaurant billed it as a tea, I was slightly surprised to get the shipment and realize tea wasn't involved and that the packets resembled a mix. Don't let that concern you - the ginger drink tastes awesome. When piping hot, I notice the honey taste more and as it cools down ginger becomes the predominant flavor. Ignore the preparation directions - you can easily get a whole pot out of one packet.

Sometimes I'll disolve it in club soda and it tasts very much like ginger beer. It is quite strong and I've offered it to some people who didn't like it because of that, but that's one of the reasons I like it so much. Compared to other similar products, Gold Kili is the best.  It's the only one I found where ginger is listed as the first ingrediant and not sugar.

Traveling was impossible. Ginger has tremendous healing qualities to it. My incision on my back has healed 2x faster than it should have because I am diabetic and had to heal the old fashion way. Ginger tea has saved me, helped me heal very fast and prevented me from having infections. It's a bit bitter but you get used to it, esp if you drink unsweetened tea.

But, no worries, each tea bag is nicely sealed in an aluminum paper-like bag which are all then sealed again in a larger aluminum paper-like bag.  I'm tell'in you this stuff could last through the Great Tribulation and still be fresh.

review/text: I have a female 1 year old Ragdoll named BB. She comes from 7 generations of champions, all which have been raised on Royal Canin. We all love her and would buy whatever she needs. As with most cats, she LOVES moist canned cat food and eats dry fine but doesn't scarf it down. However, when we put this dry Royal Canin in front of her, it's as if we opened a can of her favorite wet cat food! I don't have to tell you the health benefits since Royal Canin is a industry leader in high quality healthful cat food! The fact that our champion Ragdoll acts like dinner is a special treat makes this cat food worth every penny you pay for it! Best of all there is a formula for just about any cat!

review/summary: They just keep getting softer!
review/text: I have two Burmese cats, and both of them are being or were raised on this kitten formula (one is 13 months, the other is 8 months).  They have been on it since they were 4 months old.  I did a lot of research into food recommended by my breeder since we spent a lot of money on the cats.  I ultimately decided on this brand because of the research they have done.  I plan on putting both of them on the Persian formula (that is for Himalayans and Burmese too) because these types of cats are prone to getting a certain type of UTI and need their urine a different pH.<br />Their fur has never been softer, they are so active and always chasing each other, they are very playful with us.  We always comment on how soft the older one is, just like a pillow, and the younger one is getting closer every day.  They eat the food I leave out for them every day, so I'm assuming it is satisfying.  I just love this brand and plan on sticking with them, even when we get dogs.

review/text: The first can I opened contained one (yes one!) jumbo whole oyster (about 1.5") and the remainder were chunks of oysters. These weren't whole and then broke into pieces during the canning process, these were chunks that were packed along with the only large oyster in the can! No way you can fit many jumbo oysters in these tuna-sized cans. It would have been better to put these jumbo oysters in one big square can and arrange them like your typical canned smoked oysters and charge $26/can.  For now the consumers would have to settle with the chunks, not whole giant oysters as one would expect for about $7 a pop. Not worth it at all.

review/summary: Great Smoked Oysters
review/text: I tried a can of SeaBear Smoked Pacific Oysters when I ordered some other stuff directly from SeaBear. I loved the oysters and when I found them on Amazon the price was really good especially with the subscription. The oysters are caught in the Northwest USA and smoked. I appreciate SeaBear and their standards used in catching their fish. I feel good supporting USA fishermen instead of smoked oysters from Thailand or some other place. These oysters have no oil added and are actually really smoked. I eat them directly out of the can and the cans are super easy to open (no can opener required). They make a great snack and oysters are also high in the mineral zinc. I am not huge on shell fish, but these are definitely worth getting. Very happy with the price at Amazon as they are $9 a can elsewhere and I really can't afford that as much as I like these. The cans are packed full of smoked oysters and big enough to serve a couple people a snack or use in a recipe. I want to try a can in a pasta dish.

I tried them on crackers.. pasta... loved it all, but right out of the can, perfect. I am not into smoked stuff... but this turned me in to a whole new direction. The price is great, I am trying another brand from the same area, so we shall see. I cannot get enough. And my cans had at least 80% whole 1.5" oytsers so maybe the other person got a bad batch.

Just a little dab on a saltine cracker will turn you into a fire-breathing dragon!  What's nice is when you first taste it, you actually get nice flavor since the heat won't kick in until a few seconds later.  If you're looking for a hot sauce to get you that extra kick in your meat, soups, chili, curry, or virtually anything, this is the way to go.  I am not disappointed whatsoever.  Oh and please do use it a drop at a time; don't be stupid and die of diarrhea.

review/text: My son requested this bottle of Hot Sauce for a Christmas present as he LOVES it! So this review is not for the taste as obviously people who like HOT sauces will like this. My son would obviously give the "taste" 5 stars<br /><br />My review is more for the INACCURATE or deceiving description on this particular item # as the bottle is ONLY 5 liquid ounces. The description above says: "Item Weight: 6.1 oz" and the Shipping Weight: 1.0 pound. Most people (I think) will ASSUME the bottle contains 6.1 ounces as I did. For $11.87 was hoping for the full 6.1 oz!<br /><br />Just a heads up! (a little high priced for the shipping cost as it's just in a cardboard tube (9" long x 2 1/2" diameter) enough to cover the size of the bottle. I could not find this item anywhere in stores around me in Wisconsin so guess that's the price ya gotta pay unless you know of another source.<br /><br />Thanks for the opportunity Amazon to add my 2 cents.

review/summary: "Liquid death"?
review/text: I was treated to this a year ago by one of my college roomies. It quickly became a symbol of manliness in our suite. Fast forward almost a year. Nothing is as hot and I'm craving what wrecked my mouth and tongue with only one drop. From the minute you first open the bottle, give it a quick smell, you realize, you are about to question what you are bout to do. This goes on everything, simply because as soon as you get a taste, you taste anything else. Your mouth is on fire. You have tears running down your face. Your noise is running like a faucet. Giving a sample to my friend's at home has dubbed the ghost pepper sauce as "Liquid Death." Let's not be fooled here, this does have a flavor before the heat hits you like a locomotive. I'd like to describe it as a sweet smoky flavor. And that's probably the most addicting aspect of this sauce, trying to taste that part again before you can't taste anything right for the next day or so. This stuff makes me burp almost instantly, fantastic. I once had too much on a burrito, felt my heart beating like crazy. I was afraid I wasn't going to survive it! This stuff is more than worth the price of admission to pain land!

The 16 oz is a good size if you cook for 1 or 2.  For a larger family, I'd recommend the 32 oz size.

review/text: I was very happy to see this product at Amazon. I particularly appreciate the 16 oz. size and the fact that it is in an aseptic container, as I can taste a faintly "tinny" quality to the broth in cans.<br /><br />This is a great, quick base for homemade soups and sauces, and is a wonderful substitute for water in many recipes.  I sometimes boil potatoes in it before mashing them, and use it for steaming rice.  It is wonderful for deglazing pans.  It is a permanent part of my pantry -- so much so that I ordered it on subscription service.

review/text: Swanson makes many versions of chicken broth and normally I'd go straight for the organic version of just about anything if available but in this case the Natural Goodness version is the best of the bunch. The chicken flavor is light (think broth NOT stock) and well balanced and makes a great base for the simplest of things like basic chicken soup with very little "doctoring up". Also works the best in my recipes if I can't make homemade. It's lower sodium without tasting bland. A pretty much perfect chicken broth.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: this chicken broth actually provides a good base for lots of recipes. one thing i really like is making stuffing with this broth - part broth and part water - it gives a nice kick to the stuffing and the family loves it. course, it's not the only thing you can use this broth in, it has a nice flavor and you can use it for lots of other stuff too.

review/summary: Swanson Broth -- the staple of a Southern kitchen
review/text: Swanson Chicken Broth is a great product and a definite for the Southern kitchen.  I love these resealable containers although there are so many uses for Swanson Chicken Broth that you really won't find yourself having any leftover broth!  This particular product has less sodium which lends itself well to cooking.  Swanson's truly has the best chicken broth and using it can make a difference in the taste of your finished product.  If you need a quick throw together meal after a long day at work, warm up some broth and add some cornstarch (2T) (pre-mixed with water); add frozen peas and carrots and a can of chicken;  mix all together and pour into a refrigerator pie crust.  Bake at 375 until the crust is brown (about 30 minutes).  You'll have a delicious chicken pot pie without much effort.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.
review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/text: My wife brought this home from the store the other day and I was amazed at the amount of sugar in them.  Every calorie in this comes from sugar.  While Gerber doesn't add sugar, apples are naturally very sweet, they do sweeten the apples by placing them in a white grape concentrate.  The taste is far too sweet to give to a 10+ month old.

review/summary: Disappointment
review/text: Being of Italian heritage, I was enticed by the romantic notion of starting my day with some real Italian coffee... I use a stovetop espresso (moka) maker. I received the four pack of Lavazza Rossa bricks very quickly, but to my disappointment, the expiration date on the bricks was impossible to understand. I received the packs on May 20th, 2011 and the two different numbers on the bottom of the bag read "AP1610" and "30081Z" (yes, "Z"). So, either the bags were over a year past expiration, or "1Z" means 12. Not sure. Oh well, I thought, I'll give it a whirl... The coffee was not bad. But, it was no better than Safeway's own Franch Roast beans from the bin that I have been grinding myself for years. This coffee is not worth the extra money (or, was it expired?). I'm still irritated that the company would be so unclear about the expiration date. I won't order this product again. Spudoratos!

review/summary: Forgot How Good This Coffee Really Is
review/text: I lived in Europe for a year and a half and drank this coffee almost daily.  I would drink Lavazza and Illy almost exclusively.  Since moving back to the US in January 2008 I have been drinking sub-par American coffee.  The usual suspects, Green Mountain, Starbucks, Newman's Own, Seattle's Best, etc.  I didn't remember what quality coffee tasted like and so I continued to drink these coffees pretending they were good.  It was not until I ordered Lavazza and brewed it in my French Press that I remembered what real coffee was supposed to taste like.<br /><br />This espresso roast is nearly perfect.  It is strong, but not bitter.  It tastes of dark chocolate and smokey wood.  And the best thing of all is the price on Amazon.  There's simply no reason to drink crappy American coffee.  Do yourself a favor and order this today.  If you like good, strong, European coffee, you'll love this.  Illy is probably a little bit better, but at $13 for 8.8 ounces it is just too expensive for what you get.  This is nearly as good, for a third of the price.

Other Lavazza coffee just wasn't the same so I was thrilled when I discovered it for sale through Amazon.  It doesn't seem to be quite the same as I remember it but it is close enough for it to become my normal morning coffee choice again.  It has a rich, dark chocolate flavor, with a hint of sweetness and can be made weak or strong and still taste good.  Whenever I serve it to guests, they always ask me what coffee I use.  It is delicious and their Lava Dec decaffeinated coffee is the best decaffeinated coffee I have tried.

review/summary: Good Coffee, but not espresso grind
review/text: Ok, so I'm a huge fan of Arabica, and I needed something temporary while a part for my grinder is on delivery. So I ordered this in hopes of having something good enough to use for Espresso without having to regrind. . .<br /><br />First, the beans are pretty good. Very full body, and holding true to that Arabica taste and smell I've grown to love in a nice medium roast. However, I was quite disappointed when I saw the grind quality. The grind is fine enough for drip coffee, french press, and Moka very well. But for pressurized espresso machines, it was a nightmare trying to generate enough pressure, even with a 50lb tamp on my puck.<br /><br />Again, the beans a GREAT smell and taste, and will do perfect for Drip, Moka, and French Press. However, I needed them to be much finer of a grind to achieve good espresso results. I wanted to put this out there just incase someone had a question about the grind size. I'll upload a photo later showing it on white paper.

review/summary: Great Coffee - Beware Pierced Packages
review/text: This is very good coffee and makes excellent Espresso, especially if you use a stove stop Espresso maker. I use a 6 cup Espresso maker with two heaped tea spoons of coffee to make a full mug full, topped off with fat free Half & Half. Yum.<br /><br />It's strong (obviously), full flavored and very smooth. One of the best coffees I have ever tasted and so reasonably priced. I've been buying this stuff for years, drink a mug or two every morning and it never gets old. In fact, I look forward to my coffee each morning.<br /><br />I've recently starting buying it from Amazon because my local World Market closed down. Both my orders so far have contained one brick which was pierced. All the other bricks were solid and hard to the touch because their vacuum seal was still intact. However, the one brick was soft to the touch because the seal had been compromised somewhere.<br /><br />The first time this happened, I put it down to bad luck and just one of those things. However, my second order suffered the same problem. I'm not a big fan of pierced packages. For one, you don't know what pierced it and for another, the flavor won't be as good because air has got into the package.<br /><br />I don't know if Amazon themselves received it like this or if something happened to it after Amazon stored it in their facility. Either way, not good.<br /><br />5 stars for the coffee. 3 stars for the less than perfect packaging. 4 stars overall.

This is by far a perfect blend for my taste and in my opinion superior to Illy.

review/summary: The ground espresso blend I have found so far
review/text: I bought DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker several weeks ago and have been searching for the best espresso blend in order to recreate the experience of drinking great espresso drinks in Italy and Spain. My personal favorite is cafe con leche as they make it in Spain, where they mix espresso and milk (half and half) and the resulting cup of coffee is strong but has no bitterness whatsoever and no unpleasant aftertaste. So far, I tried 3 Italian espresso blends:<br />1) Danesi Classic (this is a dark roast, came out very bitter, no matter what I did. I hate bitterness so I had to throw it out).<br />2) Musetti Caffe Macinato Espresso (red brick) - a bit better than Danesi, but also a bit bitter; average aroma. I was not impressed.<br />3) LavAzza Qualita Rossa - this was exactly what I was looking for: strong, but not bitter. I had wonderful aroma and the classic European taste. I want to also try the various Kimbo blends, as I heard those are also very good. But this Lavazza Rossa will be hard to beat. Cappuccino or espresso from Starbucks does not even come close! I highly recommend this blend.

review/text: Based on reviews I decided to try this, and panicked when I received it and the expiration date appeared to be April 2010.  Things became worse when I tried to do an automated return, and found it wasn't possible, not with coffee. Thank goodness for Amazon Customer Service Chat!  (Something I have never needed before but was thrilled to find they had under CONTACT US).<br /><br />The rep explained to me the following pasted from the chat: "The date is the production date, not the expiration date.  The first letters is the lot number, the next letter is the production month (A=Jan, B=Feb, etc.). The product has a two year shelf life. For a package with the date "API610," the expiration date is September 16th, 2012. The 'best by' date is printed on the left in the format: ddmmyy."<br /><br />My code was AP1710.  I wasn't sure how P=Sept since P is the 16th letter in the alphabet and Sept is the 9th month.  But on the left, the code was 300812, so the expiration is August 30, 2012.  Somehow the Italian math works.<br /><br />Opened the coffee and Yum!  Great product.

review/summary: wonderful tasting coffee, the best
review/text: I always use a melitta cup for making any espresso coffee and this one is just delicious. I checked my ph strip and it does not register as acid. It doesn't bother my stomach at all and I am super sensitive to anything acid. American coffee I have a hard time tolerating; the Italian and Kenya coffees that are dark roast espresso are thought by some people via their processing techniques and quality to be alkaline. It makes the American coffee look like junk for how the body responds and the taste. Once you have had this coffee you won't want American coffee anymore as it is not bitter.<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering what a melitta cup is, it is a cone made from plastic or ceramic (mine is ceramic) and it has a hole at the bottom. I adjust the coffee filter to fit it and then put the espress coffee in it and then pour my hot water from the tea kettle into it. I add a little nut milk into the coffee and I am ready to enjoy a wonderful taste. It beats dealing with a coffee maker any day. Each person in the family can have their own melitta cup as it is so quick to do.

review/summary: Great coffee for the price
review/text: Really enjoyed ordering and using this coffee. Reminds me of expresso in coffee shops throughout italy. I've never really used pre-packed coffee before as I've always preferred freshly ground. However, this taste fresh and yummy. Great head, not bitter, but still has good depth. Will continue to order every time I need more coffee.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Love Lavazza
review/text: I have been hooked onto this coffee ever since I was living in the UK many years ago and got introduced to Lavazza. It's dark, aromatic, nutty, but mild flavour simply tastes like heaven in your mouth. I can't drink any other coffee anymore. I'm glad amazon is selling the same Lavazza I'm used to. It saves me a trip to my local Italian bakery and I always have it in stock!

review/summary: Crema e gusto
review/text: I have tried both lavazza crema e gusto and this one, the Rossa.<br />Rossa has an infusion of choclate flavour,which is good if you like your coffee mixed with other flavours.<br />But if you just want pure coffee flavour(heaven) ,you cannot beat crema e gusto.I have never been to star bucks since I bought my espresso maker.In fact I dread to drink starbucks etc.

review/summary: Excellent quality and taste
review/text: Rossa from Lavazza is one of the best coffees on the market.  I am used to grinding my own beans to ensure freshness, but with Rossa this is no longer necessary.  It has an intense flavor and wonderful consistency.  A taste of Italy.
