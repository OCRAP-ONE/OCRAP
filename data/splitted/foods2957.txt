review/summary: Best Tiramisu - confirmed by an Italian
review/text: My wife and I are from Italy. She makes the best Tiramisu (family recipe), and she *only* uses Pavesini.<br />Even in Italy, some people use a different type of cookie ('savoiardi'), thicker and larger. But we find that Pavesini make the Tiramisu lighter and more enjoyable.<br />Hundreds of friends have praised her recipe over the years. Kids love it. Trust me, it's the real deal.

review/text: These little chocolate squares are absolutely delicious. The product was perfectly fresh, the packaging is easy to open and the taste is fantastic. There is just enough salt to provide a great counterpoint to the sweetness of the chocolate. After the first day, I had to force myself to take two out of the bag and put the others away or I'd have gone through a bunch more. Highly recommended.

review/text: Out of all of the Crystal Light flavors, Strawberry Orange Banana is my favorite. For some odd reason, I can no longer find this flavor in stores. I live in Southern California and it's only available online. I'm so glad that I can order it through amazon.com and at a discount! It's even less expensive when I order it on a monthly basis.

review/summary: Best Crystal Light flavor by far
review/text: I'm glad I can still find this flavor of Crystal Light online, because it seems to have disappeared from most stores. After trying several other flavors, including many of the newer ones, I'm convinced that this is the best Crystal Light flavor by far. It has less of the sugar-free aftertaste of most products, and amazingly enough, it's even pretty good warm. For the best flavor, I mix it with a little less water than called for (about 7.25 cups of water instead of 8). You have to like this kind of drink in general, but if you do, this one's a winner.

review/text: Product seems to function as advertised but it should have been made clearer that this unit is not water tight and cannot be mounted out in the weather.  The 12 volt power and small size lead me to believe it was water tight and outside mountable.  I used a plastic bucket with a lid to mount both the charger and a small 12 volt battery in.  I had to mount the charger upside down in the bucket for easy access to the output terminals and to see the activity indicator.  The mounting system had to be modified to allow upside mounting but all seems to be working perfectly.  Just a few minor modifications to the mounting options and a water tight enclosure would make the SS-2000X fence charger an outstanding device.

review/summary: Great For Cleaning Drip Coffee Makers..
review/text: Heinz Distilled White Vinegar is a wonderful sanitizing product for cleaning most any brand of drip coffee maker. About once every three months I'll run two cups of this through the coffee maker just like brewing coffee. Pour it in the water tank and turn it on. This cleans out the tank and water distribution system inside the coffee maker. After the cleaning, run a fresh pot of water through to clear out the residual vinegar. This should keep your coffee tasting fresh.<br /><br />Please rate this review if you found it helpful.

review/summary: Does vinegar cause cancer?
review/text: The Russians say, no, not by itself but vinegar (acetic acid) increases the deadliness of any cancer-causing nitrosamines in your diet.  Salt and sea salt always contain nitrosamines.  Beef, pork, and poultry always develop nitrosamines (and heterocyclic amines) when they are cooked in normal ways.  Processed meats contain nitrosamines even before they are cooked.  The only way to avoid creating nitrosamines in bloody, raw meat is to boil it in water without adding any salt.  (Please click "Comment" below if you want to read what scientific studies from Russia say about vinegar).  Balsamic vinegar is by far the most delicious of all vinegars but it contains a substantial amount of lead, which is toxic.  The lead comes from the oak wood caskets in Italy in which balsamic vinegar is manufactured.  Distilled white vinegar is made from corn and is very low in lead.  French's Yellow Mustard, Worcestershire Sauce, Heinz Ketchup, and many other commonly consumed foods contain substantial amounts of distilled vinegar in their ingredients.

The pineapple slices might be my favorite, I throw the can in the refrigerator the night before I eat them, makes them taste even better.<br /><br />BPA issue -- Random Native Forest reviews here on amazon had concerns about BPA in the cans so I emailed Edward and Son's (company that makes Native Forest brand) about the cans to find out the truth. The pineapples, pears, and peaches were on the list of BPA free cans that they emailed me back. The asparagus and baby corn that I bought were not, so i stopped buying them.<br /><br />As I did with my review of the peaches, I'll post the list of BPA free cans that I was given in the email in the comments. For those of you who don't care about the BPA issue, you should just know these are delicious.

And since it was hotter than blazes inside, I decided to heat the Ham and roast the asparagus and potatoes on the BBQ.<br />I slathered the Ham with my secret BBQ sauce, placed it on the cooler side of the Grill and about 2 hours later we were all sitting down on the patio with a big, hot, delicious, BBQ'd Ham staring us in the face.<br />The French Rose' was poured, the Meal was consumed and a good time was had by all.

review/summary: Meh..
review/text: Maybe I'm too picky, but I won't be buying this again. I ordered 3 different items at the same time. The other two have been awesome; this one, not so much. Tried it twice now, using a HEAVY coating the second time. Just has no flavor. I was very disappointed, but the no-salt make up of it still earns it 3 stars. My dad, for whom I cook daily, is salt-restricted, and I thought sure this would be a great way to liven up the weekly chicken dishes. Nope. I wound up dumping the whole bottle into my home-made canister of rub...didn't even change the flavor of that! It was no more than "filler" for the home-made stuff, which I guess will at least make it go farther. Like I said, the other stuff I've purchased from these folks is great...I use them almost daily, and am very pleased, but I will stick to making my own rotis-chicken rub.

review/summary: Kikkoman Wakame Soup
review/text: I really like this soup. It's simple to make, just add boiling water, give it a stir, and let it sit for a few minutes.<br /><br />It's also very tasty. It has a fish broth, but to me it doesn't really taste fishy, just slightly salty. If you don't like the salt taste, you can make it less intense by adding more water, which is what I do. The seaweed in this soup has a nice texture, it's not rubbery or anything like that. Just pleasant. The smell might remind you of the sea, but I don't think that's a big surprise. Once you taste it, you get over the smell.<br /><br />It's also conveniant, because I can usually find this soup in the Asian foods aisle of almost any grocery store.

You can add thinly sliced sauteed beef and a small pinch of dried chili flakes to this soup to change it up, but it's perfect just the way it is.<br /><br />If you can visualize yourself taking a long deep breath of ocean air, the briney parfume filling your nasal cavity is the best way to describe your overall taste experience. Plus, it has just the right amount of soft, thin seaweed pieces.<br /><br />My four year old son loves it, he'll ask for two servings when I make it.<br /><br />"Kikkoman Instant Wakame Soup Is A Winner!"

Coke has quite intelligently taken  one of the mixes that many beverage-drinkers have been enjoying for years and made it available as a consistently-mixed, no knife (to peel the lime) needed version!

review/text: These bars would have been perfect had they not been so heavily loaded with sugar. I had better satisfaction with a 3 Musketeers bar, no kidding. Why not a "diet" version, or a diabetic version using artificial sweetener?  Maybe they possibly do fill you up but only for a few minutes...  they set off that blood sugar spike:  Eat one then you want another!  That's the  infamous "high glycemic index" in demonstration for you. When I realized I couldn't maintain with them, I gave them to the whole family. They all went through them super fast.  At least it was a tasty good riddance!  Will be buying any sugar free high protein MR bars instead.

review/summary: good product, satisfies my hunger :)
review/text: I already wrote a review for the chocolate chip ones, though I thought I was writing it for this flavor, so I will just copy and paste. THe both taste good.<br /><br />I bought these bars as a meal replacement, since I am usually hungry about 4 hours after I had lunch, or 2-3 hours after breakfast, so I have to survive before the next meal. This does the job well. I can stay without eating for another 2-3 hours. It also depends how much water you drink, sometimes all you need is water to get rid of the "hunger". It's the way your body tells you you need water as well.<br /><br />My stomach is somewhat sensible and doesn't like a lot of stuff, but these bars never bother me.<br /><br />I also think they are tasty, but only the chocolate ones. I tried the strawberry ones, but they are too creamy. I also liked the chocolate chip ones, they both taste similar, though the chocolate chip ones have more fiber than these ones :P

review/summary: Big fan of these bars.
review/text: These bars are very tasty.  I mean, they're not a candy bar, and they don't taste quite so good as a candy bar.  They are a bit drier on the inside, in particular.  However, they are much more satisfying than a candy bar, and they are still very sweet.  While a single bar is not a whole day's worth of food, one can get by for quite a while on one, without the sugar crash I experience after eating sweets.  The only gripe I have about Special K is that I wish they could have a "diet" option in which they reduce the calorie content with the addition of some artificial sweetners.  Nonetheless, these are the best "meal bars" I have had, and I have tried a bunch of different brands (south beach, atkins, fiber 1, etc.).

review/text: I eat these on a daily basis, they're that good. I can go weeks of having one or two a day until I start getting burned out, and after a couple of days I'm always ready for another. Special K meal bars have just the kick to last those extra two hours at the end of the day, or replace a junky fast-food breakfast. I feel like I've had a lot less problems with fatigue and stress since I've started keeping one handy all the time; when I start to get tired and grouchy I pop one open, get a short jog around the building, and I'm good to go. I go through about 2-3 boxes a month. After hundreds of bars I'd say the taste and texture could be improved just a little, but they're the only bar I've liked so much, while costing so little, that I eat it constantly. Never had a stale one. Get the subscription, it's so worth it.

review/text: I unfortunately work in a job setting where we do not just get to take breaks when we feel like it or snack while working. This can be a problem for me, as I tend to get hungry every two hours and sometimes only get a 10 minute break. These bars are small enough to eat quickly and keep me full til I can have a real meal. They are tasty too!  A bit like a chocolatey rice crispy bar. Only downside is price. On sale they work out to be about a dollar a bar, which is about the same as most protein bars, I just wish I didn't have to resort to an extra $20 a month protein bar to keep my stomach happy.

review/summary: Low fat, high fiber meal replacement bar
review/text: I eat a high protein meal replacement bar every day for breakfast, and I have lost several pounds. The bar is high in protein, which does keep you fuller longer. By lunchtime I am usually pretty hungry, but I can hold out until lunchtime without a problem. They are a bit dry, so I always have a drink on hand while eating them. The chocolate flavor is great, not that cheap tasting chocolate that usually comes with diet products. The bar has a nice chew, but isn't overly chewy, nor does it stick to the teeth. They have a good flavor - not the best bar I have ever eaten as far as taste goes, but better than tolerable for sure. These bars are lower in fat content to some of the Slim Fast meal replacement bars, which is why I tried them in the first place.<br /><br />This high fiber bar will keep you feeling full for several hours, and replacing a meal a day with them does create results. Following their diet plan of two meal replacement bars a day with three snack bars will more than likely increase weight loss from the few pounds I have lost eating one bar a day.

The only issue I have with them is that sometimes the quality is different -- not sure if it's something that happens during manufacturing or afterwards during storage/shipping, but occasionally we'll get some that don't taste as chocolately or are gritty or something.  On the other hand, it helps keep them from all tasting the same.  They're particularly great on the go!

review/text: I was really surprised by how good these taste, as most protein bars tend to be a little bland.  But these are anything but--as another reviewer commented, they almost taste like candy!  The 10g protein is satisfying enough, although lower than most protein/meal bars; the 5g of fiber, however, helps out with filling you up.  They actually have 170 calories, not 190 like Amazon says - not a big difference, but still a nice surprise :)  The bars are also pretty long compared to Luna, Balance, and others, making them a little more of a filling visually, if you know what I mean.  Overall, I like them!

review/summary: Special K...tasty and chocolately  meal replacement
review/text: My supermarket ran out of the Double Chocolate at the old price of $5.99.  When I re-checked again, the price was $7.25 a box.  I got 3 boxes for $19 on Amazon (including shipping) and within 2 days so I think that's an okay deal!  I love these after a workout or before going to the movies.  It curbs my appetite for up to 3 hours so I don't crave food during the movie or raid my freezer after a strenuous workout.  I also like the pink lemonade protein powder but I haven't been able to find that on line.

review/summary: These are awesome!
review/text: So, in my long search for meal bars, I have tried any I have ever seen on the shelves. My general reaction to most of them is that they are like eating cardboard. Also, the "flavor" that most claim to have is not there. So, from childhood I loved double chocolate granola bars. Not healthy at all, but I was a kid. I saw these on the shelf, and decided to try them, despite the many other double chocolate bars I had tried recently. To my surprise, these taste amazing. Has a very chocolaty taste, with no awful after-taste. Also, eating them is just like eating my granola bars I remember...except these are much better for you.<br /><br />I of course don't promote these to people who are on diets that need to watch more than calories, as the fat content and sugars may be a little high for many people. But I can tell you I am male, 5'11", and weigh about 180. This bar with a piece of fruit will keep me full for my entire 5 hour morning.

review/text: When the men are away, the women don't want to cook. These are really great because the taste is good (driiink something with them), they satisfy your hunger for a meal, and they are healthy. Plus it doesn't involve heating anything up or cooking. It's helped me stay at my regular weight because without it, I was just munching all the time because I didn't want to cook.

review/summary: Delicious and filling
review/text: I have tried these and the Chocolate chip and the chocolate caramel.  They are each delicious.  They are the best tasting "protein" bar I have ever tried and I have had many.  These have 10 grams of protein which is plenty to give most people a relatively healthy  snack that also somewhat fills you up.  They each have 170 calories, not the 190 that this product information says.  Now if you are watching sugar carbs, there are 15 grams of those so probably not good for that type of "diet".  In most stores they cost $6.99 per box of 6 so this price of $14 for 3 boxes of 6 is pretty good.

review/summary: Another high protein bar
review/text: This is one of many high protein bars on the market.  I would not call it a meal replacement, but it does have (according to the wrapper) 10 grams of protein, 5 grams of fiber, and some amount of vitamin and mineral content.  It is something that you can eat quick, if you did not have time for lunch, or something to fill in during a long afternoon.  It has a light crunchy texture and a good flavor.  170 calories is not overly high, and is less than some other energy/protein bars with similar amounts of protein and fiber.

review/summary: Better than I thought it would be
review/text: I am a chocoholic trying to watch my calories/fat/carbs and still enjoy life. A friend recommended these bars for breakfast.  I saw the price in the grocery store and thought maybe not. BUT the price with free shipping at Amazon made the cost per bar much more appealing so I decided to give it a try. LOVED IT!! They taste better than most of the other breakfast bars and they have more nutritional value that almost all of the others. For Weight Watchers, they're only 4 Points (PP)which is a good choice for breakfast.

review/summary: Meal Replacement Bars
review/text: My husband is on a Doctor supervised medical meal replacement diet.  I'm doing it with him with over the counter products.  This bar is really good.  I use them as snacks, as well.  I eat half a bar for a mid morning and mid afternoon snack.  Sometimes I skip the afternoon and eat the second half for an after dinner snack.  It's very tasty - not at all griddy, and satisfies the body's need for protein, and my sweet tooth.  I eat a regular food meal (low cal!) for dinner.  Please do NOT do this without letting your doc know - especially if you have diabetes, or any other medical issues.  My doc has done bloodwork and is monitoring my progress so she can cut down my diabetes and other meds as needed.  So far I've cut my metformin in half, and my cholesterol and triglicerides have come down amazingly!  Enjoy!

review/text: I don't really eat these on a regular basis. These are my breakfasts when I sleep in late or my lunches when I can't be bothered. I carry one with me in my bookbag/purse just in case. They taste good and keep me from being hungry for hours afterward. One of the few bars that I've seen with a decent amount of fiber and protein. My husband likes them too. I can easily see these being a good daily breakfast if you're busy or trying to diet, or as an addition to a meal if you're trying to gain.

review/summary: BEST tasting protein bar!!!
review/text: I need to eat 1 or 2 protein bars every day as a post bariatric surgery patient to ensure that I get enough protein every day. This double-chocolate Special K protein bar (10g protein, 180 cal), is my very favorite protein bar, since it tastes more like a chocolate candy bar with crunch. I've been eating 4-5 per week for over a year and I still don't get tired of them. There may be bars with more protein, or ones with more fiber. but none with better taste in my opinion. Buy one box and you'll be hooked.

review/text: This is a very delicious and nutritious alternative to what you'll find in a vending machine.  It tastes good and is large enough to sate even the hungriest of us all.  Best of all, unlike other meal replacement bars, there are no sugar alcohols or substitutes.  Moreover, for such a tasty bar, it packs a good amount of protein.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: Although marketed for dieters, these bars are GREAT for teens whose eating habits are not always the best. I have a son whose idea of dinner is limited to burgers, grilled cheese or chicken nuggets. At least with these bars, I know protein, fiber are not going to be an issue, especially when running to sports practice, while keeping fat and calories down. Love the autoshipment--I always have them on hand.

review/text: I've been eating PowerBars for years, and thought I'd try a double chocolate Kellogg's Meal Bar.<br /><br />Holy cow! It's like biting into a ground-up mixture of styrofoam and dirt that's been compressed into a semi-solid then dipped in overly sweeten chocolate. The beach sand residue left in my mouth from this thing is horrible. I've got half the bar sitting here in front of me, and I really don't think I can finish it off. Yuck!<br /><br />Judging from the other reviews, maybe these gross, awful things are an acquired taste or maybe my taster is just seriously out of whack. Whatever the case, they're downright nasty! Even the smell is bad!

review/text: I love(d) these bars. They taste like a candy bar, have fiber, fill me up, whats not to like!<br />Oh wait... they use SOY PROTEIN.<br /><br />I'd heard about the dangers of men/boys eating soy protein before from friends/colleagues and pretty much dismissed it as tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. But when Men's Health had a large report on it, I figured it was worth the time to do some independent analysis.<br /><br />Long story short (and don't just take my word for it, I could be a crazy person on the internets) if you are a man, you are essentially taking large doses of estrogen every time you eat one of these. Note only does estrogen not help out in the muscle building department, the soy phytoestrogens have been linked (through legitimate research) to a whole lot of bad things, namely behavioral, pulmonary, circulatory diseases.<br /><br />So eat these things if you'd like, but I will be running not walking away from them. And it REALLY bums me out because they taste great... I just wished Special K would have ponied up the couple extra cents to whey protein...sigh.

review/summary: Chemical aftertaste, smells nice though
review/text: I loved the Chai Tea Latte pods for the Nescafe Dolce Gusto machine, so this was one of the first flavors I bought for our new Keurig machine. What a let down. There is a distinct chemical after taste with the Cafe Escapes version. Add to that the fake sweetener taste amd I can't drink this at all. I added milk and some real sugar, but still the chemical aftertaste existed. Bottome line is that while breweing this Chai Latte smells wonderful, but if you are at all sensative to the chemicals used in artificial flavoring & fake sweeteners, then avoid this brand's version of the Chai tea.

review/text: I am not a big coffee fan but I wanted a Keurig maker. I absolutely love Chai Latte. I make two cups of it. I found that mixing it on the middle setting and one on the smallest cup setting mixed together makes it a perfect combination! It tastes just like when I used to buy it for 3x the price. It is creamy and the right amount of flavor. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice kick of flavor in the morning but ins't looking for the caffeine of coffee! I also enjoy this as a little treat since I am watching my weight and this doesn't make a big dent into the amount of calories I consume a day. I did wish I could find i for less expensive on Amazon as my local store has it for a better price but it is not always in stock.

review/summary: Tasty tuna
review/text: I usually buy the G'Day Gourmet Tuna, but decided to buy this because the price was so much lower.  The tuna is nice and there are very large chunks.  It actually doesn't have much tuna in it because it has so much sauce.  Thankfully the sauce is very tasty - a very slightly spicy tomato taste with chunks of real tomato.  The tomato is not acidy or overly sweet.  Just really good.  So while the can size seems very large, it's a bit deceiving.  Still a good product that I enjoyed.

review/summary: Good food but a misleading name
review/text: Contrary to what another review said, I think this is mostly tuna with a little salsa. Maybe 70-30, but it is difficult to estimate as you pull it out of the can with a fork. The liquid content isn't unreasonable for something in a tomato based sauce. The flavor is good for my tastes, a little bit of bite, but not really hot. I'm just about to order my second batch, so obviously I have no problem with the product.<br /><br />The name is a little misleading, the company may have been set up by South Australian farmers in 1945 but the can came from Thailand in 2010. The label says [...]<br /> and it turns out they are just another multinational playing off their founder's past.
