review/summary: Dented cans!
review/text: I wanted to purchase Libby's products because they state a product of the USA. Sounds like an American thing to do.  As with another reviewer of Libby vegetables, I have found significantly dented cans all secured and packaged upon delivery. It does not appear to be damage sustained in Amazon's packing or shipping. (I finally got around to cleaning my pantry to unpack and store my veges when I saw large side dents in four of the 12 cans.) These cans must have been packed dented at Libby's because the dented cans were not even noticeable until they were removed from their original cases. As a result of this damage, I no longer am subscribing to these canned goods on line. I don't save anything when there is a possibility of being poisoned. Sorry Amazon, you need to be aware that you are selling Libby's damaged products. I have to buy locally so I can be sure the cans are not dented and the food inside safe to consume.  It's nice that some customers did not get dented cans, but, I did get them in several cases.

review/text: When you have Libby's on the label....sorry, the old commercial popped into my head. Libby's products always taste good. I bought this along with some other canned goods. (See other reviews.) I'm working on building up my emergency food and kits and this 12pk of cans fit the bill nicely in quantity, price and expiration date of 12/14. Name brands aren't important to me as price, but this package was a good deal. I don't usually eat canned potatoes. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these, but in an emergency they will do nicely.<br />The cans arrived promptly in advertised condtion without dents. No issues here.

review/text: This is by far the best Earl Grey tea ever. The bergamot is not overpowering, but pleasantly soothing. To me, organic tea is the best. It has no bitterness the way "regular" teas sometimes do. This is a very relaxing tea blend, a perfect way to start your morning. The price is more than reasonable, especially for organic tea. If you're an Earl Grey tea lover, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: True coffee taste
review/text: My husband has been "Decaf" for 20 years.  So for 20 years he has searched for a Decaf that tastes like REAL coffee.  We use a Senseo Supreme (chrome look) coffee pod machine with 16 strength settings depending on pod holder, LED brew strenth, and cup size selections you use on the machine.<br /><br />After a 20 year search the Baronet 100% Columbian medium roast brought a smile back to his face.  I use regular full roasts and I prefer the Baronet Izzy medium roast and also like the Baronet French Vannila pods. (more of a 'chick' blend)  But do not let that fool you.  If you want a bold coffee the dark or bold Baronet brands that our younger friends prefer are 'truck driver' approved.  We keep them on hand for guests so buy the variety pack or a simple Dark Roast.<br /><br />These pods will work in your Senseo however if you buy the pods in the foil packs that come in the box (stay fresher) they are larger and you may need to use the 2 pod holder with a single pod if you have the black machine.  However, one pod will 'mash' down ok in the one pod holder of the Supreme Senseo machine.  Yes, that wonderfull foam froth is still there. Pods that come loose, 18 to a package, are the same size as the Senseo pods.

review/summary: Favorite Coffee Pods!
review/text: I had been buying Senseo coffee pods to use in my Hamilton Beach pod brewer.  The Senseo pods became impossible to find locally, so I looked online.  I drink decaf coffee, and it's often difficult to find decaf in different variaties.  When I found these pods from Baronet, I decided to take a chance on them.  They are so much better than the ones from Senseo!  The flavor is rich and the price is quite a bit less than the old pods I was buying. The Baronet pods are also stronger in flavor, which is great if you want to make a larger mug of coffee.  They come in flavors, too!  Highly recommend!!

review/summary: Coffee Pod
review/text: Baronet Coffee Decaf 100% Columbian Medium Roast Pods did not disappoint. They fit very nicely in either a one cup or two cup Senseo coffee maker. They brew a medium to light coffee flavor. In order to enhance the fullness of the flavor, combine it in a two cup Senseo coffee maker with a stronger regular Baronet Coffee Pod that is packaged in a pouch rather than those that are individually packaged in a box. The individually packaged Baronet coffee pods are too full for the Senseo coffee maker.

Can't wait to be notified its available.<br />This is one of those meals that is not only easy and quick but Gourmet tasting. People will think you've spend hours making it....

review/text: What kind of wife would I be if I didn't have some of my husband's favorite foods to serve at his birthday (this Tuesday) and Christmas?  Since he is British Thanksgiving is rather overlooked as a major holiday for him.<br /><br />As we live in a rural area a trip to an Internationally stocked grocery store is like a trip to the moon, plus the surprise element would be gone as he would insist on accompanying me.  Amazon gets rid of all the fuss and bother, PLUS is was Prime so it arrived in 2 days at our doorstep. This means I can maintain the surprise element as he is not allowed to open any Amazon boxes from Oct through Christmas.<br /><br />Growing up in Britain these shortbread mincemeat tarts were a delightful staple at holiday time.  They really are delicious! Since I was able to order 3 boxes in a single shipment he is set for his birthday and Christmas.  He may even enjoy Thanksgiving more this year when he has his favorite holiday tart!<br /><br />Happy Birthday, Christmas and even Thanksgiving!<br /><br />UPDATED: 11/03/10:  Warm them a bit and have with a cup of coffee or tea.  The mincemeat is well balanced with the crust.  They are wonderful!

review/summary: The only dog food my dog will consistently eat
review/text: I have a stubborn chihuahua/daschund mix dog.  Kibbles 'n Bits is the only dog food that he will eat with any degree of consistency.  He actually prefers the mini-bits. (I guess size does matter.)  I tried premium foods thinking they would be better for him, and, at most, I've only been able to get him to eat each brand once or twice.

review/summary: Delicious, healthy, a real treat!
review/text: I've recently discovered, and some may say become obsessed with raw nut and seed butters,  I had ordered and devoured a jar of raw pumpkin seed from a different supplier, Then when I went to reorder, must to my dismay, the price was now outrageous!  $65.00 for  a jar.  So I thought, what should I do?  Luckily, Amazon came through for me, I found this brand while googling on Amazon,,,,and gave it a whirl, Well, it came in today and it's yummy,  No complaints,  This will fit the bill just fine,  I am not sure if it is raw, but it is coldpressed,  And it tastes healthy,  Hurray! Is a better value for the dollar too!

review/summary: Good way to get your omega-3.
review/text: Pumpkin seed butter is a bit runnier than regular peanut butter or cashew butter (for comparison).  However, pumpkin seeds are a good source of omega3 fatty acids and the pumpkin seed butter is a nice alternative to eating all those pumpkin seeds.  I've ordered it a couple of times and shared it with my family and co-workers.  They didn't seem to care for it, so it's probably a bit of an acquired taste. Knowing it is good for me is enough of an incentive for me to eat it, but not so much for others.  This product will last you a while.  Now, cashew butter on the other hand, will go quickly!  Everyone seems to love that.

review/summary: A Glitch in the system?
review/text: I ordered what I thought was five "4" packs of Smartbones medium size. What arrived was five "single" packs of the Smartbones medium size. The price for a four pack was a little more than half the local store price for the same items.... But for a single bone it works out to more than double the cost. I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product.

review/text: This mayo is made with egg whites and no yolks, hard to find a good tasting mayo without them being front and center.  I tried MANY yolkless mayos before this and had given up hope of ever finding one I could stand.  I am so glad I tried this, it is the best mayo I have ever had out of a jar!  I am so excited to be able to have a seafood salad sandwich again :)<br /><br />This tastes better than regular Hellmans/Best Foods mayo, and it tastes nothing like Miracle Whip (which I hate).  It is smooth and rich and helps combine any salad-style mix you have going without adding any off flavors.  I actually never put mayo on sandwiches before, just used it as an ingredient, but I may start since this is so tasty!<br /><br />The four-pack is a great value.

review/text: I had already tasted Citron Oolong a few years ago in Barefoot coffee shop in Palo Alto, CA. It is a delicious tea. My friends even enjoyed it. It is not a heavy oolong tea, or even the traditional oolong such as Iron goddess of mercy or Jade oolong, both of which are my ultimate favorites. Also, know this: Rishi makes the best oolong tea so do not skimp on your tea :)! Be sure not to overbrew, and follow instructions on how much to use. Also use filtered water to boil, it will improve the taste over tap water. I love using my brita water in the zojirushi which has hot water ready to go at all times at my house.

I then switched to this brand Gaia and took 3 capsule after breakfast and 3 capsules after lunch along with Gaia lactation support 1 capsule between breakfast & lunch and my supply was instantaneously back up: 10 ounces at lunch again.

review/summary: Okay..
review/text: I purchased two bottles of this stuff. The capsules of one bottle were dark and the capsules of the other bottle (which I started on yesterday) are a light brown color and I can clearly see the movement of the fluid inside the capsule. With the first bottle, I did not notice an increase in my supply and although I've only been using the second bottle for a day, I came home from work on my break and pumped 4.5 oz in ten minutes. I am usually only able to pump 3oz in ten minutes. I haven't changed anything in my diet to explain this sudden increase so I do believe it was the use of the new pills.<br /><br />I think the first bottle may have been older and so the capsules may have lost their potency. That is the only theory I have to explain the dark color and my inability to see the fluid in the capsule. I guess just be careful with this stuff. I haven't tried another brand but there are other brands of this stuff that are much less expensive. After I am through with this second bottle, I think I will try a least expensive brand I saw on Amazon.

review/summary: Very excellent; so close to restaurant quality, you can't tell
review/text: Box arrived via Fed-X in it's special insulated foam mini-cooler with ice-pack. All were ready to put in the freezer. This shipping by Amazon is incredible. Tip: save the mini-cooler for trips to Safeway, Trader Joe's etc.<br /><br />I've had Nan at a lot of restaurants, Indian, Pakastani, etc. There's no discern-able difference in quality. And the convenience of being able to make it "on demand" at home is really nice.<br /><br />Re: preparation. I entirely agree with the other reviewer who recommended pan frying. No need to preheat an oven to 400 and bake 5 to 10 minutes or so. And here's another Tip:  use a non-stick pan, and you won't have to add olive oil. Just defrost first at room temp (only 30 minutes or less), then pan-fry less than a minute each side and you're ready to eat. It's hotter than you'll get at any restaurant.<br /><br />If you don't want to pan fry or waste a lot of energy preheating your oven to 400 then baking 10 minutes, here's another way my Mom discovered. Just pop the Naan right from the freezer into a high quality toaster (she has a DeLonghi). It's very quick, and tastes great. She says toasting brings out the flavor of the garlic more.<br /><br />Enjoy!

I feel it tastes best when you keep it in the oven preheated to 400' for about 5 minutes. Anything less than that, you will have cold spots in between.<br />Try this with the 'Chicken Tikka Masala' (also from Tandoor). They make the perfect pair.

review/text: I actually ordered these by accident thinking I was getting the original Tandoor Chef Naan. While these were okay, I really prefer the original Naan. I still gave these four stars because for those that really like garlic, these are great and make a really good pizza base. However, the original continues to be king in my book!

review/summary: Cream of tartar is NOT tartaric acid...
review/text: I haven't purchased this product but wanted to post because it is misleading.<br /><br />Cream of tartar is the salt of tartaric acid.  Cream of tartar is used for baking.  If you are trying to make mascarpone cheese you need tartaric acid!

review/summary: tartaric acid and cream of tartar
review/text: Tartaric acid and cream of tartar are not the same thing. Cream of tartar is made from tartaric acid. It is a weak salt derived from tartaric acid, when it is half-neutralized with potassium hydroxide.<br /><br />In most home recipes that call for tartaric acid can substitute 2 tsp cream of tartar for 1tsp tartaric acid. But if you are buying tartaric acid, you are not looking for cream of tartar and the seller should not label cream of tartar as tartaric acid.

They arrived inside a nice sturdy box surrounded by lots of bubble wrap.  I would definitely recommend these to buy, especially for special occasions.

review/text: First the delivery service was great and arrived a few days before the estimated time. The package was in good condition and my children liked the taste. I think it is one of the best alternatives to peanut butter with added nutritional benefits and allergen safe. Unlike regular peanut butter exerted to high roasting temperatures producing unwanted free radicals, this brand is sure stand the test if they continue upholding their manufacturing principles. One thing you may need to do is to thoroughly mix the butter before use since at the bottom it's too hard and the top too light. Some may need to put a little salt but my kids liked it unsalted.

review/summary: Yes, they are good for pho
review/text: I've been doing a bit of experimentation with making pho at home, with varying degrees of success.  While the broth preparation is by far the most important, you simply can't toss in any kind of rice noodle and hope it will turn out ok.  Admittedly, I was a little worried about these noodles when ordering; the branding on the outside seems to cater directly to westerners, so I had fears that it would be an "Americanized", and thus flawed take on rice noodles.  Luckily I was wrong.<br /><br />These are pretty good noodles; they are not that fragile, so you don't need to worry about them breaking apart during preparation or boiling.  Thai Kitchen is an American owned brand, manufactured in China, but it is apparent (and important) that they have a higher standard for quality as I've struggled to find a single broken noodle strand in the boxes I've opened.  Some of the cheaper quality 'mystery brand' chantaboon rice stick noodles I've used in the past have broken when looked at incorrectly.  These noodles are a little bit thicker @ 3mm wide, but a little on the short side @ around 12" in length.  They take flavors very well and are appropriate for many types of dishes; perfect for stir fry, as the packaging indicates.<br /><br />The only reason I am knocking a star off of these is due to the aforementioned shorter length and because they are a bit starchy, requiring some rinsing (lest you intend to thicken/cloud your sauces and broths).<br /><br />If you have no real asian markets (international isle at Vons doesn't count) near you, these are the ones to get.  If you do have an asian market near you, try a few other brands as well as this one.  You may find that you prefer these.  If you're wondering why someone with a very American name as mine is speaking about these with any kind of authority, it's because I'm asian-american and grew up with no shortage of fantastic, authentic asian cooking at restaurants and at home.  Enjoy, and don't forget the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000934VAI">Lee Kum Kee Hoisin Sauce, 36-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO">Huy Fong, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>!!

review/summary: Linguine shape is perfect for salads, too!
review/text: Linguine-style white rice noodles are hard to find. You usually get those skinny angel-hair-type noodles. Thai Kitchen linguine-style noodles is the only product I have found that gives you the satisfying mouth-feel of linguine with the lightness and gluten-free pleasure of a rice pasta. Using the easy box directions for cooking (soaking, really) the noodles, you can make any number of great cold or warm salads with these noodles. I like adding chopped green onions, sesame and peanut oil, hot chili oil, sesame seeds, cilantro, lime juice and anything else you like such as water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, chopped nuts, whatever. I love these noodles and wish they were more available in smaller quantities in more places.

review/summary: Stellar Chocolates!
review/text: Pocket Coffees are something I "discovered" while assigned to an Air Force Intelligence Unit in southern Italy.  They are positively incredible!  It's a dark chocolate filled with espresso and a big pick-me-up.  We used them on the night shifts, helping to stay awake, but the taste is fantastic.  Very unusual.  I've been trying to get them for years, and recently treated myself on Amazon, with half paid by gift certificate.  Give Pocket Coffees a try...they're unusual and exciting.  Not for children, the taste of coffee is pretty intense.

review/text: I was afraid I would never find it in the States. I don't know why I should be surprised I found it on Amazon. Parthenon Foods mailed it to me so quickly I think I got it the next day. It was carefully packed and with a cool pack, which was spent from its trip, but it had done its job: the candy was in perfect condition. I hadn't even stopped to consider that the candy might melt in shipping, but the folks at Parthenon did, and it arrived intact and delicious. I will definitely buy from them again.

I had to buy a new box as my dog (yes, he is still alive) snatched her purchase off the counter while we were out and ate the whole box, wrappers and all. The best part is the surprise burst of coffee as you bite into the chocolate! Warn others not to try to bite in half. Either venture for the entire piece of candy, or bite a corner off to enjoy the coffee and then finish the chocoloate!
