review/summary: Mmmm.....good stuff
review/text: I grew up drinking Robertsons juices in the UK and was so happy to find it here in the US. Although it may seem expensive per bottle, it works out to be very cost effective. Of course it is cheaper in the UK - it has to be imported. However, you only use a small amount per drink so it goes a long way -it is very concentrated. I like to dilute it in club soda. It is the best carbonated drink out there and so healthy compared to colas etc. The Summer Fruits version is excellent too and the original Lemon of course. I love the Orange but cannot seem to find it well priced. Try them all.....you'll love them!!!

review/summary: Really good flavor- I love black currant
review/text: I would have liked to know about the artificial sweeteners (vs. an 'all juice' product with no added sugar) as I have issues with those, but the flavor is good- I haven't diluted it per the instructions yet- but if I don't get an overwhelming "fake" flavor when concentrated, that's a good sign. I have medical issues for not using artificial sweeteners- so am hoping this all works out, as the flavor is nice.  The labels don't stay on the bottles, so if you want them, get some packing tape...otherwise, they just sit on the bottom of the box.

review/summary: Mem-reeeeees....
review/text: I was practically weaned on Robinson's products as a child. I can't tell you what a treat it was to find them available on Amazon, and at such a competitive price. Using the Subscribe and Save, makes this stuff cheaper than i would pay to purchase it back in the UK.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit Robinson's isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread. However, nobody could accuse this beverage of being a chore to prep, or drink. Personally, i love this product mixed with hot water during the winter months. Nothing quite like a hot drink of Blackcurrant on a chilly day. It's pretty good to drink cold, too. And this is my product of choice when making homemade ice pops (I increase the cordial ratio when freezing). Yes, i know there are better options on the market (Ribena), but as a cheap alternative, Robinson's is pretty good.<br /><br />If you like this, i'd also recommend you try the Robinson's Orange or Lemon Barley Water. Again, both very pleasant  hot, or cold.

review/summary: A taste of the English summer but not a totally natural one
review/text: I loved this as a kid and the core flavour is still the same but I never noticed the after-taste of artificial sweetener before.  Still enjoyed the drink but the after-taste got to me eventually. Might have to risk the rotten teeth and back-fat and just get the full sugar one next time...or maybe even go all out and get some ribena

review/summary: Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I can't say how excited I am that Amazon is offering Robinsons Blackcurrant on subscribe and save.  I recently moved to Washington DC from Orlando FL where I could always find British food and drinks.  I have gone 6 weeks without my Robinsons and have been dying for some.  It's hard to settle in a new town but I feel like a little taste of home will help a lot :o)  Blackcurrant isn't a flavor that most Americans are familiar with but my Husband likes it.  It also contains no food coloring (it's illegal to add food coloring to products marketed towards children in the UK) so you can feel comfortable giving it to a child.  It's a concentrate so you can mix it as strong as you like, you can also mix it strong and freeze it which is yummy.  Can't say enough about Robinsons drinks they are fantastic and a company that my family has trusted since I was a child.  Thank you for offering this product at such a fantastic price!

review/summary: Not fresh!
review/text: This coffee proves that old, not aromatic, dry Sumatra coffee still tastes better than most fresh whole bean coffees.  The packages I received were "use by" dated just a few months away from the date I received it.  Usually there is about a 9 month period between the date I receive a coffee and the "use by" date.  The beans were dry and had no aroma.  I will be going back to Camano Island Sumatra coffee.  I tried this Starbucks because I used to buy 5 lbs. of Camano Island Sumatra from Costco for $38 and it is around $60 on Amazon.  Still, that will be the best choice for Sumatra dark roast.

The quality is definitely lower than it was, and it is MUCH weaker than it was for years.

review/text: I'm editing this review to add a star.  I originally dissed this peanut butter as too liquidy.  The first jar was ridiculously liquidy, but the second and third jars are more reasonable.<br /><br />I bought this peanut butter because it doesn't have any added oils or additives - just peanuts and salt.  It is very tasty. Although labeled "smooth" it still has some small peanut bits in it. The consistency is on the thin side. I've always bought the natural, non-additive peanut butters at the grocery store and am used to them being quite thick, thick enough to stand a knife in.  This PB is still soft when refrigerated. I'd prefer it a bit thicker but it's still good.

review/text: I often make the "Spicy Baked Shrimp" recipe that first appeared in Bon Appetit magazine in March 1992, and now available on-line at:  [...].  That recipe calls for Cajun / Creole seasoning, and one day, I discovered I was out of that.  So I picked up this instead, which I had received as part of a "surprise-me" gift basket from Zingerman's, and tried it instead.  It was an absolutely wonderful substitute, so good, that I started using this instead of Cajun / Creole (which is often hard to get and often not that good!).

review/summary: Sharing my research & pediatrician did not recommend this formula
review/text: Hello:<br /><br />I felt it was important for me to share this review with fellow parents. I have been trying to make a decision on an organic formula (weighing the pros and cons of Earth's Best and Baby's Only) and I have done weeks of research, I have read the cornucopia reports, combed clinical studies I could find on the internet regarding DHA/ARA, websites of all the major formaula manufacturer's, research on hexane, etc, etc, and I finally talked to my pediatrician. Here is a summary of what I found:<br /><br />Earth's Best:<br />Major Pro: Milk-based. My pediatrician was adamant that the first ingredient in an infant formula should be milk. Despite opinions I've seen out there about the composition of carbs - lactose and other sugars - in breast milk and its similarity to composition in Baby's only, there is no doubt that formula should be milk-based. All forms of syrup - whether it is corn syrup or brown rice syrup are sugars, and not suitable substitutes for lactose. These sugars can not only lead to problems with obesity and diabetes later in life, but the lack of lactose does not sufficiently meet an infant's nutritional needs.<br /><br />Major Con: Hexane-derived DHA. By the way, it's not just the organic formulas that have this controversial method of DHA/ARA extraction. Every formula on the market - organic and non-organic has DHA derived in this way. I called every formula manufacturer to verify this. (Martek's LifeDHA is also white-labeled - so you dont always know that it is Martek. But if there is DHA/ARA added to an infant formula or food, whether it is labeled or not, it is almost always going to be from Martek)<br /><br />Baby's only:<br />Major Pro: No DHA/ARA - It is the ONLY formula on the market I can find without DHA/ARA - if anyone else can find another formula, organic or non-organic, let me know! I have literally scoured the marketplace. The only place to find it is Canada (Nestle Good Start) and it's not easy to purchase and ship to the U.S.<br /><br />Major Con: My pediatrician confirmed that brown rice syrup as a first ingredient in an infant formula is not acceptable. She says while Nature's One may market it as better because it doesn't spike insulin levels, at the end of the day it is still sugar, just a different form of corn syrup. She was very concerned that nutritionally this is not suitable for an infant. The other con of baby's only is that it is indeed a toddler formula. When you compare the mineral values you will see for example that the levels of calcium, phosphorous, iodine and a few others are much higher than in other infant formulas. In fact their vitamin/mineral content is more comparable to other toddler formulas on the market, like Good Start 2. I have researched that the higher mineral content could make an infant's kidney system work harder. Not sure of long-term effects, if any. This was outside of my research.<br /><br />Bottom line: I know that many proponents of Baby's only will say that the company is taking a political stance, in fact it does encourage breastfeeding until 12 months, but it also discourages the introduction of dairy milk at 12 months, which really goes against the APA recommendation to introduce dairy milk at 12 months. I have no doubt that Baby's only is meant for toddlers, in fact they tell you to consult a physician if you're offering it to an infant under 12 months. They don't do this for PC reasons, they are a company that cares about revenues, just like all the other formula companies. They say this because it is indeed a toddler formula meant for babies 12 months +<br /><br />There is no perfect solution out there. But I've decided to continue my hunt for a milk-based formula without DHA/ARA, whether organic or non-organic. In the meantime, I can only do what all other parents do - make the best choice having weighed the pros and cons. I choose Earth's best. Why? Because I've done enough research to feel confident that the likelihood of hexane solvent remaining in formula is highly unlikely. My research, which includes talking to a scientist that uses hexane in his laboratory, indicates that hexane is highly volatile and evaporates almost immediately. In other words, by the time it has extracted the oils, it should have evaporated. While you can never be 100% sure of anything in this world, the independent studies do show that no traces of hexane are in the formula). I know it's hard to believe everything you read, so I am only sharing all of this information because I feel it would be wasted if I kept it all to myself! At the end of the day, I feel the nutritional benefit of a milk-based formula outweighs the very small (perhaps non-existent) chance of hexane traces in formula.<br /><br />I hope this helps!

review/summary: no synthetic DHA, no cane sugar, the only true organic formula...
review/text: My 8 month old son gets 50% breast milk, 50% formula. Of course breast is best, but we all know how that goes when returning to work...supply was not possible to be met for my son. The week I went back to work, be it stress, lack of time with baby latching on, etc...I couldn't pump nearly enough..If you're like me, and need to supplement, even if you don't want to, consider this about Baby's Only Organic formula:<br /><br />1. No synthetic DHA added. Recent findings show that DHA added to infant formula (in all cases of organic formulas including Earth's Best, except Baby's Only) is extracted from fungus and algae, using hexane solvents, bleach etc - As a biochemist, this is disconcerting. Hexane is a human neurotoxin and narcotic agent. Organic ingredient? Not in the slightest. It will damage nerves, brain, heart and who knows what else. Believe it or not, the FDA doesn't have a regulation on hexane extractions in food.. . The best source of DHA are natural sources, not synthetic. Good DHA sources are animal-based (eggs, fish, meat, etc) and of course are found in breast milk. The fact that no synthetic DHA is included was the #1 seller for me on this formula. Also, Baby's Only manufacturer sells a separate supplement of DHA that you can add to the formula, which is egg-yolk based - all natural. Some might be concerned about egg allergies - Most egg allergies come from the proteins in the egg white, not the yolk, but in the very rare chance that the egg yolk could cause an allergy, it's nice that they sell it separately and not mixed in the formula.<br /><br />2. Only 60% lactose may be a good thing...in response to ahbnyc's comment<br /><br />"Earth's Best uses Lactose as their primary sugar (carb source). In human breast milk, lactose is almost the exclusive source for carbs...exactly the same as Earth's Best. Again on the Baby's Only website they claim lactose to be inferior to their brown rice syrup. How can they do this?? They show no evidence to support their claim, especially when Lactose is what's in breast milk!!"<br /><br />According to the American Pregnancy Association, lactose accounts for approximately 40% of the total calories provided by breast milk. Why is it that when infants are started on lactose-based formula, so many have problems digesting it and then many assume they are lactose intolerant and are given soy or lactose-free formulas?? Isn't this counter intuative if human milk is lactose based? True lactose intolerance in babies is extremely rare - Did anyone ever wonder if the commercial formulas contain WAY more lactose than a baby's sensitive system can handle and way more than is found in breast milk? It is possible to have too much lactose in a baby's diet and this may be why they have problems when switched to formula while the same baby may be fine with breast milk. Also, lactose is a simple sugar which easily spikes insulin levels, contributing to overly plump babies that have a higher risk of obesity later in life. Just look at the growth chart differences of formula-fed vs. breast-fed babies. Rice syrup takes longer to break-down as it's more complex, and won't spike insulin levels like lactose. Rice syrup may not be suitable for a newborn - true. But Nature's One - Baby's Only manufacturer clearly recommends breast is best for newborns...There may be no perfect formula for a newborn.<br /><br />3. No cane sugar. Similac Organic is garbage because they add cane sugar as a source of carbs. Way to add to the child diabetic epidemic.<br /><br />4. It's way less expensive than Earth's Best.<br /><br />I recommend this formula - my son has had no problems with it and I feel good knowing he's getting ALL organic ingredients.

review/summary: Not as good as you would think.  It IS a true toddler formula.  Not recommended for new infants
review/text: I was sold on this formula for a few reasons. Some are true, some need further investigation.<br /><br />I was only going to feed my newborn organic, so I looked at the choices:<br /><br />Earth's Best (made by Hain Celestial)<br /><br />Baby's Only<br /><br />Similac Organic<br /><br />I ruled out Sililac right away because the FIRST ingredient is CANE SUGAR. This is a very cheap way to introduce carbs into the formula. I firmly believe that Sugar is the culprit of many our ails as a society today...Including the out of control type 2 diabetes in children under 18. The last thing I wanted to do was to feed my child "fast food" formula. Organic or not.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the Earth's Best and the Babys Only. In reading the Baby's Only website, I liked a couple of things that they stated...(which really were knocks against Earth's Best). One was that the cows used for the dairy for Baby's Only were small run family cows and that these farms commitment to organic farming and practices were sound. As opposed to Earth's Best which sourced its milk from Horizon who is owned by the Huge food processor Dean Foods. Dean is one of the largest milk producers in the country. The Baby's Organic people insinuated that cows from Dean are not treated well and may not be truely organic like their cows due to watered down USDA regulations. Maybe true, maybe not. They would like you to believe this because it supports their product. Truth be told, Horizon is the largest purchaser of small run , family farm milk in the country. It is estimated that half to 3/4 of their milk supply is obtained this way.<br /><br />The other thing that really bothered me is that Baby's Organic claims that their Carbohydrate source is superior. They use brown rice syrup which they claim breaks down slower because it is a more complex sugar, thus lowering the "spiking" of insulin levels. Now, whereas I believe that compared to Cane sugar or corn syrup, this is a no brainer, I would choose brown rice syrup....but here's where I think that they are totally wrong. Earth's Best uses Lactose as their primary sugar (carb source). In human breast milk, lactose is almost the exclusive source for carbs...exactly the same as Earth's Best. Again on the Baby's Only website they claim lactose to be inferior to their brown rice syrup. How can they do this?? They show no evidence to support their claim, especially when Lactose is what's in breast milk!!<br /><br />The reason I bring this point up is because I did not know all of this and I fed my baby Babys Only from weeks 2-6 of her life believing their website that brown rice is better. She had SOOOO much gas...burping, flatulation...she was so uncomfortable using this formula...we switched to Earth's Best and all of the problems went away. I really think that the brown rice syrup used is much harder for the baby to digest and thus messes up their fragile systems. Lactose is the same ingredient found in human breast milk. I cannot understand how the Baby's Only people can deny this. They are the only formula maker that I have found that stands by the claim that brown rice us better than lactose.<br /><br />Furthermore, they call it a Toddler Formula and maybe for a good reason. I read in a few places that Whereas all of the nutrients are the same as infant formulas, they called it toddler because they wanted to be politically correct by stating that all babies under 12 months should breast feed. But, now with experience I do not think that it is as well tolerated as other infant formulas because of their ingredient choice.

review/summary: Thankfully this formula is also for infants
review/text: I exclusively breastfed my first child for 2.5 years. When I had twins 8 months ago, I found it impossible to exclusively breastfeed them. Thankfully, I found this wonderful organic formula which they were supplemented on from day 1 (and they were a month early).<br /><br />If you go to the website (www.natureone.com) you will see that the ingredients are identical to infant formulas - they simply call it a toddler formula for political reasons. See below.<br /><br />My twins are thriving and healthy. More pediatricians should read up about this and recommend it to those moms unable or unwilling to breastfeed. At least your babies won't be getting all the pesticides and growth hormones etc in commercial formula. It's really a sad state of affairs when there is only one organic formula available. Mothers need to demand better products, healthier products for their infants.<br /><br />Kim,<br /><br />Mother of three.<br /><br />extract from website: "...Infant Formula Act (IFA), passed in 1980. Baby's Only Organic� meets the nutritional requirements of the IFA just like conventional infant formulas. Baby's Only Organic� is labeled as a toddler formula due to the company's philosophy to promote breast milk for infants the first year of life when possible (as mandated by the World Health Organization). If breast milk is not available, Baby's Only Organic� can be used for an infant less than 12-months of age as directed by a healthcare professional. Baby's Only Organic� has complete nutrition - nothing is missing, nor is it concentrated. For any age baby, mix the formula according to label instructions. "

review/summary: No Hexane Solvents
review/text: Please remember that DHA/ARA added to infant formulas (both non-organic and organic) are extracted using petroleum-derived hexane solvents.  One of the reasons I choose organic is to avoid hexane solvents; hexane is a very efficient extraction procedure (check wikipedia or google), but not organic.  Do a little research on what is in the DHA added to infant formulas before you buy.  It will be educational.<br /><br />Also, as organic consumers, we breast fed whenever possible.  Formula is only used for supplementation.  Breast milk provides ample amount of DHA & ARA and all the other essential fatty acids.  So getting more from an organic formula is just a waste of money.

review/summary: Not Easily Digested
review/text: Feeding our 6-month old baby formula was not a choice my husband and I had anticipated having to make.  After comparing reviews and ingredient lists, I thought this formula was the best choice.  And perhaps for other babies, it is.  However, this formula brings our girl's digestive system to a stop.  I suspect that it is the brown rice syrup, as whey-based formulas do not cause any problems for her.  It is not an allergy to brown rice, either, as she has not had any problems with rice cereal.  Unlike other formulas, Baby's Only never full dissolves in water; it remains slightly gritty, no matter how much we stir it, or what temperature the water is.  No wonder our girl is unable to digest it.<br /><br />After a few weeks of "Let's see if her system adjusts to it", we gave up.  It may be a hexane-free organic formula, but it is not worth the discomfort it causes our baby.  We have started giving her Earth's Best and she has responded very well to it.  I had high hopes for Baby's Only and was disappointed by our experience with it.  I am wary of feeding a brown rice syrup-based formula to an infant and in the future, if we have to buy formula for our other children, we will not choose Baby's Only.

review/summary: Warning - arsenic found in this type of baby formula
review/text: I was looking for a formula for my 18 month old twins and was shocked to learn today that those made with organic brown rice syrup contain particularly high levels of arsenic, compared with products without this syrup.<br /><br />Seventeen baby formulas were tested in the Darmouth College study. According to the Today show, "Two of the infant formulas contained organic brown rice syrup as their primary ingredient. These products had arsenic levels 20 to 30 times that of the other infant formulas.. The amount of arsenic consumed by an infant could be significant depending on which formula they drank.. arsenic exposure early in life may increase the risk for health problems later on."<br /><br />The study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, indicates that organic infant milk formula containing OBRS as the primary ingredient had total concentrations up to six times the EPA safe drinking water limit.<br /><br />The formulas tested were not named but a quick search turned up that Baby's Only organic toddler formula - both dairy and soy - uses brown rice syrup as its main source of carbohydrate. I for one will be passing on this product.

review/summary: Tried a bunch
review/text: I tried this formula for one week - my baby boy is fussy and didn't do so well on this one, it was between this and Earth's Best - and I tried this first in hopes that the no dha/ara were his problem, they weren't.  This formula foams up a ton and it takes forever for the bubbles to go down- not good for sensitive baby belly and adding more bubbles.  My baby spits up a lot and this formula stains - Earth's best doesn't.  Also, this doesn't come with scoops - so you have to measure out teaspoons, which is not good for impatient crying baby that wants to eat ten minutes ago.  And the most important part - the calorie and fat content are a little low for my 2 month old.  I'd say this formula would be excellent for a little older baby that doesn't spit up much or have tummy issues (b/c of the bubbles.)  Not my favorite - but I felt much better feeding him this than I did the non-organic main brands - or even the organic main brands b/c this doesn't have high-fructose corn syrup.  When will the big companies get it?

review/summary: When you can no longer breastfeed...
review/text: I have breastfed all three of my children.  My first child I breastfed until about nine months.  I had to stop at that time because I was pregnant with my second child (surprise!) and my milk dried up.  I went to the supermarket to look at formula.  I was appalled when I saw that the first or second ingredient was corn syrup.  I hightailed it to our local health food store and discovered Baby's Only formula.  I took it home, made a bottle, and my daughter guzzled it down.  A few months after we started her on formula we were traveling and ran out of the Baby's Only formula and couldn't find a place to buy more.  We bought regular formula from the store and she couldn't stand it.  I didn't blame her because it smelled really bad compared to Baby's Only.<br /><br />I was able to breastfeed my second child until he was a year and, therefore, didn't need to switch over to formula.  My third child is almost ten months old and I weaned him last night.  He has never taken a bottle before.  I was concerned that I was going to have a battle on my hands.  Well, we got home from the store, gave him the bottle, and he drank it all down.  He did well today, too, especially tonight.<br /><br />I don't know enough about DHA and AHA to comment on what this formula would be like for a newborn/young infant.  However, for an older infant (9-12) months, I think that this is a great formula when you can no longer breastfeed.

review/summary: Availability can be an issue!
review/text: Ok, I read every possible review about all the formulas out there. Including the most popular (and recommended/pushed by our Doc) Similac/Enfamil. But call me anti establishment (or just taste the stuff yourself!) but I was determined to find something else. The comments on other sites(viz diapers dot com) about this formula were enough to convince me try this for my daughter when I had to start her on formula at 4 months old(work constraints, reduction of milk supply- a whole other story sob!). But I am so glad I did.<br /><br />Its all true, the formula foams a bit and is difficult to mix up. But for the taste alone, I wouldnt go anywhere else. This is the only formula my daughter has had- and its been really good for her. She drinks it all up and has had no digestive or other concerns. I wish it had no soy at all ( it has soy lecithin and soybean oil- but thats in every baby product out there, so I dont think it can be avoided).<br /><br />But any prospective buyers out there, please beware- Natures own does have a tendency to go into shortsupply especially the diary one. In the past 2 years that I have been using the formula, Ive seen 2 instances when the product was not available on shelves or online. Just this last week, it wasnt available anywhere - even on their own site, when I ordered it, the Customer service called me back to tell me that they were low on stock so would I consider the lactose free version!? Since my daughter has not tried lactose free, I would not give it to her. The product would be available in 2 weeks time. So, I suggest that you always stock up- atleast for a month in advance, if you do buy this brand(which I still think is the best one out there).

review/summary: Best organic formula for newborns!
review/text: After researching formulas for what felt like forever, I decided on Baby's Only and am so happy I did. While we are breastfeeding almost exclusively, we were looking for something to potentially supplement my son as I had a supply issue with my older daughter.<br /><br />There are several reviewers that state that it isn't for babies. I am a RN in the maternal child health realm and an educator. Let me assure you that the nutritional content is incredibly similar to all infant formulas.<br /><br />There also have been several reviewers that state high arsenic levels. I would recommend that you do a more thorough investigation of the study that cited that. It's simply untrue, Nature's One actually had an independent lab test their formula using the EPA's standardized testing. They found nothing.<br /><br />This formula is without potentially hazardous hexane extracted DHA/ARA (which if you're breastfeeding, you're all ready giving the baby the all natural better version!) and would recommend this formula to anyone, especially for supplementing. I found this formula to be very slightly constipating on occasion (as all formulas are) and you have to mix it pretty vigorously.

review/summary: Caused HORRIBLE constipation
review/text: I really wanted this formula to work as it was the ONLY true organic formula that I found that does NOT contain corn syrup. I did NOT want to feed my child corn syrup, so I tried this and have been using it for about a month now. Unfortunately, it caused terrible constipation in my son- to the point where he was screaming while pooping. I would continue using this formula if it didn't cause this horrible constipation. Baby's Only smells like REAL food, not like chemicals. It mixes even better than Similac or Enfamil in my opinion, too- leaving some occasional clumps but if you shake the bottle again they dissipate. Not many bubbles, either. I would have given this 5 stars if it weren't for the constipation. I gave it a while to see if my son would adjust to it also, and I even started giving him prune juice, but his body just couldn't handle it I guess.

review/summary: NOT GOOD!  ARSENIC AND NO CALL BACK, NOW USING HOLLE
review/text: We had been feeding our baby for weeks using this formula, but then realized the studies recently found.<br />I guess we did not want to believe it but call the company after all. First it was hard to get someone qualified about the issue, the lady was nice but couldn't help us.<br />So she toke our number saying someone would get back to us, but nobody ever did, do they want to stay away from the arsenic issue???<br />Nutrition is so important in a babies first few months of life that we now use another brand and have moved on from this one.<br />It's so dissapointing that they have to add sweetner anyway! I mean it's a baby formula, and being one of the first ingredient it tells you a lot.<br />We now use the Holle brand, it was very hard to get before but fortunately now avaiable on amazon! Much better quality, more organic and especially no added extra useless stuff that should not be in a baby diet!

review/summary: Yeah, made it through 12 months!!
review/text: My daughter turned a year on 12/29/10 & had been on Baby's Only dairy since 2 months old. We struggled with it at first dealing with her stools becoming hard pellets but I just had to come up with the right remedy of prune juice & we were good to go! Every baby is different but she is as healthy & smart as can be. I am so happy that we stuck it out with this formula because I wanted to switch many times because of the constipation. I still continue to give her one bottle of formula in the morning then she has milk in a sippy cup for the rest of the day. I will do this until I run out of the formula that I already have then we'll go all milk.<br />If you're having trouble with the formula I recommend sticking it out. It will be worth it in the end & you'll have peace of mind knowing that they got the best formula out there!!

review/summary: Baby loves the taste but...
review/text: I was having trouble finding a formula that my 7 month old liked. I read about this formula and saw that some parents were using it for their babies. I felt comfortable, after talking with my daughter's pediatrician, starting her on this Baby's Only as a supplement to breast feeding (she was getting her teeth and starting to bite me which was not pleasant!).<br /><br />Now that we are almost all on formula we are running into some serious constipation issues. I do not know if it is this formula in particular or switching to solid foods at the same time that is doing it but I have been needing to give her prunes to counteract it since we started using it. The iron content isn't any higher then normal infant formulas so I'm not sure she would do any better on a different brand. Might switch to a gentle digestion formula for awhile to get her pooping happily again though.<br /><br />Other then the constipation she seems to really enjoy it. One other con is that it is very foamy after first mixing it up so making bottles before hand in order to let the formula settle might be a better idea.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: I gave my daughter breast milk until she was 12 months old.  We needed something to replace the BM and didn't want to start with cow's milk this young, not 5 times a day anyways.  We tried several conventional formulas and she hated all of them, or if she did drink them they gave her diarrhea.  Have you ever smelled a conventional formula?  It smells metallic and it tastes even worse.  Another issue was DHA, sure this is a compound every body needs especially babies/toddlers.  However, the extraction process is sketchy.  Seriously, hexane extraction and your going to tell me all the residues evaporate off.  I find that hard to believe.  So I like the formula.  It smells good, taste decent and doesn't contain DHA instead it contains the amino acids used to make DHA in our own bodies.

review/summary: Best organic formula, too bad about constipation
review/text: This is by far, the best formula out there. The fact that is uses brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup is a major plus in my book. This company is diligent about manufacturing a quality, safe product for infants and I applaud that. Sadly, b/c of the rice component, it made my 6 month old extremely constipated and gassy, despite only having one bottle a day (all the other feedings were still BF). I can only imagine how bad it could've become if she was eating this formula exclusively. Disappointed with our personal outcome, but all babies are different so hopefully others will have better luck with it.

review/summary: Best Infant Formula on the Market!
review/text: After learning about the Hexane extraction process for DHA and ARA that all other formulas use, Baby's Only seemed like the natural choice. Another nice feature is that this formula doesn't use corn syrup solids like other formulas. We began feeding it to our son when he was about 7 months old. Our doctor said it was a fine replacement for breastmilk and there was no need to give our son the synthetic DHA in other formulas. Our son tolerated it perfectly. It also smells like milk not that gross formula smell that other ones have.

Before I was supplementing with Similac he would scream thru the bottle, he hated the taste of it. not any more! Also similac constipated him. No digestive problems with this formula.

review/summary: Great for my toddler with milk allergy
review/text: I had my son on Earths Best until his first birthday, and when we introduced milk found out that he had a allergy. He is fine with yogurt/cheeses, but straight milk turns his face bright red. Earths Best was great when he was an infant, but I was always uncomfortable with the added DHA, so I decided to try Babys Only. He has been drinking 1 or 2 bottles a day for about a year and has had no flair ups, or digestion issues. I'd absolutely suggest anyone who needs to keep their child off milk, and prefers organic,  try out this toddler formula.

review/summary: No DHA or ARA
review/text: I'm only giving this three stars because it lacks DHA and ARA.  It does contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA), the precursors of DHA and ARA.  However that means the baby has to convert these into DHA and ARA, something humans don't do well (that's why we need to get DHA and ARA in our diet and why they are in breast milk).  Nature's One does make a seperate supplement to provide DHA and ARA for your baby and I would consider this a must-have if you use this formula.  Otherwise find a formula that contains these critical fatty acids.  Similac has an Organic formula with DHA and ARA and I'm sure there are others.

review/summary: I'm sticking with them
review/text: Like many parents, I was shocked to hear today that Baby's Only contained high levels of arsenic.  After reading the study for myself, I believe it is inaccurate to say the levels are too high.  The dairy formula tested below levels allowed in drinking water. The goal is reduction becasue elimination is unrealistic.  I have been mixing with some Earth's Best and may increase to a 50/50 mix until Nature's One releases more details on their testing and how they are going to adress this issue going forward.  Overall though, I still think this is the best formula on the market and I want to see Nature's One improve with this crisis, not be forced out of business.  I have bigger concerns about other formulas (organic and non organic) that have nothing to do with hexane.  To be fair, we prepare her bottles with filtered water so there is not much arsenic in that water. Our baby was breastfed for 7 months (we started supplementing the formula at 6 months) and she will continue to get about 20% of her milk as forzen breastmilk until she is 10 months old.

review/summary: Great formula
review/text: I am a breastfeeding mom who needed a formula as a back up in case we ran out of breast milk while my husband and I took a mini vacation.  I did TONS of research on organic formulas (my family eats organically whenever possible and it was very important to me to have an organic formula) and this was the only one I felt comfortable giving my baby.  She took it well and we use it on occasion if I am not around or don't have saved breast milk.  No side effects (gas, etc.) and my baby seems to like it just fine - of course, there's nothing like mama's milk- but if that is not an option for you I highly recommend this formula.

review/summary: Seems to be the safest on the market...
review/text: I've been breastfeeding my son, but lately my milk supply has begun to drop off.  Between trying to breast pump for the times that I am away from him, and keep up with his normal feedings, I've had to supplement with formula - something that I really wanted to avoid!  I've read and heard a lot of negative things about commercial baby formulas on the market and wanted to go with the safest brand that I could find.  This seems to be the best compromise out there.<br /><br />There is some BPA used in the lining of the can, but it is only on the pop top lid, unlike most formula cans, which have it in the lining all the way through.  I like the fact that this is made with organic ingredients, and that the manufacturer avoids the nasty process of extracting DHA and AHA by treating it with acid and bleaching it.<br /><br />What is in your baby's formula?  I would recommend doing a little research before making a decision.

review/summary: Best there is
review/text: I could go on and on, but I'll just say this. If you're not presently using Baby's Only for your little one, then check the ingredients of whatever brand you are using. I can virtually guarantee you that one of the first--if not the first--ingredient is some kind of high fructose corn syrup solid. You really want your kid eating that? If so, then you're probably also the type of parent who takes your kid to McDonalds for Happy Meals. But if you happen to be the type of parent who cares a bit more for your child's diet, then there really is only one formula to use: Baby's Only. Plain and simple. We're all about giving our little boy as many advantages as we can afford, and this is a simple choice. It's only available at Whole Foods where we live at about $9/can for a 12.7 ounce can. That's right... about as much as you pay for the other stuff, but twice as healthy. This one's a no-brainer.

review/summary: Tastes WAY better than it looks.
review/text: To concur with the previous review, this juice looks pretty revolting (a dark greenish/brown). However, if you can set that fact aside, it actually tastes amazing. I'd liken it almost identical to peach juice (almost as sweet as that juice you'd get with canned peaches). It's delicious. It is 100% juice. Ingredients (in order) are filtered water, apple juice concentrate, peach puree, pineapple juice concentrate, banana and mango purees, spirulina, chlorella, natural flavor, barley grass powder, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), gellan gum, broccoli and spinach powders. According to the label one 8oz serving contains 620mg of spirulina and 420mg of chlorella. These two ingredients, along with the barley grass, are supposedly effective detoxifiers of mercury. All said, this is a condensed, very nutritious, and great tasting juice. Just close your eyes if you have to to ignore the color.

When mixed it has a smooth and fresh taste of real coconut. The color is actually a green coconut green color and I also used the black tapioca pearls in this. The picture is a bit misleading because you have to purchase the pearls separately. I probably made about 10 sets of 2 16 oz drinks with this which absolutely beats the $5 per cup boba tea that I previously would purchase at the Bubble tea house.

review/summary: Good Stuff But a Few Warnings (see below)
review/text: Overall, this is a good and fast hot chocolate product offering.  While I don't drink that much hot chocolate, my family does and they like the quick and easy way they can make a cup vs. warming up water in the microwave, stirring, etc.  I think it tastes a little better than the Butternut and Nestle brands - throw in a few marshmellows and you are set!<br /><br />The cost per cup seems pricey to me (hey, I'm an accountant), but I've done the math and it is comparable to other brands and traditional ways of making hot chocolate.  As an Amazon Prime member, I don't pay extra for shipping (well, technically I do with the annual fee) which helps mitigate the cost per cup.<br /><br />Here are the things to look out for when brewing hot chocolate with your Keurig:<br /><br />1.  Make sure you shake the cocoa container real well prior to putting the pod in the Keurig: the powder / mix tends to clump, and you don't want that to be the case when you brew a cup or else it will taste a little watery.<br /><br />2.  The hot chocolate tends to be thicker and can clog up the filtration / water lines (or whatever they call it).  After you make a cup of hot chocolate, immediately run a medium cycle of just hot water.  You'll see what I mean with the cloudiness of the water coming out at this cycle as it cleans out the water line.  Make sure you put a cup under it when you do it or you'll have a mess!<br /><br />3.  If you want a "richer" hot chocolate experience, use the small or medium setting.  It all depends upon your viewpoint: my son and I like the small setting, and my wife and daughter like the medium setting.  Don't forget the marshmellows!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: What it lacks in flavor, it makes up for in convenience.
review/text: If you only read one thing about Green Mountain's hot cocoa, make it this: Don't ever use these K-Cups on a larger setting.<br /><br />When used on the standard setting, almost all of the powder in the Green Mountain cups gets used (unlike Timothy's White Chocolate cups), and produces an acceptable cup of hot cocoa.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's not much better than a Swiss Miss packet that you'd mix in hot water, but the convenience of slamming a cup in your Keurig and having a cup of cocoa in less time than it takes to microwave some water is pretty nice. And if that's your goal, this is a pretty good buy.<br /><br />However, if you're expecting massive chocolate flavor or a "gourmet" experience, these K-Cups are guaranteed to disappoint. Using two on the small setting might get you by, but that brings your cost per cup around a buck, which is pretty steep for what you're getting.

review/summary: Great Taste, more Maintenance Required
review/text: I enjoy the flavor of the Green Mountain Hot Chocolate. I found that after brewing, the nozzle (that sharp plunger that comes down from the top) was clogged with a small amount of chocolate paste. Nothing major, but I needed to clean it off immediately, before it dried. I used my cleaning tool, a thin tiny dental brush &lt; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00124S3HU">DenTek Easy Brush Cleaners 10 ea</a> >, and removed a bit of chocolate from the nozzle. Never a problem after that, as long as I clean it each time.<br />  When I use coffee only, I only need to clean the nozzle once every 2 or 3 weeks. I think it's the different consistency of chocolate powder vs. ground coffee.<br />  I own a Kuerig B40 at the office and a B77 at home, same problem.

review/summary: Don't forget to shake!
review/text: For those who say the cocoa is weak, you might remember to give the K-cup a good shake to loosen up the powder before putting it it the machine. And take a look at it after it brews - sometimes not all the powder dissolves, so tear the top seal off and mix what's left in the K-cup into the cocoa. I've not had a weak cup yet. I find that the 6 ounce cup size works best if your machine has it but the 8 ounce works, too.<br /><br />There's nothing magical about this like with a coffee K-cup, it's just hot chocolate powder in the cup, no filter. You could forget the machine and just open the cup and mix it into hot water (or milk!) but that takes away the fun. It really tastes pretty good; I take a star off for coconut oil and all those weird additives in it. Inscrutably, it has 3 grams of fiber per cup, from inulin. Maybe to give it some body? Don't know, but it tastes fine.<br /><br />Also, it never hurts to run a cupful of plain water (no K-cup) through the machine to clean the needle out after using one of these. That will help with the clogging.

review/summary: Not One Of My Faves
review/text: I enjoy a variety of Green Mountain coffees, so when I saw this on display at a local department store I picked it up. I absolutely love hot chocolate. I couldn't wait to take this one home and try it out. After the first couple of cups I was disappointed in both the flavor and body. After going through a couple of adjustments like less water, it still left me wanting more. Maybe I was expecting too much. Not only does it lose points for lack of flavor, I just don't like my chocolate this watered down.

review/summary: Yuck! Chocolate flavored water is what you get. Not good at all!
review/text: This is some of the worst stuff I've ever tried to drink.  It's even worse than that awful stuff that comes out of those machines where the cup drops down and fills it.  I tried it on the various cup size settings with my Keurig machine and it just goes from bad to horrible when going from the larger size to the smallest.<br /><br />It's a complete waste of money.<br /><br />I just tried another brand that's similar and it's no good either.  If you like chocolate water, buy these.  If you have it in mind that you are buying "Hot Chocolate" with a milky or creamy flavor... that's not what this stuff is.<br /><br />Yuck!

review/summary: Not Very Chocolatey
review/text: I purchased these Hot Cocoa K cups for my husband.  Our local store is always running out of the Cafe Express in Hot Cocoa so I thought I would stock up on the Green Mountain brand.  He told me last night that they are just OK and not chocolatey enough.  He said he would drink them, but in the future we will stick to the Cafe Express.

review/summary: Best in Value; Okay in Taste; How to Improve It
review/text: This is the best value in K-Cup hot chocolates by far among all brands.  It costs a mere 33 cents per K-Cup for what I paid on Amazon.  Green Mountain makes great coffees, but this product is rather anemic in cocoa taste, and it is not as sweet as some other brands.  This is either good or bad depending on you taste, of course.<br /><br />Now here are some tips to improve the taste:<br /><br />1) Shake the K-Cup prior to use in order to minimize clumping.<br />2) Use the lowest amount of water setting on your machine.<br />3) After the brew cycle ends, tear open the top cover and empty out the left over cocoa into your mug.  (You'd be surprised how much cocoa is left in there--therefore wasted if you don't do this.)<br />4) Add a splash of milk for extra richness, and sugar for sweetness (optional).<br />5) Enjoy!

review/summary: Good, but really not great.
review/text: I don't know anyone who has purchased a Keurig single serving unit for the specific purpose of making hot chocolate.  If that's what you're most interested, save your money and get a hot water kettle for a heck of a lot less plus a good hot chocolate mix recipe (that perhap used dried milk).  So, in reviewing the Green Mountain Coffee Hot Chocolate k cups, you have to sort of start here - is this about convenience or taste?<br /><br />As far as convenience goes, there's no question it's pretty gosh darn convenient.  Toss a k-cup into the slot and hit brew - there you go.  A+ for speed.  Congratulations, you can make hot chocolate in less time than it takes to boil water.  I suppose if having a hot cup of cocoa is what you absolutely must have in 30 seconds or less, you lead a very wonderful life and I'd like to experience it once myself.  You know, the world where instant hot chocolate is the biggest worry of the day.  Truth be told, though, when entertaining, it's nice to have the option of a single serving - quickly - without the need for a secondary device or even a microwave which can superheat the water.<br /><br />Kids can use the device, so that's another plus.  Properly trained, a young child can make their own hot chocolate without too much risk of 3rd degree burns.  So the question then turns to taste....<br /><br />Our 7 year old and 5 year old were used in the taste test.  We served them hot choclate from a packet (swiss miss, with marshmallows), a single cup of the Green Mountain, and a cup of a family recipe we have that also uses water.  (They added marshmallows to the other two options as well).<br /><br />Family recipe won by a landslide.  Two to nothing.  Swiss miss was made, per the packet directions, with 8 ounces of water.  They liked this second best, but still complained of it being watery.  The Green Mountain came in third, because it was entirely too watery.<br /><br />I remade the Swiss Miss and the Green Mountain version with less water.  I used the next smalles setting on the Keurig and I only used 6 ounces of water on Swiss Miss.  Green Mountain was the lesser preferred, although the it wasn't so much about the "wateryness" as the actual flavor.<br /><br />My kids tend to like the creamier - which is largely milk based - hot chocolate.  Green Mountain just didn't provide that.<br /><br />I think with less water, the Green Mountain k-cup tastes fairly good.  No, it's not very creamy.  But for a quick single serving, it will do.  Then again, we didn't get a Keurig in order to make hot chocolate in the firt place, so I can't get too undone about the mediocrity of this flavor.  It's ok.  Not worth a higher recommendation, and certainly not worth the purchase of the machine.  But it's a nice flavor to add to the ensemble of other flavors.

review/summary: Hot cocoa blahs
review/text: I just love my Keurig and I've enjoyed tasting all of the different coffees in the sampler pack so when I ordered this hot cocoa I thought it would be as good as the coffee. I was wrong, dead wrong. This cocoa is terrible and tastes like sugary hot water. You honestly get no chocolate taste at all. I had such high hopes for this hot chocolate and all I have now is the hot cocoa blahs.

review/summary: It is what it is
review/text: Is this hot chocolate....yes<br />Is this good hot chocolate....um, sorta<br />Is this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K-cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove-top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.<br /><br />Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.<br /><br />3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping.

review/summary: Okay K-cup Cocoa
review/text: I love the Green Mountain coffees so much! Wish I could say the same for the cocoa. It's just not strong enough for me, even when I choose the smallest cup size on my Keurig. It's okay, I guess, but when I make my own cocoa from scratch, I make it super dark and rich. I think I'm spoiled. :)

review/summary: These are fine on a lower ounce setting
review/text: I bought these, knowing they weren't going to taste like rich, flavorful hot cocoa, but they were on sale and my kids had been asking why I never buy hot cocoa K cups.  For the kids (teens), they didn't care what size they brewed on, they drank it anyway.  I've tried a couple and found that they are just fine on a 6 oz setting.  I also have used them on a 6 oz setting and mixed with a strong coffee k cup at a 4 oz setting and topped with foam or whipped cream.  If you are not expecting chocolate perfection, and maybe keep these around for making mochas, then it's worth it if they are on sale.
