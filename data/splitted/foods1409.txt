review/summary: Dogs odor and itching almost gone
review/text: After about three months on this product, both of my dogs have reduced odor and do not have itchy ears and paws anymore.  As for whether or not they like it...they did not at first, but now they cannot get enough. Also, there were no digestive issues when converting to this food.

review/summary: Amazing food
review/text: We have a rapidly growing 7 month Labradoodle puppy and initially began using this food after the trainer recommended it. All I can say is that on and off this food is like night and day.  Right now we give him Honest Kitchen in the morning and high grade kibble at night.  The difference is amazing. With Honest Kitchen he's much more compliant, does less nipping, and is less ADD/hyper.  Honest Kitchen is now a core part of his food. I wish it were less expensive so we could feed him all his meals with this.<br /><br />BTW, try some different flavors. We started with a different mix from Honest Kitchen and our dog didn't like it too much.  The Embark is better.  We toss in some grated cheese and salmon oil, and he loves it now!

review/summary: Amazing results, worth the price
review/text: I used to feed my dogs Blue or Nutro Ultra thinking it was the best that I could do for my dogs. They were shedding so much it was embarrassing, and practically ruined my furniture. Their coats just looked dull and one of them was always constipated. I knew there had to be something better out there and I'm lucky to have found this! After just a month their fur is sooo soft and shiny. They're no longer constipated and seem more alive. The consistency is different, almost like creamed spinach, but the dogs love it. I really like the compact box vs the old bulky bags of food. It's not much more expensive than the Nutro and totally worth it. I recommend it to everyone I know. Amazon has the best price I could find, plus free shipping.

I have never tried a dehydrated dog food before but thought I would try this stuff out based on the recommendation of the breeder. I have two new toy poodle puppies and they both gobble the stuff right up, licking the bowl, etc. everytime I feed them (twice a day). Admittedly, it looks different from other dog foods, but the dogs obviously love it.

review/text: Switched both of my dogs, ages 5 and 13, to this food on the recommendation of a new holistic vet. It takes a few minutes to prepare but my dogs go crazy for it and their general health has improved. The food smells like chicken soup mix, which is pretty pleasant. Cheaper than canned and much better. No fillers.

review/summary: My dog is happy, healthy, and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs!
review/text: I treat my animal's health as if it were my own and try to not only find the best veterinarian care, but also the best foods.  I've had my dog Brandy on Eagle brand dog food for many years.  I remember when there was the melanine scare, but I didn't have to worry because all of the ingredients were natural and were grown in the United States.  Aside from that, once I changed from an inexpensive food with suspect ingredients, there was a very noticeable difference in her general appearance, especially her fur.  It became sleek and ultra shiny and her body slim and trim.<br /><br />Brandy is now eleven years old and although I cannot credit Eagle for her health, she has had only one minor incident that she's had to be taken to the vet's for outside of regular checkups.  My veterinarian wholeheartedly approves of her diet and is pleased that even though she's getting to be an old girl, she's amazingly healthy.  I used to use another Eagle brand, but since she's getting older,  I switched to the senior brand.  She's getting a tad chunky, but her activity level has changed.  Brandy still is frisky and I do believe a good diet has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />When my vet called me the other day with some test results from another dog, I asked her about the corn in this food.  Everyone is yelling about corn being a poor and unhealthy filler so I couldn't resist asking.  She simply said that she considered corn a vegetable and had little bad to say about it.  In other words, a not to worry situation.  My dog is happy, healthy, and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground Yellow Corn, Oatmeal, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Pork Meal, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Beet Pulp, Anchovy & Sardine Meal, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Wheat Germ Meal, Potassium Chloride, Carrots, Peas, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Dried Kelp, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein (min.)  26%<br /><br />Crude Fat (min.)  12%<br /><br />Crude Fiber (max.)  3.00%<br /><br />Moisture  (max.)  10.00%<br /><br />Calcium (min.)  1.00%<br /><br />Phosphorus (min.)  0.080%<br /><br />Vitamin A  (min.)  22,000 IU/kg<br /><br />Vitamin E  (min.)  165 IU/kg<br /><br />Ascorbic Acid (min.)  30 mg/kg<br />(Vitamin C)*<br /><br />Omega 6 Fatty (min.)  2.40%<br />Acids *<br /><br />Omega 3 Fatty (min.)  0.60%<br />Acids*<br /><br />Glucosamine  (min.)  340 mg/kg<br />Hydrochloride<br /><br />Total Lactic Acid  (min.)  100,000,000<br />Microrganisms*<br /><br />(Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium in equal amounts)<br />*Not recognized as an essential nutrient by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles<br />Eagle Pack Senior Adult Dog Food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for maintenance.<br /><br />FEEDING GUIDELINES (from the website):<br /><br />Transitioning to Eagle Packï¿½<br />It is important to slowly transition your dog from his/her current diet as it takes a few days for the body to adapt to the new nutrient levels.

review/summary: Great Food
review/text: My two senior dogs absolutely love this food.  They were in good condition before, but are now in excellent condition.  My 15 year old mini poodle had a "gas" problem, but that was all.  His blood work showed an elevated liver count.<br /><br />My 9 year old standard poodle had soft stool, was lethargic and was generally just off.  The vet could find nothing wrong.  She recommended a food change to a "senior" food.<br /><br />We have completed our first full 30 lb bag and what a difference.  No more gas in Gizmo and the Standard Poodle, Clio, is acting very active and young again.  Her stool is also firm again.<br /><br />I am now going to be a regular customer as my vet likes the results also.

Lovely expresso flavor with a very rich caramel center.

review/text: I eat popcorn most nights.  I use an air popper and a little melted butter (not marjarine or spread).  I've tried every thing available in the stores and many gourmet popcorns looking for the perfect one -- and organic.  I found it here.  This popcorn has a mild corn taste and pops up big and fluffy.  I've read more than once that if you are going to buy anything organic, make it popcorn.  Pesticides are found on popcorn.  You wash some of that stuff off of your veggies, but popcorn is never washed -- just sifted before packaging.  You won't be disappointed with this popcorn.

review/summary: Best popcorn ever!
review/text: We microwave our popcorn in plain paper bags with no oil.  We've tried many brands, but this is the best, by far.  It always tastes fresh, never stale, or soggy.  It holds up well to a bit of olive oil, and the flavor is great.  It also comes in vacuum sealed bags, that can be resealed.  I ordered 12, as the bags are small, which is a plus for freshness as well.  Also, being organic is important to us, as it's my understanding that popcorn which is not organic, provides some of the highest levels of toxins from pesticides.  Buy organic, buy this popcorn.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: It's organic. It pops big and fluffy. YUM!
review/text: I had been using the Nordic Ware Microwave Popcorn popper with one of the Fireworks popcorn varieties that was supposed to be best popped in the microwave. I wasn't happy with all the old maids that were left in the bottom of the bowl. I used the reviews and found this organic popcorn, and I'm so glad I did. I like that this popcorn is organic, and comes in 20 oz resealable bags which keeps it nice and fresh, and easy to transport (beach trip). The most important things that I like about this popcorn is that it pops huge, fluffy, and flavorful. I had been able to use a half cup of the Fireworks popcorn without it ever nearing the top of the popper bowl. The first time I popped the Eden Organic Yellow popcorn with a half cup portion it literally popped the top off of the popper. Eden's Organic Yellow popcorn pops much bigger, and had very few old maids left in the bowl. I'm able to use a quarter of a cup of popcorn to get a full bowl. One other benefit to the Eden Organic Yellow popcorn over the Fireworks brand I was using is that the popcorn isn't as hard on the teeth. You still get a crunch just not a hard crunch, and less hulls between the teeth. Try the Eden's Organic Yellow popcorn with confidence. I think you'll be happy with the results. To get a great bowl of popcorn I use the Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil with some Jolly Time Buttery seasoning...yum, yum, yum!

review/text: I wanted organic popcorn (had been buying it in bulk at a local upscale grocer which was inconvenient). I checked Amazon and decided to give this a try given the reviews and the sourcing. The popcorn arrived on the day when I was about at the end of my current supply. The difference between what I had been using and this popcorn was dramatic. Huge puffs and no grubby hulls in the pot to be wiped out before making the next batch. While I normally don't like individual packaging, in this instance it may be worth it to keep the kernels fresh and ready to go.

Most of the antioxidents are actually in the hulls, and many bagged pre-popped brands take the hulls out! This was a great find, and and LOVE that it comes in sealable bags. I use organic butter with it and sea salt. I do find it slightly chewier than major brands, but that doesn't bother me. It's a tasty treat that's actually good for me! Bonus! Great buy!

review/text: This is the first time I purchased an Amazon product in bulk without trying it out first.  I am so relieved to like this product so much. I love popcorn popped on the stovetop and this corn is great! It is my healthy snack (well...sometimes I do put some butter in just before it pops for extra yumminess).  The bags that it comes in have a zipping seal. I have not noticed any difference in the size of the popped corn when compared to a national non-organic brand as other reviews of organic popcorn have noted. This is good simple real food without preservatives and pesticides.  Worth the extra money for an extra healthy low-calorie (if I can bring myself to skip the butter) snack.

review/summary: thought I was eating chewy puffed rice!
review/text: I've always gotten another popcorn, Orville's - and love it, but I was happy to see an organic brand. Made it for the first time tonight and blech. Perhaps it's an old bag, but it really needs some flavoring on it because it tastes like nothing. I actually at one point forgot I was eating popcorn and thought - wow, this puffed rice is getting stuck in my teeth.

review/summary: Organic popcorn
review/text: I have been looking for tender, crispy popcorn for some time.  I decided to try this popcorn since it was organic.  It's not what I'm looking for.  It is a little chewy, even though I've made several batches with a few changes, trying to see if I could make it crispy.  Nothing worked.  Perhaps it is old, & maybe it was crispier when it was fresher.

review/summary: Pops great!
review/text: I bought this after deciding to get rid of all processed and GMO products in our home.  They pop great!  It takes slightly longer for the popping to start, and they pop slower than regular Orville brand popcorn, but the taste is the same if not better and the idea of no GMOs in the product makes it worth the extra minute of popping time.  I'd definitely recommend this product. They come in several individually sealed packages, so it keeps the kernels fresher.  Very impressed.

review/text: The best popcorn!!!  I cook this up in an old, heavy, lidded, stainless steel pan (about 3 qt, I think) using organic coconut oil.  Tossed with a generous touch of melted butter and a sprinkling of RealSalt sea salt...you'll never go back to unnatural types of popcorn again after trying this brand.  Pops up fluffy and tasty every time.

review/text: I ordered a lot of this popcorn because it is organic.  I make it just as the direction state on the bag except I substitute the Soybean Oil with Organic Nutiva Extra Virgin Coconut oil.  It gives it a creamy flavor with a slight coconut flavor and it's delicious!<br />I usually get all the kernels to pop because the coconut oil has a high heat tolerance.  My grand kids love it also.

But after explaining to the testers that the lack of artificial flavor, pesticides, and chemicals would affect the taste, they reacted with a "yuck!", and promptly requested to keep this healthy brand.<br /><br />Update: they love it. Only 2-3 kernels per batch end up un-popped. Fantastic.

review/summary: What Happened To This Product????
review/text: As a previous reviewer stated - I used to buy this product and it was very good - very spicy.  I have purchased several jars over the last several months, at different locations, and this product no longer is any good - at all.  The jar I just opened was supposed to be good until 2011 - it was totally bland, and looked old.  I don't know what Thai Kitchen is doing - but - their curry pastes are bland.  It seems like the curry is very old.  Or, the jars are not sealed properly.  I have even sent emails to Thai Kitchen about this.  This vendor has a problem.  Go to an Asian market and get a real curry paste.  It makes a WORLD of difference.  (I'm sorry Thai Kitchen - but you need to get it together !!)

review/text: We bought this stuff on occasion (loved it) for quite some time, but now it has changed.  Bought some recently and found it to be very mild and tasteless.  Used almost the whole jar!  Still no flavor.  Thought something was wrong and bought a jar a few months later, someplace else.  Same result.  Won't buy again, have tried another brand (A Taste of Thai brand Curry Paste, available in 4 different flavors), will stick with that.  Liked that this came in a nice sized jar, versus a packet, but without flavor, what's the point?  Hope this is helpful...

Patak's is the best red curry paste I have ever used.<br /><br />I have cooked red curry chicken and red curry shrimp and Patak's made my entrees delicious.  I simmered the paste with meat and vegetables and then added some lite coconut milk to create a rich and flavorful curry sauce.  Yum!<br /><br />A word of advice.. Don't waste your money on Thai Kitchen brand.<br /><br />Feel free to send me a message if you want to talk about Thai and Indian recipes.<br /><br />Greg

review/text: This curry paste is horrible. The green, red, whatever color, it doesn't matter. They are all bad. Totally flavorless and bland, and when you open the jar, it seems as if it hasn't even been sealed correctly and is old. I was confused for months now, thinking that all these good recipes were crap, and almost threw out my Thai cookbook. Finally after trying some other highly rated online recipes only to find the same problem, I narrowed it down to this jar of crap! Don't buy it. Save your money and your time and look elsewhere for good curry paste....

review/text: Bought this paste in my local grocery store because it was the only thing they had, plus I didn't know any better.  Was making curried butternut squash bisque for the first time.  The bisque was good, but little did I know, it could have been much better.<br /><br />Because this product was so expensive -- it took a whole jar to give my bisque a mild curry flavor -- I looked to Amazon for an alternative.  Found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EI2LLO">Mae Ploy Thai Red Curry Paste - 14 ounce per jar</a> and gave it a try.  Prepared the same butternut squash bisque and Oh. My. Goodness!  What a difference!!<br /><br />Try the Mae Ploy ... you will get a HUGE container for a fraction of the cost, and the taste will be better than you ever knew was possible.  Kept in the fridge, it keeps for a good long while.  But, when you taste the wonderful flavor, you'll be looking for recipes calling for curry paste.  Try the yellow and the green curry too.  Totally different tastes.

review/text: One jar of Thai Kitchen Red Curry Paste used to last me for years.  It was so powerful that a half-teaspoon could season a quart of curry.  Finally ran out of the old stuff (purchased c. 2005) and bought a new bottle.  I added the usual amount and tasted the curry.  Nothing!  Added a tablespoon--then two.  STILL nothing.  Finally I tried some right out of the jar.  The only flavor in it was salt!  Message to serious heat-seekers: Don't waste your money on this garbage.  It has the kick of a ninety-year-old mule.

It's not quite as good as the regular version of Newman's Special Blend. But, it's surprisingly close.<br /><br />If you have been searching for a decent decaf for your Keurig, look no further.

review/summary: Peach Flavor?
review/text: I don't quite understand why this tea contains 'natural peach flavor' rather than simply 'peach'.  It doesn't seem like actual peach would be too much to ask.  The 'natural flavor' gives the tea an off taste, in my opinion.  It also has a smell that can only be described as artificial.  Sorry, this is not a winner in my book.

I put the name in on the amazon search list and in less then 5 seconds there it was. I thought why not??? give it a try. I ordered the product from amazon and within 2 weeks received the product. The first time I opened the packet sent me back to the early 50's and was totally blowen away. Excellent  service and satisfaction thankyou Amazon.  rp

review/text: This box had very few chocolate pops in it but had plenty of the yucky and odd banana flavors.  The grape and cherry are the same, as well as raspberry, they do have orange, which I'm not a fan of but all acceptable flavors.  They can eliminate the banana or change it to lemon (which I thought it was! HUGE disappointment!) Other than that, I love Tootsie Roll Pops!

review/summary: Potent and Effective
review/text: Bigelow Chamomile Herbal Tea helps me relax and unwind at the end of a long, stressful day. I occasionally drink it right before bedtime to help me fall asleep. If you have insomnia, it's a natural remedy worth looking into.<br /><br />I have tried the Celestial Seasonings brand of chamomile tea (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E671X4">Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Herb Tea</a>), which is a blend of Chamomile Flowers, Spearmint Leaves, Lemon Grass, Tilia Flowers, Blackberry Leaves, Orange Blossoms, Hawthorn Berries, and Rosebuds. Although I really like its flavor, I don't find it as potent or as effective as the Bigelow brand of chamomile tea.<br /><br />Each box of Bigelow Cozy Chamomile comes with 20 individually-wrapped tea bags. This order ships with 6 boxes, for a total of 6 x 20 = 120 tea bags. With free shipping, it's the best deal you'll find anywhere! If chamomile tea is a staple in your household, you may want to consider Subscribe & Save and save an extra 15%. You choose to have your tea delivered every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months.<br /><br />---<br />Bigelow Cozy Chamomile works very effectively to soothe and relax. Give it a try!

review/text: While my favorite relaxing tea is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OF6">Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime</a> this tea is a close second. This is made with just chamomile flowers for maximum effect. This means that you get a full flavor of chamomile which is delicious with honey. To vary the flavors all you have to do is change the honey flavor. Like maybe use lavender honey or any other favorite honey you can think of. Now if you are trying to get to sleep this tea might help but I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OQA">Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra</a>.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: the product is listed as a 150g 6-pack.<br />Traditionally, when US companies do a bundle-pack they list the size of the individuals...so a 6 pack of canned soda would be a 12oz 6-pack, we would never see that listed as a 72oz 6-pack<br /><br />I foolishly assumed I was getting a real bargain, 6 150g bags, for about $8!<br />Oh so wrong. It's a 6-pack of 25g bags, 150g TOTAL<br /><br />So you're getting about the equivalent of one bag of chips for your money. Still, not a terrible deal for something a little exotic.<br /><br />The chips themselves were good, though! I only took stars off for the somewhat deceptive descriotion and the fact it took a couple of weeks for them to arrive.
