review/summary: THIS WAS A 5 STAR
review/text: I have felt that Timothy's Columbian Decaf Kcups were worthy of 5 stars, however the last batch (I am on auto delivery) many of the kcups have been defective.  The water does not want to flow through and backs up and makes a mess. I descaled the Keurig, made sure the needle was clear as instructed, ran water through without k cup and worked fine until I put in the K cup. Don't know what the problem is and don't know who to contact about this problem. Using the Keurig is a luxury that I really enjoy but to have throw away this many K cups is beyond annoying as they are rather costly (therein the luxury). I will say that these particular came from the smaller (24ct.) as I ordered those separately from the usual 50 ct. boxes I receive on auto delivery.  I am going to try and contact Timothy's to see what theproblem is. I still will continue to get these K cups unless the problem gets worse.

review/summary: New 50 Packs - Horrible Taste
review/text: My wife and I drank nothing but the Timothy's 2fer 24 pack decaf from Amazon and it was fantastic coffee.  We just received and tried the new light colored fifty pack boxes (that now have no expiration date).  The coffee was horrible.  It tasted like it was ground years ago and left to air dry.  Please return the sealed, date on box, FRESH coffee!!

review/summary: Timothy's World Coffee - 50 Pack
review/text: First of all, my favorite K Cup is the Timothy's Colombian Decaffeinated.  If you are looking for an excellent cup of coffee, I highly recommend Timothy's.  Secondly, it is my understanding that Timothy's is packaged by Green Mountain Coffee. Again, I have never been disappointed by Green Mountain products.  Unfortunately, there comes a time that something goes wrong in the process and you just have to get it off your chest.<br />This package of 50 was not typical.  I have had others in the past and they were neatly packaged in a Timothy's box.  In this case, the package was simply a cardboard box with 50 K cups inside.  What's really different about this order is the incredible poor quality of the K Cups.  It's like they bundled all of the bad production products and stuck then in box to sell on Amazon.<br />We've all heard of the exploding K Cups, but what's really happening is that the small filter inside the K Cup is not bonded properly to the side of the K Cup, and the coffee flows into the bottom of the K Cup and into your cup.  The coffee is not drinkable and you have to pour it out and waste another K Cup.  At today's prices, that's a problem.  I have had a few of these in the past, but this batch is particularly bad.  I have gone through 20 of the 50 K Cups now, and 10 have been defective. Every time, I carefully remove the foil top to find the filters are not properly attached to the side of the plastic K Cup.  What's really bad, is I have 30 of these left.<br />My advice to you is stay away from these 50 packs if you can.  I have not had any real problems when purchasing 2 24 count boxes, but I think these are factory rejects, which are costing me double the price I had expected to pay.

review/summary: Possible Defective K-Cups  ??
review/text: Not sure if I got a bad batch or what... but approx. 25%-33% of the K-Cups will not produce a cup of coffee.  Have many other brands used without any issues.  I have purchased this same brand several times and this is the only time I have had this type of problem. The water pulls from the holding tank and tries to go through the K-Cup but then shuts down because it will not flow through. At the price per serving...  a lose of 1 out of 4  or  1 out of 3  is not a very good track record.

review/text: Just about every serious coffee drinker, is reluctant to try or even admit to others, that there is a Decaf Coffee that tastes, rich and satisfying, even Bold but lets you sleep when that time arrives. Timothy's Decaffeinated Colombian Coffee is just that. It is a wonderful treat as an after dinner coffee that is safe to drink, even as the clock nears that bewitching hour. The price was more than reasonable for the K-Cup version and shipping was free, as a Prime Amazon customer. You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Great coffee but some Kcups are defective
review/text: I was skeptical when I saw other reviews about how some of these Kcups "explode" and make a big mess.  But those reviews are correct.  This is the second time I've ordered this 50-pack from Amazon.  The coffee is great, packaging is efficient, but I would say that so far 10% of the Kcups from the second order have been defective.  So much for the great price!  While I hate wasting so much good tasting coffee, I am getting tired of cleaning up the grounds and hot water that goes all over the place.  What is the deal with these cups?  I've been using Kcups for about 2 years.  Why is it that just these are causing the problem?  Is something being compromised in the making of these Kcups in order to keep the price down?  I think this is the last time I'm going to buy this item from Amazon.  Disappointed!

review/text: The coffee itself has never been a problem - strong decaf? yes please!  However I noticed that several cups out of the 50 had a weak seal between the thin metal lid and the plastic cup itself.  This resulted in me thinking my brewer needed an exorcism as coffee spewed out in all directions.  Hot coffee spraying all over you and your kitchen in random directions = bad news.  After spending wayyy too much time cleaning my machine and picking apart every detail, I noticed the cup's seal had been broken.  Anytime I made a cup of coffee with the same results (coffee volcano!) lo and behold the metal had completely removed itself from the cup.<br /><br />So be careful!

review/text: This is by far the best decaffeinated coffee I have ever tasted. However, I found out after the order arrived that this coffee is decaffeinated using the process of Methylene Chloride. I am concerned about how this chemical will effect my health. I called the coffee company and they told me that Methylene Chloride has been approved by the FDA for use in decaffeinating coffee. I will be more careful when ordering decaf coffee from now on.

review/text: I drink decaf coffee only occasionally, usually in the evenings.  The first time I purchased this coffee, I liked it very much.  I do not necessary expect my decaf to be as robust in flavor as my morning coffee, and this Timothy's Columbian was very pleasant.  However, my most recent purchase (several months ago now) was unsatisfactory.  Even on the 6oz setting, the resulting coffee was very weak and bland.  I quit drinking it and have been trying other brands without finding one I love yet.  Given the recent positive reviews, I wonder if I just received a "bad batch" and need to give Timothy's another try.

From my experience over a third of these cups have broken filters resulting in a ground filled undrinkable cup of coffee. I have found these cups have inconsistent amounts of coffee grounds, resulting in a brew that is too weak or too strong to drink. Economically priced decaf kcups are hard to come by but don't waste your$ on these.

review/summary: coffee is good, they just dont brew well
review/text: Although the coffee tastes good, these kcups don't brew as well as others. These take twice as long as other brands to brew through, and often they "explode" with coffee grinds all over the inside of the unit and in the coffee mug. I've never had this many problems with any other kcup ever. I won't purchase these again.

review/summary: The one decaf I always have
review/text: I used to have the decaf Carribu coffee - but it became too pricey. After trying a number of them, this is the decaf I've settled on. I switch other flavors with every order, but this one I have on subscription. It is just reasonable, smooth coffee (I do use the medium setting, for my taste, it might be weak on the large setting).

review/summary: The only K-cup coffee I really dislike!
review/text: I have tried many of the caffenated and decaf K-cups.  Timothy's Columbian Decaf is the only one I don't like at all.  I think it tastes like instant coffee, which I won't drink.  I made the mistake of buying a box of 18 K-cups (without having tasted it in a sampler)and finally threw out the last half dozen K-cups because I just couldn't drink this coffee.  Among the decafs, my favorite is Green Mountain's French Roast Decaf. Among the caffenated ones, my favorites are Diedrich's French Roast, Newman's Own Extra Bold and Emeril's Extra Bold.

review/summary: In "Timothy's World," flavor isn't a high priority
review/text: I received this K cup as part of an introductory sampler and I'm genuinely grateful. Having tried it, I am inoculated against spending actual money on this brand.<br /><br />The promotional materials for this brand bruit that Timothy's is sold all over Canada. Never having been there, I cannot speak for the veracity of the assertion. I can, however, suggest that if it IS true, and if decaf is any substantial part of Timothy's sales, then they are purveying decaf to people who don't much like coffee. This stuff is, in a word, awful. It bears only the most meager resemblance to actual coffee such as one might brew for oneself at home or get at a decent fast food chain on the road.<br /><br />Since my K cup coffeemaker came with a do-it-yourself insert, I can attest the fact that a good cup of decaf IS possible. I don't know if the failure of this module is because of the roast itself, or because the boys in Accounting convinced the folks in Production that they could save .000001 cents per unit by shorting on the amount of grind. Either way, this Timothy's World K cup is a profound failure, not even yielding the aroma of coffee, let alone anything even taxonomically resembling the flavor of it.<br /><br />Purchase this awful stuff only if the flavor profile you seek is that of "faintly tinted hot tap water."

review/summary: Makes great sauce
review/text: The tomatoes make for incredible sauce.  I always heard about them on food network, cooking channel, etc. I never thought there would be this much difference until I tried them.  You will never go back to Hunts or any other brand.  However, don't use any Cento branded tomatoes.  You have to be sure to use the San Marzano D.O.P Certified (they actually have a unique number on each can).  I can also tell you that cooking them on very high heat with some good olive oil will yield a very nice tasting sauce.  We add only salt, black pepper and a bit of red pepper flakes.  Then when the sauce is cooked down and the oil incorporated (does not take long, maybe 20-25 min at most)  add you spaghetti to the pan with the sauce and add some fresh grated Parmigiano-Reggiano some good quality butter, fresh  cut basil and you have a great meal.

I just put about 2 tablespoons on my ham sandwich.  It is really very weak.  It does state that it is a non-extract sauce, but a little more heat would have been welcomed.  Either that or change the label from saying things like "Fear the Ghost", "The Ghost is gonna bite you".  I will definitely get this again.  Try their silver edition for a serous burn.

review/summary: one of the best tsating hot sauces in my life.
review/text: I am of korean descent, and have had my share of spicy food. Korean food as you know has varying degrees of spicy foods that also taste amazing.<br /><br />The 357 pure ghost hot sauce by mad dog, is the best hot sauce I have had in a very long time, as far as the balance of flavor and heat is concerned. Its not hot at all in my opinion but it does have that bite that lingers nicely after consumption [not overbearing]. I can see why others have commented that this and the other non pure version were considered great flavor enhancers.<br /><br />I am a little disappointed as far as the heat level is concerned. I was hoping to experience more of the bhut jolokia, but over all I am very happy with experimenting with this brand. Mad Dog you have 1 more fan to add to your list of many. I will definitely be buying more hot sauces from this company, and very soon too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this hot sauce, to anyone who wants a step up from the bull sh-t you find at your local grocery store. This brand by far, beats out tobasco, franks red hot, red devil, and the other run of the mill brands u see in stores, in both heat content and flavor.<br /><br />Note: I have purchased from amazon a lot in the past, and this is the first time I felt a product was necessary/worthy of a review.

I have to say that i was disappointed with this product.<br /><br />I have previously had the Mad Dog 6M scoville - it was much hotter and much better tasting than the pure ghost.<br />In comparison the pure ghost sauce is honestly no hotter than a bottle of habanero Tabasco; although it does have better flavor than the Tabasco.<br /><br />Save your money - buy the Mad Dog 6m Scoville sauce instead if you're looking for something with really good heat and flavor.<br /><br />3 out of 5 for this product as hot sauces go and that's being a little generous cause I like this brand.

Reserve - Limited Edition, 50 ml</a>) which is purported to be 650,000-900,000 Scoville, slightly weaker than the Ghost pepper.  I tried a toothpick of this...and then ended up pouring it on everything, since it has nearly no heat to it.  It carries a heat that I would compare to Tabasco, but with an excellent taste that seems to go with everything.<br />  I'm quite disappointed by the heat, but quite impressed with the flavor.

review/summary: Delicious, Hot Yet Tolerable
review/text: This is probably my favorite of the Mad Dog 357 line.  I have tried many of the extreme hot sauces, including Mad Dog 357 Silver Edition, which is WAY too hot to even enjoy or consume.  I keep that sauce strictly as a novelty or something to dare friends to try.  But I read about this sauce, Pure Ghost and decided to give it a try.  I opened the bottle and the first thing I smelled was vinegar, then came the scent of garlic.  It actually smells dominant in the 2 ingredients.  I was seriously afraid to try this sauce, being its habanero and ghost pepper based.  I saw some youtube videos of people taking it by the teaspoon full and hiccuping and totally spazzing.  I also read reviews of people mocking the sauce and saying its not hot at all and say they are disappointed with the heat level, so I was certainly getting mixed opinions about it.  But I fear no ghost, so I filled my spoon full of it, took a deep breath and went for it.  What happened next?  Delight!  I held it in my mouth for 10 seconds (easily) and swallowed.  The blend of flavors was quite good.  No dominant flavor, yet heavy in garlic and vinegar, as stated, but that does not make the sauce unbearable one bit.  The flavor was really good, as I enjoy it on burgers.  The heat is what I consider to be "just right" meaning its not to the point you make a B-Line to the fridge to chug a gallon of milk.  I didn't even need any milk, or water for that matter.  I didn't need anything, I sat and enjoyed the flavor AND the heat as well.  Its a nice burn that lingers for a little while.  I swear I will always have a bottle of this around.  I am now even more tempted to try the other Mad Dog Ghost Pepper sauce, hopefully its just as good, if not better.  I hear Dave's Ghost Sauce is not as hot but tastes better, so that's a MUST buy.  I recommend this sauce to anyone that is a pepperhead or enjoys a good hot wing sauce.  This is nowhere near as hot as Mad Dog 357 Silver, for those of you that have tried it.  So for good flavor and just the right amount of heat, try this.  I can honestly say that even Quaker Steak and Lube's Atomic Sauce is hotter than this, where if I eat just a glob on a pretzel, I start panting.  If you can do that sauce, this will be a piece of cake.  Seriously, what are you waiting for?  Get yourself some of this!  If you wanna try Ghost Pepper/Bhut Jolokia flavor without the excruciating pain, this is the sauce for you.

review/summary: Tied For Favorite
review/text: I'd have to say this sauce is tied with Blair's Pure Death for my new favorite. My heat level is about a 5 or 6 and I'd say this is about a 6. I'm not some idiot who likes to take table spoons at a time. If you guys don't like the heat of this, go with Dave's Ghost Pepper or the extract version of this. I love this sauce. Great for steaks and burgers.

review/summary: Tasty but not as hot as I expected
review/text: This sauce has great flavor but is relatively mild.  By "relatively", I mean when compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DID5R">Dave's Insanity</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B9HC6I">Mad Dog 357 Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce</a> (note the difference, ... not 'pure ghost'), and even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DG55M">Blairs After Death</a>.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B9HC6I">Mad Dog 357 Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce</a> is much, much hotter since it includes pepper extract.  This 'pure ghost' sauce does not include pepper extract, so it is only as hot as the peppers and other ingredients make it.  That said, it is still much hotter than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZSYS">Tabasco</a> and still deserves some respect.<br /><br />Depending on how much heat you like, this sauce may be 'just right'.  It has excellent flavor and a moderate amount of heat.<br /><br />-- Update, July 3, 2011 --<br />Over time, this has become one of my favorite 'mild' sauces. The flavor is unique and is very good on sandwiches, wraps, and several other dishes. It isn't so mild (like most grocery store hot sauces) that I have to pour a whole bottle on something to get some burn. The label definitely over-hypes the heat, but if you can forgive them for that, and if you like the unique flavor, it is a good sauce.

review/summary: Boxed Evolution
review/text: Long live Camper Van Beethoven!! This is a blessing for long time CVB fans who didn't have a chance to upgrade their collection to CD before most of this went out of print.  Wow, where to begin?  CVB was a band that matured on record, so to speak, so this is really a fascinating and entertaining listen from beginning to end.<br />  Of course you get the endearing and humorous debut album with goofy anthems ala "Take the Skinheads Bowling" and various folk/ska instrumentals; the increasingly warped and psychedelic "II & III"; and this collections' centerpiece: the self titled 3rd album!!  Forget the editorial remark above about them "scratching their heads out loud" on this because there's nothing confused, unfocused, or tentative about this album.  I'd say it's a characteristically irreverent and eclectic psych-rock masterpiece.  The song writing has fully matured with the sarcastic humor still intact, and it seems to be intentionally conceived as an album that gets stranger and stranger as it goes on, with the group mastering every diverse style they apply themselves to.  I could go on and on about this album, but suffice it to say it's a classic.<br />  "Camper Vantiquities", the 4th CD is a top notch odds and ends collection containing perhaps the best Camper song ever: "Seven Languages" and the Harrison/Starkey composition "Photograph."  Finally, the live CD is a competent but not revelatory live set from 1990 with 2 songs from 1988.  I would've prefered to hear an earlier and more chaotic live recording, but I'm sure the quality wouldn't have been as good.<br />  All in all, you can't go wrong with this.  The packaging is quality: a thick , bright orange box with the 5 Cds in simple glossy slip cases, (well, the box is relatively thin but it's made of nice thick cardboard) and a full color booklet with 2 essays.  One is an entertaining first-hand account of what Santa Cruz was like when Camper formed; the other is a dry and factual journalists view on the Camper "phenomenon" MUCH LIKE THIS REVIEW.  I hope it was helpful.  Rock on Comrades!!!

I like the variety of instruments the band employs(violin,banjo,steel guitar & sitar etc) are some of the instruments used in the cigarettes & carrot juice collection.<br />Even though I only heard my second CVB track when I bought this collection in late 2010, It does'nt really matter as unique, lively & colorful music such as this loses nothing over time.Don't know if they have ever toured Australia,but it would definitely be on my list.

Each CD comes in a little cardboard cover just like the original record, which is sort of thrilling. To me, these three albums were, by far, the most exciting music Camper Van Beethoven ever released. After the 3rd album, they got caught up in that unfortunate late-80s quality pop songcraft thing, and it broke them. This stuff, though, is tossed out, sloppy, unprofessional, fun, and gorgeous. Don't get all that other stuff, get this.

review/summary: Camper van Beethoven is the greatest rock band ever
review/text: Well, maybe not &quot;the&quot; greatest, but one of the best.  This set brings together the earlier stuff which is slightly more quirky than the two albums they did for Virgin.  Some of it is even sort of challenging, but mixed in are some songs as lovable as a soft fluffy kitten with a ball of yarn like &quot;Take the Skinheads Bowling&quot; and &quot;Good Guys &amp; Bad Guys&quot;.  There was this one story about them one time when they played in Philly and stayed with the Dead Milkmen for the night.  It's a great story, but probably shouldn't be repeated here.  When I first picked up a guitar (actually the first time I picked up a guitar after hearing the third album) I wanted to play &quot;Good Guys &amp; Bad Guys&quot; but I was the only keyboard player in the band so I got stuck playing the keyboard part which is a lot more tasty after you play it a few times.  We can thank our lucky stars that these guys are touring again.  I was heartbroken when they broke up and Cracker always sounded a little too sanitized.  This set is almost like another album coming out, except that the songs came out before.  It's beautiful.

review/summary: Never A Dull Moment
review/text: Finally, a collection of the best Camper Van Beethoven albums (I think there is one album missing from the band, a  major label release with intentionally clean over-production).  I had been waiting years for this dream CD, as I only possessed each one in vinyl.  <p>Some people like to listen to a full album that has a recognizable identity in its sonic experience.  You will not get that from Camper, as they instead offer a faint, mysterious familiarity in musical pieces that can tweak your ears in two opposing directions, even during the simplist compositions.  If that sounds appealling, you can correctly guess that boredom cannot maintain a presence with this compilation.<p>Categorizing this music is impossible, again due to so many style changes.  Psycho-country?  Unpretentious garage-rock with arena-sized talent?  Low-fi Hillbilly Jazz?  Spraycan Art-rock?  Gritty Underground Surf? Poor rich kids with Mischievous Aspirations transferring their energy into music? Kerouac whack?  How about calling it a "Flexible Soup".  It's anything but smooth, yet occassionally you find David Lowery's penchant for small club-guitar rock sneaking through (after CVB dismantled, he became the leader of the successful pop-rock group, Cracker).  It may be easier to instead think of the band as a group of hyper-static fellows whose medications are almost, but not quite at the right dosage.  They're simply possessed by friendly demons with a spiritual intent to entertain and cause wonder. <p>Each album collectively draws numerous inspirations and styles, completely entertaining the listener through lyrics and musicianship on a variety of traditional and obscure instruments.  One can only imagine the pure enjoyment the band had while first writing then performing these before an audience.  For two decades now, I've held a relentless belief that CVB would make the most amusing backyard-party band -- sure to make Granmma Nelly dance alongside her pierced third generation of family one moment and then cover her bleeding ears when the next song begins.  However, I believe the band's intent is not to frighten or shock, but to instead expose the wealth of musical styles that one listener despises while another reaches a glee plateau.  Be sure that these same two listeners will switch positions when a later tune begins.  Are you prepared to enjoy the best of many worlds?<p>Picturesque landscapes are lyrically drawn with a slacker-like intelligence in unimportant poignancy, the next moment you are drawn into a global hoe-down, followed then by crafty psychedelica mixed with raw instrumentals, closing with an guitar orchestra jamout with lead played by a screaming violin chant.  Add a half-tablespoon of sugar Wiseguy and serve.  <p>Add this to your collection if you appreciate bands that are like no other.  Some tracks will prompt you to ask "Why?", yet with an immediate second thought you'll smile and say "Why hasn't Anyone Else?"<p>[I noticed that CVB had recently made a handful of live performances after a long time apart.  I've caught several of their shows and recommend all to give your mind a jolt of electricity that is surprisingly pleasant.  You will walk away wide-eyed at the unrealized potential and wasted energy we swallow in 99% of today's music. ]

review/summary: Fantastic Cinnamon Taste
review/text: I bought these for my husband's candy jar at work.  Everyone there loves the great cinnamon taste.  They taste a little like fireballs but are not quite as hot.  Three (3) pieces contain 70 calories, 10 mg. of sodium, and 17 g. of carbs (11 from sugar).  Each one lasts quite awhile.  Highly recommend these for taste, texture, and the price I paid through Amazon.com.
