review/summary: MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I am very disappointed that this Happy Hips product is made in China now. If it wasn't for me going into a pet food store that doesn't carry products not made in the USA I would be still feeding this product to my dog. I am really concerned on finding a new product due to my Bichon's allergies, she can only have Lamb. She now sits at the cabinet and cries for her treat. I think I may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator. More work but worth it. With no regulations in China who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product. As we know the packaging is misleading what is misleading in the ingredents. I have been to China it is scary. We take so much for granted in the USA.<br /><br />dp

review/text: My dogs loved this product and I was happy to spend the money on it, but now that it's made in China- thumbs down, what were they thinking? I'll never buy it again. There are better products made in the USA. If you care about the well being of your dog, you will avoid products made in China.

review/summary: Causes diarrhea and vomiting!! Do not buy!
review/text: I will no longer be giving these to my dog!! They caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit! When I did some more research online, there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues! My dog loves these treats. I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now. Every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance- in most cases both, and I finally now linked it to these treats. Do your research before you buy this product!! However, I would not recommend these at all!

review/summary: My dog feels better!
review/text: I've been giving these treats to my dog for roughly 3 weeks now.  He is a Dalmation/Hound mix and has joint issues in his back legs.  At 12 years old we have definitely noticed him slowing down.  He has food allergies so having this medication in the form of duck breast (something which dogs are rarely allergic to I am told) was perfect for our Buddy.  He's running a bit again in the yard and seems more inclined to go for a walk (something he used to love to do).  I highly recommend a try if you are skeptical.  I like it so much I went to a "subscription" status to save a little more money.  At roughly $20/month for us, it is well worth the "investment" - it just plain made him feel better!

review/text: Admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious.  However they are made in China and dog lovers in the US usually choose not to buy products from China due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals.  Dogswell should take note of this and manufacture them in the US.  It should also be noted that competitive brands on your grocery store shelves are also made in China even though distributed in California.  The only brand I have found that is manufactured in the US is from Trader Joes.  If you love your dog do not buy this item.  Go to Trader Joes.

review/summary: Made in China? Not feeding THIS anymore!
review/text: Up until now, I believed I was feeding my dogs a healthful treat that was good for them. Of note: the glucosamine and chondroitin content in these jerky treats is of the highest I've seen in a treat that they actually "like" and look forward to having. I was feeding these as a daily joint supplement to my poodle in particular who, as of late, had been experiencing more joint issues after a traumatic hip injury years earlier.<br /><br />Thanks to the savvy poster who brought to light this product is now being produced in China. Costco sells jerky treats made in China as well, and I no longer purchase those and warn my clients about purchasing them too. Only made in the USA and USDA inspected, as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Why oh why can't pet owners find a decently priced, trustworthy jerky treat for our pets that is A. High in glucosamine and B. Isn't manufactured in China? Being that China has shown little diligence with regards to creating a child's toy that isn't later involved in a recall, I'm certainly not about to give any credence to something that will be ingested by my pets. I'm tossing the rest of these treats in the trash!<br /><br />No. Thank. You.

When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as "MADE IN CHINA". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!

review/text: My dogs LOVE duck treats and have been getting the chicken happy hips for years so I though I'd give the duck a try.  Bad idea.  The treat was too tough and stringy for my small female Westie to pull apart and she ended up choking and vomiting.  I order by subscription and had to make cuts in the strips with a poultry shear to use up the 6 bags.  I too hate the fact that these are made in China, but my little guys need extra condroitin and glucosamine so I'm back to the chicken formula.

review/summary: Not Sure
review/text: My Shih Tzu loved these and I have been giving him these duck treats off and on for the past two years with no obvious problem even though they are made in China. Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.<br /><br />So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something. Not going to take any more chances with this brand.

They buy meat from one of the largest makers of dog food in china, a MASSIVE factory.  And are fully aware of the FDA issued warnings about chicken products from China killing pets.  They state they test for everything, but since the contaminant has not been pinpointed yet it is impossible to test for.  Don't give your dog these treats!  Do your research and read every label CLOSELY as they really try and fool you with the fine print.

review/summary: CAUTION!!!!
review/text: I've been buying Dogswell chew treats for my dog for several years. She's always loved them. The most recent time I purchased them, however, she got seriously ill, with heavy vomiting and lethargy. I almost forgot about it, but a few weeks later I found them in the back of the cabinet and tried them again. She got very ill again. Especially since she's rarely sick, it's difficult to ignore the link between these treats and her illness.  Unless and until there's some quality control on these, I highly recommend finding a different treat. As for the issue of 'made in china', I only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews, and in fact,the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china. I find that pretty incredulous, considering the claims on the packaging about all natural and even free range. Definately beware!

review/summary: Dog went Crazy - Neighbor Dog Wants to Move In - These are Disgusting!!!!
review/text: Ugh.<br /><br />We've been buying Happy Hips treats for our 14 year old black lab/springer spaniel mix for about a year because they are SO beneficial for her arthritis.  We bought a batch of the Beef Liver to add a little variety to the whole routine - and oh, my gosh!<br /><br />The dog LOVES these treats!  She's ready to put on a tu-tu and prance around the kitchen to beg for them.  Forget the dignity afforded to canine senior citizens - this pooch is acting like her old juvenile self!  I don't know if they are more potent than the duck or chicken treats, but they sure seem to pack some sort of punch!<br /><br />I made the mistake of giving the neighbor dog a taste.  Now she won't go away!  Every time I turn around she's at the back door looking for more - she certainly never acted this way with the duck or chicken!<br /><br />Did I mention that they were disgusting??  They ARE!  Unlike the other "flavors" of Happy Hips these things absolutely REEK!  And forget about them looking like "beef jerky" - nope!  They're real dried out liver - mostly little dried square bits that remind me of mica or shale (they're almost crystalline).  There's no pretending this is anything other than what it is - nasty gross protein of the variety that dogs LOVE!  At least it's sanitary and not the dead stuff they like to roll in out in the yard.<br /><br />Yes, I'll be forced to buy these again.  My 14 year old is rather irresistible with her old-lady gray hair, sassy grin, and wagging tail!  They are a healthy all natural treat with no added hormones, fillers or other nasty stuff.  I just wish they didn't smell so bad!<br /><br />December 2010 UPDATE:<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Ceilie is still making her way around the yard at nearly 16 years old thanks in large part to the Happy Hips brand of treats.  We were pulled out of town last winter for a family emergency and had to leave her with a relative for a week.  She didn't do well adjusting at all, so by the time I got back home I was really scared I was going to lose her.  I don't know if she had a stroke or just refused to eat, but she could barely walk and couldn't hold her head straight.  It took a week of encouraging her to eat senior dog food (a cut up hot dog plus chicken broth helps) and regular dosing of glucosamine and chondroitin via these treats to pull her out of it.  Now I have to be careful that I don't run out.  If she doesn't get her dose of these each day she goes down hill really fast.  The vitamin option doesn't sit well on her tummy so I persist in spoiling my grey haired old lady with these treats.  Amazon's prices and delivery can't be beat.

review/text: My dog absolutely loves these treats. We have tried many treats since we have had her, and she has never loved any of them as much as she loves these. When she is done eating one, she will stalk the bag and try to manipulate us into giving her another one. She literally goes crazy for them. I like the fact there are so few ingredients and that they do not have any grains in them. Our dog is getting older, so I feel good about the ingredients for her joints. The only reason that I gave them four stars instead of five is that they are made in China; I really wish they were made in the United States. I must warn you though; your dog may become addicted--just like mine :)

review/text: In my opinion, its an outrage that these treats which used to be Made in the US are now Made in China. The company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients.<br /><br />Let me start my review stating that many of the current 5-star ratings here look suspiciously fake (made up). Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food.

This is very disappointing considering 4-5 years ago when many pets in the US died due to food poisoning resulted from pet food packed in China.<br /><br />It is very surprising why this product got around 4/5 rating. I am assuming either  many buyers, like us, did not read where this is manufactured as the text "Made in China" is written in small alphabets and hidden in other text behind the cover OR most of these reviews in 2010 and 2011 look suspiciously 'fixed'...notice how many of them got 1 out of 1 likes.<br /><br />We have stopped feeding our dog this food out of legitimate concern.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Feb 2012: Just to update that our dog died recently after diagnosed suffering from Hemolytic Anemia and Diabetes. We fed our dog these treats for number of years and now wonder just how much they contributed to her illness considering these treats are NOT made in USA but China.

review/summary: DO NOT TRUST THIS PRODUCT!  MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I had been buying my 2 year old Bichon Frise these Happy Hips Duck Treats for  months until recently when I purchased a large bag that, upon opening it, reeked of some sort of chemical substance which smelled very much like chlorine or bleach. The smell was overwhleming and disgusting. Not knowing what was wrong with it, just out of curiosity I looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough....at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words, "Made in China".<br /><br />Up until this time I had assumed their treats were made in the USA, and some of them are. But after looking through all their products it seems that their duck and chicken breast treats come from China.<br /><br />Do NOT trust this product!!!

review/summary: WARNING ---> MADE IN CHINA!
review/text: I didn't mind paying the $20+ a bag because my dog loved them. These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats/food that was killing dogs....when I looked at the Happy Hips bag, I was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in China.<br /><br />I used to joke that my dog was addicted to these, but now I am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these Chinese "treats"

review/summary: Beware - Made in China
review/text: My 8 year old Maltese loved these treats.  I didn't know about the FDA warnings until after he died from a "mystery" illness that started out as vomiting followed by lethargy.  He had been very healthy before.  The vet did a necropsy and said my dog's liver was severely enlarged and his kidneys were also affected.  Please don't feed your beloved pets ANYTHING made in China.  If I had known about the dangers, I would never have given these to my dog.

review/text: all of the veterinary products made in China are potentially dangerous to your pet.  Do not buy pet products made in China.  Along with the melamine issues of a few years ago, there have been reports of Salmonella on these so called "treats".<br /><br />Additionally, there are no good studies showing any efficacy of glucosamine for the treatment of arthritis.<br /><br />And Amazon should make it easier to find the country of origin of all of their products.

Here is what they replied to me which immediately relieved my worries.

review/summary: Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver
review/text: I placed an order for Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver on 6/25/12.  On July 5 when my current supply was used up, I opened the new batch.  Started with one pouch and then a second pouch.  For the first time the product doesn't appear to be healthy and fresh.  Instead of being solid brown, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.  My guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat, not the original one and that's the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats.

review/summary: Chinese Product Masquerading as American
review/text: I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) "U.S.A. Rawhide" and on the back, in fine print, was "Made in China."  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our "furry kids" that won't make them sick or kill them!

review/text: I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.<br /><br />The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.<br /><br />Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased.

review/summary: Zero stars- my dog became ill after eating these
review/text: My otherwise healthy Papillon was doing great before feeding these to him.  He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.  I am giving them 1 star, because there is no button for 0 stars.

review/summary: Made in China, causes some concerns
review/text: I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.<br /><br />However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?

review/summary: Made in China - won't buy anymore
review/text: My dog became very ill (vomiting, diarrhea, excruciating pain) in mid-Oct and spent three days at the Emergency Vet - and cost us $3500! They ruled out a bunch of things and were only able to say that he might have Irritable Bowel Disease but the biopsy to find out for certain would cost us an additional $1800. He did recover (without the test) and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now. However, I have to say that I had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate. I can't say for sure that these were the cause but I won't be buying ANY dog food products (treats or otherwise) that are made in China. Treats made in the USA only for us!!

Finally, I have found a treat that's healthy, not only for his hips, but for his teeth, also.  They're nice & chewy.<br />I read food labels constantly, and it helps to be able to read the ingredients before purchasing on Amazon.  Also, buying Dogswell in bulk (15oz./pks of 3) as Amazon offers, is the best deal I have found, so far.  My 13yr. old, 33lb. dog gets 3 chicken strips a day.  The rest of the 15oz. pkg. goes into the freezer, whereupon the next day I'm able to snap each strip into thirds - that's how Ranger Bob (my dog) likes it.  Might not be a bad idea to offer it this way for smaller dogs.  Oh, and one last thing, Ranger Bob will bury pig ears, real bones, biscuits,"green bones" etc. but not these Dogswell strips!

review/text: I ordered three packages because the price was so good, then I saw this. I am asking Amazon for a refund - otherwise, they are going in the trash unused.<br /><br />Copied from FDA web site.<br /><br />FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products<br />November 18, 2011<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]

review/text: FDA just issued yet another warning for dog chicken jerky treats made in CHINA..... dog lovers, you NEED TO PAY ATTENTION!!!! We just threw our stuff in the trash......Yet another health article appeared on CNN online re: dog chicken jerky treats. I re-read the reviews on Amazon. I contacted Dogswell customer service and got a lengthy, very informative reply that said, " A large number of our products are sourced and manufactured in the United States and only a small number of our treats, are made in China." (My package clearly states made in CHINA --- so, did I buy that "small number" of bags??). I carefully weighed all the information and still do not feel comfortable. I believe the manufacturer cares a lot about dogs but how about keeping the business right here in the USA?<br /><br />We just made the decision to stop ordering this product. Yes, my dogs like the treats but I cannot, in my heart, say I can serve them to my pups. I am unconvinced that this is the best option for my dogs.

review/summary: Dogswell - Dogs love them!
review/text: It's more than a year that I daily feed Dogswell Happy Hips treats to my now 12 year old dog who has arthritis in her hips. Her moves are more fluid now, without the 'stiff' look to her stride because of the glucosamine and chondroitin contained in this product. Plus she looks forward to getting the treats every day (her favorite is the Duck Breast).<br />I also give my dog a Best Pet Health chewable tablet every evening that contains glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM. These products really do help my arthritic dog a lot.

review/summary: Has The Manufacturer Changed the Formula?
review/text: I have been giving these chews to my Mini-Pincher and Mini-Dauchand for the past 3 years to help support their joints and hips.  The last batch I bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more.  It made my Mini-Pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools.  I am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the US . . . I have been looking at GNC products for Dogs and that is probably the route I will take.

review/summary: dangerous treat
review/text: I have been giving my dog this treat for a long time,I found it here on Amazon and it is much cheaper! Now I learned that ALL chicken treats for dogs (and also cats I believe) that are MADE IN CHINA are being investigated  by the FDA because some dogs have died after consuming them. These treats and all Dogswell treats are made in China,I researched all over the web about this matter and bottom line is: why take the risk? A few sites say it is OK, most say to be cautious and others say don't buy.I threw out all the ones I bought and got new ones made in USA.I wish Amazon gave us the choice of "made in USA", for now I recommend everyone that has a pet to read the labels of the treats and food. Sorry this product, I don't recommend.

review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE Dogswell products!
review/text: I found Dogswell products 7 years ago when my vet recommended the Glucosa-Chondro chicken strips to help my dog who had just had patella luxation surgery on both his knees. The vet said the supplements would help my little one avoid arthritis in his later years. I'd say so! He's pushing 8.5 yo and doesn't show any signs of slowing down even though he has pins in both knees. He jumps high, runs like a maniac and is spry as a pup. Between this and various other dogswell treats that care for his eyes, hair, coat, breath, teeth, etc, he's going strong which makes momma very happy. All in all, I love these products and recommend them to all my friends who have dogs.

review/text: I ignored the other reviews about how these were now being made in China - I had checked the warnings and was comfortable that Dogswell hadn't been mentioned.  I've bought them many times, and my dog loves these treats!  Unfortunately, the most recent batch I got last week smelled really awful - like a mix of chemicals and rotten meat.  None of the bags I've gotten before smelled anything like this, and it was so strong that it filled my apartment with the odor.  I threw them out and would not recommend buying them.  It's not worth the risk.

review/summary: Pregnancy Survival!
review/text: When I wound up with terrible morning sickness, everyone had some food or method to recommend for feeling better.  I heard it all--and very little worked for me in the slightest.  I spent my days being miserable and feeling sick as anything.  But when I was visiting a friend, she happened to have a package of Gin Gins and offered me one.  I was already chewing on raw ginger to help things, so I figured it couldn't hurt.<br /><br />Rarely has anyting tasted so good as that candy did to my morning sick stomach!  Sweet, but not too sweet, with enough of a gingery bite.  One hard candy could last a while and keep the nausea down.  The first thing I did when I had a chance was order a whole case of the things!  After that I always had a bag tucked into my pocket book throughout the first months of my pregnancy.  Unlike raw ginger, there was no preparation time involved, and the candy is much more pleasant to eat and easier to share with others. (I still like raw ginger and ginger tea, though).  Since then, I've recommended and shared my stash of Gin Gins with several pregnant friends--and they've given me positive feedback as well.<br /><br />Gin Gins also makes a chewable kind--but that's hard on the teeth and can pull out a filling if you're not careful! Plus it's a sharper taste than the hard candies, so it may not appeal as universally.  My only regret is that there doesn't appear to be a sugar free variety of these on the market, and that is something I could have used.  Still, all in all a great investment and one of the most useful things I bought for my early pregnancy.  Beats saltine crackers any day!<br /><br />Enjoy! ^_^ Shanshad

I have bags in my nightstand, in the car, my husband's car, my purse, and the kitchen.  They aren't too sweet and pack enough of a ginger punch to settle my stomach and quash any bad breath issues.  I like the ginger chews also, but they tend to hurt my teeth more than these hard candies.<br /><br />These are a great buy!

review/text: I have an issue with dehydration, but due to some medical complications it's really difficult for me to drink a lot of any liquid.  I don't usually like the taste of plain water, and I wanted to stay away from all sugary drinks.  I went through about 10 different powdered drinks before I ran across this.  This is now basically the only thing I ever drink.  I hate the aftertaste that aspartame usually leaves, but the taste of it in this is very, very slight, nothing like drinking a Diet Coke.  It is delicious, refreshing, and it is keeping me more hydrated because I love to drink it.  If you are having a difficult time finding the perfect calorie-free drink, give this a shot!

review/summary: very good but no savings anymore
review/text: Of all the flavors of Crystal Light, this is the flavor that no one in our family has gotten tired of.<br />Especially in the summer served cool it absolutely hits the spot.<br />Unforntunately it seems that this popularity reflects in the Amazon price, as it has become one of the more expensive Crystal Light flavors on Amazon, and after shipping there are no more savings when compared to our local markets. I used to have in as a standing order as I got a good deal on Amazon, now it is no different than the regular markets, even more expensive than the sales that markets offer.

review/summary: Iced Tea Peach
review/text: I love this Crystal Light ICED TEA PEACH but can no longer find it in my grocery stores. So the other day I ordered it online and maybe because they were out they sent a substitute. They sent Iced Teac Peach MANGO....Gad...that's not what I wanted but I will keep it because I hate the idea of returning it.  So please send me the ICED TEA PEACH as shown in your picture. Thanks

review/summary: Delicious iced tea
review/text: The peach flavored tea is one of my family's favorites. The peach taste is just right--not too strong or syrupy tasting. There is also no chemical taste as sometimes happens with artificially sweetened drinks.<br /><br />This is really easy to make. I just pour two packs into a large pitcher, stir, and keep it in my refrigerator so I always have a nice cold drink. It is very refreshing.<br /><br />Shop for price. On sale at my local supermarket I can buy 4 packs for six dollars.

review/summary: Peach Tea.
review/text: I surely enjoy the refreshing Peach tea, pricing is very good, bulk packaging works great as well.  After mixing peach tea I watch it disappear quickly with our Grand kids.  Thank you

review/text: Why do we have to review this? How do I impart to you the flavor of Crystal Light peach tea? it doesn't taste like tea because it is not tea, none of these drink mixes taste like tea. but it does taste like Crystal Light "tea", which i like and why i bought this.

review/summary: Peach Tea
review/text: I had begun having trouble finding Crystal Light Peach Tea in grocery stores so again I tried Amazon and was a bit surprised to find it there.  My family just loves Peach Tea and when this batch runs out, I'll buy again.

review/summary: Good tasting drink
review/text: This is one of the most popular flavors of drink mix around this house. It has good flavor and is quick and easy to make. I like the new packaging much better. And shopping here on Amazon is great as it is cheaper than Crystal Light at Walmart, but not cheaper than the GV brand (which is probably the same stuff).

review/summary: really good drink
review/text: I really love crystal light peach tea.  It is easy to make and has the most natural peach flavor that I have found.  I like to use a little less water than it calls for.  It makes it stronger tasting.  I had to search stores to find it and now I am getting it sent to me from amazon on a monthly schedule.
