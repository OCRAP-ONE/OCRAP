review/summary: Exceptional Cat Food!
review/text: Oh, this is some good cat food!<br />Have you ever opened a can of Friskies and gagged at the awful smell? How can your cat eat that?<br />This cat food smells pretty good, and it simply looks and smells like good food. My kittens made so much noise when I opened that can! They gobbled it right up, and I have to admit that it smelled pretty good.

review/text: This stuff looks disgusting, it really does. It's like meat soup that has been pureed. My cat goes nuts for it. She chirps her tiny cat meow at me whenever I get up in the morning and when I come home from work. I put her dry food in, that she used to love (will definitely switch to Spot's Stew dry next time I buy) and she looks at me like I'm evil. All she wants now is her succulent salmon.

review/summary: Cats review
review/text: I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed.

review/summary: My cat loves Spot's Stew, and I know it's good for him.
review/text: I've seen other reviewers say their cats wouldn't eat the vegetables in Spot's Stew. Before deciding for or against this product, try just a couple of flavors from Petco or Petsmart first. My cat goes ga-ga for all of this product, including the vegetables. Every cat's different. I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh! I wouldn't ever want my furry loved one to eat skin - that's like feeding a human infant McDonald's, no offense to McD's.

review/summary: Wow! Cat Food That Seems Yummy!
review/text: Wow! I have the pickiest cats in the whole universe.  The only wet food they eat is Spot's Stew Chicken.  I can get them to eat the Chicken/Beef flavor if I add some shaved Bonito but with three cats Slinky, Jester and Regal, only Slinky and Jester scarf the food down.  They will eat the chicken without the Bonito but Regal is another story.  She won't eat it at first but might come back later and eat some.  She will ONLY eat the Chicken and does not like Bonito so with her, it gets a little more tough.  However, this food is a wonderful consistency, smells good (to me the human) and I assume to the kitties as well because they LOVE this stuff.  For the vegetables, I don't know if cats really need them however, I mush them up with the meat and they don't notice.  If I miss mushing some, then yes they try to eat around the peas/carrots.  All I can say is thank goodness for this food.  I spent lots of money and time trying to find something they would like.  I also feed them a mix of Halo dry Sensitive Formula Turkey and Purina Dental Health.  In order to prevent urinary symptoms, I give my cats only fresh bottled water every day that I put in bowls all over the house.  With the good water, the good food and lots of petting, I have the happiest cats in Arizona!  Thank you Halo!!

review/summary: Chicken and Beef
review/text: I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe. Whenever I put it out at feeding time, there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot's Stew in them. With 5 kitty mouths to feed, the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot's Stew, so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied. Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting, those poor things that had to "settle" for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew. I have been so pleased with it, that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners.<br />But, at our house, WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines!

review/summary: Picky felines love this canned food
review/text: My two cats somehow never figured out how to use their teeth to bite into their food--given dry food, they'll just use their tongues to lick it up and swallow the kernels whole, with an occasional bite with the teeth to crunch on food that's already been delivered into their mouths.  For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.  Anyways, thank goodness for Spot's Stew, otherwise my teeth-challenged cats would never have been able to enjoy wet food!

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.

review/text: I used to buy this at Whole Foods, which seems to have discontinued it.  Glad to find it at Amazon!<br /><br />This is one of the few foods all 3 cats will eat.  And none seem to pick out the veggies!  The soft texture, and good nutrition, is excellent for (1) the elderly cat (2) the cat who's sick and (3) the cat who will literally eat anything, but you'd prefer he eat something healthy!<br /><br />This is "human quality" cat food, meaning the ingredients are pure enough for a human to eat, and it smells a little like chicken pot pie filling!

review/text: I have a kitten that just LOVES this stuff. The breeder I got him from didn't give me any of his old food, and I had heard that switching food quickly causes stomach upset... but I read about Spot's Stew being great for problem tummies and it's true! My kitten has never had any problems on this food since we brought him home. Also, from the human perspective, this stuff smells like chicken/turkey/fish and not like dog vomit, like certain brands of cat food. Big plus for me.

review/text: The texture of this food is like cooled pea soup.  It's not as stiff as some of the pate style foods and my cat likes it.  All but the veggies that is.  So she leaves not only the veggies, and there are a lot of them, but also a good bit of the chicken surrounding each veggy.  This makes for more waste than I am willing to tolerate so I won't be buying any more Spot's Stew.

review/text: The first time I served this they both chowed down on it...except for the veges as everyone seems to complain about...but then a little while later they both came back and finished up the veges too!  So I thought this was the greatest thing...but the next time I fed them the one cat decided the novelty had worn off and wanted nothing to do with it.  The other one though continued to chow down, and again left the veges, but came back later and ate most of them.  The next serving -what do you know -neither of them wanted it anymore.  I don't get it -I've never had cats like something so much one day and the next day be turned off from it.  I'm very disappointed, I wanted them to like it, knowing how good it is for them.

However, I've started squishing the carrots into the food, and they seem to be leaving less in their bowls. After trying many brands of canned foods, this is one of the few that they eagerly eat, and it doesn't smell as bad as some.

More brittle than American almonds, these are flatter, whiter in appearance, and easier to bite into, but no less crunchy. They are roasted in sunflower oil and seasoned with salt and a liberal amount of rosemary leaves. Grown in Spain along the Mediterranean coast, marcona almonds are apparently the least abundant and most expensive kind, according to the little description on the back of the bag. 190 calories per serving (4 servings per bag). 160 calories from fat. 0 cholesterol, low in sodium.<br /><br />Nut are dense in calories because of the oils they contain, but they are healthy fats. Get these at your local Trader Joe's. Ordering them from the seller at the current price is murder. The ingredient list is also wrong. It's: almonds, sunflower oil, sea salt, and dried whole rosemary.

review/summary: Edible Gold Leaf Sheets
review/text: I ordered this product for my daughter's golden birthday.  I baked her a 6-tiered triple chocolate cake (the recipe came from a Cook's Country magazine) and we topped it with a gilded caramel-pecan turtle candy - she happens to be obsessed with live turtles right now...<br /><br />The first time I ordered this product was only about 1 week before her birthday.  I received my first shipment in time - it was on a Saturday - but unfortunately the wrong product was sent.  I was a bit upset, as her birthday was on Tuesday and I didn't think I'd be able to get a replacement in time.  But this seller, after receiveing my complaint via e-mail on Monday morning - overnighted me a replacement product and a return label to send back the incorrect order I had received, and it all arrived on my daughter's birthday the next day in time for me to finish her cake.  So, long story short, this was a very helpful seller who cared enough about my order and plans to get me what I needed!<br /><br />The product itself was just what I expected it to be.  I had a little trouble working with it, though I think the brush I used was a bit too stiff; sometimes the gold sheets tore.  Sometimes the gold also rubbed off the chocolate it was supposed to cover, but once again, I didn't exactly know how to use it, so I may have been doing it incorrectly.  At any rate, the final product looked brilliant and definitely made the cake special.  It was a bit pricey, but since golden birthdays only happen once, and since I have 3 kids to share the cost, it only came to about $16/child.

review/text: The flavors in this particular blend of Davidson's are too strong for my tastes; it almost feels like I'm sipping liquid candy without the sugar.  To balance the flavors a bit (I think it is the cinnamon that is so overpowering), I've tried adding different teas and spices to the blend as it brews:  a simple black tea, dried lavender, freshly grated ginger, lemon juice.  So far adding lavender and a touch of lemon created the best balance for me.  Not a bad tea; just not my favorite.

Our local pet stores stopped selling this item<br />but I was sure I could find these dog treats on Amazon.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot fully digest corn as they are carnivores. Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness.

review/summary: My little dog loves these little bites...just her size.
review/text: I have a small mixed-breed dog, about the size of a large chihuahua. She has always loved Beneful (just like my last dog who lived to a ripe old age), but she tended to only eat dry food when she became impatient for me to give her a little canned dog food. I would only give her small amounts of other food, wanting her to make her dry Beneful her main meal. I realized that the large dry food bites were probably too much work for her.<br /><br />When I found out about the IncrediBites, I couldn't wait to give them a try. I have to admit that I was disappointed to only be able to find the 15.5 lb bags at the grocery store, because I have heard that dry dog food actually contains some moisture and large bags tend to get dry and stale if it takes you too long to use them. The good news is that the bag has a zip-loc closure, so that should help retain some moisture. If you have several dogs, 15.5 lbs may be fine for you, but I plan to order some smaller bags here on Amazon.<br /><br />Anyway, my little dog now LOVES this new just-her-size kibble, and I probably fill her bowl about four times as often as I did with the larger pieces.<br /><br />I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because I can't say for sure that this dog food is the healthiest dry dog food. My last dog was overweight, and I eventually had to switch her to the Healthy Weight flavor which she definitely did not like as well. That told me that the "regular" flavor has something really GOOD tasting in it. My daughter has three large dogs, and they too love Beneful. But two out of the three are overweight as well. So since I haven't done the research to determine how healthy Beneful is, I can't really make a judgment on that.<br /><br />I tried feeding my dog something "healthy" and expensive from the pet store, but she wouldn't touch it. I suppose it's the same principle as when I choose a juicy hamburger over a turkey burger. All I know is that she gobbles the Beneful up. So for now, I will stick with what she loves, and she loves Beneful IncrediBites.

review/text: I hadn't tried this sweetener before so I thought I'd buy some.  I've concluded that it is meant to be used like regular sugar, sprinkled on food such as cereal.  It is as sweet as sugar.  This is just my personal opinion, but I wasn't as crazy about it when used in baking.  Probably I didn't use enough.  I like it better than Sweet n' Low.<br /><br />I wish you didn't have to buy so much to get special pricing.

I'd like to give up sweeteners completely but I just can't get used to oatmeal without the added sweetness or some salad dressings that need the intense sweetness without adding another flavor.<br /><br />This doesn't have an aftertaste like some of the other artificial sweeteners do and from everything I've read it seems to be safe.  I like the little packets because it's easy to measure just the amount I need.  I also like that it's not affected by heat and can be used for cooking and baking.

I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from. Buy in bulk and save :). 1000-count and 2000-count boxes are available.<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story.

You use less than regular sugar, and since I bake alot we can all enjoy a little baked good from time to time without the guilt.

review/summary: very good--but watch those carbohydrates if you have to
review/text: Splenda is a wonderful sweetener for beverages like coffee or iced tea. An individual packet has no calories; and the packet is also low in carbohydrates. It uses sucralose as a sugar substitute.<br /><br />I used to prefer Sweet `N Low; but these days I far prefer Splenda as a substitute for sugar which is definitely not on my diet! Splenda is my number one choice because it makes coffee or tea very sweet without the negatives of sugar that some people have to watch, including myself because of the diet I must adhere to these days.<br /><br />Splenda is a powdery white substance. Just open an individual packet (or two) and pour it in to your beverage. It is probably quite good for certain recipes as well. You may prefer to use the granular form of Splenda for certain recipes but if you don't have granular Splenda handy these packets just might do the trick. Keep the individual packets in the box they come in or you can put them into any container you wish.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of is that you may want to look elsewhere for a sugar substitute if you need to watch your intake of carbohydrates. Depending on how much Splenda the recipe calls for (or how much Splenda you use in your daily beverages) there might be too many carbohydrates in larger amounts of Splenda for you. If you're watching your carbs, ask your doctor what to use as a sugar substitute.<br /><br />Overall, Splenda is still a very good substitute for sugar. I used to prefer Sweet `N Low but over time I changed my mind.

review/summary: Avoid if you have low thyroid
review/text: I can't recommend Splenda (sucralose) for people (like me) who have low thyroid problems. I loved Splenda for 10 yrs until I realized the connection - chlorine interferes with thyroid production, Splenda is made of chlorinated sugar, & over the years my thyroid was doing worse & worse. I now have to treat with medication & I still have low thyroid symptoms. I'm sick everyone telling me how hot it is when I'm always freezing. I wish I knew about Splenda & chlorine from the beginning...I wouldn't have 'poisoned' my thyroid for the past 10 yrs.

review/summary: Harmful to your health
review/text: This product really should not be used for human consumption. Here is a quote from Dr. Mercola at Mercola.com to partially explain why. "Inflammatory bowel disease--an autoimmune disease that can have serious health consequences--may be caused or exacerbated by the regular consumption of the popular artificial sweetener Splenda, as it inactivates digestive enzymes and alters gut barrier function."  There is more to learn on his site.

review/text: My mom bought this as the alternative to sugar and loves using it all the time in her coffee. Me, I believe it's just okay, but leaves a horrible after taste. I tried using it many times, hoping I would acquire the taste, but it just didn't come at all. It even makes the coffee I drink have a weird after taste as well. Judging by the reviews, people like this stuff, me I just stick to regular sugar or Equal, because it tastes better than the Splenda.

review/summary: Not what I hoped for.
review/text: The fruitcake arrived in great shape in a nice tin. I ordered it based on the fact that it had real fruit, nuts, and no artificial color, and it was as advertised. But, the texture was too wet, almost soggy, it was cloyingly sweet, many of the walnuts were soft and unpalatable due, I expect, to the excessively wet environment in which they live, and whatever character the "cake" element was intended to have was overwhelmed by the moisture and sweetness. I won't be ordering this again.

review/summary: It was Okay, but..
review/text: I'm not sure it was $40 okay.  When I have a fruitcake I really like, there will be a good balance of about 50-50 fruit/nuts to moist, spicy, cake. That is my preference and of course your mileage may vary.<br /><br />This cake is very heavy towards the fruit side, with some nuts, mostly walnuts. Many of the fruit pieces were not cut up, so you might find yourself with 2 whole prunes (or whatever) and not much cake or nuts to speak of in a slice of about 1 to 1.5 inches.  I'm looking for more balance, so maybe next year I'll either try to make a fruitcake myself, or sample another brand.

review/text: This is the best fruitcake ever! It is filled with dried fruits (raisins, dates, apricots) that have been dried naturally, without sulfur, as well as copious amounts of nuts (walnuts, cashews). The cake itself is nice, dark and dense, moist and flavorful. Additionally, it 'keeps' wonderfully long, as we found out accidentally--we each 'saved' the last piece for the other--FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. When we realized how long it had been, we resolved that the next one in the fridge would dispose of it. He was there before I; upon checking before tossing, he found that IT WAS STILL GOOD! And, he said, it was "STILL the best fruitcake" he'd ever had.

review/text: After reading a number of reviews in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times I bought two 40 ounce loaves, one for me and another for my aunt. Boy, was I disappointed! After eating the first loaf, I decided against gifting the other. The first loaf was too dry but the second loaf had the right amount of moisture. Both loaves did not have a variety of fruit, just raisins and prunes, big soggy prunes in every slice! I expected candied cherries, etc. At $22.00 a loaf no wonder the company paid for Priority Mail costs!

review/summary: Cherry Spice Tea
review/text: I am a big tea drinker and Twinings is a great full-bodied tea.  As I was stocking up on some special flavors in Kissel Hill, PA, I saw the picture of those beautiful cherries on the box and had to try it.  I LOVE cherries!<br /><br />While it is a very good tea, it tastes heavier on the spice than the cherry.  Spice tea is not my "bag," so to speak, so I will probably pass this one by the next time I shop.  I guess the spice kind of overpowers the cherry, because I DO taste the cherry.<br /><br />All that said, this is just my preference.  It is still a very good tea.  It will likely wake up your taste buds and is a welcome change from plain tea.  It is red in color but is not a rooibus tea.  The ingedients, listed in this order, are: hibiscus, natural cherry flavour with other natural flavours, orange leaves, apple pieces, rosehips, cinnamon, liquorice root, cherry pieces. If you like spice teas, check it out.  I suggest you try it without sugar or with agave cactus nectar (sweetener in natural food isles), or brown unbleached sugar, or honey.<br /><br />This is a caffeine free naturally flavoured herbal tea. Each tea bag is sealed in in its own individual packet to keep the flavor fresher longer.

After a few months, they (of course) quit carrying it ... &lt;sigh>  I don't buy many grocery items online, but after missing my tea, I found it here.  With Supersaver Shipping, it was less than when I bought it locally.<br /><br />It has a great mix of floral herbs, fruits and spices (although I don't pick up much cinnamon) which makes for a lovely fragrance and taste ... and it has a beautiful light red color.  It also makes a really, really nice iced tea.  Barely sweetened, for me, it is perfection!

review/summary: perfect combination!
review/text: I love cherries and am also a big fan of spicy teas like chai, so this seemed a natural fit.  I was disappointed, at first, by the scent when I opened the bag. The tea smelled "off" somehow and I couldn't detect the cherries at all.  However, once I brewed it, the flavor came through and the tea smelled sweet and spicy.  The cherry flavor is definitely noticeable, but it is somewhat overpowered by the cinnamon.  I really like the cinnamon flavor, so this didn't really bother me.  Those looking for a strong cherry tea more in line with the Celestial Seasonings "zinger" fruit teas could be disappointed, though.  I like Celestial Seasonings, but find them lacking in depth compared to Twinings.  This tea is rich and full-bodied, with just enough cherry to satisfy. Recommended.

As long as this tea stays with the same ingredients and does not add soy, I will continue to buy it.

review/text: I gave plums 4 stars for ease of use mostly.I only have two minor complaints really. The Just Bananas has lemon juice concentrate and citric acid, which I understand is to preserve the product. However, it gives the banana a very bitter sweet taste. My son did not care for it (the only food he has actually turned his head away from) and having tried it myself, I do not like it either. My other issue with the plums and other products that come in the very handy pouch is that the product at the very tip that first comes out is most often harder than the rest of the pouch. Which isn't a big issue it is not hard to squeeze the first little bit into the sink.This is one of the better options in premade baby foods. I also like ella's kitchen both for ease of use and organic ingredients. However, not being able to find a wide variety of vegatibles and fruits that I usually eat I have choosen to go with the BabyBrezza to make my own baby food.

The consistency is just right, nice and smooth and it tastes great!  I always end up finishing whatever is left in the package!  Tip: Because there is a bit of lemon juice in these bananas to keep them from turning brown when exposed to air, whatever you mix them into will also stay nice and fresh looking (avocadoes, for example).  The screw top is much easier than a zip-top, and they keep just fine in the fridge once opened.  I'll be buying these again!

Serve as a side dish or pair with a meat to make a casserole, pairs well with dark meats, duck,pheasant  etc.  And it all goes well with a full bodied red wine.

review/summary: The good and the bad
review/text: First thing to say is my order took about 10 days to arrive but that's normal with these kinds of vendors.  Once I received the box, I was surprised at how much was there.  Two full bags.  But in each bag half was unusable and I had to throw away.  What was usable was good but not great quality.  I tend to judge things by how much pleasure I derive from them so my bottom line is out of the $15 I spent I have gotten about $3 worth of enjoyment out of the basil and when I'm done it will be around $5.  If this is a must have and there is no other way to get it, one should order this way by all means.  I will not again.
