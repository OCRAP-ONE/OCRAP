review/summary: Review of Cheetos
review/text: These Crunchy Cheese flavored Cheetos are great for a party or as a snack. Hopefully, they're not too fattening. I'd recommend them to anyone. Only drawback I noticed is that they're a little too small. It maybe too hard to super-size them, but they'd be much better if they were larger. Yeah, I tried those that are fatter and full of air. . They're worthless.

review/text: I got this for a large American Bulldog.  He likes it and it is good quality at a fair price.  It does have corn in it but at least corn is not the first ingredient.  This is good basic dog food, nothing fancy but it's a bargain and it actually smells like it is edible.  The cheaper dog foods smell vile and toxic, this smells like actual food and the dog likes it and is doing well on it.

review/text: Our breeder introduced us to Diamond Adult Maintennance Chicken dog food.  She explained to us that we needed to make sure the protien levels in dog food are not too high as it could result in too fast a growth spurt in our 10 month old Rhodesian Ridgeback.  Also swollen knuckles may occur if too much protien is present.<br /><br />We have been very happy with this product and thankfully Amazon has it with Super saver shipping otherwise we would have to switch since no one in Hawaii is selling Diamond.

review/text: My cookies were fresh-tasting and crispy; almost as crispy as a small rice cake. This might have been because it was winter, and the humidity in our house was low. They had 3 months until their expiration date when I ate them. They were thin and circular. Each one was a little larger than bite-sized for me.<br /><br />These are great for when I crave sugar since the sweetness of the dates is balanced by the coconut and sesame seeds. I could clearly taste each of the 3 ingredients. I found that a bag is one serving, not 3 as stated on the bag. This gives me a lot of saturated fat and fiber.<br /><br />I also like the Go Raw Live Pumpkin Bars which are less pricey.

review/text: I found this at a local Hannafords supermarket for either $2.50 or $2.70 a bottle, it's hands down the best buy for a bottle of hot sauce, and one of the best tasting hot sauces out there.<br /><br />I tried a cap full first, and while it's not the hottest habanero based sauce I've had, it is up there with the most flavorful.  It's great on just about everything.  It's one of my favorites on rice, but it's also just as good on pizza, burritos and eggs (more often than not, my favorite hot sauces on rice aren't among my favorite on burritos, pizza or eggs).<br /><br />Chileheads like me can just pour it on, and if you're not accustomed to spicy foods, just use a small bit.  My eight year old loves it too.

review/summary: Great Choice if You Want Habanero More for the Flavor than for the Heat
review/text: Habanero has two great advantages as a pepper--tremendous flavor and tremendous heat.  The Yucatan Sunshine habanero sauce captures the former without overwhelming you with the latter.  It's not the best habanero sauce I've tried, but it's the best I've tried outside of Jamaica.  It's a little bit less heat than I want out of a habanero sauce (the Tabasco Brand Habanero Sauce has significantly more kick).  But the primary advantage it has over the Tabasco brand is a much thinner consistency that makes it easier to apply to your food (for some reason Tabasco's habanero sauce is much thicker than their other sauces).  It also has about half as many ingredients as Tabasco's habenero sauce (8 vs. 14).

(In the earlier days when it was less popular, I had to pretend to be a restaurant in order to get it through a commercial supplier.)<br /><br />I do like very hot and spicy.  But, what's special about this sauce is the flavor.  You can actually enjoy the Habanero flavor without your tongue smoking.  Goes on the scrambled eggs every morning.  Good addition to barbecue sauces.  Goes into soups, that 6-hours-of-slow-cooking chili made from scratch (or, the stuff from the can), ....

One drawback is that it usually does get lost if you're cooking with it due to the lack of potency, but as long as it's going directly on a finished product it is sublime.

The only reason I grabbed this one at the store was because it was $2.99 compared to Melinda's at $3.49. Seems trivial but this might last me one week.

review/summary: Best Tasting Recovery Beverage
review/text: Low fat chocolate milk is great after a workout and with the added protein this is even better! For $2.50 per shake delivered right to your door it is one of the best ready to drink beverages out there. They don't have to be refrigerated so you can easily take them on trips and hikes. The taste is much better than anything else on the market. Excellent product.

review/summary: This is not a pine honey
review/text: I was looking for Rigoni Di Asiago Pine honey since it disappeared from my local stores. When I finally ordered it - I got Forest honey of the same brand. Forest honey is exceptionally good, but still not as good as Pine. So my 4 stars apply for Forest and I would give 5 stars to Pine. Now picture is for Pine and the description is for Forest. At the time of my purchase it was Pine in the description too. There is no way anyone can get Asiago Piney honey now as it was discontinued by manufacturer. I still highly recommend Forest for it is quality and very interesting, I would even say - intriguing taste. As a proof I only can say that I've finished one jar in a two days.

review/summary: Another good product from Clear
review/text: I picked this for when I wanted a break from the harsher anti-dandruff shampoo I normally use. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8A2">Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo</a> gets my hair clean with just one wash and I didn't need to use a lot of product to get a good lather. It leaves my hair soft and shiny and best of all it didn't dry out my scalp like many other non-dandruff shampoos have over the years. The scent is light and not so feminine that a guy like myself can't use it. It smells fresh and clean not heavily perfumed. This is another product I'll be sticking with. It works great.

review/summary: So very pleased with the product it is my new brand.
review/text: I have health issues that make my hair fall out after large steroid treatments and the last few years it comes back different. My hair has always been fine and thin. This time it came in frizzy and like a brillo pad. Not the whole head i lose about 1/4 each time so it is a mess. I washed my hair today after swimming to really give it a challenge.<br /><br />It lathers well and has a soft pleasant fragrance. Rinses out easily. I used the conditioner which I will also.<br /><br />It comes wrapped in plastic but mine leaked out into the bag so you have to kinda was the bottle, it was nice as a hand wash nothing wasted. It did not get the box wet.<br /><br />I will be buying this and the price here is less than the brand I buy at the big M store.<br />My hair is smooth and soft. Not all frizz gone but this is one use and it looks at least 75% better.

review/summary: Heavy Floral Shampoo
review/text: The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control, then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance, texture, and cleaning.<br /><br />FRAGRANCE<br /><br />Typical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal, but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Dry Scalp), with a price between the two extremes, has a floral fragrance that reminds me of cheap children's perfume and lingers all day. It is not terrible, but I think a simple "clean" smell would be much better.  The "Clear Men" shampoos have a nicer smell, which would work well for both men and women.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br /><br />The texture is much like lotion, but it lathers well.<br /><br />CLEANING<br /><br />The shampoo left my hair feeling clean, but it might be a bit heavy for some people.  It reminds me of a shampoo+conditioner.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />Clear Scalp & Hair Dry Scalp shampoo is a good shampoo for women who have very dry hair.  It would be particularly valuable during the winter.  Apart from the cheap floral fragrance, I think it is a good value.

review/summary: It felt like I was washing my hair with hand lotion
review/text: This shampoo has a very light lather (not too many suds) and it felt like I was trying to wash my hair with hand lotion. Although I knew my hair was clean after washing with this shampoo, it just did not feel like it was clean. One positive is that smells nice but has a subtler scent than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8AC">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> which I use.<br /><br />I actually like the complementary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8T8">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> better than this shampoo.  This shampoo is defintely not for me and based on the fact that most people gave this product a positive review, I guess I'm the odd one out.<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT - One other complaint I have is that the bottle should be designed so that the product label can be read while it rests on its spout like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8T8">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>. Basically I store the bottle flat end down so that the shampoo is always at the bottom (near the spout) and can be dispensed easily. However, when you store it this way (which is the way the conditioner bottle was designed to be stored), the writing is upside down unlike the conditioner bottle which has the product label showing correctly. This is a minor issue, however and not one I took off points for.

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: I will review this shampoo along with its conditioner, CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounces (https://www.amazon.com/gp/vine/product?ie=UTF8&asin=B007RTR8UC).<br /><br />I received the shampoo, then the following week ordered the conditioner.  I put up my other hair products, so as to allow these products a chance to prove themselves to me.  I began using them both on Sunday; today is Wednesday.  My hair has been very soft and manageable; it's naturally curly and has been very easy to comb through after my shower.  So, I would say that I was pretty happy with the results.<br /><br />Until this morning.  Something really curious happened.  When I opened the shampoo bottle and turned it upside down to pour into my hand, a liquid came out that wasn't the shampoo.  It was very watery.  Yes, I'm positive that the bottle was closed yesterday and that nobody opened it.  There was perhaps three tablespoons of this watery stuff before the shampoo came out.<br /><br />I washed my hair and reached for the conditioner - which, by the way, has its opening on the bottom of the bottle.  The same thing happened!  First, some type of liquid came out, then the conditioner.<br /><br />I've never had to shake a shampoo or conditioner before, so I'm not sure what happened.  Either way, I won't be using it anymore.<br /><br />It did a nice job, though, except for the liquid issue.

review/summary: Foams fast, but Too Dry for Me
review/text: This gave me big suds, so I was hopeful. However, I never had a SHAMPOO that felt DRYING before until now. I actually found myself re-shampooing in the shower as I could feel my hair start poofing up after the first shampoo.  It felt somewhat better with the addition of a conditioner (even though it was loaded with drying agents) from the same line. Once dry, the overall affect on my super curly, thin hair-wispy cotton...<br /><br />Update:<br />Had to downgrade my reviews for this line when the skin on my arms and neck started breaking out after accumulated exposure-washing my daughter's hair in the sink in addition to using other products from same line on myself that day. Not the best choice for sensitive skin.<br /><br />*Found a "silver lining:"<br /><br />When scalp became extremely dry as a result, with dandruff "raining down" to the touch, I did an internet search. I found that VINEGAR is an excellent conditioner. I used 1/2 vinegar/water-amazing results! My scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered-now soft to the touch instead of brittle.

review/text: I have a VERY sensitive and dry scalp and so far the only shampoo that really works for me, doesn't stink, and doesn't dry my hair out is Biolage Cool Mint Shampoo.  Since that is so pricey, I decided to give this a try.  It smells very strong, a pleasant smell, but so strong it makes it smell cheap.  It left my hair limpless (is that a word!!?) and also my scalp dry and irritated.  Back to the pricey stuff!

review/summary: Gives Back a Little Life to The Greys
review/text: I used to have to worry about greasy, oily hair back in the day. I searched out shampoos that would dry out the scalp and leave my hair less oily. Well a handful of years ago I started to go grey, and when I went grey, I skipped right over the "salt & pepper" look and jumped from a dark brown to Bob Barker in what seemed almost overnight.<br /><br />Now, I didn't mind losing my hair color at a young age...at least I still had a full head of hair which is more than I can say for several friends, but what I hated was that the grey hair was of such a different texture and feel from my regular hair. It was coarse, dry and wiry. Suddenly shampoos like Head and Shoulders and Pert we too harsh, and my scalp felt brittle.<br /><br />I like the Clear Scalp because it actually manages to give a bit of the old feel back, without making my hair feel greasy as if I've left conditioner in it. I've used this for about a week now, and really like how it makes my hair look and feel. Definately worth a try if your trying to avoid that brillo pad head of grey hair like me.

review/text: I got two different products to try from Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty.  I cannot rate both of them excellent, but this Shampoo would receive 10 stars if I could.<br />The suds feel foamy.  I don't have a better word than that.  It feels like there is added substance to the suds and rinses out really well.<br />I used the shampoo for a week (as suggested) and checked the health and condition of my hair after those seven days.  I have healthy hair.  After seven days it was healthier than I've ever seen it and silky.  I am changing my shampoo and ordering more of this.<br />My husband experienced the same thing.  His scalp felt better.<br />The scent is pleasant.  The feel is exquisite.<br /><br />I've been using this product every since I got it to review.  (A couple of months now)  I can't believe the shine, health and silkiness of my hair.  I highly recommend both the shampoo and the conditioner.  Very, very nice!

review/summary: Ah, Relief!
review/text: I usually do not have an itchy, dry scalp in the spring or summer.  But due to a recent medical issue and the medication I received, my scalp has been very dry, itchy, and flaky for the past couple of months.  So, I decided to give CLEAR SCALP & HAIR THERAPY MOISTURIZING DRY SCALP NOURISHING SHAMPOO a try. And I am pleased to say, that after just 7 days, the itching and the dryness have vanished.  YAY!<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR THERAPY MOISTURIZING DRY SCALP NOURISHING SHAMPOO is rich and creamy (almost like conditioner), with a pleasant light scent.  Just a very small amount makes a nice, luxurious lather which thoroughly cleans your hair and soothes your scalp and then rinses away completely, leaving no residue.  CLEAR SCALP & HAIR THERAPY MOISTURIZING DRY SCALP NOURISHING SHAMPOO washes your hair and scalp without stripping away all the natural oils.  Your hair is left shiny and bouncy.  For me, personally, my hair (which I color about once every 2 months) looks better than it has in a long time.  WITH that added benefit of no itching.  And, I have also noticed that if I just let my hair dry naturally (no blow dryer) that my hair has more volume.  Again...YAY!<br /><br />As a side note, I also appreciate that the folks who make CLEAR SCALP & HAIR THERAPY MOISTURIZING DRY SCALP NOURISHING SHAMPOO have not fallen into the trap of "lather, rinse, repeat."  Until the early 1960s, the instructions on shampoo bottles did not include the work "repeat."  That word was added by the ad men for a popular line of shampoo.  They were trying to figure out how to increase sales.  By the addition of that one word, "repeat," they were able to double their client's shampoo sales almost overnight.  The other brands soon jumped on the band wagon.  So, the reality is, we don't need to "repeat;" one lathering will do.  The CLEAR SCALP & HAIR THERAPY MOISTURIZING DRY SCALP NOURISHING SHAMPOO folks understand that.  There is no "repeat" on their bottle.  Just "lather and rinse."  I like it!<br /><br />Overall, I am very please with CLEAR SCALP & HAIR THERAPY MOISTURIZING DRY SCALP NOURISHING SHAMPOO, and would recommend it to anyone who has a problem with dry hair and itchy scalp.

review/summary: Great cost-performance
review/text: This looked like more of a woman's sort of product, so I gave it to the missus to try out. Here's what she had to say:<br /><br />I had never heard of the Clear brand before and had some doubt about the quality level. My doubt came from the low price and sort-of-cheap bottle design. I usually pay $10 to $20 for a bottle of shampoo from name brands such as Frederic Fekkai, Paul Mitchell, Redken, Pureology and The Body Shop. I didn't think it fair to compare Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy Moisturizing Dry Scalp shampoo with products in this price range, but I can say that the quality of the Clear shampoo is comparable with some of the shampoos mentioned above. It has nice fragrance, cleans my hair with only a small amount of liquid, makes my hair look healthy and shiny, and after using for a week, it made my hair more manageable when used together with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>. Although I won't say the quality of Clear shampoo is equal or better than my favorites, I can say the cost performance of Clear shampoo is great. The only thing I don't like is the bottle design. I don't like the inexpensive-looking (well, it is inexpensive), light lavender-color, curved-shape bottle. I wish it had a nozzle dispenser or round shape so that it's easier to hold with wet hands. When I have an empty bottle of one of my regular shampoo, I may transfer the liquid to it so that my bathroom looks better and I feel better!

review/summary: Lathers and moisturizes well even in hard water!
review/text: I've been using this shampoo almost daily for several weeks now.  I swim in a chlorinated pool twice a week and generally have somewhat coarse, dry hair and dry scalp.  I also live in an area that has extremely hard water which really does a job on my hair so most shampoos don't work well for me.<br /><br />I found this shampoo does work to keep my scalp and hair from getting dried out.  I love the way it comes out more as a creamy foam, and I can't believe how well it lathers in hard water.  It cleans my hair just fine and does seem to keep my scalp from getting dry.<br /><br />Although the product states its moisturizing claims only apply "When using shampoo and conditioner regimen," I was very satisfied with the results using just the shampoo by itself with no moisturizer.<br /><br />If you're having trouble with dry hair or scalp, I would definitely give this product a try.

review/summary: Like most others
review/text: "Clear scalp and hair Therapy" is another product with claims that are difficult to determine if they actually work. I must admit that I am probably not the best person to rate a shampoo, for many years I just used the bar soap I had handy. I now use a shampoo based primarily on plant extractions with as few chemicals as possible. I am comparing the "Clear" shampoo which has about 25 ingredients some plant based, others just chemicals, with a Emu oil shampoo which has 10 ingredients (3 chemicals}, a Nature's gate shampoo with about 25 ingredients, mostly plant based. "Clear" lathers better than the other two, but I know that an ingredient is added to do just that. It causes no problems that I can determine and works just fine. I honestly find few differences between any of them.I have always had an itchy scalp with no apparent problems such as dandruff, just an itch. No shampoo including the three mentioned make a difference and it's not really a problem anyway. I'm mentally more comfortable with ingredients that I can pronounce. I find "Clear" just one more shampoo trying to climb onto the therapy bandwagon and get my money. It seems no different than any shampoo I've ever tried.

If I don't use a cleansing shampoo about once a week, my scalp looks greasy even with daily washing.

review/summary: excellent conditioning, fair dry scalp control
review/text: The conditioning of this shampoo is quite good, and it never left my hair frizzy or dry. As for the dry scalp prevention or treatment, it works better than a regular shampoo, but not quite as good as one of the dandruff brands that is made for dry scalp. The problem is, those dandruff brands can be hard on the hair. So I used this shampoo every other day, alternating with the harsher brand, and it worked out pretty well. The scent was a bit overpowering. It cleaned the hair well, and I was able to use less so a bottle lasted for a good month, even with my long and thick hair.

review/summary: Been using for over a month
review/text: I got both the shampoo and the condition Clear Scalp. I have problems with itchy scalp, hair loss, and dry hair. When I first used this product, I noticed a difference in how my hair felt. It was super soft and I didn't notice that filmy feeling I have with other shampoos and conditioners. It was a nice change. A month later, I am still using both products. My scalp does feel better. My hair doesn't fall out as much (not sure if that is from my change of diet though or the shampoo), and my hair still feels soft. My sister purchased this product for colored hair and complained of build up. I have not noticed this. My hair still feels as soft as when I first used it.<br /><br />The bottles are also fairly easy to use. One opens from the top and the other from the bottom which is nice otherwise you can get the bottles mixed up (which on is the conditioner and which one is the shampoo).  You just press one side of the top and it opens up, press down and it snaps back in place. No mess. The shampoo and conditioner bottles look almost exactly alike, but like I said, they open differently.<br /><br />For the record, I have hair that goes past my shoulders and is thick and wavy. I've noticed my waves are more pronounced because they aren't dragging down from build up. I really like this shampoo and will continue to use them both.

review/summary: Itchy Bumps On Scalp And Shedding
review/text: I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp.  I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair.  I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews.  This shampoo is not for everyone.  If you're at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away.  I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with.  Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do.  I've tried them all and I like their Neem shampoo the best.  I don't work for them. I'm just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products.

review/text: I love this shampoo. I don't really have dandruff...just a bit of dry scalp from time to time. Since using this shampoo, I haven't had any issues. That's the best testament of all - it works. It also has a pleasant scent, and a nice consistency. Highly recommended for those with dry scalp...or anyone who wants to avoid it.

The scent and texture do not stand out in any way, but what I look for is results.<br /><br />I consider my shampoo a positive success if it helps me avoid split ends and dry, flaky scalp.  So far, my hair looks great.  I continue to get compliments on my silky, shiny hair, so the shampoo is doing its job.  I like it.

review/summary: Good dry scalp shampoo
review/text: I have normal hair, but suffer from a little bit of dry scalp especially in the winter time. I normally use "Head and Shoulders Dry Scalp" which is good shampoo, but nothing special. CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo in my opinion is better than the Head and Shoulders. It doesn't leave my hair dry or greasy, and I like the fragrance much better than the other brand. It's a little on the strong side, but I like it. The price is also right for a quality shampoo. If you're looking for a dry scalp formula shampoo, I recommend "CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo".

review/text: After reviewing the anti-dandruff shampoo, I purchased the conditioner, and decided to also try this shampoo. I have been very pleased with all of them.<br /><br />I don't generally get flaky dandruff, but my scalp is dry, and this shampoo is perfect. I love the fragrance of it as well -- clean and not too perfumy. I do not wash my hair every day, and I find that this shampoo gets my hair very clean and I can easily go 2 to 3 days between shampoos.

review/summary: Cleans well, but i didn't much care for the scent
review/text: Functionally, this is a pretty good shampoo. It cleaned my hair without stripping it down to squeaky nothing, it didn't make my sensitive skin break out in any sort of rash, and it did seem to reduce the dry-skin-itchiness that i get on my scalp in the summer.<br /><br />The only complaint i have about it is the scent. It has a sort of generic middle-tier-department-store-perfume-counter-medley smell. A little floral, a little fruity, totally non-specific, and a little cloying. It didn't really stick, though, so at least i didn't feel like i was walking around wearing cheap perfume all day.

review/text: My hair is hip length, very straight, medium thick and very fine. There's a fair amount of silver in it, but it isn't noticeably coarser then the rest.<br /><br />I have hair that tends to split at the ends, and using Clear products,there has been a lot less splitting than I've had with shampoos before. It's actually comparable to shampoo free hair care routines.<br /><br />This one smells nice, and has rich feeling lather that rinses well. The scent may be a little too feminine for some men to use.<br /><br />Used with the matching conditioner, it does leave hair well conditioned/moisturized, soft and shiny. It's become one of my favorite shampoos.

review/summary: Great for curly-haired gals!
review/text: I'm absolutely in love with the smell of this brand. My boyfriend loves it too; I have to remind him I'm not a flower and he shouldn't go around sniffing me!<br /><br />I've also been using the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner for the last month & was immediately hooked. I decided to try the shampoo since my hair and nose seemed to agree with the conditioner so much.<br /><br />The shampoo, like the conditioner, has a sweet, floral smell. It's feminine & flirty and I immediately loved it. The texture is fairly thick but still a bit silky if you rub it between your fingers (this is important for me because I can't have shampoo that's too drying).<br /><br />My hair is fairly long, naturally curly, and thick. I wear it naturally (air-dried and curly) about twice a week so that it can recuperate, and flat iron it to death the rest of the time. I want my hair to be as shiny, soft, frizz-free, and generally healthy as possible either way I wear it, which is a tall order.<br /><br />In order to accomplish this I've developed an optimal routine over time & experimentation. I use a miniscule amount of shampoo ONLY on my scalp, & condition the bottom half of my hair BEFORE rising. This way, the shampoo is pulled through the strands & cleans them without overly-drying the bottom half.<br /><br />I MUST use a shampoo that is cleansing (so that the top of my head doesn't look oily), isn't drying to my scalp or hair, and smells nice. All of this has been accomplished so far with the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo. Note that a little goes a LONG way. If I use too much I notice that my hair won't be as silky & a bit on the dry side. However, it's all a matter of adjusting and figuring out what amount works for your hair.<br /><br />I 100% plan on continued usage of both the conditioner and now the shampoo. I'm crazy about the conditioner but I like the shampoo too. I'm so happy this new brand is on the market!

review/summary: My hair feels so soft!
review/text: I'm someone who normally uses the cheapest shampoo I can get because my mindset was any shampoo worked just as well.  I may be changing my tune after using this.  After only a few days using this nourishing shampoo and conditioner together I found that I was running my fingers through my hair.  Well, that's not a normal thing for me to do because I swim a lot and usually my hair feels like straw.  Not so using this!  Some people have mentioned there being a strong scent with this shampoo; I like a lot of scent and to me this has very little.<br /><br />I liked this shampoo so much that I ended up getting more on subscribe and save.  I still find myself running my fingers through my hair; definitely a winner for me!  :-)  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that both bottles of shampoo I received (the original one and then one on subscribe and save) leaked.  The bottle was taped but a small amount of shampoo still leaked out.  We live in the desert so I imagine it got too hot and the shampoo expanded.  I still do recommend this highly if you want soft silky hair like mine now feels!  :-)

review/summary: Good for a basic shampoo
review/text: This shampoo was good as a basic shampoo. It is a thick shampoo that smells good, lathers very well and rinses easily. My hair did not feel like straw/dry after using it. It is advertised as a "dry scalp" shampoo though, and I did not feel like it did anything at all for the dry scalp issue, so I did knock off 2 stars for that. It is great as an everyday shampoo, though, and should be marketed as just that. If it was marketed as just "shampoo" with no mention of the dry scalp, it would have been a 5 star product.<br /><br />If you're thinking of using the matching conditioner - it wasn't bad, but not the best. I would have liked to see better moisturizing and detangling qualities. While using the set, I did not see an improvement with dry scalp problems.

review/summary: Lovely smell, good feel, made my hair too oily!
review/text: It might seem ridiculous to have some dandruff as well as oily hair. My hair gets oily in about 3 days. I try to not wash more than every 3, to not dry out my hair on the ends. This means I do get some dandruff.<br /><br />I opened this shampoo and was immediately in love with the scent. So fresh and clean smelling! I was excited to use it on my hair. The shampoo alone did a nice ob, but it left my hair a little lacking after rinsing. If I hadn't had a conditioner, I sure would have needed one. I used it mainly on my scalp, working it very good. I worked it through the ends.<br /><br />After air drying, my hair was shiny and silky. However in a day, I noticed more oil than normal on my scalp and hair near my roots. In 2 days, I found myself needing to wash my hair, when typically I can do another day. So while it might have made my hair feel good immediately after the shampoo, it wasn't a good fit for me on a regular basis.

review/summary: Nice shampoo, but bottle may not ship well
review/text: I've bought lots of shampoo and conditioner online and never really had any issues with leaking during transport, until this line of Clear Scalp products. The bottles themselves seem to have a high than usual leaking problem. Out of the 4 bottles I had shipped to me, 2 of them were leaking in some way. Not a lot came out, but enough to know that at some point while they were in the mail, they had started to leak some. The shampoo itself works well and as long as you wash it out thoroughly, leaves hair feeling clean. Probably works best on dry and normal hair. If your hair is particularly oily, you might find a lighter formula works better, since this is a slightly thicker and heavier shampoo. Nice shampoo, but be wary that you might find a little has leaked out during transport.

review/summary: Comparable to Herbal Essence
review/text: I've been using the moisturizing version of Clairol's Herbal Essence shampoo (the one that comes in the blue bottle) for years now. When I saw this shampoo, it sounded relatively comparable, so I thought I'd check it out. I've been using it for the week it supposedly takes to give me stronger, more beautiful hair, but I haven't noticed any difference.<br /><br />I have fairly short, thick, dry hair that curls just enough to be nearly unmanageable if I let it grow too long. As long as my hair is really short, I usually just shampoo and condition, and then comb my hair lightly into place and it works. As my hair gets a bit longer I often use a mousse or leave-in conditioner as my hair is still rather dry even with the moisturizing products. This product has been working pretty much the same way. My hair is just on the cusp of getting too long, and if I just shampoo and condition, this product leaves my hair a bit flighty.<br /><br />This product looks, feels and works much like Herbal Essence, except that it's white in color rather than blue. It has a thick, rich feel to it and it lathers up nicely, even with the small dime-sized amount I usually use. The product seems to rinse cleanly from my hair. It has a decent, mild, floral scent. Despite the claim that it helps dry scalp, I have not noticed any change in this product from Herbal Essence, either during the washing process or afterwards.<br /><br />This product comes in a bottle that has a wide, flat base that doubles as product dispenser. Personally I would prefer a container that could be stood on either end. It is helpful to store the product on its cap as it's getting low, but when the bottle is full, storing it on its cap tends to produce a rush of product when the valve is opened, which results in much more product than I need, and there's no way to return the excess to the bottle.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a good product, but not necessarily better or worse than Herbal Essence. Whether or not I would buy this in the future will depend solely on pricing - I would buy whichever one is cheaper.

review/text: I had fun testing this shampoo because of its fun and fruity, with a bit of floral scent. It is a very thick shampoo, so I just used a small amount on my short, but very thick hair. And I usrd it in conjunction with the matching conditioner.<br /><br />After using both, my hair was "squeaky" clean, and had no heavy or greasy feel, it just felt clean. I also tested the shampoo on my skin, since it is aimed at the scalp, and was pleased with the way my skin felt afterwards.  Afterwards, I did a "scent test" with my husband, and he found it pleasing.<br /><br />I am not a chemist, so I don't know about the Nutrium 10 claims, but I did enjoy using it and was pleased with the results.

review/text: Every summer my hair and scalp seems to get very dry which makes my scalp itchy.  I've been using this Shampoo and Conditioner for a week now and I've noticed a huge improvement already.  The itchiness was gone after the very first use and my hair feels so much healthier now as well.<br /><br />I've been having my 10-year-old daughter use these products as well and she keeps going around telling everybody to feel how soft her hair is now.  The chlorine from the pools sure drys her hair out in the summertime but after using these products it seems to help out tons.  It even helps those awful tangles that she's always fighting.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that the scent is something to rave about but it's not bad either.<br /><br />I really like how much healthier our hair is after using this product and I would recommend it.

review/text: I have been looking for a cheaper alternative in shampoo that is a good product and without the horrible fragrance that some of them have while still getting some nice lather.  I think I found it.  I usually use Pravana but it is really pricey and I can't always afford the $17 a bottle.  This fits the bill at a far cheeper price.<br /><br />I have short hair with a sensitive scalp that is usually dry because of color treating my hair and have to say that after using this a few times it's been okay.  No problems with my scalp and my hair is soft and silkie with lots of volumn.  The fragrance is pleasant and just a little bit goes a long way.  Lathers up nicely and rinses out nicely without leaving a ton of build up.  I sold on this product.

review/summary: Quality Shampoo
review/text: I can find nothing negative to say about this shampoo.  It barely has a scent, which is good, and it doesn't take much to make a rich lather.  I washed my hair two times.  The first time I used about a quarter-sized dollop of shampoo.  It took a few seconds for it to begin to lather up, but then suddenly it exploded in lather.  I rinsed it out and the second time I used about a dime size dollop.  It lathered up very well, and I have medium long hair.<br /><br />It rinsed out easily and didn't leave my hair dry feeling at all.  I think if you need something to round up your Amazon purchase to $25.00 in order to get their "Free Super Saver Shipping", buying this might be a good idea.

review/summary: Does Seem to Moisturize Scalp
review/text: It's summer and the kids and I have been swimming almost every day, and our hair sort of shows it.  However it wasn't until two nights ago, the day of the arrival of my shampoo and conditioner samples, that my 10 year-old son freaked out and began seriously complaining that his scalp was burning and itching.  (I can only assume the pool was over-chlorinated that day, or else the pH was off.)<br /><br />So I did the obvious thing and shampooed both of our hair with the Clear Scalp and Hair Moisturizing Dry Scalp Shampoo.<br /><br />Results:<br />Dave immediately stopped complaining.  He's got short hair so can't really comment on how the shampoo made it look.  (Dave doesn't do conditioners.)<br /><br />My scalp also felt better, which I have to admit, surprised me.<br /><br />Now everyone's experience can vary according to their hair type and level of grime, but I thought that the shampoo wasn't as sudsy as the Pantene I normally use.  Plus, it felt 'heavy' as I was rinsing it out.  However, if it left any deposits I can't tell.  My hair looks good.  Shiny and manageable.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/text: I'm in my 50's with very long, color treated hair.  However, since I only color my hair 2-3 times a year and I don't use heat tools such as blow dryers, flat irons, curling irons or hot rollers; my stylist says my hair is in very good shape.  In fact, she only sees me every 2 months to trim a little off the ends.<br /><br />I usually alternate between Fekkai Glossing Shampoo & Conditioner and L'Oreal EverCreme Intense Nourishing Shampoo & Conditioner.  However I was up for a change and thought I could swap the Clear Scalp line for the L'Oreal line.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that the new products had a much thinner consistency than my usual shampoo and conditioner.  The scent was also just okay, nothing remarkable.  After the first wash, I noticed my hair had more tangles and after a few more days I noticed that my ends felt dryer.  After I added the Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp Oil, my hair got a little softer but the Clear Scalp & Hair Moisturizing Dry Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner isn't moisturizing enough for me.  My husband, on the other hand, tried it and liked it but then again, he has much shorter and thereby younger hair than I do.<br /><br />Oh well, I'm glad he likes it because I don't think I'll be using it on a regular basis.

review/text: There isn't a lot I can say about shampoo, but after using this product (along with the moisturizing dry scalp conditioner) I noticed that my scalp was much less dry and itchy.  The shampoo is thicker than most, but cleans well.  I've had issues in the past with moisturizing shampoos not getting my hair real clean, but that wasn't an issue with this product.  I did notice my hair was a bit flat when using it, but that is to be expected with any moisturizing shampoo.  One good thing is that the bottle is designed to be stored upside down.  This is important when working with a very thick product.  Overall, it seems to do what it was designed to do though.

review/summary: Rich and luxurious
review/text: I have strange hair so I'm quite sensitive to the pluses and minuses of shampoos.  I can tell you that this one leaves my hair extremely manageable and lustrous.  Now truth be told, I have darned good hair (albeit strange)--that's just a gift God gave me.  It's thick, richly textured, insanely manageable...well, you get the picture.  Back to this wonderful shampoo, it makes my hair even more dazzling. I loaned some of it to my sister and she felt the same way.  She told me yesterday that she went out and bought some.  I cannot vouch for the fragrance it leaves since I can't smell my hair but I like the aroma of the shampoo itself. I  can honestly say I will purchase this product, as needed, on an ongoing basis.

review/summary: Good shampoo, but shampoo is shampoo.
review/text: I like this shampoo and I have no complaints, however I can not in good conscience vouch for all of the supposed benefits OTHER than cleaning the hair. Study after study has shown that shampoo is basically shampoo. It only job is to clean hair and typically that is all that takes place. Putting things back in the hair comes from the conditioning process or when adding product later. Shampoo pretty much just cleans the hair and not much stays behind. In blind tests most will be fine with a $1 bottle instead of a $10 bottle; the results will be roughly the same. Again adding conditioner is when anything will be added. In any event, this shampoo does everything I want shampoo to do: it thoroughly cleans my hair. I have no complaints whatsoever.

review/summary: Pleasant Soapy Scent
review/text: This did a nice job of getting my hair clean and it has a nice pleasant scent as well. Mostly a soapy and clean sort of smell rather than the overpowering flowery odor you get from a lot of products. I can't say that it's revolutionized my hair or anything, but it looks nice and feels soft so far, and my scalp is feeling pretty good as well.

review/summary: Nice lather, nice scent
review/text: This is a lot more "upscale" than I normally go for shampoo (tend to stick to the brands that are under a dollar a bottle even without a coupon) and I have to say it was a real treat. Very nice scent - not too heavy, and not too floral. Enough that it smells nice in use but doesn't linger much afterwards. Lathers up easily and does a good job cleaning.<br /><br />I can't say that I noticed a big difference in terms of helping with dry scalp, but it seems to help somewhat.<br /><br />My only complaint is the bottle that has a push down dispenser. It's easy to open with wet hands, but does not seal tightly. I knocked the bottle over without knowing so after my shower, and didn't see it until the next day. A fair amount of shampoo leaked out. Not all that messy, but certainly wasteful.<br /><br />But aside from the packaging, nothing bad to say about this at all. Definitely worth giving it a try.

review/summary: Leaves hair soft and not overly fragrant
review/text: My hair is fine, straight, and color-treated to cover the grays. Lately I've been using "moisturizing" shampoos to keep my hair from becoming too dry and dull. This Clear shampoo is slightly creamy in texture, rinses out easily and leaves both my hair and scalp feeling very good. It has a slight soapy/floral scent (reminds me of those little hotel soaps) but it's not overwhelming like Pantene, and only a very slight fragrance is left on my hair. The slim bottle and one-fingered dispenser cap are also very easy to use in a shower. I think I'll take this to the gym!

review/summary: Pretty good.  I will repurchase.
review/text: I tried this even though I had previously not like another clear scalp product.  The long lengths shampoo and conditioner had not worked well for me but I decided to give the brand another try.<br /><br />Like the first Clear Scalp product I ordered and the conditioner I got with this, this one had leaked substantially.  It wasn't as bad as the conditioner leak but opening it was a mess.<br /><br />Other than that this was a completely different experience from trying the first product.  I really liked the smell.  The shampoo lathered nicely (we have very hard water).  It didn't leave my hair feeling stripped or tangled when I washed it out.  It smelled good and rinsed nicely.<br /><br />For the price and performance I will keep using this product.

review/summary: Scalp is less itchy
review/text: I have been using this along with the matching conditioner and it works pretty well. I tend to use coconut oil on my hair in the summer to protect it from heat and pool water and this shampoo washes it out with no problems. I have long thick hair which is dark but I have a few grays. I noticed my gray hairs which are usually course are a little bit smoother now. The shampoo has a nice scent that is not too strong. It is quite thick and lathers nicely.

review/summary: I like it
review/text: I have hair that is thick and goes about 3" past my shoulders and difficult to manage-it always seems to be frizzed out (just thought I would included that so you know when reading the review you can compare your hair type to see if this will work with your hair or not) I am a Head and Shoulders Loyalist, however, this shampoo works pretty well. It is smooth and goes on easily.  It smells pretty good (I would say about as good as Pantene or Garnier Fructis, but better than any of the Head and Shoulders scents I've tried) and after blow drying left my hair soft and silky, but not greasy-even the next day.  I did use it with the Clear conditioner, so I think that using both products together also helped and would recommend that you get the conditioner as well!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.

review/summary: It's O.K.
review/text: Aside from the packaging that I am not crazy about since it opens at the bottom and tends to leak, this is pretty standard, run of the mill shampoo. While it did a perfectly fine job getting my hair clean I prefer my regular shampoos that I alternate. This shampoo is o.k., but its big selling point is that it is reasonably priced and it doesn't require a lot of product to get the job done.<br />I probably wouldn't buy this shampoo because I really like what I currently use.

review/text: This shampoo comes out of this ergonomically-designed bottle easily, looking like a slight purple cream much like the container bottle.  It has a slight berry scent, but nothing too dramatic.  It lathers and spreads well over wet hair.  Combing the hair is easy after using this shampoo.<br /><br />I used one application and my hair smells and feels clean.  No itchiness, no stickiness, no residue.<br /><br />The price is right, too.

review/text: I have been using this shampoo along with the conditioner for a month, and I am pleased that my dry, itchy scalp--probably caused by medication I am taking--is much relieved.  The fragrance is almost undetectable, and it doesn't take a lot of the product to get a good lather.  My hair and scalp feel clean and it lasts the three days between shampoos.  I like the packaging, too.

review/text: I have persistent dry scalp so I'm always looking for products to help with this.  I use a tar based shampoo part of the time but don't want to use it daily.  The Clear Scalp and Hair shampoo works fine - my hair is clean, soft and my scalp is not itchy after using it.  But it has a perfume-y scent that I don't care for.  I will not be buying it again because of that.  Perhaps a scent-free shampoo could be developed?

review/text: I have very dry brittle hair and this product is the best one I've found to moisturize my hair without leaving it heavy and<br />greasy feeling.  It has a pleasant smell and easy to apply and my hair doesn't feel heavy afterwards.  Most moisturizing products make my hair feels like it needs washing, this doesn't.  It seems to be helping my hair become less brittle and dry after 2 weeks use.

review/summary: Smells great, feels great too!
review/text: I've tried alot of dry scalp/dandruff shampoos before, and the top one has always been Pert Plus but I find it a bit too fruity and too tingly on my head, and my hair didn't always feel smooth afterwards. So I continued looking...<br /><br />So I finally get to try something new by a new brand Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty, interesting...I like the bottle design, easy to hold and even easier to open with the big push-button top. The shampoo smells great, not too fragrant but enough to give your hair a nice clean smell. The shampoo is very well mixed/not gooepy or gooey, just a natural flow.<br /><br />Once you start using it, and wash it out, the Clear Scalp shampoo feels very freshening. It gives my hair a wonderful texture, kind of an iron-out feel, and best - shiny. The other dry scalp/dandruff shampoos usually leave my hair fresh but not shiny. So this works quite well so far, I've only used it about a month but I am liking it alot.<br /><br />Definitely recommend a try!

review/summary: Creamy and Smells Good
review/text: I have used shampoos of various types for my entire life.  Some shampoo has been expensive and some has been inexpensive.  All of them have cleaned my hair, but some shampoos have a more pleasant smell than other shampoos, and some shampoos leave my hair softer than other shampoos.  This shampoo seems to be above average with respect to how soft it leaves my hair and the smell of my hair after shampooing.  This shampoo also seems to leave my scalp less itchy than other shampoos.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I opened the shampoo is the pleasant odor.  The odor seems to be floral or fruity; it is hard to tell which.  I did not notice the smell of the shampoo in the shower or the bathroom, which means that the odor is not overpowering.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed is the iridescence in the shampoo.  The shampoo appears much like a metallic paint, and is almost beautiful.<br /><br />I applied the shampoo to my hair and was surprised and pleased at how creamy it was.  The shampoo is much thicker than other shampoos I typically use.  I wanted to keep shampooing my hair because the feel of the shampoo in my hair was so nice.<br /><br />After shampooing my hair, my hair felt very clean and seemed quite manageable rather than limp and lifeless.  The odor the shampoo left behind was pleasant.  It seemed to me that my scalp itched less than it usually does with my standard shampoo.  Even better, my hair felt soft and clean the second day after I used the shampoo.<br /><br />This shampoo has a bunch of miscellaneous stuff that falls under the heading of nutrients and botanicals.  I am unable to tell much about the effectiveness of these various ingredients.  The ingredients sound impressive, but your hair is dead and I am unsure as to the effectiveness of fertilizing your skin.<br /><br />There remains one important aspect to this shampoo, which is the same as for any shampoo, and that is price.  After comparing the price of this shampoo to several other shampoos, I conclude that this shampoo is about average price or perhaps slightly above the average price for most shampoos.<br /><br />Shampoo serves at least one or two useful and important functions.  Shampoo cleans your hair and helps it smell nice.  In addition, shampoo may help keep your hair and scalp soft.  This shampoo also seems to reduce the itch that some people have after using shampoo.  From an esthetic perspective, I think the shampoo is beautiful with metallic-looking iridescence.  The price seems to be competitive to other shampoos.  I think this shampoo has a lot going for it.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Good Dry Scalp Shampoo
review/text: I've used several different dry scalp shampoos over the years and so decided to give this new one a try.  It did not blow me away in terms of being head nd shoulders above the rest, but I did like it.  It works as well as other shampoos in calming the scalp.  All of the dry scalp shampoos I've tried leave the hair feeling a bit coarse and dry, and on this front this shampoo maybe was a little more gentle than others I've used.  I did use it by itself so I could assess its effect on my hair, but for daily use I would definitely pair it with its conditioner.

review/text: I have reviewed and sampled another shampoo from this product line and this seems almost identical. It has a white, pearl shimmer with a creamy consistency, slight fragrance. It does an ok job, but not sure about the moisturizing dry scalp nourishing properties. For the price it's fine, a 2.5 out of 5 stars. But even though it costs more I prefer a Paul Mitchell shampoo.

review/summary: Moisturizes, smell great, weighs my hair down a little
review/text: I've got fine, curly hair so I have to be careful not to use conditioner too often or it will be limp and the curls won't be bouncy.  I sometimes use shampoos with the conditioners already in them, because separate conditioners are too much.<br /><br />I liked this Clear Scalp & Hair moisturizing dry scalp shampoo.  It lathers nicely and smells good, and rinses easily.  The bottle is easy to hold on to, and the price for 12 ounces in the bottle is good.<br /><br />It left my hair soft, shiny and obviously moisturized, but it did weigh my hair down and I had to wash it again the next day.  I gave the bottle to my daughter to try, since she has dry hair and uses tons of conditioner every shampoo.  She really liked this product and will finish the bottle.  For her, it was just the right amount of moisturizer.

review/summary: very good
review/text: I am very surprised that such a reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner work so well...  I've always had problems finding mild enough products to clean and leave the hair soft, but not "weighed down" with conditioners... or shampoo's that don't dry the hair out<br /><br />I didn't expect much, even after reading all the great reviews.  Since turning 50, my hair has thinned, is changing as it turns grey, and my scalp is so dry I have horrible itchy dandruf - which I've never had to deal with in my life.  I've tried so many "all natural" dry scalp, mild shampoo's over the past 2 years, and even the harsher "head and shoulders", "medicated" types, which are WAY too strong . . .<br /><br />This shampoo and conditioner do the trick.  My hair feels so soft and is much more manageable, and the itchy dry scalp seems to be much better after just 2 washes!!! I'm so happy.  It smells really pleasant too, kind of floral . . very fresh
