review/summary: High cost, average product
review/text: Gift baskets are never particularly economical but this one is even less of a value than many I have seen.  The candy is drug store quality ~ decent but far from impressive.  The basket is an appropriate size for the contents but the individual packaging leaves a large environmental footprint.  The largest box appears to be a traditional assortment of candy such as Whitman's Sampler<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003747XQ0">Whitman's Sampler Assorted Chocolate, 24-Ounce Box</a>.  Instead it contained things like single serving chocolate covered grahams, a chocolate covered pretzel, peanut butter cups and other off the shelf items.  As a business gift, it would come across as cheap and unfortunately, the recipient might well assume that the quality was equally below par.  For $35.00, you could put together a far better basket.

review/summary: Great chocolate basket!!!
review/text: I ordered this basket as a birthday gift for my husband, who is a major chocolate lover!  Everything arrived perfectly and very quickly and he was overjoyed by all the different chocolates in the basket, especially the Kenzi items.  It all was packaged very well and the attractive basket will be used again in our home. I would highly recommend this basket...great gift!

review/summary: Not So Sweet Treat!
review/text: I love chocolate so I was excited to see the Chocolate Sampler Gift Basket by Back Mountain Baskets available in Vine to review. After reading a few other reviews on the strange packaging, I was almost afraid to open it - who knows what I would find. My daughter had a strong chocolate urge so we pulled off the wrappers.<br /><br />Oh my gosh, it is hard to know what to say. What was this company thinking?<br /><br />Let's start with the packaging. At first glance the basket looks simple yet classy and attractive and boasting what appears to be an assortment of delectable chocolates. That illusion is lost once you have opened the package. There are paper wrappings around boxes with the product name. But the actual boxes are for common grocery items like jello, fruit loops, flan etc. Can you imagine diving into a box of truffles that say Kenzi on the surface only to find the box below is for jello? A box of jello whose expiration was several years ago. How long does one keep old cereal boxes around, but more importantly, why would you package gift basket chocolate in old jello and cereal boxes?<br /><br />One of the boxes has a computer generated label that has been cheaply made and taped to it.<br /><br />So what is in the box? Well in one I pulled out a bag of peanuts that had melted and then solidified in one chunk. In another were small brown things that I believe were supposed to be truffles. There were also some wrapped cheap chocolate such as a chocolate graham cracker.<br /><br />The entire basket was unappetizing and unappealing. I can't share how the chocolate tastes, because after pulling it out of jello and flan boxes and seeing the melted condition, there was no way I was eating it despite my love for chocolate.<br /><br />With proper packaging and shipping, there would be a much better result but as it is now, it should not be for sale.<br /><br />This is definitely not a gift basket you will want to give.

review/summary: Lots of fluff, not a lot of stuff
review/text: ...and the stuff that's there is mediocre at best. Drug store chocolates, and this "Life Is Like A Box of Chocolates" box that is filled with tissue wrapped Halloween candy.  If your chocolate gift needs to show class, this isn't it. The basket is great. What in it leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Disclosure: I am a chocolate snob and have 3 hand made chocolate companies that I love, so I go for the good stuff and I mean, better than Godiva.<br /><br />p,s, They sent me a second basket saying the first, with the color laser printed wrappers, was a prototype and never meant to be seen, but the final version, other than the printing, wasn't any better. The chocolates were the same low quality drug store brands.<br /><br />p.s.s. If you know chocolate, then you know that chocolate that is old gets a white film on it. The chocolate covered peanuts were totally covered in that film.  This is not a basket to give to any chocolate lover who has any knowledge of what good chocolate tastes like.

review/text: Seriously, this is the worst tasting grape juice I've ever ingested.  Tastes like it's 2/3 water and 1/3 grape juice.  Talk about a misleading label!  Says 100% juice.  I would beg to differ.  For reference, I've drank many brands of grape juice from the obvious Welch's to any old store brand.  The kicker is on the label there's a gold medal this was awarded for superior taste.<br /><br />Don't waste you money on this.  Would never buy again.

review/summary: Tastes great, but no expiration date
review/text: My 4 jars were shipped in lots of bubble wrap, it took me a while to open.  Anyways, it is real artichoke spread, made in Italy.  Claims all natural ingredients and no preservatives.  My first shock is the size of the jars.  4.5 oz ain't much - think baby food.  The other thing I didn't like is that nowhere on any of the jars could I find an expiration date!!  Looks like Amazon took individual jars not labeled for resale from a large box.  Maybe it is OK to sell stuff in Italy without a date, but I am sure some law is being violated selling it here in the US.  Anyways, I opened a jar and it tastes OK, so I'm keeping it this time, but have doubts about re-ordering in the future.<br /><br />My recommendation for Amazon: if you want to get into the online food-selling business, please make sure that not only the products are labeled properly, but the expiration date is noted on the product page.

review/text: This oil has a very strong garlic flavor, which is hard to find.  There are bits of garlic in the bottom to keep the infusion going on the shelf, but the pour spout fails to filter them out.  So if you're pouring directly into your dish, you may find some garlic "paper" or the woody bits of the skin atop your food.  Keep an eye out for that but, otherwise, good stuff.

Rare that anyone cares at all about anything.<br /><br />The chocolates were cold, but once they came up to room temp, they tasted like they<br />were made yesterday.  Fresh and robust.<br />As long as I have access to this company, I will never buy an over-priced big name<br />chocolate again.  CCC will be my only Chocolate vendor from now on.<br /><br />Try a box and prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the taste, quality, and caring for the customer.

review/summary: delicious olive oil.  not too full bodied.
review/text: PLUSES:<br />delicate fresh olive flavor and the color is a beautiful pale green.<br /><br />MINUSES:<br />thin gauge plastic bottle<br />not the prominent olive flavor I'd prefer (which might be a plus for you)<br /><br />This was recommended to me because I am looking for a very full bodied olive oil.  In Olave, you can taste the olives, and they are very pleasant but it lacks the strength of olive flavor I'm looking for.<br /><br />This is a good oil and for someone else, this might be nirvana. Pricewise it's average, not bad, not good.  It's packaged in too thin clear plastic bottle which is a big negative, first because after a time plastic imparts it's own flavor to the oil.  And second because the bottle too easily collapses.  I had to transfer the oil to a carafe.

review/text: I have two smaller dogs and they absolutely love their Tug-a-jug's.  The many uses of this product; training, feeding, tug, play, fetch, etc.. are incredible considering the low price of it.  Ingenious design and functionality.  Be sure to use (smelly) smaller treats to have your dog get the "hang" of it and adjust them in size to make it more challenging.  Trust me, if you put just a little time into showing your dog how it "works", it will easily become its favorite toy. The BEST!!!!!!

review/summary: My Pugs love this!
review/text: I bought two of these for my Pug puppies.  Wasn't sure if first if they would get the hang of it but it took no time at all.  Instead of the treats they suggest (which could be made of anything and could have too many calories), I fill these with Cheerio's (or some frozen sliced carrrots or peas) and a few larger milkbones and they go nuts.  The larger milkbones are added just to make it a little tougher.  It's a great learning toy or busy toy - hence the name.  All I have to ask my little Puggies is, "do you want your bottle" and that's all they need.  We couldn't live without it.  Oh and I've had ours for probably a year and a half and we're not even close to needing to replace them.

review/summary: Great fun for my dogs!
review/text: My dogs love this toy!  They're Golden/Lab mixes, so they love to play and are very food-driven.  One of them figured out how to get the treats out within a matter of minutes ... her father hasn't quite gotten it yet.  For him, it's still trial and error, but they both love it.  I like that it is so easy to fill; the bottom simply screws off so you have easy access for filling and cleaning.  It's easy to clean too; I've washed it in the dishwasher with no problems.  My dogs have destroyed several other treat-dispensing toys by simply chewing through the toy to get to the treats.  I've had this one for a few weeks now and it's still in good shape (only a few scratches on the surface of the jug from being bounced around my hardwood floors).  So I'm pleased with how durable it is as well.

review/text: I purchased our first Busy Buddy Tug for Hudson's 1st Birthday! He is a constant busy-body and this toy provides hours of entertianment for him. My concern was the durability becasue he can chew through most everything immediately.... not this toy! It is by far the most durable!!! He did eventually chew through the rope, which I removed and he continues to play with this and carry it around most of the day. Our other little Springer Spaniel loved it so much that after months of fighting over it, I bought Wrigley one for his 1st birthday last month. I was so pleased with the first one, I also purchased the Preimer Waggle for him. If it is possible, this toy is even more entertaining than the other! Hard to believe ... these toys have kept our puppies busy, entertained and constantly concentrating and working on getting the treats out! I love them!

review/text: My young Keeshond puppy is a master of the Tug-a-Jug, but even my 10 year old Border Collie loves the thing!  She will play with it until every last bit of kibble is liberated.  After many hours of play, the jug is a bit scratched, but the rope remains intact.  My dogs do not chew the rope (or I would remove this toy and replace with something more appropriate). They seem to recognize that the rope is helpful in removing kibble from the jug.  Tug-a-Jug is definitely a hit!  It keeps my very busy puppy occupied for 45-60 minutes per refill.

review/text: We have the large Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug for a lab/shepherd mix that is a major chewer!  He goes through toys fast and destroys the yard when left alone outside, so our trainer recommended products that you can hide treats in that he has to WORK to get out.  I thought for sure he'd just shred the rope, but he's happy to flip it around endlessly... just for little morsels.  We use about a half cup of dry items like KONG brand "Tail Mix" and GRIZZLY NUTREATS smoked wild salmon for the week.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:19 Mins<br /><br /></span>It took my dog no more than 4 hours to destroy this.  First off there are two types of rope that this product can come with - we've seen a cotton rope or a rubber one.  Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x-small and small size on amazon).<br />First, my dog took to chewing the jug.  She saw the treats and would hit at the jug.  She also chewed on the grip and bone.  In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it.  She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her.  Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL.  In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all.  She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.<br />For reference, we had the medium/large for about a 40-45 pound 1 year old beagle/basset mix.

review/summary: Easier than I expected
review/text: This toy seems well-made, which is important for my puppy who is a powerful chewer and destroyer. Sometimes, though, the base can be difficult to screw back on after filling it with kibble.<br /><br />I have used the toy with my 8-month-old, medium-sized dog 3 times now, putting her kibble meal inside instead of treats. The first time she used it, she was frustrated and confused, and my mom just gave her the food inside after a while. The second time, I was with her and constantly encouraged her but didn't touch the toy. She got all of the kibble out except for a few pieces after significant efforts. She eventually discovered a way of manipulating it (tipping the jar upside down to stand on the narrow neck) that was most successful. The kibble came out many pieces at a time instead of just one piece at a time, which was happening often before. The third time, I barely watched her, and she had the food out pretty quickly. She started to get really frustrated with the toy, wanting more kibble to come out. I examined the toy, and there wasn't a single kibble left! This surprised me that she was so quick, but a similar thing happened when I introduced her to the Kong. It was quite hard the first time; but, after that, she seemed to have easy success.

review/summary: My Yorkie can spend hours playing with the Tug-A-Jug!
review/text: I bought the Tug-A-Jug for my Yorkie and he loves to push and pull it around the room while it pops treats out. He can spend hours just playing with it. My Golden Retriever even plays with the Tug-A-Jug. I'd recommend this product to anyone who has a dog that needs a challenge and loves the mental stimulation that this product provides.

review/summary: Amazing toy for dogs who devour their food quickly
review/text: Absolutely LOVE this toy. We recently purchased this for our 8 month old French Bulldog after our trainer suggested feeding him by hand to prevent him from gobbling up his meals in 2 seconds as Frenchies do. While that's great in theory, there are many times we just can't sit and feed him his kibble bit by bit. We tried several Kong type products and he was able to either get his food out too quickly or grew bored and never ate. This toy makes him really work for his food and because he can see the food through the tube it really keeps his interest. My only gripe is that the plastic tube could be more sturdy. I love that it's see through but his jaws of steel have already done some damage to it, but perhaps we just need to experiment with a larger size (we have the small now) We've only had it a short time so I can't speak too much for longevity but for now it is an amazing solution.

review/text: This toy really helps my dog slow down when she is eating dinner. Before she would eat too fast and would get sick.  Now we give her this with a cup of food and it takes her about 30 to 45 minutes to eat her dinner.  She doesn't seem to actually "play" with it (she never really plays with anything) but does like to chew on the rope.

review/summary: keeps 'em busy!
review/text: My dog (cocker spaniel) has separation anxiety and one of the tactics i use to distract him from my leaving the house is his busy buddy tug-a jug toys.  His first one lasted about a year, and we used it every day, sometimes two to three times.  The threads on the bottom of the screw-off bottle eventually all broke off (i believe there is a picture of what it did on the item description already) and we needed another one.  So i bought 2.  It is a good toy that i will continue to give my dog, as it effectively keeps him busy and engaged.

review/text: My dog is food obsessed and LOVES this toy. At 4 months it took her less than a day to figure it out which was fine because now we give it to her when we leave and she spends the entire time playing with it! It is by far her favorite toy. When the food runs out she carried it over to us and begs for more. We don't bother with special treats. Her dry food works just fine and from what we have seen, she even prefers it that way.

review/text: What a great find for us. We recently adopted a 6 month old Weimaraner/Black Lab mix who is very smart and needs to stay busy to avoid getting himself into trouble. From day one with his "juggy", it has been his BFF (and a great babysitter). We have experimented with different sizes of dog food (for more of a challenge) and have also discovered that a handful of Cheerios in there with the dog food pieces makes our Joey pup go NUTS until he gets all of the cereal out. This product is his "go to" toy 24/7, and we are glad.

review/summary: Good food toy for the rotation
review/text: This toy has worked out well for our dog!  We try to buy interesting and safe toys for us to give her while we're at work. It's tough and has withstood our large Bernese Mountain dog puppy chewing at the neck of it and throwing it around the room. It took her a few days to figure it out.  I had to show her how to use it, and she seemed uninterested, but then I left it in her crate with her, and when I came home later it was empty.  Since then, she's a pro at it.  The rope didn't last that long, but we just took the rope out and use larger treats with it, and it's still a challenge for her.  Our last thing that we tried in it was baby carrots - she loved it and it took her a good 30 minutes to get them out.

review/text: I purchased the largest Tug-a-Jug for my 2 dogs, both around 60 pounds.  They love it.  It didn't take long to figure out how to get the treats out, but it still takes work to actually get them all out.  With previous toys, once the puzzle is solved, you go from 30 minutes of doggie entertainment to 2 minutes.  I love that this toy continues to keep them occupied.  While it IS durable, I don't leave it out when it's not play time.

review/summary: Pug loves it...
review/text: I have 2 very food motivated pugs (never met one that wasn't...). The outgoing one LOVES banging this toy around the house for hours. The shy one won't go near it. the first day with this, I filled it up almost full with kibble so it dispensed more easily, but she still got frustrated trying to figure out how to use it. After a couple of days, she can empty 1/2 cup of kibble from the small one in an hour :) and will continue to play with it as long as it has food in it.... the larger the treat size, the harder it is to come out. A couple kibble falls out every minute or so; a treat the size of a Zuke's Mini Bakes will come out every 5 to 10 minutes. I put 1/2 cup kibble and 10 mini bakes inside to keep her occupied for an hour. Note: the more full the jug is, the faster the dispensing rate (good for unmotivated dogs). The smaller the jug, the more full it is when a given amount of food is placed in it, thus if my pug had a hard time with the small size, I would buy the x-small so she could get the food out more easily. After a week of using it, I realize the small size is just fine.<br /><br />Pros:<br />dog loves it<br />durable<br />keeps them occupied for unlimited time<br />i like the "difficulty" level of this toy: it is not too easy that it's emptied in 15 minutes like a treat ball, but not so hard that she won't play with it<br /><br />cons:<br />rope is difficult to clean and attracts moisture<br />the noise as she bangs it around the house is insane

review/summary: Amazing way to provide treats
review/text: I have been searching for some good toys for my little pup.  After him beating up some of his stuffed animals, I knew i needed to provide something more durable and safe.  I came across this while searching for dog toys, and loved the idea that it is not only a toy, but a reward/education system.  After filling it with some of his favorite treats (cheerios), i put it on the ground and awaited his reaction.  He was a bit confused at first, but after pushing it and dragging it I think he finally realized how the toy will reward him with play.  Took him a solid hour to go through a handful of treats, and he seemed VERY engaged.  Didn't even notice me cooking in the kitchen (he usually follows and stares and waits for food to fall).

review/summary: Good Toy--A few Drawbacks
review/text: My labs like to play with this toy-- which is good.  I don't put treats inside it and they still will play with it and fight over it.It seems durable and it seems safe.  The problems are two fold.  If the dogs play with it on a hard surface, like a concrete patio or a wooden deck, it makes a lot of noise as they drag the bottle end around and bounce it off of objects. Also my Labs will grab this thing by the rope end and swing it around in the air and it becomes a weapon of mass destruction whacking fixed objects or another dog while being whirled around. Nothing is perfect. I let the dogs have play time with it regardless of the negatives.

review/summary: Puppies All Time Favorite Toy
review/text: We have an English Mastiff puppy, and when we has about  months I picked up a small one of these on clearance. He loved it and played with in multiple times each day. As he grew it was just too small, so we upgraded to the Large Jug.<br /><br />He would hold this my the role and swing it back and forth hitting himself in the head. We eventually took it away because we didn't want him to give himself brain damage, but dang he enjoyed this thing.<br /><br />It was really durable. We have dents in our walls from it, but the plastic never cracked. The only part that eventually broke was the rope itself from our dog chewing on it. That wasn't a fault of the product, just a puppy with sharp teeth.

review/summary: Great Toy But Not Durable Enough
review/text: This toy has been a favorite of my 2 Year old GSD's since she was a puppy.  The first one lasted a really long time but our home is all hardwood flooring and my dog is so obsessed with this toy, she carries it around and drops it on the floor in front of us when she wants us to fill it!  This has resulted in the bottom screw caps breaking pretty quickly and she is now on her 5th one.  She broke two in one week.  Problem has been solved by no longer letting her carry it around the house, however, it would be nice if Premier could come up with a more shock resistant plastic to use.  I give it 5 starts due to the love my dog has for this toy but I wish it was more durable.

review/text: My 7 year old yellow lab figured this out in minutes and loves it.  My 2 year old chocolate lab just doesn't get it.  My only reason for giving it 4 stars is that Buster (yellow lab) carries it by the rope when empty and drops it at my feet on the tile.  After about 3 drops the screw on bottom breaks.  After he broke the first one, we ordered another and sprayed the bottom with rubberized coating.  That made it last a good six months.  We are ordering another one for his Christmas present.  It would be the BEST if the manufacturer would put an unbreakable bottom on it.

review/summary: Fantastic puzzle toy for our clever and busy pit bull! Just try not to get conked out with it.
review/text: This is really one of the best purchases we've ever made for our 3-year-old pit bull (aside from the giant orthopedic dog bed that she loves like candy).<br /><br />Like many pits, she is very clever & very eager to work, and that means she needs a lot of mental stimulation in order to be a good citizen around the house. She's not terribly food-motivated in general, but she adores this toy, and we've taken to giving her one of her 2 daily meals out of the 'food bomb.' She seems to love working to get all the food bits out of it, and when that's done she alternates between gnawing on the screw top end of the toy, chewing on the rubber bit, and whipping it around by the rope.<br /><br />That brings me to the only potential drawback of the food bomb--I am convinced one of these days she's going to give me a concussion if she loses her grip on the rope while she's flinging it about. But since she has those strong pit bull jaws, hopefully that won't be an issue... Sometimes I'm shocked she hasn't given *herself* a concussion with it, but her head is apparently made of concrete.<br /><br />(Oh--and it has withstood a year's worth of her efforts to destroy it so far, which is more than I can say for the vast majority of toys that enter the house.)

review/summary: Keeps my big Dog busy for a long time!
review/text: My Doberman/pointer mix has a lot of extra energy and really enjoys to chew. I purchased this product on a whim at the animal shelter that we got her from. I really had no idea how the toy was supposed to work, so she really did not use it for the first few weeks.<br /><br />Initially I put just a few Zuke's Mini Naturals treats in the container. She was able to get the treats out eventually, but lost interest quickly.  This toy is dishwasher safe! I put some peanut butter and a few broken up Milkbones in the toy to make it smell appealing and rattle when she shakes it. This made all the difference.  She now will sit calmly trying get to the peanut butter, and accidentally making the Zuke's treats fall out.<br /><br />Other reviews stated that their dog was able to break the plastic, but my dog has been playing with this for a month now, and she hasn't even been able to rip the rubber ball by the rope. As with any toy, you should try to supervise your pet. I would recommend this toy to any owner whose dog gets bored and will get destructive.

review/text: My dog usually has toys shredded within a day. If it's something with a rope, he always manages to rip it out.<br />Not so with this! So far its very durable and keeps him busy for a while trying to get the cheerios out!<br />I recommend this to anyone who has a dog that needs to be busy.

review/summary: Took a while to figure out, but great toy!
review/text: I got the medium/large size about 2 weeks ago for my 2 year old, 40lb dog. He is a generally smart dog so I was a little disappointed when for the first several days all he would do was lick where the rope went into the toy in hopes of getting the food out. Now, a week or so later he is knocking it all around and seems to have really gotten a hang of it. All of his food fits into the toy, (about a cup) and I am sure more would fit for a larger dog. I think now that he has figured it out I may start putting his meals into it so he doesn't eat too much.<br /><br />This is one of the original reasons why I bought this toy, because he bolts down his food and bloat was a concern. Plus it will give him something to do when I am away at work. On the quality of the material, I would say the plastic bottle is very  hard and seems tough enough to handle being  whacked around against the floor and walls. I cannot give an accurate account, however, because my dog has not shown any interest in chewing this toy. The ball at the end of the neck is a softer plastic, and I think that if he wanted to he could chew it up, but again he is mainly focused on the food aspect, not necessarily chewing up the toy itself.<br /><br /> I would say give your dog some time to figure out the toy and don't be surprised if it takes a week or so to figure out, because now that he has he is always pushing it around the floor.

review/summary: Keeps my dog occupied for a looooong time!
review/text: Fergus (1-year old terrier mix) loves his tug-a-jug! It dispenses his kibble just often enough that he stays interested, but not so quickly that it's empty in a few minutes. Plus, it's pretty big (I bought the small/medium) and doesn't get stuck under the furniture, unlike some of the other, similar toys I've tried.

review/summary: Not very busy buddy
review/text: I purchased this toy for my very busy-mouthed blue heeler who seems to love everything that is half-way chewable.  It seemed to be the perfect combination of things he adores:  rope, bottles, noise, and chewable plastic.  We bought treats, showed him the treats inside (and they were good and stinky - his favorites), swung the thing around in the air a couple of times.  He was very interested, and we thought "this is it!".  We tossed the toy in front of him.  He smells it, pawed it once, and then nothing.  OK, that's fine.  Sometimes toys take a little warm up period.  So we grabbed it up, acted like it was great fun, teased him with the rope, tossed it, ran to get it, and did all the things that usually get our heeler into a playing frenzy.  Oh, he was ready to play.  But when he'd run to the toy - that was it.  "Oh - it's still this toy, huh?"  Nothing.  We tried multiple times - nothing.<br /><br />This toy has all the makings of a good toy, but just didn't hit the mark.  It's very durable - because it will never get played with!  What a shame, too, because it's a great looking toy.  For a dog that loves just about every toy, he doesn't like this.  Two paws down.

review/summary: Surprised at how much my dog liked this!
review/text: I accidentally ordered two of these, and when I saw them, I was sure none of my small Havanese dogs would be interested.  Just looking at it, I figured there was no way they could figure out how to get the treats out.  I planned on giving it to my son who has bigger more active dogs.  Well, I put treats in one and put it down and one of my dogs took possession of it and worked for an hour at getting the treats.  She absolutely loves this toy, and will perk up and follow me when I pick them up to fill.  Yes, I kept both of them, just in case the other dogs took an interest.  Paws up on this one!!

review/summary: Great Toy but Not as Durable
review/text: We got this for our 45lb dog and it occupied him for 30 minutes the first time we gave it to him. He had a little trouble getting a treat out. A miracle! However he is a smart dog and quickly learned how it worked. A scoop of food that used to last him 20+ minutes now only lasted him 10 minutes. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks, the plastic lid that screws onto the jug cracked and it is now useless. This is probably best for pet owners with carpeting since my dog would pick it up and drop it constantly to get the treats out which would be very noisy.

review/summary: So much better than a bowl!
review/text: The Tug-a-Jug has become our Hobbes' favorite toy.  We no longer give him meals in a bowl, but either in this toy or in a Buster Cube. We prefer this to the Buster Cube when we are watching TV because it is less noisy. The Tug-a-Jug is solidly constructed.  We've had ours for a month so far, and have used it nearly every day.  It is absolutely worth the twelve dollars it is currently selling for.<br /><br />The medium/large size hard plastic bottle is about the size of a large (32 oz) sports drink bottle.  As the dog tugs the rope and manipulates the bottle, bits of kibble - or whatever you want to put in it - come out.  You can also change the level of challenge by putting ping pong balls or other things in the bottle.<br /><br />Hobbes is a 60 lb Lab mix, and a cup of kibble will last him about fifteen minutes.  In a bowl, the same amount is gone in seconds.  It's a great way for him to have some mental stimulation and settle down in the evening before bed.  Because he loves it so much, it's a great training aid.  At a minimum, he sits politely to ask for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: (September 2, 2011) Hobbes chewed right through the rope a month or so ago. However, we removed the remnants of the rope and put in more ping pong balls to plug the hole. This way we haven't had to buy a new one and he still enjoys it every night.

review/summary: Favorite toy
review/text: I usually am not one to submit reviews but after having used this product for two years I feel that it is definately worth a review.  I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug-A-Jug tops them all.  The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown.  The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it.  A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have broke into two pieces almost instantly.  I have found that if the rope is broken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not broken!  I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better.  My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one.  He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly.  The Tug-A-Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!<br /><br />Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon.  In the future, I will only buy this from amazon.  It is the exact same thing for almost half the price!  Way to go Amazon, this is great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug to anyone who has a very smart dog that is food motivated.  5 stars.

review/summary: Great while it lasted
review/text: My one year old Lab. loved the bottle filled with his kibble. The kibble fell out when tossed around. He carried the bottle into the kitchen started tossing it and it cracked when it hit the tile floor at the screw end  ALL kibble fell out and it broke into sharp pieces and it was a scramble to get the piece before he tried to eat and swallow them.  You know Labs they will eat anything halfway looking like food.  The bottle is not very durable on hard surfaces.  The same would have happened on the patio deck I am sure.  Expensive for the 30 minutes he used it.

All of them ignore it completely! They seem to like the kong with treats in it best or the buster cube or a toy similar. However my sister's dog is a mix of german shepard and she loves this toy. So it kind of depends on the dog. Some dogs love it, some dogs ignore it.

review/text: I bought this toy for my puppies in hopes of finding a toy that would last longer than a day.  They love to tear and chew anything up!  This is a great toy as it is durable, but also keeps them busy for hours trying to remove the treats.  It is adorable watching them try to figure out the rope\treat technique.  I ended up buying another one so they didn't have to share.  The best part is we have owned it for a couple of weeks and it is still in one piece!

review/summary: Favorite toy - just plan to replace it frequently
review/text: My puppy loves this toy, although I don't like that the rope gets smelly and it is hard to clean (I prefer toys that can go in the washer or dishwasher).  I put her kibble in it and she immediately hauls it into her crate she she can get the food out without having to chase it around the house.  She is not a toy chewer, but this has cracked just from her dropping it a few inches.  I have glued it several times, but the last time was so bad that the glue has now made it so I can't screw the bottom on.  This has lasted 1 month with a very gently now 5 month old Newfoundland. Not a great track record, but she loves it so much that I will order another. Thank God for Amazon Prime where I can get another one quickly as she looks disappointed when I put her food in her dish rather than this device.

review/summary: Challenging and Durable
review/text: I accidentally bought the large Tug-a-Jug for my little 12 lb Maltese/Jack Russell mix dog. Although it intimidated her as a puppy, she has since come to love this toy and begs to be able to play with it. (I wouldn't suggest small dog owners getting the large toy for their small dogs though. It works for Izzy, but my parents toy poodle won't do much more than sniff at it.)<br /><br />DURABILITY: My main concern with buying toys for Izzy is she can destroy most things in a short amount of time. Toys for "aggressive chewers" last a couple hours tops, and the only way I get stuffed squeaker toys is purely for her occasional entertainment. The Tug-a-Jug, however, has not been a problem whatsoever; it's still in great condition, and she's been playing with it for a year.<br /><br />TREATS: I would suggest when they're learning how it works, to fill it with treats like Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats. They're a training treat and very small. Once your dog figures out how to work the treats out, fill it with something like Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats. These are larger and create a bigger challenge. Also, of course, dog food works great too.<br /><br />This is a great toy and option for dogs that have energy and enjoy a challenge. It's also entertaining to watch them try to get the treats out :)

review/summary: Great for smart busy dogs!
review/text: I have a 2 year old border collie mix who gets bored easily and loves interactive toys. She gets so excited when I bring this toy out. However, she is a very strong chewer so she was able to chew through the rope within a day or so. I read on the Busy Buddy website a great suggestion: put a tennis ball in the bottle to make the toy useful again. This has worked well and makes the treats a challenge to get out. She figured it out very quickly but she is also a very smart and curious dog. My only complaint is that it is very loud on the wood floors! this toy is best if you have carpet or at least don't have a basement tenant in your house.

review/text: Dog broke the hard plastic the first day by slamming it around by the rope so we have to tape it up everytime we refill. Dog does enjoy, carries it around wanting to play fetch but settles on tug a war. It does keep him occupied trying to get the food out. Container needs to be made of different material to prevent breakage but still worth the money for the enjoyment it has given him.

review/summary: Good for fast eaters
review/text: I put my dog's kibble meals in this so she doesn't gobble it up so fast.  She seems to think it's fun, and will work until she's gotten every last piece out.  I've had one for about a year and it's still in good condition except the rope is gross, so I wanted to replace it.  I ordered the small, which is pictured with a rubber piece instead of rope (thought it would be easier to clean), but I received a small with rope.  I definitely recommend this product as an alternative to the "slow down" bowls or for dogs that need extra stimulation.  I have a medium sized, non-destructive dog and this product does hold up over time.

I give her kibble in here about 3-4 times a week and she gets it all out (1 cup) within about 20 minutes. Make sure you are away from breakable things though because if your dog whips it around and tosses it - like mine does, it could definately break something. This is a great, durable toy at $11.92.

review/text: I am really surprised out just how much they do love them.  They quit playing with their other toys and carry these around with them.  I have 2 of the x-small and 1 of the med/large which is really big.  Some of them have a rope and some have a rubber rope.  It seems a little harder to get out treats with the regular rope because of the size of it.  It really makes your dogs work for the treats and keeps them occupied for a long time.  You can even take the rope out and put in a golf ball but the treats do come out easier with this method.  My dogs have slammed these things around and there has been no breakage of the product.  I have 2 German Shepherds so they are pretty tough on toys.  I also like the fact that you can fill these up ahead of time and then give to dogs later when you are leaving.

review/summary: Good entertainment
review/text: My puppy is a big time chewer. We give him his dinner in this a few times a week and it keeps him (and us) entertained. We do take it away from him as soon as he's done with all the food though, because I can tell the rubber end wont stand up if we let him go to town on it. Still other toys don't last a day and we're getting good use out of this.

review/summary: Was good for a while
review/text: I liked this toy when I first got it and it kept my 1 1/2 year old corgi busy for a while. I put his food in it and a few other "interactive toys" to keep him busy, this toy is actually too easy for him and lately  he will only get about half the kibble out and then loose interest. The other thing I don't like is that I can't wash it without getting the rope all wet. It would be better if you could twist off the rope portion and throw it in the dishwasher.

review/summary: I love this toy
review/text: I don't have time to write reviews, because I have a new baby Boxer,but.....this is the best toy I have EVER purchased. My Boston Terrier cannot figure out why she can't kill this toy. She plays with it for hours and hours until she is panting, and I take it away. My Boston kills every toy she gets, but not this one. I'm online right now to buy one for my Boxer. Boston's don't share well, she takes all the toys and puts them on the bed where the Boxer can't get to YET! Wish me luck, and get one of these toys.

review/summary: Tug-a-Jug is WONDERFUL!!
review/text: The tug-a-jug keeps my boarder collie busy for hours! I just put her normal food in the jug and she thinks it's a game to get the food! It is wonderful.  I don't sugest using it in any rooms with glass doors (like on an entertainment center) though, they break from the hard plastic jug.<br />WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!

review/summary: Great fun, has to be on a rug and needs thin treats
review/text: My dogs love this and each figured out different techniques to get food out - took a while for them to get good at it. The Pit Bull holds her paws around the rubber ring and turns it over to pour some out. The Heinz 57 bats it around until something falls out, just beginning to hold the rope with 1 paw and hit the jug with the other. They are tied for time to get all the treats out!<br /><br />This cannot be played with on tile or wood floors - too noisy for people and jug slides too much for dogs. It would work in a crate, but I won't leave my dogs alone with ANY toy of this sort.<br /><br />It is hard to find dog goodies that will come out most are too thick to pass through. Charlee Bear Treats(any flavor) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002QX3Q0">Charlee Bear Dog Treats 16Oz Zip Pack Cheese/Egg</a> work perfectly as do larger sized cat treats. I love watching the dogs as they figure out a new way to make it work. No one has eaten off the rubber ring (the toy would still work if they did) and no one has chewed off the rope. (You could replace the rope or put in some sort of ball as someone else did.)<br /><br />I'd have given this 5 stars except for the noise on hard floors.

review/summary: My dog's favorite way to eat!
review/text: As other people have noticed this isn't something that you should leave your dog alone with all day.  Given that caveat I think this is an amazing product!  I actually have 2 (one for each dog) and it is their favorite way to get a meal.  It keeps them occupied for about 10-15 minutes but you can tell they are thinking and having a blast and they are generally ready to settle down and relax for a bit afterwards.  I have one with a real rope and one with a rubber rope.  Each has benefits and downsides.  I would recommend getting the large even for little dogs, my sister had a 4lb yorkie and he has no problem operating the medium/large size toy.  My dogs are a 25lb cocker and a 35lb mix so I cannot comment on the appropriateness of this toy for large dogs.  If the toy is too difficult you can take the rope out until they get the hang of it.  Also my cocker will sometimes unscrew the back instead of working each piece out through the top but that actually takes him longer so I don't mind.

review/summary: Tough Jug!
review/text: This product is so sturdy and great. The rope only lasted a day, but I still use the jug constantly. My Lab loves it and it has held up to her power chewing. Once she figured it out I've had to use larger treats to keep her busier longer. Great product.

review/text: My 10-month pitbull loves this, but she chewed through the rope on this toy within her third day of having it.  That's a pretty short life for $14 so for those of you who have had the same thing happened here's what I did: forget the rope and put a tennis ball or two inside with kibble.  It's not exactly a tug jug anymore, but it does take a little work to get the food out.

review/summary: Great interactive toy but my boy still to smart for it...lol
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:37 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was impressed by the design of this toy.  Definitely one of the better interactive toys within it's price range.  The dog is supposed to pull the rope to get the treat out.  Well, my boy bypassed all that and within 20 minutes figured out he just had to tip the bottle to get the treats out.  I put bigger treats in to keep him busy for longer and some pieces I still don't know to this day how he got them out before I got home from work.  My only gripe with this toy, which is something the instructions don't tell you, is that the rope starts to stink after a while.  I cleaned it with dish soap a few time but that was only a temporary fix.  Put the rope in the washer and it frayed and came loose.  I'm now using and old medium width leash that I cut and knotted up on both ends (small enough to still let the treats out but not to have him spill all at once), which will also be easier to wash since I don't have to worry about fraying.  He's not as crazy about the toy now, but that's probably because he has to work harder for his "goods".

review/summary: Great!
review/text: This toy is one of the best I found. I put their food in it, and they went crazy trying to get it out. They are both pretty smart labs and figured out how to manipulate the toy to get the food pretty quickly, so I had to buy some treats that were bigger and harder to get out. The only problem I've encountered is that one of the ropes fell apart. I bought a new rope (rather than a whole new tug-a-jug), however the new rope is thicker and makes it near impossible to get anything out- neither dog gets anything from it regularly enough so they get fed up.

review/summary: Hours of fun!
review/text: My dachshund dog, Barney, ABSOLUTEY LOVES THIS TOY.  He loves for us to put dog food kibble in it, and then he entertains himself for hours.  He is very crafty in that he knows exactly how to get the cookies out of the jug.  He rolls it until he can get it against a solid surface and then he flips it upside down and gets the cookies out.  This toy is great, because I have two dogs, and they usually are always fighting to share toys, but the other dachshund, Cooper, doesn't like this toy, so Barney can have it all to himself.  Strongly recommend this toy!

review/summary: Good alternative to a Buster Cube
review/text: This toy takes more effort to get food out than the Buster Cube, which I like because it occupies the dog longer.  I find that the cube, even on its "hardest" setting only takes a few minutes to get out most of the food, and then the rest doesn't come out no matter how long the dogs work it.  With the bottle the dogs can get nearly all the food out if they keep at it.<br /><br />At first you should fill the bottle so that it is over half full.  This way food can come out more easily when it is on its side.  This will encourage the dog to play with it.  Once the food level goes down food will only come out as they toss and pull the bottle.  It took my dog a few days to get to this, but now she seems to have mastered it.  She stands the bottle up and knocks it over, putting food into the neck, then she works the rope a bit and manages to get a piece of kibble out.  When I first got the toy I thought she would never be able to figure it out, but she has.  Even so, it takes a fair amount of work to get out just a few pieces of food, so it can keep them occupied all day.

review/summary: Perfect for Power-Chewers!
review/text: Our 16 month old yellow lab loves to play with empty 2 liter pop bottles.  I bought him this toy because I worried he would cut his mouth and gums on the sharp plastic shards of those flimsy bottles.  No worry about that with the Tug-a-Jug...this toy will most likely survive through the next millennium!<br /><br />To fill with treats,  just twist off the bottom;  couldn't be easier.  It's a lot of fun watching our dog figure out how to get at the goodies inside.<br /><br />I honestly don't think the rope pull is going to last very long;  especially if you are buying this for an aggressive chewer.  However,  don't let that stop you from buying the tug-a-jug.  Even without the rope,  it's still a great and challenging toy.

review/summary: Love the Idea But Not as Great in Practice for Us
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Tucker was nervous about this toy at first (as you'll see in the video) but really warmed up to it quickly and has enjoyed gnawing on it.  However, this has not worked very well for us as a treat dispenser.  I consider Tucker to be quite a clever puppy, but after fiddling with the tug-a-jug for a couple days, he just began bringing the thing to me and dropping it at my feet for me to dispense the treats for him.  (I suppose that may be evidence of just how clever he is!)

review/summary: Not for a medium chewer!
review/text: I have a medium size dog - 38 pounds.  He enjoys to chew on things but I have never thought of him as a heavy chewer.  The night I received this he was so excited about it.  It was so tempting to see, hear and smell the treats.  Well, within 20 minutes the toy was in the garbage.  He chewed off the rubber toy that blocks the treats from coming out.  He then started to chew where the smell of the treats is able to escape.  The plastic fell apart so easily!  He then started to break off little pieces.  I woudl not recommend this for a medium or large sized dog!

review/summary: Great Toy for a dog that's tough on toys
review/text: Our dog loves her Bad CUZ, but this toy she loves more than any other.  She's a VERY tough chewer, and it's survived for quite some time with no damage.  One thing - protect your toes with this toy - it's pretty heavy and does get swung around a bit.  I wouldn't recommend this toy if you have low tables with knick-knacks, sensitive shins or teeny kids that may get bonked with it.  Ours has gotten thrown (by the dog) repeatedly down the stairs onto a hard floor and hasn't broken yet.<br />As far as treats to go into it - remember that the rope is knotted inside the jug, so don't put anything into the jug that's soft or the rope will end up smelling REALLY nasty...

review/summary: Tug-a-Jug lasts 5 minutes.
review/text: I was very disappointed with the tug-a-jug.  It came in the mail today.  The dog had it for 5 minutes and she had the rubber rope chewed in half in that short amount of time.  A waste of money for me.  I have yet to find something that this black lab doesn't destroy in record time.
