review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: Well, I've only had one cup so far, so I'll soldier on and keep trying to like it.  (After all, I did get stuck with 3 boxes.)  But this tea is definitely not what I expected.  Mostly tasteless and what taste there is is bitter ... I can't taste lemon OR ginger.  I've always loved Numi teas - the mint one is to die for.  But this one gets a thumbs down from me.

review/summary: Part of one of my favorite lunches.
review/text: I can't get the Hormel chili without beans anywhere locally, so was really glad to find it online at amazon. Well, what ISN'T online at amazon? Anyway, this product is an essential ingredient to my favorite diet lunch. I mostly eat the Nutrisystem way, only with my own foods. Low glycemic index, high protein. I use a low calorie hot dog bun, opened on the plate, put 2 40-calorie hot dogs on it, one on each half of the bun, then top it with 1/2 cup of hot chili and 1/4 cup of fat free cheddar cheese, then microwave it to melt the cheese. I have this with a big salad and all the calorie-free (watch your portion anyway) Walden Farms dressing I need. This fills me up, satisfies all the cravings I have for "real food" and makes me lose weight. And, it's delicious.

review/summary: Quite good. Not enough nuts though
review/text: Like the title says. There just aren't that many nuts. The picture shows a good amount of almonds,peanuts and cranberry. But the bars are mostly made of oats w/ high maltose corn syrup......Whatever that is. But those are really the first 2 ingredients. Other wise it's actually a pretty good bar. Probably not as healthy as a kind bar. But a lot cheaper. If you have sam's club member ship look into buying these there. You can get a pack of 30- 1.2 oz bars for  $10.

review/summary: Keep in the refrigerator
review/text: I always keep a box of these bars in my refrigerator.<br /><br /> If I had never seen the Fruit and Nut bars before, one look at the label would tell me that they are not particularly healthful.  The ingredients include corn syrup, honey, and sugar listed twice.  In fact, there are 14 grams of sugar in every 34 gram bar.  That is forty percent!  Although the label does claim all natural ingredients, that does not necessarily mean that the contents are all good for you.<br /><br /> The sugar seems to be what holds the fruit and nuts together.  The reason that I keep them in the refrigerator is that when the bars get warm, they do not hold their shape.  You do not want to put one in your pocket on a warm day.  They become a sticky blob.<br /><br /> So why do I keep a big supply of them around?  I like them.  When cooled, they keep their shape as a crunchy rectangle of nuts and fruit.  Their nutty texture is very nice.  The taste is great, although the sugar does make its presence known.  I do not eat them every day or take them with me to go hiking.  For that, I like the Oats and Honey, Almond, or Peanut Butter varieties of Nature Valley granola bars.  Those varieties have a more reasonable sugar content.  However, I like a Fruit and Nut bar as an occasional treat to go with tea or coffee.  Maybe I am addicted to them.

review/text: Ok. I love these granola bars and I purchased a large box of them for a very good price.  They taste great and I will reorder.  I gave a sort of low rating for 1 reason.  The bars must have been stored in a hot warehouse or truck, because you know the stuff that the nuts and granola are covered with, and that holds the bar together?  Well it's like it melted and ran to one side of the bar. I am not confused.  I am not talking about the sweet and salty nut granola bar with a praline layer.  I am talking about these bars.  Again though, they still taste just fine and I will order more.

review/summary: Best BBQ sauce on the market today, hands down.
review/text: And I've tried them all.<br /><br />Maybe its the anchovies. Who in their right mind but these radio clowns John Boy and Billy<br />would put anchovies in barbecue sauce right! Well why not, most all good steak sauces and<br />Worcestershire have anchovies, and you cant make a decent Caesar Salad without them either.<br /><br />What this sauce does to food is amazing. For ribs and chicken it just doesn't get any better.<br />Not a real tomato taste like most mainstream BBQ sauce, and not a mustard flavor either like<br />you will find in Florida and South Carolina. And although JB&B are in North Carolina, its not<br />a traditional NC style sauce either and thank god for that cause NC BBQ is the most overhyped<br />and overrated stuff I've ever had. So they went in a whole new direction with this recipe<br />cause there's nothing else like it.<br /><br />I use it as a finishing sauce on the grill, or you can dilute it with beer or vinegar and use<br />it for a marinade, even on steak. Its also great on rotisserie chicken and wings. If you want<br />more heat get the Hot and Spicy version. Its even better.<br /><br />BTW, my favorite recipe is for ribs using Emeril's Rib Rub and John Boy and Billy's Grillin<br />Sauce as a finisher. Great combination.

review/text: I give my Catahoula one Dentastix after her breakfast and one after her dinner. (I was delighted to find the Dentastix available in this 40-count economy size on Amazon.  I haven't been able to find these super-size bags in my pet store).  I find it very hard to brush her teeth (she HATES it) so I thought this would be a good alternative.  I think I was right.  The dog is 7 years old and the veterinarian says her teeth are beautiful.  She could do commercials for a toothpaste company!!  After she's eaten her meal(s) she automatically goes for the stix so I assume they are tasty.  Because of the veterinarian's glowing remarks re the condition of the dogs teeth I believe I can safely say that the Dentastix are doing their job.

review/text: I've been using Batch #37 ("The Batch") for YEARS and it is hands down my favorite hot sauce. I recall when I first stumbled upon The Batch I thought it was so good that I went out and ordered all the Pain Is Good hot sauces to give them a try. Some were good, some were crap but none compared to The Batch.<br />If you like hot hot sauce, you must try The Batch. It is the perfect balance of flavor and heat. Many of the really hot sauces are so hot they lose any and all of their flavor. Supermarket hot sauces on the other hand, often times have decent flavor but very little heat.<br />I eat The Batch to spice up salsa, straight on tortilla chips or whatever needs a little kick...I recently added a few drops to some cocktail sauce for dipping shrimp and it was amazing!!! Before it was available on Amazon, I would literally buy it by the case directly from the folks at Pain Is Good and give half the bottles away as gifts.<br />WARNING: DO NOT give it to people that do not openly volunteer their love of hot sauces as they usually can't take the heat...literally.<br />Now go get some Batch #37 and enjoy!!!

review/text: This is an amazing hot sauce for those who really like to kick it up a notch without inducing extreme pain. It has the perfect blend of heat and flavor and it goes with everything. I have a collection of hot sauces, but this is the only one I almost need by the case. For a real delight, mix it with sour cream for a fast dip that is bound to get you big points. I can't say enough positive things about this product. In a world full of sauces that exist only to be hot, this is truly a condiment designed to be savored.

review/summary: A Wonderful Product
review/text: Wow.  On the recommendation of the store owner, my husband and I bought a bottle of Gator Hammock at a specialty hot sauce shop in Dahlonega, GA.  This is some truly flavorful hot sauce.  Yes, it is hot, but not the kind of hot that you have to sign a waiver for or that will make you cry.  I'd rate this at about a 5 on a 1-10 heat scale.  Heat is great, I guess, if you're just trying to prove how macho you are or are the kind of person that thinks that eating should start with a dare.  But what we really love about this sauce is the flavor it imparts.  It must be in the mystery "spice blend" mentioned on the bottle.  It's a bit fruity from the peppers but not at all sweet.  It has some savory notes and is much more complex than a basic Tabasco or Texas Pete.  There is not a pronounced vinegar flavor as is the case with some other hot sauces.  I haven't tried this yet, but I'd imagine it would be amazing to add just a splash to tomato soup or to a Bloody Mary.<br /><br />What I have done is 1)mix it half and half with ketchup for a spicy burger topping, 2)added a splash to scrambled eggs (best scrambled eggs ever) and 3)added a little to some pulled pork barbeque along with a splash of vinegar and a tiny squeeze of honey.  Voila--instant barbecue sauce.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about Gator Hammock.  I went to their website the other day, and they make a wide range of products.  Guess I'll be working my way through their inventory over the next few months!

review/summary: Perfect Hot Sauce
review/text: I found this hot sauce while shopping in old town St. Augustine Florida. The store was filled with Sauces of every kind. I asked the woman working there for her favorite and she instantly led me to the-Made in Florida-Gator Hammock.  Now I order by the case. I can not be without... seriously.  It is a sauce with a full and unique flavor. Delicious. I have also purchased their other flavors. Lethal Hammock -wonderfully Really Hot. Swamp Gator medium heat and of course Gator which is mild but hot. Their sprinkles are great too, in chili and stir fry. Worth a try. If you love hot sauce, this will become your favorite.

review/summary: Very good sauce, not too hot, great flavor
review/text: I just got back from Firehouse Subs where they have numerous sauces available to try.  I'm not a huge hot sauce aficionado, but I do enjoy good food.  This sauce is good.  It is not very hot and does not have an overpowering vinegar base.  The flavor of the peppers and spices is strong and comes across nicely with other foods.  I will be purchasing a bottle of this sauce.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: This sauce is awesome.  I went on a month long quest for the next best table hot sauce.  I read a million reviews from different hot sauce sites only to order product after product and finding it flavorless, under-powered, over-powered, or simply disgusting.  This is THE most versatile hot sauce out there.  It makes a fantastic table sauce as well as an excellent marinade for some wings.  It showcases the cayenne and garlic without making the cayenne or garlic so much that it's unwelcome.  It is an immediate medium burn and should satisfy anyone seeking a nice well rounded table sauce.<br /><br />BTW:  These independent hot sauce reviews (non-Amazon) were hard to go through.  A lot of them are video reviews.  Why do people reviewing hot sauce think we want to see them eating hot sauce on a cracker over a crappy webcam.  And then they review the sauce while continuing to munch on a mouthful of hot cracker.  Gross...

review/text: I love having Plum Organics Baby Food as a choice for my baby. Whoever thought of having organic fruits and veggies in a pouch knows parents today are looking for fast, easy and healthy. These are great when you are traveling. I feel like eating green vegetables is one of the hardest things to get my child to do and he has no problem eating them everyday with these Spinach, Peas & Pear pouches. I will continue buying these as long as he eats them! Better bargain here on Amazon then buying them at my local Target store.

review/text: I really liked this flavor because it seems to be pretty healthy for a pre-made baby food. But I do wish the packs were bigger and they used less pears so it's not so sugary. Also, I contacted them once and asked what countries did all their ingredients come from and they never answered... Don't know why. Probably China???

review/text: My 18 month old loves this flavor of Plum Organics.  She was born with cleft lip/palate and is only allowed to eat from a bottle so I mix these in with formula and she loves them.  We go through 3 or 4 packets of Plum Organics food everyday.  I was thrilled to find a flavor that she liked that provided her with some green veggies!  I'm surprised that these are so expensive on Amazon.  I never pay more than $1 per packet at Babies R Us b/c they're on sale so frequently.

review/summary: So sour it made me pucker...
review/text: My daughter loved this food when I bought it for the first time at Wholefoods. I also tried it and it tasted really good. It was mild and sweet. I decided to buy the box along with other varieties from Plum. When I gave her the Peas, pears and spinach, she refused to eat it after the first two bites so I tried it.<br />I was surprised and alarmed that it was SO incredibly sour. It almost gave me a canker sore. I tasted nothing except lemons, felt like I was sucking on one too.<br />Tried to contact the company twice and NO one responded. Wanted to know if they had recalls for their food. Apparently they do have recalls but not for the pea, pears and spinach. Still trying to get in touch with them so they know that it was sour and maybe try to fix it. I plan to stick to Earth's Best at the moment until they get their act straight or finally contact me.<br />A month later...<br />I finally got a response from the rep and they are sending coupons so I can replace the boxes I bought. Hopefully, they will figure out what the issue is.

review/summary: Let's put this in perspective
review/text: You will see other reviews criticizing this syrup as not being like Lyle's.  Different uses!!  Lyle's is excellent for baking and making desserts but not for beverages.<br /><br />I like this Monin syrup to sweeten drinks!  It is awesome for that purpose.  I make fresh limeade for Margaritas with this ----way way better than a crummy store-bought Margarita mix.  Ever try to sweeten a beverage with granulated sugar?  Gross.  It doesn't melt.  All you do is add this syrup and it's great.  Great to add into iced tea too.<br /><br />Get the pump if you think you will use it to sweeten by the glass.  Otherwise you can just pour out of the bottle for larger batch drinks.  It's also really good to add into whipped cream if you are making that from scratch - but I actually prefer to use the vanilla flavored Monin for that.<br /><br />Monin syrups are high quality - I've been using them for years in my coffee (caramel, vanilla, almond, etc.) and the fruit flavored ones to make Italian sparkling sodas.

Moving here, for weeks I'd find packing peanuts Pat put always on the left 8" of three lower steps. never berore or since. She always has slept by me or is in a box by whatever chair I'm in.From the first time I picked her up from the box she was in with her exactly appearing littermates,(she was the only one I saw) she's been so amazing--lots more about hers--she knows & loves me more than anyone ever!

review/summary: The Only Way To Go!!
review/text: I am a HUGE fan of Chicago styled hot dogs and while my cousin was visiting us this summer, we got in this big discussion about them. You see he lives in Chicago and he told me that there was a brand of hot dogs in Chicago that was basically synonymous with the Chicago style hot dog. Well, he wound up sending us a huge package of them for Xmas. I was extremely excited and couldn't wait to go shopping to get the rest of the ingredients. I dont know why, but for some reason all my local stores were out of celery salt. It was very strange and ultimately very frustrating as I just couldn't wait to light up the grill and chow down on some Chicago style hot dogs.<br /><br />Anyways if I couldn't buy it locally then I had to buy some on the net and of course I came to Amazon first. I immediately found Simply Organic Celery Salt. I had never heard of organic celery salt but considering I buy as many things organic as I can, I immediately ordered a pack. I received them 2 days later and was extremely happy to find out that they use sea salt instead of regular salt. So not only is it made with organic celery, they also use sea salt, which is much better for you than regular salt. So overall it was a good thing that my stores were out of celery salt as I would have never found this brand otherwise.<br /><br />Needless to say we pigged out on Chicago style hot dogs that night and they were the best Chicago styled hot dogs I had ever had. Not only do I have a new brand of hot dogs, I also have a new brand of celery salt. Bring on the hot dogs!!!<br /><br />5 stars!!

I couldn't really taste the sea salt flavor though.

review/text: I was glad to find this on Amazon after learning that my local wholesale grocer no longer carries it.<br /><br />Not too many people know that gelatin contains both chondroitin and glucosamine, both of which are used widely to relieve arthritis pain. I prefer the whole food, besides which it's cheaper. I start with a mug 3/4 full of bouillon or apple juice, and put in a coffee measure (2 Tablespoons) full of gelatin. It does not need to be stirred as it will slowly absorb the liquid. Then I put a lid on the mug (my lid came from an old candy dish) and place it on a low-wattage candle warmer or mug warmer. In two hours or so I have a hot yummy protein drink ready to stir and enjoy. I do this twice a day so a 1-lb can will last a month or so. I really notice a difference in my pain levels from doing this.<br /><br />Note: make sure the lid fits inside the top edge of the mug.

review/text: I've always used Knox but when I was trying to decide if I wanted to purchase this, I tried the Kroger brand and the nutritional information indicated that it has 30g of protein where as the Knox has less than 1g! I haven't be able to figure out why there is such a difference. In the end, I purchased this Knox 1 lb. (2pack) because the subscribe and save made it a really good deal and is a "known" quantity. However, this is a lot of gelatin. So unless you eat it everyday, it's 2 lbs is going to last you a LONG time.

I like making cakes in pint jars and canning them.  If you use eggs they are good for only a few weeks, if you use this they are good for years...oh, and with the cakes, no water bath needed..they self seal once you put a lid on them from it's own heat right out of the oven.  Great way to have a ready dessert if company comes!  Be sure to use a wide mouth jar or it won't slide out.  What a great price and even better with a subscription.

review/summary: Much more economical than buying the little envelopes
review/text: I ordered this bulk container of gelatin because I was getting fed up with all the additives in flavored gelatin available from the grocery stores. To get the equivalent of a normal box of gelatin you use 2 teaspoons full from this container. I used the recipe on the can for knox blocks using 'Newman's own Grape Juice' and they were the best jigglers substitute I've had in a long time. Instead of there being 15 ingredients of questionable origin, my ingredients were this: Grape Juice (juice from grapes, vitamin C) and gelatin. NO additional sugar, anti-caking agents, food colorings or preservatives. When I finally go through 2 pounds of this stuff I will definitely order it again.

review/text: I've tried mixes from a lot of stores, including expensive ones from WIlliams-Sonoma (Sprinkles, etc.).  This is by far the best cupcake mix on the market.  I worried at first about having 5 mixes in our pantry, but it has worked out well.  We always have one in our pantry for last minute guests, bake sales, or other gotta have a cupcake occasion.  The cupcakes themselves are a deep chocolate flavor, not too sweet, and the peanut butter icing is yummy.  For the cupcakes, you need 2 eggs, milk and butter, and for the frosting mix, you need milk and butter.  Some of the other mixes I've tried, they just give you the frosting recipe, but in this box you have the actual frosting mix.  Each box makes 12 very nice sized cupcakes.  Enjoy!
