review/summary: Southern Blues is Phenomenal
review/text: I've only tried the Southern Blues and it was amazing on Ribs. I have to say this was THE best BBQ sauce I've ever had to date. I wish Amazon starting selling this brand because it is very hard to find locally.

review/summary: Best BBQ sause ive ever had
review/text: This sauce has made my delicious marinated boneless chicken thighs the talk of my house hold. I swear by this company, if you love tart mustard taste this is where you want. But the key is that its NOT overwhelming. Its just the right amount of tart and sweetness. This sause is great for BBQ, Smoking, Charcoal, or baking. This is not a computer, this is a real life person.

review/summary: No noodles!!
review/text: I was extremely disappointed in this soup.  The box had the word "noodles" on it more than actual noodles inside.  Amazon was great to deal with.  I could not, however, find out how to contact the manufacturer to give them feedback.  Chicken fat water is not my idea of a good boxed soup.  Yuck!!

review/summary: Stale-oil flavor--won't buy these again
review/text: I really loathe having to write a 1-star review. However, I purchased a 6-pack of these crostini without ever having tried them before. Took one bite and couldn't take another. I don't know if it was this particular batch, or how it was stored in the warehouse. But the flavor I can only describe as rancid-oil... If you've ever tried to use olive oil way past the expiration date, and it has a stale taste and odor? It's how these crostini tasted.<br /><br />My boyfriend, who has a more forgiving palate and less wasteful tendencies than I do, tasted them and agreed. Not willing to deal with the effort of repackaging and shipping back to Amazon, tossed them in the backyard for birds and squirrels.<br /><br />Now, I have tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBLF9C">La Panzanella Rosemary Mini Croccantini, 6-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> from a local grocery store, and they are delish and addictive. Very happy to see Amazon offer these. They're on my Amazon list and looking forward to replenishing as soon as the store-bought are done!

We have a Destination Imagination team and a FIRST lego league team at our house and all the kids coming through our house are thrilled that we have these.  My children would not even let me consider giving these out for Halloween as it would take away from their stash...

I keep these stashed in my purse for those times when my kids are offered a hfcs sucker that they can't have. 'PING!' Voila, my hand appears with a sucker before my kids even realize a sucker was offered to them. Lifesaver. Sanity saver. Not to mention, these lollies are awesome.

review/text: Our family loves these!!!  My son is allergic to artificial colors so we always keep an eye out for good all-natural candy.  Buy in bulk because they keep forever.  I keep a couple in my purse just in case someone offers my son a regular sucker.  I always have an alternative on hand.  I wish doctor's offices would consider handing these out instead.  Also, I hand these out at Halloween instead of chemical-laden candy.  I wouldn't consider giving candy to other people's children that I wouldn't give to my own.

These being all natural and organic, I feel a lot better giving them to him than the other type that are made of artificial who knows what. I can take the DumDum pop some innocent postal or bank worker gives him and make a quick switcheroo for the better YummyEarth one and everybody is happy. These taste fantastic as well, I myself love the Mango Tango flavor :) They are a little pricey when compared to "regular" brands but well worth it to me.

So your probably thinking so what so great for me this candy doesnt leave this gross ofter taste and film that regular candy does and doesnt mess with my stomach.

review/summary: Very tasty organic treats for the kids
review/text: I buy these lollipops for my kids, and they really like them, especially the grape and strawberry. I actually like these better than regular lollipops, since the fruit flavors are real - they don't have that "chemical" taste. Some of my kids are sensitive to artificial colors and flavors, so it's great to have these for holidays and occasional treats for the family.<br /><br />As others have noted, the distribution of flavors tends to be uneven, but since they are all good, this hasn't been a serious issue to us.<br /><br />The colors are bright and pretty, but they are not the neon colors you see with artificially-colored candies. The watermelon is a pretty light pink, the grape is purple, the cherry and strawberry are darker pinks, etc. If you're used to artificially-colored candies, the biggest surprise will be the sour apple, which is yellow.  Some flavors are two-toned; the mango is especially striking, part clear orange and part opaque light yellow.<br /><br />Of course, organic candy is always more expensive than the artificially-flavored stuff, but this large package is pretty cost-effective.  With the subscribe & save discount, these lollipops currently cost about a dime each, which I think is a good deal.

I no longer see any mention of the sweetener on the product details. If the sugar is not an issue for you, these are really great and I'd buy them again in a minute if I was certain they wouldn't damage my teeth. I have severe dry mouth from meds and lollipops are a mainstay for me.  Someone please let me know if these ARE sugar  free.  One could assume they are since my search criteria was sugar free lollipops,  :)

review/text: The suckers are quite good but the variety SUCKS. The container I received contains mostly watermelon and blueberry suckers. All of the suckers taste relatively good, but the blueberry is just NASTY. It's nice that they're organic and all, but I probably won't buy these again. So unless you have a strong love of watermelon and blueberry suckers, I'd steer clear of buying this. And not all of the flavors taste like the fruit they're supposed to. Strawberry tastes like some kind of strawberry syrup, mango tastes amazing, apple is okay-ish, watermelon is overly sweet and sour, and blueberry tastes like vomit. the other flavors are good.

Ginger ale and YummyEarth organic candies were the only two things that settled my stomach enough to eat a small meal.  The assorted bag was nice to switch it up depending on my taste that day.  After I delivered my baby girl, I still enjoyed these when I have a dry mouth or would like a little sweetness.  It was so nice to find a tasty organic hard candy, so much tastier than Preggo Pops!

review/summary: Great tasting & Excellent Variety
review/text: These are wonderful lollipops. I like a somewhat tart lollipop that doesn't have the taste of "flavoring" and these are wonderful. My 8-year old had one, without seeing the package and said, "Mom! This is the best lollipop I've ever tasted!" My younger child agreed. They then laughed that the container had a quote from a food critic that read something along the lines of, "The best lollipop I've ever tasted!" I got these on an Amazon Lightning Deal (only a tiny bit less than the subscribe & save amount) and they are well worth the cost in that price range. I like that they have no artifical colors and so forth and we all love the taste. Also, given so many comments about the poor variety/quantities of various flavors, I separated these by flavor to comment on that concern. All of the flavors were nearly identically represented (if not identically). The size of the lollipop is small-ish -- not a big Charm-pop size but bigger than a Dum-Dum (and far better tasting than both) -- just right. Someone else commented about them not being sweet enough and I found them just right -- tasted of the fruit they are supposed to represent and sweet enough to be candy. Perfect!

I was so happy to find out the I would be able to send these lollipops in for special holiday treats.  Unless something has changed at the factory and before taking my word for it though, I would suggest contacting the company to make 100% sure before sending into school or giving to someone with dietary restrictions.<br /><br />And why not buy a huge container of lollipops?!  They will last forever, even if you can't imagine eating more than one a day!

review/summary: Great Lollipops
review/text: I bought these for my 2 nieces - one is 3 the other is 6. They love lollipops. These are probably the most healthy lollipops you can buy. They are 100% all natural - nothing is artificial in them. I didn't want to buy them something with a lot of added sugar - which these don't have. What's also great about these lollipops is there are a lot of flavors to choose from. My nieces love the variety and love the taste. And since this was a big container and thus there were lots of lollipops I took some for myself and I love the taste as well. There isn't a flavor I don't like.

review/summary: Outstanding suckers we always have on hand
review/text: We always have the YummyEarth Organic Lollipops on hand and order them in the 5 pound bags.  I adore them, always carry them in my bag, and enjoy sharing them.  Kids loved these for Halloween, too!  I had handed these out to my Dad's doctor's office staff when I was visiting a couple months ago and they all went crazy over these lollipops.  Since that time, Dad been bringing some from his large bag to the office every week or so.  When he asked for more this weekend I was surprised because his Subscribe and Save delivery wasn't scheduled for some time.  Turns out he wanted to get more for the doctor's office for the holidays.  I came up with a great solution -- order this 30 ounce container for the office.  Everyone is happy and the container can be refilled from the 5 pound bag!<br /><br />Every flavor is delicious and a little on the tart side.  They are not exceptionally sweet, just hit the spot.  Several fit into even the smallest bag for easy retrieval and they are great conversation starters if you've given one to an individual who has never tasted one.  I personally eat very little candy, but I enjoy these immensely.

It is hilarious. She loves these! They have great flavors and even better, a great texture.<br /><br />The only downside was, like other reviewers noted, the assortment is...well, sucky. We got 3 of one flavor and 30+ of the sour flavor (which no one really likes).

review/summary: LOVE it!  They did a great job on the assortment
review/text: We got our suckers today!  Hooray!<br />Of course, almost everyone loves Yummy Earth lollies.<br />I won't bother with reviews on the flavors, because they are fantastic.<br />These suckers are not tooth-curlingly sweet, but very pleasant, very fruity<br />and definitely worth the wait.<br /><br />Our previous purchases have been a very uneven assortment, like so many others have mentioned.<br />We'd get an abundance of sour apple and grape, but very few (if any) blueberry or mango tango.<br /><br />I'd never ordered the counter container before, as we do not have a retail location.<br />I do use these in my small e-commerce business as customer thank-you's. So, decided to give it<br />a try so I didn't have to keep slapping my husband's hand for taking my customer's suckers.<br /><br />I read that Yummy Earth was working on a better package for Amazon customers, and I think they<br />made it.  Now, for date references, I ordered in Oct 2010. This assortment was more than fair,<br />with truly a very decent distribution of flavors. We even had a decent count on our<br />personal favorites, the mango! Thank you Yummy Earth, for working so hard to get this assortment<br />package more evenly distributed for your customers!<br /><br />Now, if they'd only tuck a chili lime in there too, we'd be over the top! Ha! (We still want to try<br />that flavor, but no one in our area carries them. I didn't want to get a whole package in case we<br />didn't care for them.)<br /><br />So, hats off to Yummy Earth for a great product. The suckers all arrived intact, nothing broken.<br />Amazon packaged them very well, and we will definitely be reordering from here!

review/summary: The only candy my child eats
review/text: We discovered YummyEarth at Publix.  I am a mother of two and slowly transitioning our family to traditional, organic foods.  I read labels on everything.  My 3 yr old loves gummy bears and lollipops.  When I saw YummyEarth, I had to try them. Reasonably priced, organic ingredients, no artificial anything...what's not to love.  AND THEY TASTE AMAZING!  I bought this large tub of lollipops to hopefully last a while, but the whole family loves them, I can't imagine they'll last long.  I highly recommend this brand, not only for the taste, but for this company's mission.  I believe in supporting responsible, sustainable companies who really are looking out for my kids and not just for their bottom line.

review/summary: What a Great Lollipop for all ages
review/text: I have purchased this product a couple times now and I think they are great. Normally I do not care for the fake taste of may lollipop brands but this one I really enjoy. I also keep them in my candy dish at work. At first people were hesistant to try them (they were not familiar with the brand), but the ones that have always come back looking for more. They have also figured out which ones are the best flavors and which ones are rare. When I refill the dish it is a race for the Mango and Sour Apple flavors (both which I quite enjoy).

review/text: My little 22 month old girl loves them to.  I personally put them in the refrigerator which makes them taste even better (like healthy koolaid on a stick).  I normally hate the lollipops you get from the bank.  I find these better tasting then the round ball types at the store as well.  I'm not a health fanatic either, just bought them for my kid because me and wife agreed to not give her unhealthy candies.<br /><br />Amazon as usual, easy returns if you need or even want to 100% free, fast shipping, cheapest prices (only shady fake scam websites usually have lower), the new and dare say much better newegg XD.<br /><br />Side Note:  Check out [...], they post deals for amazon all the time ^_^.

review/text: These lollypops are perfect except that sometimes you get an uneven distribution of flavors.  Mango Tango and Apple are my favorites but there always seems to be an abundance of Pomegranate and Cherry flavors in the container, my least favorite.  There are never any broken ones and I think I have only gotten one lollypop that was missing a wrapper.  They are a great price for how many you get.

review/summary: Great! Sweet treat.
review/text: Let me say that my assortment was nearly even, just a tad low on the Blueberry and Cherry. It's an assortment so you get what you get.<br /><br />I will say these pops are really sweet compared to other pops Ive had over the years. They also have an ever so slight hint sour/bitterness (from the cane juice I assume). The Rice or Tapioca syrup they use rather than HFCS make these pops taste crisper, they aren't semi soft (hard and fresh) and have less slimey / gooey in the mouth feel. The flavors are all crisp and not funky like Jolly Ranchers but more like the actual fruit.<br /><br />I'm not big into organic products but dabble from time to time to see what new tastes I can discover and this was a welcome discovery. When I run out I'll be stocking up again.

review/text: This container has lasted us almost a year & I have to say, it is one of the best things I have ever purchased on Amazon (and as an Amazon Prime member, I purchase a LOT!)  My 2 young daughters absolutely love these things, and while I am a pretty anti-candy mom in general, it is nice to have a special treat to use when desperate times call for desperate measures (such as getting my 4 year old to sit still while I brush her long curly hair or getting my one year old to sit quietly during church.)  And as an adult, I think they're pretty tasty myself!  (Especially the apple ones!)  We will definitely be purchasing them again.  And again!

review/summary: Good
review/text: My daughter loves these! Her favorites are the grape and cherry flavors, however I was disappointed with the watermelon and strawberry. I was expecting a little more flavor...it just seemed to be lacking something...however I feel good giving these to my daughter and for that alone I would rate this a four out of five.

review/summary: Yummy suckers!!!!!!!
review/text: My daughter never had a sucker before trying these suckers and she loves them even though she can't figure out to hold the stick and not the sucker itself(ha ha)! I tried one yesterday and you can't tell that they are organic ones. The only bad thing is it is abit pricey for me to buy her all the time, but it will take her a good while to eat them all.

review/summary: God's lollypop...
review/text: These are truly God's lollipops - the most amazing things I've ever tasted.  I'm trying to quit smoking, so they satisfy that hand to mouth behavioral habit at home, in the car, and at work.  And I smell like fruit instead of smoke!  Fabulous!  I think I've traded one addiction for another, but far less guilt associated with this one than the other. Healthy on top of it - amazing!  And I'd rather pass this habit on to my kids than the smoking any day.  So my headstone will read "He died of lollipops instead of lung cancer."  Not a bad trade...

review/text: These pops are great, as others have said. Unfortunately, although I know the manufacturer's post refers to a change in the 500-count bags, I had held out hope that there'd be an even number of flavors in this container. Nope. More than three-quarters... is Strawberry Smash. I hope this is something that gets fixed soon. I locked in a great price, so, for now, I will keep these lollipops on my "subscribe & ship" list. :o) Thanks, YummyEarth!

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: Completely changed my lifestyle 7 months ago to eating healthy and exercising, but really missed having some form of candy to have every once in awhile. These suckers definitely help get me through the sugar cravings and with 3 only having 70 calories, no high fructose corn syrup, and organic, I do not feel guilty at all sucking on these. Can't wait to put one of these containers in my dorm in the fall for some extra foot traffic.<br /><br />The suckers themselves are great. Really intense flavors that actually taste like the fruits and not pure sugar. Box, packaging, and sucker sticks feel high quality also.<br /><br />Only con I have about these is it would be nice to have an even assortment of the flavors. This is the breakdown for my first order:<br /><br />32 (21%) Sour Apple<br />29 (19%) Googly Grape<br />24 (16%) Strawberry Smash<br />23 (15%) Wet Face Watermelon<br />18 (12%) Tooberry Blueberry<br />10 (6%)  Pomegranate Pucker<br />10 (6%)  Very Cherry<br />8  (5%)  Mango Tango<br /><br />Total of 154 suckers so I received 4 extra!

review/text: These lollipops are very yummy. It was a great purchase. They are the perfect size and all the flavors are wonderful and so fruity. There was a good selection of all the flavors. Easy to throw a few in my purse for the kids because they are all individually wrapped. Even the adults in my house enjoyed these lollipops.<br /><br />I was so impressed I order the 5-lb bag with vitamin c thinking the added vitamin c would be a nice addition. They were not, the lollipops with the vitamin c are lousy, they lacked flavor, don't buy those. I am leaving my feedback for them next.<br /><br />Buy these organic lollipops - the plain simple YummyEarth organic lollipops. They are delicious and your kids will love them!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I bought these to keep in my office as a low calorie treat to grab when I NEEDED to eat something during the day. They are sweet and flavorful, and... thank goodness... organic! Really satisfies my craving for sugar. I think they taste exactly like I would expect a lollipop to taste... some of the flavors included are different/better than traditional lollipops (pomegranate, mango), and some taste just as good as the classics (grape, cherry) except better because they are not full of corn syrup and dyes and crap. I generally think organic things taste better but I don't think anyone would guess outright that these are organic based on the taste. They just taste like yummy candy! I noticed another comment about flavor distribution... the container I got was pretty evenly distributed across the flavors, except did not include ANY blueberry. Not that big a deal, but it is listed on the side as a flavor and is just not there. I hope this huge container lasts a long, long time, but when it runs out I'll definitely be ordering more.

review/summary: I have say they are bomb!
review/text: They make my goats go yummy yum when they lick it up. Yeah I sort those people who give candy to goats. but I did give some to my sister and my nieces to keep it all quiet. Lollipops...are all good with flavor I not sure about mango tango? but I like watermelon, and apple one but the others I long since hated chemical sort their is no dye to tongue which awesome I have say!. They don't hurt the tongue thank you for that. I can't eat sees for very long because its like sucking on huge square so round lollipop is nice flat one which disappearing from market place.<br />My favorite of whole punch is: Pomegranate Pucker I thought at first it going to taste all bitter or punchy but it was okay. Only one you have worry about is strawberry one which has too much flavor kick to it. tastes like organic strawberry ripe and I had to drink some water fast because that almost killed me. I like tasting candy since here where I live candy you want to buy you have head to Monterey, CA to wholesale candy shops.

review/text: These lollipops are awesome - they taste good and I feel so much better about letting my kids have these.  [I like them too!]<br /><br />What I found frustrating is that over half the container was only one flavor "pomegranite pucker", which is so sour that most of my kids won't eat them.  [I like them so those became "my" lollipops - which isn't what I had in mind when I bought this giant container].  I wish the distribution of flavors had been more equal because my kids loved the other flavors.

review/text: UPDATED 09-02-10 - We hear you loud and clear, amazon lolly lovers!!! We have changed to an almost even assortment of flavors per 5lb bulk bag and Counter Bin EXCLUSIVELY FOR AMAZON so make sure you are buying from Amazon directly (it will say "Ships from and sold by Amazon" under IN STOCK).  Sorry, the assortment is still random when buying this item via a 3rd party, such as DAB Nutrition "fulfilled by Amazon". Please note that the assortment is ALMOST even as compared to a completely random flavor assortment. Your feedback drives this company from ingredient requests and allergy needs to flavor requests to flavor ratios. We appreciate your feedback and hope that you know that we are listening. I am truly sorry for posting this note here with a 5 star review since I do not want anyone to think that we are trying to mislead anyone with a "fake" product review, but I could not really figure out any other way to communicate this to our Amazon friends. Thank you again for your wonderful reviews!

review/summary: These are absolutely delightful.  MMMMMmmmm!  ^.^ -- Worth every penny!!
review/text: These have become my absolute favorite candy, second only to chocolate!  I took a few handfuls to share at work today and all of my coworkers loved them too.<br /><br />The first positive thing I noticed about these after they arrived is that the serving size is * 3 * lollies, not just * 1 * -- not that I'm advocating overconsumption of candy, but if you have kids it's good to know that they can eat 3 of these without even getting close to a hundred calories!<br /><br />The Pomegranate and Berry flavors are traditional "red" flavor, only without the disgusting quality that most regular "red" lollies have of being made out of sugar and synthetic dyes.  Mouth-watering!<br /><br />The Lemon flavor is VERY lemony -- so much so that it tastes like you're chewing and sucking on a real lemon, lemon peel included.  At times it can be a little overpowering, but if you love real lemon flavor you'll love this.<br /><br />The Orange flavor is a typical orange flavor but pleasantly so.<br /><br />The Watermelon is very similar to the Jolly Rancher ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8GWR2">Jolly Rancher Hard Candies, Assorted Flavors, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> ) sort of Watermelon, but much, much tastier, with a very clean finish.  It is very much like licking a real slice of watermelon.<br /><br />The package I received also included a mango flavor, much to my surprise!  This, also, is fantastic.<br /><br />Overall I HIGHLY recommend these.  They are well worth the price, the package is HUGE, the quality is excellent, and they're natural and organic to boot!

review/text: If you have kids sensitive to food colorings or are just trying to avoid artificial ingredients, these are great treats to have.  My children have only recently made the adjustment from commercial, artificially flavored and colored candies.  So, they are picky about organic treats.  These lollipops have passed the test with my eight children.  Their quality control seems to be pretty good (something I don't always see with organic foods), and the flavors and colors are really nice (not boring or tasteless).  I keep these on hand to trade for candies others give them that they are not able to eat (due to sensitivities with food coloring).

review/summary: Yummy Lollipops, But Not Much of an Assortment...
review/text: I bought these lollipops earlier in the year for my very picky kids, and was really pleased with them. My older son especially liked the cherry flavor. Recently, they went on sale and I purchased them once again. My kids were so excited to get their favorite suckers in the mail!<br /><br />My son wanted me to separate out the cherry lollipops for him, so I started to sort the candy by flavor. To my dismay, only a few were cherry (10/157 in canister #1, 6/155 in canister #2). The majority of the lollipops were watermelon (61/157 in canister #1 and 47/155 in canister #2). Unfortunately, this is the one flavor that nobody in my family likes.<br /><br />By my calculations, with 8 flavors in a 150 item canister, there should be approximately 19 (about 12%) of each flavor. I understand that these candies are probably packed mechanically, so the numbers will not be exact. However, one of the canisters was 39% watermelon flavor, which to me is not acceptable.<br /><br />The three star rating is for the uneven flavor assortment. The flavor I give five stars.

review/summary: Very tasty, pretty even distribution of flavors
review/text: So I noticed the gripes in others' reviews about there not being enough of certain flavors, and the response from the company about working on a fix, so I thought I'd go through and count the tub I received today to see how they were coming along.<br /><br />Before I get to that, though, I should note that the tub was significantly cracked when I received it today, and there were a few loose and smashed suckers inside - but not a ton, and no more than can be expected of this sort of thing.  Also, by the time I was done with the tally below, any irritation I might have felt was completely gone because there were extra suckers anyway, and more than enough to make up for the ones that were in pieces and loose.<br /><br />Of the six flavors, here's how many I had of each:<br /><br />WET-FACE WATERMELON = 18<br />TOOBERRY BLUEBERRY = 17<br />SOUR APPLE TART = 22<br />POMEGRANATE PUCKER = 16<br />MANGO TANGO = 25<br />STRAWBERRY SMASH = 16<br />VERY VERY CHERRY = 20<br />GOOGLY GRAPE = 21<br /><br />As you can see, they're pretty even, or about the same distribution you'd expect in a bag of Skittles or M&Ms.  Certainly, plenty of each!  I haven't tasted them all (it's late and I have to go to bed), but I did eat all of the little pieces at the bottom, because I'm greedy like that, and they were all very good! :)<br /><br />I should also mention that I sent these several months ago to a sick friend in another state without having had them myself, first, but she absolutely loved them and gives them to her students in class when they're especially good (which is rare, because they're in college).<br /><br />Hope this review helped!
