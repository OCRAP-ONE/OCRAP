review/summary: Well worth buying the biggest for your large breed dog!
review/text: Kept my 9 month old Golden Retriever intimidated for 3 days trying to figure out how to handle this massive chew.  After one week, he has chewed (maybe) 10% of the rawhide bone.  I've purchased the typical rawhide chews only to see my money devoured in a day. This large, heavy rawhide chew keeps my Golden entertained for hours every day and is still going.  Would highly recommend for your large breed dog who likes to chew, and chew, and chew.

review/text: I ordered the 22 to 24 inch bone for my dog. It arrived quickly and was more like 36 to 40 inches which was nice. The dog really liked it. It costs a lot to ship so I would only go this route if you cant go to a store. (I am in Iraq) The company had great fast service, if they sell other things that ship cheaper than a 4 foot bone I will use them again.

review/summary: Flaky and poor qualtiy large dog bones
review/text: I ordered these as I have ordered from Amazon 24 inch dog bones. These arrived and appeared to be the same however, definately were not. These came apart in little pieces and broke like potato chips. One of the primary reasons to order these bones is so they dont come apart in little pieces. They were paper thin amd broke apart in to smaller pieces way to easily.. These were definately a cheap poor imitation of the ones I recived before.. I will throw away the remaining 3 to avoid further probelms with my dog chocking on the small pieces..... Stay away from this seller.......

review/text: I picked this up for just under $3 for one bottle at our local Winco supermarket. This product has some serious balls to it! Nice and spicy!! It's fairly similar to Trader Joes All Natural BBQ sauce. This Moore's sauce has a slightly thinner consistency though. I'm giving this 5 stars. Very nice smoke/heat combo and exactly what I want in a good BBQ sauce. If you are looking for a real BBQ sauce w/ a very flavorful taste w/ plenty of punch, heat and spice I'd  highly recommend this. This isn't your watered down and boring Bull's-Eye or KC Masterpiece. This is the real deal!

review/text: I ordered a cake-of-the-month for my dad and stepmom on the opposite coast on December 15. As of January 5, they still did not receive the card noticing them of the gift. When I called flying noodle, they gave me the brush off, saying that they could resend a notice to me (not doing me any good being 3000 miles away) or could resend them the card for a $5 fee. I told them that was unacceptable and had to actually ask for a manager to get anything straightened out. It almost doesn't matter how good the cakes or other products are if the company is unreliable.

review/text: I was given six months of cakes for Christmas this year.  I've gotten two of them and they were very good!  When I opened the first I was afraid I wasn't going to like it very much - pumpkin cake - but it was lovely, dense, moist and yummy.  The cakes travel well, keep nicely, and are not filled with artificial ingredients.  My first choice would have been six months of wedding cakes but, in light of the impracticality of that, these cakes have been surprisingly good.

review/summary: An orange bitters worthy of the Angostura name
review/text: I think it's fair to say that Angostura's ubiquitous aromatic bitters are the standard against which all other aromatic bitters are judged.  And with the release of Angostura's orange bitters, I believe that the company has created a new standard in that area as well.<br /><br />These bitters are zesty, sharp, and deliver a gigantic orange punch.  I am a huge fan of Regan's orange bitters, but where those go off into a deeper, spicier direction, Angostura's offering stays laser focused on orange, orange, and more orange.  Brilliant.  I highly recommend these bitters for anyone who needs a bit more orange accent in your cocktails -- and really, who doesn't?

review/summary: A Dash of Brilliance from Angostura
review/text: Angostura has been a brand name well-known to my family for generations. As a child, I remember my grandfather and keeping a bottle around. These days, I always have one on hand and so do most of my friends. Recently my local grocery store stopped carrying Angostura regularly so I looked online for it (as almost everything is available online these days) and much to my surprise it was available in original and orange flavor!<br /><br />  I haven't yet tried any other brands or flavors of bitters, but I do know that I thoroughly enjoy Angostura orange bitters and will be buying another bottle. In fact, I may have been converted to orange. I find it versatile in that its great for cocktails, non-alcoholic mixers, and flavoring carbonated water such as club soda and seltzer. Like the original, the more you add, the more pronounced the flavor can be so the flavor can range from a delicate hint to bold.

review/summary: Not ready for prime time
review/text: I have been working my way back to classic cocktail recipes ever since reading David Wondrich's book Imbibe! on the great Professor Jerry Thomas and his cocktail recipes and techniques.  A wealth of information there and a beginning of a long journey to try to recreate the cocktail prior to the great disaster called Prohibition.  As a martini drinker, I naturally wanted to explore the tastes of the original drink so I began with orange bitters.  In my market there were no retailers who carried orange bitters, so I had to rely on the ever more expensive places that will ship the stuff to your door.  I started with Fee Brothers orange bitters and then tried the Peychaud version of Gary Regan's orange bitters (no. 6).  Finally about 3 months ago a local liquor and wine store chain started stocking the new Angostura orange bitters.  Thinking it would be easier and less expensive to support a local merchant and also wanting to try the bitters, I picked up a bottle.  I was a little taken aback when I saw the retail price, $11 versus $7 for Fee Brothers and $6 for Regan's.  I decided to try it anyway.<br /><br />Upon opening the bottle I realized that the bottle itself was orange colored and the internal contents were virtually colorless.  Having made many fruit and peel extractions for liqueurs, I was very suspicious.  Forging on I sniffed the aroma from the open bottle.  The first smell is definitely orange, with an underlying clove aroma and something cloying behind those aromas that does not seem to work well.  In the drink the orange flavor is good and the bitterness that is necessary in a quality bitter is apparent.  But it seems to me that it is quickly overwhelmed by something like a passion fruit flavor that definitely does not belong in a martini.  I would consider using this product in drinks that have some fruit juice and will experiment some with it. I think wit would compliment a splash of pineapple juice in a drink like the Cobalt, but I would not use it in a martini.

review/summary: When you can't find something in a store - go to Amazon
review/text: So maybe I live in a small town, Olympia, WA - I'm often frustrated by how poorly stocked our local retailers can be ... must not be very many people in Olympia interested in mixing CLASSIC cocktails (shaken in stainless, served up in stemmed crystal COCKTAIL glassware).  I could find the original Angostura Bitters at every retailer.  Couldn't find anything like the Angostura Orange Bitters.  In addition to the Angostura Orange Bitters ... Amazon.com has a fine selection of specialty products and accessories for the home bartender. I've become a big Amazon.com fan after hosting just a few cocktail parties.<br /><br />The Angostura Orange Bitters are excellent in mixed cocktails ... if your recipe calls for a dash, use a half, if for two use only one.  Angostura produces a robust product.  I read several taste test articles before deciding on the Angostura brand.  Hands down difficult to beat a true original.  Do visit the Angostura web site too!  I printed a file packed with mixology know how, tips on what to mix with what to achieve various flavors, and, certainly many uses for Angostura products.<br /><br />Cheers!

I was happy to know in advance because I saved my jar from the Maxwell house I bought previously in the store and just put it in that.  It seems stupid that they don't just tell you it's packaged in bags because for me, I really didn't mind because it saved me money.  Instead of being upfront, they list a disclaimer.  I am writing this review to confirm what the last reviewer said because I was grateful that I was warned in advance but I am giving a 3 star rating because it really didn't bother me.

review/summary: Strange bottles
review/text: The bottles I received with my order were much lighter weight plastic than any other Smart water I've ever purchased. It was difficult to even hold the full bottle without water squeezing out the top and splashing around. I don't know whether all Smart water has now changed to this packaging, but I don't like it. It made me wonder whether it was "fake" somehow.<br /><br />But at least I got a nice supply of the sipper tips!

review/text: Hot or cold I love this tea! I brew sun tea in the summer (8 tea bags in a gallon glass jar, outside for minimum 4 hours) and people who don't usually care for ice tea love this brewed method! In the winter it's a cuppa tea or two in the evening and no problems going right to sleep. Great tasting tea!

review/summary: only a hint of flavour
review/text: Been a fan of Stash teas, but I never ventured into the flavored teas. I am always affraid of the flavor taking over the tea part of it. This one I have to be honest had a hint of the Vanilla flavor. Sometimes I think I am only smeling it, and not tasting it. It is perfect, but that's just me. The one star taken out, is the decaf part of it. I think if they made it in regular it will give me more buzz :)

review/summary: Really good, for decaf
review/text: I'd received a sample of Stash's English Breakfast Decaf with a previous order from Stash's website, and I knew it was good (for decaf tea, which is always missing something -- I think it's the caffeine.)  The price on this multipack was so good, that I could give a couple boxes away (which I did, cause I can't go through that much decaf tea in a year) and still save money over buying it in the supermarket.

review/text: I personally like loose tea best or Tazo better than this, but I live in a town where loose tea is hard to come by and I am trying to cut down on caffeine, so this tea works for me.  It definitely has the typical english tea flavor, like you find at a national trust property or a museum's tea house.  Amazon definitely has the best deal right now.  Overall, I am happy with this tea and will purchase it again from Amazon.

review/summary: Great Decaf Tea
review/text: I have a tolerance problem with caffein and usually decaf tea is weak and flavorless, not this Stash decaf Chai.  You can brew it for a long time and it doesn't get bitter like some teas.  It is delicious. I add a couple splenda packets and some hot milk and I'm set.  It's very, very good.<br />Like some of the other reviewers, I have a hard time finding it at my local grocery stores. I go through a box a week so buying in bulk doesn't seem to be a big deal.<br />I find that it's good iced too.

It's definitely a lot stronger than the other two in taste.

review/summary: Not impressed by this tea
review/text: I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.

The caffiene-free Stash is a step above the rest for two reasons - better taste and no need to worry about drinking it several hours before bed time.  Best way to get the flavor from any bagged black tea is to microwave a cup of water for 2.5 minutes and immediately "throw" the tea in it from a distance.

I'm not sure who could like this tea.  A much better tea is Stash's Organic Black and Green Chai tea, or Green Chai tea by the same company.  At least try the sample pack before buying 120 bags of this.

It is supposed to be spicey, have a fairly strong flavor, and you are supposed to add sweetner and milk to it.  This VANILLA DECAF CHAI is fantastic!  My kids love it, my guests love it, and I love it!  Everytime I serve it, everyone wants to know where to get it and how I made it.  Even non-tea drinkers get hooked on it.  It is wonderful cold or hot, and has a lighter spice flavor than most Chai teas, but they added a touch of vanilla instead.  This tea really is one that you can enjoy everyday.  It really is worth a try.

review/summary: Elegant white tea AND raspberry . . . so very good!
review/text: After trying to find a green tea that I could actually drink and enjoy, I found white tea. It has all the health giving benefits of green tea -- maybe even more -- and it's so very enjoyable! Of all the white teas I have tried, this is my absolute favorite. The white tea is smooth: it has none of the bitterness or sharp taste of green tea, and the addition of raspberry is a brilliant touch. To enhance the raspberry flavor, try adding a little sweetener -- your choice. Drinking a cup of this tea is like giving yourself a present. Thanks Stash, you really do create world-class teas.<br /><br />P.S. Remember NOT to boil the water for this tea: it's far too delicate for boiling water. Instead, use water just under the boiling point and only brew for no more than 4 minutes -- it does make a difference.

It's no longer available in my local stores, so I'm getting here at a great bulk price. I add the recommended sugar and milk and it is wonderful!

review/summary: Excellent "dessert" tea!
review/text: This tea is so tasty!  I use 2 bags and make a 10 oz hot tea.  After it steeps, I pour it over ice and enjoy my favorite drink of iced tea.  This chocolate hazelnut is great.  It takes care of that chocolate urge in the afternoon.  I love it!

review/summary: Perfect Dessert Tea - Baby Bear
review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker and got tired of not having something to drink with a dessert. This tea is perfect with milk and sugar! I feel like a grown up when I drink it. Don't get me wrong I know I could just drink hot chocolate and I do but sometimes depending on what I have it with or when, hot chocolate is too sweet. Which feels hypocritical for me to say because that's how I like it, but only when it is the dessert. So this is my perfect medium. It's like a term I like to use, it's baby bear! We all know the story of Goldie Locks and the three bears. Well coffee is pappa bear's bed, too hard to get over the bitterness. Hot chocolate is mamma bear's bed, too soft or sweet for everyday. This tea is baby bear's bed, just right. Now I'm no Goldie Locks but I'd like to think of myself as that content when I drink this tea. Love it!

review/summary: Love It or Leave It!
review/text: From reading other reviews, it seems people either hate or love this tea with no in-between.  I happen to love it...am here to re-order.<br /><br />Last year this product disappeared from local stores so I reluctantly ordered this box of 6 ... good grief-so many! Surprisingly, barely a year has passed and I'm out (in spite of having an average of 4-6 other favorite boxes of tea open at any one time).<br /><br />As with most teas, the flavor definitely improves with a bit of milk or cream (my favorite) or honey (with the milk or instead of ...). Sometimes I brew two bags at once...my favorite: this vanilla nut with Trader Joe's Organic Mint Melange.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Great version of Chai tea
review/text: This is far and away my favorite Chai tea to drink.  It is meant to be served with some type of sweetener and milk (which it recommends on the box).  I prefer to standard Chai.  I have this sitting next to a box of Tazo Chai, and I am always grabbing a bag of the Stash Decaf Vanilla Chai.

review/summary: Smooth and delicious
review/text: I've been drinking Stash teas for some time now but usually stuck to their caffeinated versions.  Once I found out I was pregnant, I made the switch to decaf and was happy to find that Stash has a nice selection of flavored decaf black teas.  However, this tea in particular is a favorite.<br /><br />In order to really bring out the flavors, I would suggest adding some milk and a sweetener (I usually use honey and if I do use sugar, I use turbinado sugar).  This makes the tea very smooth and creamy, something close to a tea latte.  The flavor is nicely chocolaty with just the right touch of hazelnut, which I find to be overpowering in large quantities.  I often drink this tea as a dessert-like indulgence but it would also be good in the morning in place of a flavored coffee.

review/summary: Good, mild green
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker and so I was at a bit of a loss when I became pregnant.  I wanted to cut caffeinated tea out of my diet during the pregnancy but soon found that meant my choices were limited to herbals and a small handful of decaf black teas, which were mostly flavored.  One day I came across this one at the grocery store and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I've long enjoyed Stash teas for their quality, which is pretty incomparable.  I generally prefer loose teas to bagged but Stash is one of those rare teas whose flavor isn't compromised by the bag.  I found this to be the case with this particular tea.  It's not a very complex flavor, which is why I wouldn't give it a full five stars.  However, it is very mild and has a nice, subtle nutty flavor.  It's definitely a good tea for those who are new to greens as when it's brewed appropriately it has none of the bitterness or strong grassy flavor that can sometimes come through in greens.  It's an easy drinking tea and I sip it throughout the day, to the point where I drink around three oversized mugs of it a day.  In light of this, I now order it by the 6-pack from Amazon in order to have a continuous supply.

review/summary: Great tasting Tea
review/text: This is a great tasting Tea that is unfortunately no longer on the store shelves in my area.<br /><br />It tastes sort of like a creamy hot cocoa. So it's a great replacement if, like me you're lactose intolerant. It also comes in regular I believe for those who need their caffeine fix :)<br /><br />Also of note is that each tea bag is individually sealed in a foil package so the last bag is as fresh as the first. I've seen a lot of tea companies switch to loose bags and they get old quickly after you open the box. These are always fresh.

review/summary: chocolate hazelnut tea
review/text: The first time I tried it I was kind of dissapointed. It just tasted like chocolate flavored water. I brewed it a second time and got better results. You have to steep it till you get it kind of strong, add quite a bit of sugar and milk, and it is quite good, for a tea. I think that was the problem, I expected hot chocolate - you can't get hot chocolate from a tea. I would rather drink ovaltine, if I want something that tastes chocolatey. It does smell wonderful. I gave it four stars as a tea, and not especially as a hot chocolate drink.

review/summary: Not bad for a decaf green
review/text: As someone who loves Japanese-style green tea, I highly recommend Stash's regular green tea. That's why I ordered their green decaf. However, this decaf does not have the same qualities as their regular green tea. The tea is not green in color -- it is more of a brownish color -- and it doesn't have that fresh "green" taste I enjoy with their caffeinated version.  Maybe green tea just doesn't keep its color or flavor when it is decaffeinated.  It's not too bad though, and I'll have to keep trying it to see if it grows on me.  I actually have not found the perfect green decaf yet.<br /><br />PS: After a long period of thinking I didn't like it, then going back to try it again, it may not be as bad as I first thought.  Most green decafs disappoint, so don't consider any green decafs as having true green tea flavor.  Stash's isn't objectionable like some, it's just bland.  It's a bit better than most green decafs, but not nearly as good as good Japanese caffeinated green tea.  For true green tea taste, try a Japanese Sencha or Macha caffeinated tea, like Kirkland's Signature Macha or Yamamotoyama teas.  I very much DISlike the Stash Organic Premium Decaf Green however, and urge you not to buy it. I have a concern about the levels of fluoride in green teas (especially Chinese teas, so I've read), but I suppose if consumed in moderation, like everything else, the risks shouldn't be of great concern, and the benefits probably outweigh them.

review/summary: My cure for morning coffee
review/text: My doctor recently suggested (strongly) that I cut out my 3+ cups of coffee per day. Now mind you, I am a Starbucks drinker. I LOVE my coffee and I have for years. I told my doctor and myself that this was not possible. However, I re-thought and considering my health issues, I decided to take the plunge, so to speak. . . into the No-coffee, no caffeine pool. But what to substitute on those cold mornings??? I have enjoyed Stash Chai tea for a few years but it was always a treat for winter days when I was already over-coffeed. I tried many teas to see if anything satisfied to replace for my morning joe. Nothing, truly, Nothing satisfied my taste buds, my comfort buttons...my need for a stimulating aroma. Until. . . I went back to my STASH Chai. Decaf as it is, it satisfies all my taste and aroma needs and we are now 7 months out and I declare myself fully De-coffee'd. I no longer need that cup of jolt any longer and I am fully satisfied by my STASH decaf chai. I am amazed and delighted! I want to stock up on my tea, lest they stop making it! Heaven forbid! I get my STASH with the regular subscription monthly. Can't be without my STASH Decaf Chai!

This does not taste like vanilla or nut to me, it is kind of fruity and has a bad aftertaste.

review/text: All the ladies at my office LOVE this tea. I introduced a coworker to it and she convinced me to buy several boxes for the office. I just bought a box last Friday and today (Monday) it is half gone! The flavor is not super chocolatey, but has a delicate chocolate taste to it with creamy hazelnut notes. It's great with a splash of almond milk and a tiny bit of sugar. This and Mighty Leaf's chocolate mint truffle tea are my two favorite afternoon teas. When I'm craving something sweet, I just have a cup of this tea and it satisfies my sweet tooth and my chocolate cravings all at once. Again, if you're looking for a really chocolatey drink, this tea isn't anything like, for example, hot chocolate. It's just a hint of chocolatey and nutty flavor.
