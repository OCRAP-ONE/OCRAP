review/summary: Dead within a month
review/text: Originally I was very happy when I received this beautiful little tree ... unfortunately it seemed under-potted and root bound so it died within the first month.  I drew the root bound conclusion as I made one final attempt to save it by re-potting the tree into a bigger dish with new soil but the roots were already dark brown and just a tangled mess to deal with ... I have left the tree in the new soil and water it occasionally ... as of yet no signs of life have returned.

review/text: Not what I was expecting. I bought this tree a week ago for a welcoming home gift for my wife. When I received the tree in the mail, I was very disappointed with the size of the tree. The tree had one sprig of green about the size of a plum. The pot and the tree looked nothing like the picture. I had to run out to another bonsai tree store 2 hours away to fix this problem.

review/summary: nice little bonsai
review/text: I bought this tree and didn't know what to expect from the reviews. It arrived today in seemingly good health, no brown spots however a very small amount of dead foliage in the substrate which I promptly removed. Shipping was fast, 3 days from cali to pa and the tree was packed very nicely in such a way that it couldn't accidentally fall out of its pot. Mine looks to be about 6-7 inches tall, lots of little branches and nice green foliage, will probably have to restyle this spring however all in all I think this was a good purchase.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to start bonsai. Will be a welcome addition to my front porch. :)

review/text: I got this present for my boyfriend on christmas and when it got here, it looked like a little pine branch stuck in the dirt. The pot was not blue, but an ugly brownish grey and i thought it was incredibly ugly. A bonsai tree is a cool gift but i didn't want one that looked like a pine tree. It doesn't look as the picture does. Maybe it grows into that a few years down the road but so far it's still ugly lol i wouldn't reccomend it.

review/summary: Very nice, but does not look like picture
review/text: I've only had this for a few days and there are some dead spots but I expected that given the distance it was shipped.  The instruction sheet was poorly translated but gets the general idea across reasonably well.  It was very well packaged but came with a spider (not advertised) who was happy to be relocated outdoors.  The only qualm I have is that I was hoping for a tree in the style of the picture (a single straight trunk with several branches &ct.), but it actually looks almost exactly like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XY08PK">Bonsai Juniper Tree</a> in shape, while being also significantly sparser than pictured.  Basically it looks like a small branch in a pot, rather than a small TREE in a pot.  It is still pretty, but I feel like I could have stuck the end of a pine branch in a pot and had a very similar look.

review/summary: Very happy with this little bonsai tree.
review/text: Tree arrived very quickly and appears no worse for wear from it's travels. It looks exactly like the picture in the listing which was a pleasant surprise because some reviews said it was clumpy. The pot is very attractive and the rocks give it a very nice touch to the overall look. If I were to say anything negative it would only be that I think the description should have mentioned that the Juniper requires a cold winter dormant period to remain healthy. I live in South Florida and am very worried that this little guy may be doomed because of it. I should have done my homework before not after so I still gave it 5 stars. If anyone has any tips on how to keep this guy alive leave me a comment.

review/summary: Mostly hype
review/text: I love Lipton's Mixed Berry and Orange Passionfruit Jasmine green teas, so I was very excited to see these new flavors.  Not being able to decide which to try, I bought all three.  Couldn't wait to brew up a cup of Red Goji and Raspberry.  Noticed there wasn't a lot of fragrance when I opened the bag, but thought well maybe it'll release when brewed.  Blech!  What a disappointment!  The predominant flavor is strongly the bitterness of green tea.  Since then I have tried all three of these new "Superfruit" flavors and I am extremely disappointed in every one of them. The Purple Acai and Blueberry one has the most fragrant smelling teabag, but the results are just as disappointing. Despite all the hype and the pretty packaging, there is very little flavor to any of these except for the green tea flavor.  Looking for someone to give this stuff to, because I really won't drink it.  By the way, I drink a lot of tea and a lot of different kinds of black, green and herbal teas, and I do know Earl Grey from Irish Breakfast and rooibos from chamomile and yerba mate'.

review/summary: Enjoyable!
review/text: I bought the Red Goji Raspberry, Purple Acai Blueberry and White Mangosteen Peach teas to try out when they first came to the market. Out of the three, I enjoy Purple Acai Blueberry the best. I don't expect who knows what out of a bagged tea, so I can say that for its league, it's very enjoyable. One can smell green tea with a fruity background, it has a good color and a pleasant taste, and no artificial put-off what-so-ever (which for me is very important). Many green teas can be harsh, but not this one, it has achieved a delicate balance between a green tea flavor and a bit of fruitiness without being too "fruity", i.e. sweet, preserving the pleasant taste of green teas. I'm pleasantly surprised. However, this tea surely is NOT for people who enjoy strong artificially flavored teas, particularly all the colorful berry mixes out there.

I don't use it for more antioxidants than what is in the green tea, but for the light flavor. Now here comes the interesting bit. I bought some basil plants and they were sitting on the counter next to the pitcher where I was about to brew some of this tea...so I got inspired and put some basil leaves in when I brewed. The resulting tea was delicious. My favorite of the three is the raspberry/goji berry tea alone, and this one with the basil.

review/text: Lipton Green Tea bags with super fruit purple acai promised itself to be an antioxidant blockbuster but alas fails. Primarily because the antioxidant potency comes from the green tea alone. I was expecting a extract of Purple acai but it is only a flavor and not the real thing. Isn't that misleading advertising.....<br /><br />The tea is fairly okay as far as the taste goes and can be used as a hot and cold beverage. I drink it at work and put a bag in to my water bottle from which I sip all day. I purchased this because of the hype and also because I got it at a super low price of a dollar a pack.<br /><br />The taste is okay and one cannot really taste the bitterness of the greentea but the fragrance is predominantly of blueberries.

Even if acai helps you, the amount in this tea isn't very much in the long run.

review/text: The Lipton Green Tea Superfruit Purple Acai with Blueberry is one of my all time favorite teas. It has an excellent flavor, doesn't require much added sweetness, and has a pleasant smell as well. Some other reviews complained about the Green Tea bitterness, but I've never experienced this problem. (I'm thinking these other reviewers don't know the proper temperature or steep time for Green Tea which would explain their issues.) I drink several cups of tea daily, mostly green, but also do herbals, white, oolong, and black. I have brewed them at different temps and times, and have noticed first hand that it does make a difference in the flavor.<br />If brewed at the correct temp, and for the recommended steep time, you can't go wrong with this one.

review/text: I've tried both Purple Acai/blueberry and Goji/Raspberry.  Both are equally nice.  This is a light flavor tea, it is not strong like some of the black/green tea.  If you are looking for a strong tea, you will not like this.  When I drink this, I feel like I am in a sunny field and surrounded by flowers.  It makes me happy and instantly put me in a good mood (it's just me, it doesn't actually have the effect in the tea).  I first tried it through a FB free trial and I received 3 bags of blueberry/purple acai.  I then ordered the whole 6 pack from here on Amazon.  I wanted to try the Goji ones too so I went to Walmart and got a box, plus I have a $0.75 off coupon.  That's when I found out Walmart's price is actually a little cheaper (before the coupon) than here(I purchased the subscribed and saved).  It's not by much ($.15) but it's still cheaper.  I know I will just buy it from Walmart in the future.<br /><br />PS: I grew up drinking green tea (Chinese), I was afraid this would be like other fruity tea out there, but I was wrong.  This one has the great balance between the tea and the fruit note.  It's a very pleasant drink.  I like it!

Yes, but I've got no complaints since I usually drink stronger teas and use loose leaf teas.

review/summary: Tasty but weak
review/text: This tea tastes good, but it is not robust at all.  One bag will make a half-mug cup of tea OK, but no refills on the same bag, and if you top-fill a mug with water, the tea will be watery. I won't order it again.

review/summary: One of my favorite teas
review/text: I'm a big tea drinker and love all kinds especially funky flavors. Just opening the box I got a whiff of the scent and knew the flavor was going to be just as good. I read some complaints about no flavor and don't know why because its great for me. I let my tea steep for 5 minutes and press the tea bag against my cup a few times as well as dunk it to really get the flavor brewed. I remove it after 5 minutes though because tea's will get bitter if you steep it too long.<br /><br />I like to add a little honey and or pure agave to sweeten it up a little. Its a green tea base so it has a lighter flavor but its surely not weak. I really love the combination of the Acai and blueberry, although its more blueberry in my opinion. Lipton's new superfruit line is incredible and knowing me, i'll probably order one of each, next is the Black Current-Vanilla...yummm<br /><br />Update: I reviewed the Black Current Vanilla and this Acai Blueberry is way better the Black Current smells very odd (read my review on that)

review/summary: Drink it quickly!
review/text: I'm not a tea connoisseur, so please take my review from the impression of a "lay person".<br /><br />When I first opened the package and brewed a cup, I thought it was sort of weak, but acceptable--light accents of fruit without the tea overpowering it. As time went on, I remembered that tea can lose flavor if it's exposed to air. While the paper bags containing the teabags are a wonderfully eco-friendly decision, they don't do much to protect the tea from air.<br /><br />Compounded with the fact there's only 1.3g of tea per bag (compared to 1.9 - 2.0g in some of lipton's other products), this tea will probably only be enjoyable if you use 2 bags if you don't drink it all fast (and maybe even if you do).<br /><br />That being said, the flavor is quite nice, with neither the fruit nor the tea overpowering one another. I just think they should have used more tea per bag.<br /><br />One last word, there is absolutely no acai in this--it's only flavoring. The anti-oxidants come from the green tea itself, so don't buy it if you're only after the properties of acai.

review/summary: Great new flavored Green Tea
review/text: I enjoy green tea of different varieties, and typically drink the jasmine tea under the Kirkland Signature brand at Costco. Looking for something different, I was pleasantly surprised at the Acai Blueberry Lipton Green Tea. When the package came I boiled some water and went on to brew the tea. The scent is VERY aromatic, and the tea was great. Although it contains no sugar nor artificial sweeteners, the tea tastes sweet naturally (not like candy or juice, just a very delicate sweetness). I brewed some more to try it cold the next day, but I think it tastes better hot (brings out the flavor more).<br /><br />I think there's something wrong with the reviewer who gave it one star and couldn't tell the difference in flavor. Maybe he/she got bad batch, but it's the same tea as mine, that reviewer probably can't tell the difference between Earl Grey tea and English Breakfast tea.

review/summary: Without Aca&iacute;
review/text: Beside its weak taste in general, I notice that this tea does not contain any aca&iacute;. There is juice of pomegranate, cherry and blueberry but what's left of the aca&iacute; marketing is only "natural flavours". Well, it tastes a bit fruity and maybe the flavoniod content is more than the promise printed on the box.<br /><br />Conclusion: It is more than just drinking hot water but one really has to decide if the price is justified.

review/summary: Best beef jerky there is!
review/text: This is the best beef jerky there is hands down! I'm an avid beef jerky lover, and have tried many different flavored beef jerky in my lifetime, yet Pawnee Bill's triumphs all of them!  I had the fortunate chance of trying Pawnee Bill's Beef Jerky for the first time when I lived in Eastern, PA, the only place where I can find it if not online. Pawnee Bill's is more for the people who enjoy saltier beef jerky.  It's not "squishy" or "gamy" but more tough.  The  saltiness has varied a few times with bags I've gotten, but it is salty - which I love!  If you love beef jerky, definitely give Pawnee Bill's a chance.  I've ordered a few bags off here now since the shipping is fast, and this is the best price online.  The only con is that I can't pick it up at the local grocery store like in PA. I love love Pawnee Bill's  Beef Jerky!

review/text: Pawnee Bill's jerky is considered by me and my circle of compadre's as the best jerky on the planet.  We have collectively  tried dozens of other brands and although there are some good ones....Pawnee Bill's remains at the top of the list.  There is one drawback and it is simply the cost of it.  The price is the one thing prohibiting me from having a continuous stream of this jerky show up at my doorstep everytime I run out.  Don't waste time, money or energy on any other brands, I already did that for you.  Go with Pawnee Bill's.

review/summary: Pawnee Bill Beef Jerky
review/text: With beef jerky it's a matter of personal preference to taste, texture and saltiness and Pawnee Bill has always been my favorite whether paying $1 a piece from the store or gorging with reckless abandon from a fresh bag like this! The tough consistency makes you work to eat it, so you can't gobble it fast then feel guilty.  If you wear dentures, choose a softer brand.  Taste and texture are perfect....I just ignore my better judgment about the nitrites/sulfites/whatever and enjoy and share the ample amount for as long as it lasts as a special treat while I'm still able to afford the splurge!  It's good, go ahead....you know you want it!

review/summary: The best beef jerky ever!!!
review/text: This is by far hands down, the best beef jerky around.  I eat a ton of beef jerky, and have tried probably close to 50 or so brands.  This is my favorite.  If your into Slim Jims, beef sticks or some kind of beef nuggets claiming to be beef jerky...well then just keep it movin lil girl.  This is a man's jerky.  It's real strips of beef, cut and hung on a hook in a smoke house somewhere in PA.  Is it kind of tough?  Sure, sometimes it is.  Is it salty?  Most definitely!  Is it delicious?  Yer damn right it is.  I'm not some employee of Pawnee Bills...I'm just a guy living in Atlanta, that has known about this amazing stuff for almost 15 years.  Yeah I keep buying other kinds of jerky, only to be disappointed.  The only one that comes close to this is Wild Bill's jerky...it's close, but not quite Pawnee Bill.  Just try some already...seriously...it's great stuff!!!  Certainly don't eat it while drinking beer!!!  God no!  That would mean, that you will eat all of your jerky and have to order more, which leaves less jerky for me to order!

If you like Indian food and making it for yourself, this is a nice addition to you pantry.  I still have some left over, so maybe I'll try it as a dipping sauce next and update my review.

review/summary: First K-Cup coffee I loved.
review/text: A year ago, my dad received a Keurig for Christmas, and with it the K-Cup variety pack. I tried a couple coffee brands without milk and sugar, and this was the one that really caught my taste buds' attention. It's very mild, borderline light-bodied, with a subtle flavor and not too bitter. It doesn't taste like you're chewing on beans, but it's not watered down like some sub-standard brands you find in stores (I'm looking at you Folgers 10lbs jug of "ground").<br /><br />A few months later, a co-worker brought a Keurig to work and offered access to it. I purchased packs of Green Mountain Nantucket Blend the same day and enjoyed 48 cups of it, dreaming of the day I may have a Keurig at home. That has happened now, and I've got this on subscription.<br /><br />Strongly recommend if you are a fan of light-bodied coffee. One of the best K-Cups you'll find in that category.

review/text: since we got our Keurig,We have been trying different flavors and brands of coffee,tea,hot chocolate,and cider. Out of all the coffee brands I have to say that Green Mountain far surpasses all the other brands that we have tried. Great taste and not so expensive that it hurts the budget.

review/summary: the best coffee ever!
review/text: This coffee was in our package when we recieved our Keurig. I had never tried it before, in fact I had never heard of it before.  It was so good I never drink any of the other kinds that were sent with it. It was always Maxwell House or Folgers, even Starbucks, but now it is Green Mountain.

review/summary: Love Natucket Blend Coffee!
review/text: I have  a Keurig coffee maker and have tried lots of K-cups and different brands and roasts of coffee but the Natucket Blend is my FAVORITE.  The Nantucket blend is a smooth and rich coffee that is not too strong or too weak.  Anyone who owns a Keurig should try the Natucket Blend by Green Mountain.  They will realize it is the best!  The price is great on Amazon too!

review/summary: My new favorite
review/text: I received a box of Nantucket free with my coffee maker but it didn't sound like anything special so I put off trying it, but now it is my favorite!  It is slightly stronger than coffee people coffee shop but has a richer and more flavorful taste.  Not bitter at all, but if you like lighter roasts then you probably will not like this.  I think it tastes best using the 7-8 ounce setting.  This reminds of when I dine out and they have such good coffee but either they don't know or won't tell you what kind it is.  Love it!

review/summary: A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee...
review/text: When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors.  Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.  I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee.  We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least.  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee.  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried).  I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods.  Almost.  All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.  When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!

review/text: So far I've had no problems ordering this product and receiving it as promised. I am a Nantucket lover and occasionally will buy a specialty/seasonal flavor on the side.Green Mountain is extremely expensive at most local stores! I've been buying bulk online for years. (I'm a coffee-holic) I suggest buying/trying a sample at your local store. (some even will let you brew a free cup!) Then, you can decide where your taste takes you! Happy sipping!

review/text: This is a very good deal. The coffee goes without saying. A perfect cup every time.  I have had a Keurig for a few years now, and to me there is nothing out there that can touch it. A fabulous, fresh cup every time. I never go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks anymore.<br /><br />The offer is a good one. I bought 5 boxes of 24 for $10.95 each and shipping was free! I saw another review where the guy said this was "high" compared to prices locally. I have yet to find the same deal locally. Supermarkets rob you for 12 pods and Bed, Bath and Beyond gives you 16 or 18 for $9.99 at last check (and it could have gone up) as coffee has gone up. I also used to get the same coffee at the same price a couple of years ago at "CoffeeforLess.com. Their prices have increased dramatically recently. I don't see where there are any better values around online or locally.

review/text: Some people like a strong cup of coffee that kicks them in the mouth first thing in the morning, but I don't, so I tried one classified light roast, which was a little too weak for me. I tried Nantucket Blend, and it is perfect! It's not weak at all and had a really delicious flavor to it, what I think a good cup of coffee should taste like. It is so smooth, not a single negative thing about it except that now I go through it so quickly!<br />This is my favorite one so far, and has become my morning drink every day!<br />If you like coffee and are looking for a not too strong, not too weak blend give this a try!

review/summary: Delicious medium-roast blend with complex tones
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:30 Mins<br /><br /></span>The name belies an intoxicating medium-roast blend that fuses flavors from Central America, Indonesia and East Africa. The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands. Is it worth the additional price? Yes, but keep an eye out for sales.<br /><br />Added bonuses:<br />Nantucket Blend is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is Fair Trade Certified.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is organic.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here's my recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYUE6G">Green Mountain Coffee Lake & Lodge Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C4YIFE">Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>
