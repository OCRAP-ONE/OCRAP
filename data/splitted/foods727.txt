review/summary: Chicken Pot Pie my ar........!
review/text: When I think of Chicken Pot Pie I drool over the chicken and vegetables and pie crust along with the delicious gravy.  Now take all that away and add FAT noodles instead.  That is what is in this terrible soup.....just fat noodles.  It does have a nice flavor but I soon realized that, after not having a migraine in over a year, it was this soup that caused me to have a migraine for two days.  The large amount of 'yeast extract', in other words MSG, that is in it caused my migraine.  How can an ORGANIC soup have such an artificial chemical neurotoxin in it and still be considered organic?  I will donate the remaining cans to the food pantry and hope they like 'noodles' and MSG.  I will never purchase this soup nor this brand again but be my guest and give it a try.  I think you'll regret it though.

review/summary: Best canned soup ever!
review/text: This incredible soup is mostly made up of very large and very delicious noodles.  As far as the other ingredients go you have the chicken and the two main vegetables peas and carrots, which are the perfect complements to the rest of the soup.  The broth is what really holds everything together with a very tasty, creamy texture. Its the broth that makes the biggest resemblance to real chicken pot pie.  Even if the name does not make much sense with some of the ingredients its the taste that matters and it doesn't get much better than this.

review/summary: Looks & Tastes Great, but artificial flavor & color
review/text: We tried these because my husband loves Horehounds (they are an old home remedy for sore throat but also tasty and something we ate in childhood). The Horehound are all natural, nothing artificial so I ordered the Sassafras "assuming" the same would be true. My bad for not paying closer attention.<br /><br />As long as artificial ingredients don't cause negative reactions for you, these are a great little snack. They are hard candy, dusted with sugar, orange in color, with a light, fresh, kind of, sort of root beer flavor. It's a little hard to describe. I love these little devils even though I am allergic. sigh.<br /><br />Anyway, very good, light, unusual flavor that I would recommend.

review/summary: Best for Young Dogs
review/text: This is a high-quality food, but I think it's best for young, active dogs.  I bought it for my 11 year old mixed breed because he needs grain-free food for his itching.  It worked for that, and he loved the taste.  However, he's had some problems recently, and blood tests showed liver inflammation, as well as elevated cholesterol and very high triglycerides.  NONE of the problems were caused by TOTW, but it's extremely high in fat and protein, so it's exactly wrong as a maintenance diet for a dog like him.  Many older dogs have similar problems, so unless your older dog has had recent, comprehensive blood-testing, you may not want to put him/her on such a rich food.  My dog is improving on a low fat, moderate protein diet.  If I had a young dog getting plenty of exercise, a food with a minimum of 18% fat and 32% protein would probably be just fine.

review/summary: you owe it to your soulmate..
review/text: 5 star rated by a number of independent experts.  arrives as detailed every time.<br />my best friend/soulmate loves this kibble as his food AND as a treat.  he is a Weimeraner and his muscles have bulked up, his weight and definition have become awesome, his poop is as good as poop gets, his fur is much softer and smoother, his energy and playtime has become off the chain great.<br />no single food is best for every one of our family members.  I would guess that if you are already using a 4 or 5 star rated kibble and your soulmate is happy and healthy, there is prolly no need to change up.  there are many really good foods available!!  congrats to you in providing a healthy diet!!<br />however, if you have been duped into buying the crap foods that receive less than 4 stars (you will be amazed at how many HUGE names are rated a 1 star garbage - I will refrain from naming a couple of dozen sold everywhere including most sold by vets), I beg you to sample this awesome product!!  I have found this kibble to be merely twice as expensive as the cheapest garbage one can buy at the local Dollar General store.  the long-lasting benefits to my soulmate are worth at least 10 times that...<br />a massively recommended product from Amazon...

So, I went online to find a rating and comparison of the different dry dog food.  Call of the Wild is rated very high and since it was available locally (one of the important things to me) I decided to try it.  I have the pickiest dogs in the world and they love it!  I'll know in a few weeks if it will keep my older dogs from scratching (no grain) and keep my younger dogs at a good body weight. But, so far I am impressed.

review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

review/summary: Baird Approved!
review/text: I've had Baird now for a about 18 months. In the first stages of life I was feeding him Purina Pro Plan. He did just fine on the food, despite it not being what many consider "quality" pet food. I left him on this until he became an adult and switched him over to the adult Pro Plan, shredded blend chicken. About two months later, I noticed his back teeth were a sickly yellow; turns out that shredded chicken would stick to his teeth, requiring me to brush his teeth frequently. Finally had enough of that, I had done a TON of research on quality dog food and settled on either Canidae or Innova. Canidae is difficult to get in my area with regularity, and so I chose Innova, so that if I run low on food or run out, I can just run over to the local pet supply store and pick it up.<br /><br />After a few months on this food, and twice weekly brushing, I don't have to take Baird to have his teeth professionally cleaned, which is awesome. Another couple bonuses, thanks to their being less filler in this food than the Pro Plan shredded blend, is less... poop, and less frequent pooping. Yeah, not a fun topic to talk about, but it is a bonus side effect for sure. And also, his pooh is a lot more regular; not runny like it would be 2-3 times a week on the Pro Plan.<br /><br />Just be sure that if you CHANGE a dog to this food, CHECK THE FEEDING AMOUNTS compared to your old food. Innova has more calories per bit than most other dog foods and if you give your dog the same amount, you are likely overfeeding him. I've also found Baird put on some extra weight when I was feeding the Innova recommended amount, so I dropped him down a bit, he lost some weight and I figured out he needs 1.25 of a cup a day for his activity level and to maintain current weight.<br /><br />Also, if you are changing your dogs diet, do so gradually! If you switch cold turkey, many dogs will be bloated, have gas (dog farts? NO THANKS!), potentially throw up and have an upset stomach. Gradually changing over allows the dog's body to adjust. So if you want to change, either start when you have 1/4 bag of the old food or buy a small bag of the old food to switch the dog over within a 2 week period.<br /><br />Baird didn't have any allergy issues, so I can't comment on whether this fixed any food allergies.<br /><br />I would say he loves the taste, but... he's a dog; as long as it is food, he'll eat it!<br /><br />What many don't know is that Natura Pet Food, the company behind Innova, was purchased by Proctor and Gamble. This is why Innova is turning up in a lot more locations. One thing you need not be overly concerned about is a change in formulation of Innova as Natura isn't going to change their ingredients and so on as the quality of the food was the reason P&G bought Natura. Of course, this could change down the road, so I'm keeping my eyes and ears out, but after a year and a bit after the acquisition, the ingredients are the same quality (as best I can tell) and the formula is the same. What will next year bring? Hopefully the same formula. Oh, and according to Natura, they might change the formula, but only based on sound nutritional science, to make the food better for your pets, not because P&G says to change.

review/summary: great dog food
review/text: I started giving both my dogs Innova dog food about a month ago slowly mixing it in with thier old dog food.  My 2.5 year old border collie mix has had problems with food allergies since he was about a year old.  He would chew and lick his paws till they were raw and developed a rash on his stomach and in one of his 'armpits' that would not go away after trying a couple different kinds of food and numerous topical treatments.  After giving him Innova for just a month the rash on his stomach is nearly gone and he chews on his feet significantly less, and I suspect it will improve even more after he is no longer recieving any of the other kind of food.<br />It has also helped my 10 month old doberman mix with decreasing the amount of food I have to give him and the amount of poo as a result too.  He also seems to have less digestive upset and diarrhea.<br /><br />I did a lot of research to find the best dog food that I could get locally and that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg every time I buy a bag (although I only gave it four stars because the price is a little high, but not unmanageable).  Innova has quality ingredients with lots of meat and veggies and no filler, which makes me and my dogs very happy.

review/text: I am happy to read good reviews.  We bagan the gradual  switch last evening.  Cole our Great Dane Lab mix REALLY liked the INNOVA!  He kept peeking around the corner while I was in the laundry room where the food is kept in a snap shut box, both old and new separatly.  thought I should keep the door closed so he cant RAID the food which he hasn't tried since the food has been securly stored. AS SOON as I had my arns full of fresh laundry making my way uostairs to put away, he got into the laundry room and ate the INNOVA to his fill.  his belly looked as though he had swallowed a BASKET BALL!<br /><br />He seemed uncomfortble the rest of the night and had fruity dog Farts this morning. He has not thrown up and still waiting for poop probably after he eats a little or runs around but he has gone for small amounts of water frequently throuhout the night and this morning. He groand a bit last night and thid morning too but he's a talker normally anyway.<br /><br />Now he is barking and playing with his pound brother and sister, a Plott hound and an Antolian shepard mix, we will continue the switch for the week from Science Diet Precription JD(joint diet)and see how we do; may have to supplement for the lowered omega fish oils in the JD. The dogs have been VERY healthy on JD. We always have 4-6 big dogs form the pound. One just passed away. She was a tall Golden Lab with atypical addison disease; she lived to 16 years!<br /><br />Innova is less expensive and more accessable than precription food.  AND the wheat, corn and by prouductare not there so dounle plus! Hope we can find the same thrive as with<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JPD21Y">Adult Dry Dog Food Large Bite - 30 lbs - Bag</a> the precription food.

review/text: Wonderful oil. Some supermarket brands have a burnt smell/taste; not so with this one. La Tourangelle has everything you like about sesame oil with nothing you don't.<br /><br />Amazon's packaging of this oil is the worst of any item I've ever ordered in the last five years. I ordered 3 cans of sesame oil and 4 cans of grapeseed oil, and they were all in a box loose with 4 air packages which didn't nearly fill up the box. All cans arrived dented.<br /><br />The oil is great, the prices are good, and if you don't mind dented cans, go ahead and buy it. If you do not like deliberately mis-packaged items and dented cans, fughedaboudit.<br /><br />This would have been rated 5 stars were it not for the dented cans.

review/summary: Great Oil, Great Price, but Amazon needs to learn how to package it!!!
review/text: This is really a delicious oil in the Asian toasted sesame oil vein.  Very flavorful and the price is really outstanding if you use a lot of it and can stand having to buy 3 at a time.  HOWEVER, Amazon needs to learn how to package these things.  They just threw 3 loose cans in a box and sent it to me!  Needless to say the cans are EXTREMELY dented!!!  Minimally, they should have put tape around the 3 cans to hold them together (and keep them from bashing into each other).  They would have probably still been dented, but most of the damage came from them crashing into each other in shipment.  Ideally, they could tape them together and roll them in bubble wrap, but that may be too much to ask.  When I was a kid, we used to get 50% off of dented cans at the grocery store - how about it Amazon?

review/summary: All Japanese Sesame Oil is NOT the same!
review/text: I tried this for the first time because my favorite sesame oil (Kadoya) wasn't available.  I figured all Japanese sesame oils are more or less the same. I was dead wrong.<br /><br />What a disappointment!  This oil is either watered-down or not processed properly.  I will never order it again, unless there is a world wide shortage of sesame oil.<br /><br />Stick with Kadoya 56 oz if you can get it. It is rich in flavor and the real thing.

review/summary: Instant Gourmet! Wonderful Oil - Fantastic flavor, health benefits galore!
review/text: Become an instant gourmet with these delightful oils! Okay, perhaps you won't be an overnight sensation but your culinary experiments are sure to take a step in the right direction thanks to these fantastic oils by La Tourangelle.<br /><br />Proper oils are essential for flavor, health and proper food preparation technique but our local grocery stores leaves a lot to be desired in terms of selection. Finding a half decent olive oil was a chore so you can imagine the difficulty associated with more obscure oils.<br /><br />After reading the health benefits associated with Grape seed oil, I first ordered a three pack of that as well as the sesame. Both quickly became household favorites. The sesame has a slight sweet hint that my spouse finds perfect for apparently everything. He now uses it exclusively for organic popcorn (odd but it really tastes terrific) to salads and homemade bread. It's light with a slight sweetness. Absolutely delicious at a very competitive price. Wonderful addition to a kitchen searching for something other than olive oil.<br /><br />We've also tried the Grape, Sesame, Walnut and Almond...to date, have been very pleased with all of them. Wonderful selection.

review/summary: 3 bottles lasted me more than a year
review/text: I keep this oil in the refrigerator as instructed.  I use this oil more frequently than I did when I was buying the difficult to recycle Kadoya brand from the local store but I find that I am getting more for my money.  I recommend buying this 3 pack.  The oil is less intense and lighter than the traditional dark kadoya which took some getting used to for me as I was afraid I was losing flavor but I have made delicious noodle soups with this product so I am no longer concerned.<br /><br />This oil originates from somewhere else on the planet.  I am not sure how closely La Tourangelle polices the quality of the oil.<br /><br />This product was one dollar cheaper last year.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: So good I signed up for regular delivery order. Price can't be matched at stores (nor can I find it). It delivered very fast (4 days, even with holiday week). Packaged up in three pack with bubble wrap around center can and then again around all three and sealed in box with air pillows. If a can had broke it wouldn't have ruined much and it would been hard to do in first place. I was impressed, and that's not easy to do.<br />I love this oil on every thing, but my favorite is jasmine rice cooked with some chicken bullion and parsley (or your fave spice). I add a tsp or so while it's cooking and then drizzle some more on again after it's done. I love stir frying in this oil as well, even the meats! Can't stop eating ...

review/summary: THE BEST! Outstanding!
review/text: We purchased same brand sesame oil previously that was not 'toasted'. This is better. Just the aroma is amazing. We use it in all of our Asian cooking, and, we brush it on veggies before grilling. Highly recommend toasted sesame oil, and especially recommend this brand - better than what's available in local groceries in terms of quality and price. And 3 tins is not too much for our family of 3.

review/summary: Good Oil, arrived damaged, twice!
review/text: These oils are lighter in flavor than their descritions.  But still a good value. My Biggest problem was the cans were all damaged, not by shipping but by the individual that packaged them.  I ordered 5 of the different flavors, each oil has 3 or 4 cans with the offer.  In the first shippment 9 cans were crushed, not dented.  The 2nd order had 11 cans damaged.  My intent was to give these away as gifts; of course in that condition I was not able to!  If you want these oils for personal use by all means order them.

review/summary: Excellent flavor, in stay-fresh cans
review/text: I've purchased La Tourangelle Toasted Sesame Oil (3 pack) twice, and have been very happy with it both times.  The flavor of the oil is wonderful - it has a delicate sesame flavor that compliments Asian food.  Some sesame oils have an overly-toasted flavor that can overpower the food, but this one is just right.  What I like best about this product is the metal container it comes in.  Each 16.9 ounce container is sealed for freshness, and will stay fresh for several years in the pantry.  The lid is designed so it doesn't dribble when pouring the oil, and the screw-on lid keeps the contents of an opened bottle safe from air which can cause it to go rancid.<br /><br />This oil is expensive at over $8 per bottle, but when a recipe only calls for a few tablespoons it lasts a long time.  With free Amazon Super Saver Shipping, this is a good deal.

It has a light, clean toasted sesame taste, which makes a great salad dressing ingredient.  Yum.  No quibbles with the packaging, either.

review/summary: Tastes toasted not burned
review/text: My favorite for "toasted" flavor.  When I ran out of this brand recently,  a friend gave me some from an Asian market, supposedly the REAL stuff.  To me, the flavor was almost "burnt".  Guess some people like it that way - sort of what you get used to becomes the standard for you.  I personally like a lighter flavor.<br />I use it to stirfry and make a ginger-sesame salad dressing which gets raves.<br />It's hard to find this particular oil on a regular basis around my town, so Amazon is quite convenient for keeping it in stock in my pantry

review/text: My Sesame oil arrived in good condition - one can was dented, but I don't care what the can looks like as long as there isn't oil everywhere.  I put my sesame oil out in a different container, so maybe a dented can means less to me than to others.<br /><br />I cook a lot and in addition to many other recipes, I chiefly use this oil in one of my bread recipes - the sesame oil in the dough and then roll the dough in the seeds before baking.  It's my husband's favorite.<br /><br />This is extremely nice oil with a beautiful flavor.

It appears someone was paying attention to the feedback, because my cans were shrink-wrapped together to prevent jostling during shipping.  I can purchase this product locally, and I have, but choose Amazon because their website is so easy to navigate (and secure), their shipping program is awesome, and their prices are very competitive.

review/summary: Don't waste this lovely oil in a cooked dish
review/text: The fragrance of this Japanese toasted sesame oil is as wonderful as its taste.  If you've gotten a bottle that smells "off", I can say with certainty that isn't the way it should be.  This oil has a beautiful color and a clean, perfectly toasted taste.  I use it on salads mostly, since I think its wonderful taste gets somewhat lost in a cooked dish.  I have a wonderful recipe for carrot coins and raisins and this oil works exceptionally well with it.  This is not the heavy, thick and dark sesame oil that you find in small bottles in grocery stores.  The bottle is actually metal and is sealed under the screw top by a plastic cover with a pull-off ring.  You should store it in the frig and take it out to warm to room temperature before using.  It will stay fresher, longer.  I also use<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00886KIJG">Japanese Toasted Sesame Oil - 8fl oz by Mogami.</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YB21A">Kadoya - Pure Sesame Oil 5.5 Oz.</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UB72L0">Loriva Extra Virgin Sesame Oil 12.7 oz.</a>.  This La Tourangelle is the toasty-est.  (The Loriva sesame oil isn't toasted anymore (it had been several years ago), but it has a wonderful, clear flavor.)

review/text: The oil itself is fine, but I have a problem with how the bottle is designed. Small amounts of oil accumulate on the wide metal area surrounding the cap, and fruit flies and other small insects will drown themselves in it. Then, if you're not careful, you'll pour dead bugs into your food! Not cool. I would really prefer a differently-shaped bottle.

I just transplanted the Juniper (in great shape) to the nice pot and am giving the tree some time to rest and adapt to it's new location before I start trimming and shaping it. I have a book my Son's bought me a few Christmas' ago which I'm looking at to get some ideas on this most important phase - how to make this young tree look like a weathered, stately old creature full of wisdom, and full of the care, perspective, and artistry of the Bonsai. This is a great purchase and I'm grateful to my wife for the gift. Now comes the hard part, to look into my deeper self and attempt what I know is far beyond me, to create a work of art I will cherish for years. I highly recommend this product, and would appreciate it if you'd wish me luck as I try to move further on this path.

review/text: The bonsai came in a very cramped and shoddy package, and was dead on arrival. The pot was way too small for the tree as well. It is hard to tell whether a bonsai is dead or not, as they often do not turn brown until months after they have died, but a trained eye could tell. Spare yourself the waste of money and spend a little more on a more legitimate seller.

review/summary: missing everything but the tree
review/text: I received the tree in a timely manner, and it was in a fine condition. However, besides the typed instructions and the ceramic pot housing the tree, none of the listed items were received. I didn't receive fertilizer, training wire, etc. I emailed the shipper  (Sheryl Shop) a week after the tree arrived and they said the rest would arrive. Months later, I'm still waiting.<br /><br />If you're going to buy a starter kit, this isn't it. If you're looking to buy a tree, then you're fine going with this option.

review/text: This would be the first bonsai I have ever bought, and I bought this one as a gift. It did however get to me relatively quickly and was in good health upon arrival. The picture however doesn't show exactly what I got, but it still worked pretty well (it came with a smaller rectangular clay pot). It was a beautiful tree and seems to be maintaining health very well. Not a bad purchase.

review/text: These were a wonderful surprise!  They are individually wrapped, so they retain their delightful gummy texture a long time.  They are chewy, definitely, but not hard, and they don't really stick to your teeth like so many gummy treats do.<br />The flavor has got to be the purest I have ever tasted.  Nothing artificial or metallic at all, just bright grape and strawberry.  There are a lot of different varieties, but these two are my personal favorites, along with the pineapple and kiwi, to a slightly lesser degree.

review/summary: Excellent cookies but for that price they should be wrapped in gold.
review/text: Before my husband retired, he would bring these alfajores back for me when he went on business trips to South America.  I would, however, request the box that contains only the chocolate-covered ones.  The meringue-coated alfajor has a shorter shelf life and dries out more quickly.  (The "mixto" box featured here on Amazon has 6 chocolate and 6 meringue.)<br /><br />Besides beautiful architecture, irrigation systems, science, mathematics and medicine, another great contribution the Moors made to Spain (and hence to Latin America) was the "alfajor".  It's a sandwich cookie like no other.  The cookie itself is flaky, soft and delicious and the filling is "dulce de leche", a yummy, soft, spreadable caramel.<br /><br />Of those alfajores I have purchased, Havanna's are the best and when I say this I am referring to the chocolate-covered ones.  Unfortunately, the price here is exorbitant for a box of 12 cookies but, of course, that's a great reason not to eat too many at 375 calories each.<br /><br />The chocolate-covered Havanna alfajores are a 5-star treat.  I gave this lower rating to the Amazon offering because this is the assortment box which is only half chocolate and also because of that high price.

This Glico pack is not worth it as I can buy the other varieties cheaper at an Asian supermarket that are well stocked with Pocky coming from regional Glico Pocky flavors.

review/summary: Pocky is good but..
review/text: Best to check out your local Asian food market or Japanse anime store. The price will usually be better, considering S&H, and you won't be stuck with 6x of something you end up hating. Also there are a lot of other varieties of pocky than what's being sold here. There's even "giant" pocky, "custard" pocky, "green tea" etc... Always more new ones coming out.<br /><br />But, if there are no market or if other internet stores are comparable in price, than maybe a wise choice for the curious snacker. Beware though, even I didn't like the sesame. And FYI, Men's pocky is just "bitter" instead of "milk" chocolate. Best flavors in my opinion (and most novice Pocky snackers like): Men's, Strawberry with/without extra bits, almond crush.

review/text: I'm based out of Indianapolis, so I got really excited to see a local roasterie here on Amazon!  Their Kenyan is one of my favorite flavors since you get a big bold flavor, some of the spicier notes typical of the African coffees, and a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other coffees, though, this particular one does not stay as amazing as it cools, so I tend to avoid using it for cold drinks.

review/summary: Misleading Product Description -  Note that this is a Blend
review/text: OK. I admit it. I didn't scrutinize the full product description nor study the picture of the bag before purchasing this product. I purchased this product thinking that it was 100% Kenya coffee. Nowhere in the product title or in my invoice did it say it was a Blend. You had to look at a closeup of the bag or read through the romance description in order to get an inkling. Even then, they use the word blended in the description which can have a different meaning than the word blend.<br /><br />Why is this important? There are no worldwide standards for what percentage of a coffee's orgins are needed in order to make a claim. For example, Kona coffee does have a standard for blends, where at least 10% needs to be sourced from Kona in order for it to be called "Kona Blend". In this case, as long as there is some Kenya coffee in this product, Copper Moon can call it a Kenya blend. Amazon should make this clearer.

review/text: It says it is Kenya blend, which implies a mix of coffees.  How much of it is Kenya AA is not said.  I will say it is pretty good.  It is not as good as the one I got from GFS though.  I think it's got some to do with the coffee being a blend, but that's not all.  It's also roasted less than the one at GFS.  I "roasted" some in the oven and then tried it.  I got to say it is much better that way.

This Au Jus is more of a broth texture, and the flavor is excellent.

review/text: Oh, YUMMM!!<br />These are THE best chips I have tasted in years.  I am allergic to lactose, gluten, soy, mint and grapes, which has made it hard to go through these past several years craving soda crackers or something akin to them, and even trying (unsuccessfully) to come up with a workable recipe I can make for myself.  Now I have found them!  These are my newest comfort food.  Wonderful with a chilled glass of Diamond Almond Milk, and I am that little kid back in the kitchen sitting with my milk and crackers.  The texture and tender-crisp "bite-factor" (to me) is so close to that of good, old fashioned crackers - - and the flavor is just deeply satisfying.  I will be up in the middle of the night snacking on these for sure.  I cannot rave enough about them, but I see that others agree with me in the quality and "yummy-ness" quotient of these wonderful chips!  To me they taste closer to crackers than tortilla chips and that is SOOOO yummy!<br />Thank you AMZ for putting these on S&S!!!  Come next payday I will need to be getting a whole case, maybe 2!!

review/text: I stumbled on the Multigrain chips at the little store where I work.  I love them and buy them by the box from Amazon now!  The ingredients are all words you would expect and no long chemical names you can't pronounce.  The Sweet Potato is very good too, but I did not like the Olive flavor.

review/text: As someone who has not been able to eat gluten for the past couple of years, this chip brought back memories of my favorite - everything bagels - that I used to eat regularly. They are quite delicious!

review/summary: Delicious and Nutritious!
review/text: My two year old son and I have Celiac Disease. We can't have gluten, because it makes us very sick. We also both happen to have issues with dairy too. It is very nice that there are AFFORDABLE, delicious snacks like this that we can eat and enjoy. My son loves them, and so do I. The multi-grain are the only flavor we have tried, and we are sold! They are so good. I am so happy to have found these!<br /><br />Most gluten free food is very expensive. Like, Betty Crocker's (albeit delicious) gluten free chocolate cake mix is $3.50 a box, and you get half the amount of a regular Betty Crocker cake mix at 98 cents! It is nice when I find great products that taste good and are inexpensive that we can eat. I am so happy that more companies are finally making gluten free foods!

review/summary: Rave Review!
review/text: What's there not to like??  I am not a "chip" person usually, but was looking for something yummy that would do justice to my homemade hummus.  These fit the bill!  Nutty, crunchy, full of flavor, fiber-rich.....even provide a protein punch with 4g per bag.  Will put these babies on subscribe and save!

review/text: If you have to eat gluten-free and wonder what to snack on, these crackers are wonderful.  I have tried to find tasty snacks and they are hard to find, however, these crackers are so good.

review/summary: Good snack, not very hot
review/text: This chip has a little tomato taste but the jalepeno seems mild. Good alternative to plain tortilla chips. Not overwhelmed by the taste but a good change.
