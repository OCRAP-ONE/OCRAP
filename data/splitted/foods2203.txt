review/summary: awesome liquid smoke
review/text: Love this hickory liquid smoke!  It has a smooth and rich flavor.  I used it on premium tiger shrimp last Saturday. I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and added about 8-10 drops of liquid smoke to about 12 shrimps and let it set for about 15 minutes. I sauteed the shrimp in a pan and the aroma was wonderful...just like grilling on an open fire.  The shrimp had a rich authentic hickory smoke flavor from the liquid smoke.  I'm looking forward to using this liquid smoke on halibut and may even try using it the next time I make beef jerky.  I;ve tried using colgin liquid smoke bought from the store, and this CedarHouse liquid smoke is absolutely more flavorful.

review/summary: The real deal- read the ingredient label
review/text: One of the reasons this liquid smoke is so good is that it has no added fillers or coloring.  Read the label on Stubbs or Colgin.  They contain molasses and spices and other stuff.  This just waters down the smoke flavor.  You end up needing to use less of Cedarhouse because you are getting more smoke flavor in each drop.  I had to come to Amazon and order online because, here in the deep south of Columbus GA I could not find a single store selling pure liquid smoke.

review/text: I read the other reviews and decided to give CedarHouse Liquid Smoke a try.  I'm typically a loyal fan of Stubs.  I was amazed at this product.  Kudos to CedarHouse.  Their liquid smoke is extremely smooth and has a rich smoke flavor.  This liquid smoke is awesome.  I added about 10 drops of liquid smoke to about 8 oz of water and put that into a squirt bottle.  I heavily sprayed my halibut and seasoned with garlic salt and pan fried the fish.  Simply amazing!

review/text: Okay-Liquid Smoke is THE BEST! I've tried other brands like Stubb's...& Liquid Smoke is much-much-much better! I'm from Texas and though we like to smoke meats on the BBQ pit- sometimes because the rain or the Texas heat, you just don't get the chance! Liquid smoke really did the trick with my cajun chicken! Delicious!!! Full bodied hickory smoke flavor-Thanks CedarHouse! I marinaded the chicken for about 2 hours with Lawry's marinade plus the CedarHouse natural hickory liquid smoke & then cooked the chicken on a gas grill. It was perfect with the right amount of hickory smoke flavor! I highly recommend purchasing a bottle!!!

Adding the liquid smoke to our fajita marinade brought a whole new dimension of taste and aroma to our fajitas.  No more smoking chips for us...we're using CedarHouse liquid smoke from now on.  I also like the fact that this is an all natural product with no additives.

review/summary: Amazing accidental discovery!
review/text: I was recently in Las Vegas for a trade show. After a long day on my feet, all I wanted was a quick snack, a drink and bed. We stopped at "Carnevino". This is a Mario Batali restaurant at the Venetian hotel/casino. Ordered a drink and two or three appetizers.<br /><br />When the "Beef Cheek Ravioli" came out, the waiter made a small production of drizzling about a half teaspoon of a dark, dense liquid over the dish. Then he put the spoon down on the plate next to the food. We really didn't think much of this until we tried our first bites. WOW! Needless to say, we each grabbed for the spoon. I won and immediately licked the spoon clean.<br /><br />This balsamic is unlike any I have tried before. Sweet and decadently luscious with just a hint of acid tang. We asked the waiter to bring the bottle so we could inspect it. I made a note of the name and upon returning home immediately searched it out on the web.<br /><br />If you like balsamic vinegar, then you will LOVE this stuff. I am already planning dishes to make once I recieve my bottle.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017WSH82">Villa Manodori Balsamic Vinegar</a>

review/text: Yep. If you're vegan, vegetarian or just want to try some meatless chicken, this product will do just great. I bought this and found it to be a great alternative to buying the fake chicken for $4 a bag every week at the grocery store. For under $30, you get a huge bag of faux chicken. Big ol' bag.<br /><br />Although it it pre-seasoned, it's not too salty or spicy. I highly recommend juicing some lemon juice over it if you're frying or saut&eacute;ing it. Tangy delish. Use this in pitas, salads, tofu scrambles, fajitas, faux chicken salad or with peppers on a hot dog bun. Great buy for the holidays to feed the veggie masses. If you don't use the whole bag, it freezes well after you open it for up to 3 months.

review/summary: Trehalose is basically 2 glucose molecules = safest form of sugar
review/text: Trehalose is a tasty sugar substitute (tastes like a powdered version of Marshmallow Peeps) made from 2 joined glucose molecules.<br />I've been consuming the Trehalose I purchased over the past few weeks without suffering any ill effect or any signs of indigestion.<br />I ordered another 5 jars of Swanson's Trehalose just this week.<br />I am still playing around a bit with cooking techniques to master the best properties of Trehalose while minimizing the slight reduction in sweetness.  Trehalose can convert into a glass phase (think hard candy) just like sugar with much less caramelization (it tends to be clear like glass rather than browning like sugar).<br /><br />It is only about 45% as sweet as regular sugar, but has some very interesting cooking and preservative properties.  Plants like the Resurrection Fern can survive freezing and drying out of 97% of its water mass and still robustly return to life in the presence of water.  A very novel sweet molecular pair indeed.  Don't be mistaken in thinking that Trehalose is a "fake sugar" because humans can digest it back into 2 glucose molecule (the human body's energy reserve molecule) in the lower intestine for energy with the enzyme Trehalase, but at a much slower rate which does not cause rapid blood sugar spikes like High Fructose Corn Syrup does.<br /><br />Only recently have some wonderful scientific manufacturing companies have been able to mass produce Trehalose in large quantities for sale.<br />I expect it won't be too long in the near future when Trehalose is as inexpensive as sugar, but that will only happen when larger demand levels allow a price reduction as an economy of scaling up the production.<br />I invite you all out there to take a taste of this wonderful sweet human-safe alternative to sugar.<br /><br />(Addition on April 18th, 2011 to my January 16, 2010 Amazon review)<br /><br />Okay.  It's been over a year and I have some new stuff to add.  Still a great product, additional suggestions on usage for baking and consumption.  A teaspoon-full of the standard granulated Trehalose (what you get when you purchase this product) added into baking batter acts a bit like baking soda in that baked goods will be a bit softer and rise higher, yet also slightly enhances the normal flavors of the baked goods.  For better food usage, you can put dry Trehalose into an empty blender (not adding liquids and filling above the blending blades) dry blend-grinding granulated Trehalose to a superfine powder for 2 minutes.  This increases the surface area, reduces some of the "powdered marshmallow" flavor, and increases absorption for other uses.  The best dietary cellular absorption I've found is by adding powdered Trehalose to melted chocolate candy squares (to your preferred taste of course).  I suspect that Trehalose is incorporated easiest into human cells by natural semi-solid fat oil-suspension over watery suspension.  Superfine powdered Trehalose does not substitute for confectioners sugar when dusting baked goods.<br /><br />As for other uses, I've added powdered Trehalose to liquid soap for an energizing showering experience which leaves the skin feeling young and the powdered Trehalose is absorbed better when added to skin moisturizers.  Again, no negative side-effects or any "sticky residue" as would occur with sugar or other sugar substitutes.  I have not done very much home-testing on the value of Trehalose as an additive for plant food yet (it should help I'd think given nature's usage in the Resurrection Fern and in cold-surviving & desert-surviving creatures).

review/summary: May not be what I am looking for
review/text: I have read much,(maybe by people who want this item to be used more than it is),and it is very hard to find credible information on the web sometimes.<br /><br />I will say, the claims made about it being a sweetner and food enhancer are probably true, I think it is less than 49% as sweet. Splitting hairs, I would say 40% is closer. I have no doubt it is a good food taste enhancer, although I have not used it as such. This is not why I bought this item.<br /><br />I bought it because of the claims of it's alleged "medicinal" qualities. I am familiar with the claims that it helps retain water in cells under harsh conditions. It also was reported to be a target of study for alzheimers and several other diseases. The most noteable thing for me is the idea that it enhances cellular communication which would denote an efficiency gain in many areas. That is what interested me. Also, with me testing it, my wife has lupus, I had hoped that the efficiency gain might help her immune system recallibrate itself or some unseen gain that might not even be thought of.<br /><br />So, for me, I have noticed no change in any metabolic activity nor any other system efficiency gain. It did not produce any results.<br /><br />But as a sugar subsitute, I am sure it will do quite well. And as a food perservative, the food industry has been using it as such for a long time...if my information is correct. It also would be good for diabetics as it doesn't produce an insulin spike because it doesn't digest until it gets into the colon. That is a biggie. If that is true, it would be a very worthwhile purchase!

review/summary: This stuff is great!!
review/text: I bought this after I came across several studies that show Trehalose actually<br />can reverse the protein growth in the brain that causes Alzheimer's as well as it<br />destroys cancer cells. I was impressed because these were NIH studies and not some<br />chinese herbal school in Mongolia. After doing a lot of reading up I decided to try<br />it and I am very pleased with it.  Do a google for "trehalose alzheimer's" and<br />look at what pops up. It also kills cancer cells by causing them to die off.<br />Everything I read about its taste is accurate. It certainly is not as sweet as ordinary<br />sugar but, I do not know how to describe it, it is a very pleasant sweetness.<br />Absolutely no aftertaste at all, its just nice!<br />I am used to putting a heaping spoonful of sugar in my coffee so I do the same with this<br />and it, well, its just better because it isn't very sweet but it has a great smoothness that sugar<br />doesn't have and it makes my coffee taste better. I really like it more each day.<br />I have started to use this on a daily basis just for preventions sake.<br />Oh I should mention that Trehalose is rated as GRAS by the FDA (Generally Regarded As Safe)<br />Which is as good as it gets.<br />The only drawback is the price so I googled "trehalose cheap" to find lower prices<br />and I just bought some from a fellow in Texas (JC Spencer) who gives you 1lb free with a 5lb purchase and<br />the shipping is a lot less so there was a real savings compared to this.<br />Hopefully it will get even cheaper when people find out about it and start buying it.

review/summary: A Good Option for Diabetics
review/text: Having diabetes, I like it that this fruit spread is less sweet than other marmalades and jams. It's wonderful on toast or a small piece of pannetone at Christmas. Marmalades such as King Kelly and St. Dalfour taste much too sweet to me.  Too bad Sorrell Ridge is no longer available where I live in the western U.S., because the costs for ordering are prohibitively high.

review/text: Most of the "100% Fruit" Marmalade is fruit juice mixed with fruit pectin, which forms a gelatinous base (like soft Jello).  Then there is some orange peel added (not a lot).  The overall flavor is OK, although it's weak in orange flavor.  I prefer Bonne Maman or King Kelly for Marmalade.<br /><br />If you are looking for a higher quality fruit spread, I also like Dalfour Fruit spreads.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T34OE2">St Dalfour Orange Marmalade 100% Fruit Conserve  6x10 OZ)</a>

review/text: This bread makes the best toast. It lasts for months, fresh, on the cupboard shelf, and keeps nicely in the fridge once opened. It has a tangy sourdough taste rather than the slight bitterness often found with whole grains and a dense, slightly chewy whole grain texture. I would not make a sandwich with it--it is too crumbly, but it is great for open-faced toast, spread with jam, peanut butter or pate. I order it by the case.

review/summary: It's an acquired taste
review/text: Ever work with horses? If so, you probably know about "sweet feed" and how good it smells. But...were you ever tempted to taste that sweet feed?  If so, you have a pretty good idea of what Mestemacher fitness bread tastes like.  Just kidding, well, a little anyway.  This bread has a very strong flavor and is definitely an acquired taste, much like black coffee, straight whiskey, or Guinness stout.  You either like it or you don't.  I like it.  It has a great texture - very dense but not tough.  You really have to chew this bread thoroughly.  And that's a good thing.  The pleasure lasts.  It's not like a frosted donut that you can swallow down in seven seconds, so don't plan on gulping down a slice as you run out the door in the morning.  You'll never make it.  As others have noted, the bread tastes better toasted, but don't let it cool after it's been toasted or it will get tough. And it tastes better with something on it.  It's quite good with bacon and eggs.  I suspect that it would really taste great with a little bacon grease on it, but I suppose we have to exercise some restraint once in a while.  I note that the price has increased by eight dollars or so since I bought the twelve-pack several months ago.  However, I see that the sunflower seed bread is more reasonably priced, and with that in mind I should probably tell you that, in my opinion, the flavor of the sunflower seed bread is pretty much indistinguishable from that of the fitness bread.

review/summary: Amazing Stuff
review/text: The thing I find most amazing is how long the bread lasts. Truly amazing. My wife bought some of the Mestemacher Rye Variety at Christmas time. I opened it and had some. I left it on the shelf (un-refrigerated) with some plastic loosely wrapped around the opened end. Checked it every so often to see if it was turning green and it never did. Finally decided to try some again in April just before ordering the Fitness Bread I'm rating here. Toasted it and loved it. I love the Rye (one loaf), Fitness (working through a case), and Pumpernickle (just received a new case and begun working through it). To keep that well without any preservatives is simply amazing. I haven't developed a "real" taste for it plain but love the chewy texture and hardy flavor when toasted. Reminds me in this regard of Health Bread my mother made as a boy. The high fiber and low fat serve me well in getting carbohydrate from whole grain as an active diabetic. Provides a good energy source without severe sugar spikes. Shipping from Amazon was slow but free so great as long as you plan your shipments so you don't run out of bread. Love the concept. Working on my second case!

review/text: I have been enjoying a piece of Mestemacher Fitness Bread every morning for three years.  I lived in Germany for six years, and was spoiled by their infinitely superior breads--without equal in quality or variety--and no preservatives!  When I finally found Mestemacher at a local imported foods store, I was delighted.  I like imported gourmet jams with it, and am very happy with the wholesomeness, dense texture and thin slices.  It was even better when I discovered it could be ordered online through Amazon, at less than the local cost--and it's much more convenient.  The freshness date on the order I just received is far better than the one I was finding in the local store.  The streamlined size of the loaves make it easy to store 12 loaves in an ordinary freezer compartment.

It's got an interesting packed-together spongy texture due to its pasteurization process that is a bit unusual, but goes to explaining why it has a longer shelf life (even out of the bag) than most breads.<br /><br />Pros:  It's good for you, certainly.  It's got a long shelf-life.  The "12 pack" is perfect for bomb shelters.  The bread is sliced lengthwise, which makes for a fun Euro touch (oh those crazy Germans!). The cover photo makes the product seem quite appetizing, too.<br /><br />Cons:  It tastes like foot.

review/summary: All it takes is one death, and these will be pulled from market
review/text: We're pretty avid Whole Foods shoppers now, and have felt pretty good about purchasing organic baby food for our now 9.5 month old son.  Earth's Best brand has been popular with him, so we bought these teething biscuits recently.  Today, he could have died eating one.<br /><br />Although I'm an anesthesiologist, and half of my job is to "protect people's airways", one needn't be a medical professional to realize why these biscuits are dangerous.  Most babies get their front teeth (upper and lower incisors) first, long before molars arrive.  So, they're limited to biting with their front teeth, and only mashing with their gums (where their molars will someday erupt).  These biscuits are great for the first 5 minutes, baby happily chomping away on the hard surface.  Then, they soften.  Pretty soon, baby bites clean through the biscuit with their front teeth (size of chunk depending on how far they had inserted it into their mouth at the time), and the chunk that remains in their mouth is WAY too hard to mash with gums.  Baby has nothing to do but try to spit it out (difficult at this age), or swallow it whole (if lucky enough for it to be a small piece), or have it completely occlude their airway.  We were able to quickly fish one large chunk out with our fingers, but our poor soon started gagging, tearing, and wretched once before something resolved (still don't know if he swallowed a large piece or if it ended up on ground), but not before we scooped him up and tried to knock it loose with some back blows.<br /><br />In any case, although the kids may love these, all it would take would be one infant death from choking to prompt a recall or something.  Why risk your own kid?

The biscuits do get soft after some time, but we just break of the soft piece and give him back the rest of the biscuit.  I would advise not to give these biscuits to a child until they've learned to chew puffs with their gums, so even if they were able to break of a piece themselves, they know to chew on it before swallowing.  My son is 7 months old in this video by the way.

review/summary: These don't have to be a choking hazard....
review/text: My son liked these after us both getting used to them.<br /><br />I would say these are for infants who are teething and beginning to eat with their hands. The biscuits are really met to be sucked on and not really chewed well. So if your baby is at the stage where he is proficient at chewing and swallowing solids, he is beyond these.<br /><br />Also, I found that if I broke one biscuit stick in half, it fit perfectly into my little guy's hand and he could take it to his mouth to suck on and bite. By the time he had bit it enough times to break a piece off, it was dissolved enough and small enough to not be a choking problem.<br /><br />The box says not to give these biscuits to babies younger than 9 months, but my son started these at 6 or 7 months because he was getting teeth. I don't think he will be able to eat them much longer because he is getting more skilled at chewing and swallowing, and like I said before, these really aren't meant to be chewed all at once, but slowly sucked on and bitten.

review/summary: Major choking hazard.
review/text: The ped suggested I get my 6mo old teething biscuits. I got a package of these and the barley ones yesterday. I gave him one of these. He was gumming it pretty well, with both my husband and I present. Yes, it was messy, but he liked it and seemed happy. I was keeping a pretty close eye on him. He dropped it in his lap and it got stuck, so I went to pick it up and noticed much of it was missing. I immediately looked into his mouth and saw a piece. As I started reaching for him, he had a coughing fit and inhaled it. I immediately picked him up, tipped him over, and gave a few good pats on his back which dislodged the nearly quarter sized chunk. I don't trust giving these to him any more.<br /><br />On the ad for the barley ones, a reviewer raving about the product wished to start out by telling us all how we need to supervise our children while they're trying out new foods because food is "dangerous". This may not be helpful, but.... duh, ya think? So because one person thinks these type of biscuits are the bees knees, that makes the rest of us incompetent parents? Hardly. Not only am I a parent, I have also been a healthcare professional for nearly a decade now.<br /><br />I love the company, but I don't trust these biscuits. Period. I gave it 2 stars, because my son went crazy for them and I am impressed with that. Perhaps I'll grind them up and turn it into cereal instead.

review/text: These are definitely messy (but no messier than graham crackers), but they don't stain anything because there's no artificial coloring. My son seems to enjoy them very much. They're nice and hard, so they truly are excellent for teething. I don't worry as much about my son choking on these as I do when he eats graham crackers. These are difficult to break into pieces small enough to choke on (it can still be done--so always supervise).

review/summary: Messy and dangerous...
review/text: My 9 month old is sprouting 6 teeth and I thought this would be great for him to hold and chew on (like a chew toy). The first time we gave him one was to keep him occupied while we were out having dinner, but to my horror, the mess he made while it dissolved in his hands and mouth didnt help us enjoy a meal. The table cloth, high chair and his clothes were all smeared with mush within a few short minutes. I had to take it away from him. The second time was at home (where I could bear the mess alittle more) I gave him a piece to entertain himself while I prepared dinner. He was entertained with it in his highchair for awhile - just enough time for me to wash the rice twice before putting them in the rice cooker, then I heard him coughing and gagging. Thankfully, he was only an arm reach away from me. When I stuck my finger into his mouth, I found the cause to be the 1/3 of the biscuit broken in there! Unless you are prepared to keep both eyes without blinking on your kid and use up a box of wipes cleaning up the mess; look for something else.

review/text: I was concerned from reading the negative reviews of the biscuits as a choking hazzard.  However, once I bought it and tried it, I no longer worry.  These are very hard, so takes a while even for a drooling baby to soften it.  I suggest anyone interested to buy one box and try it out.  I bought it at Target for less than $2.  What a great deal!  I am going to stock it up for my baby (and me too.)

review/summary: My 16 month old and I eat these.
review/text: My little one has been eating these since she was about 10 months old. She didn't like the wheat ones and frankly, I like these barley ones better too. Good thing they come in twos. We like to share them. It is a choking hazard but like most foods, you have to be vigilant and supervise. For some reason, I thought these that I received via Amazon were not as hard as the ones I got at the store. I was worried about the expiration dates since I ordered a pack of 12 boxes but then, I am eating them too so I'm sure they'll be gone by 2/09. What I find amusing is the "evaporated cane juice" that is listed in the ingredients of health foods these days (not just these biscuits). Isn't that simply sugar? Aside from that, I thought these were healthier alternative to a lot of toddler snacks out there anyway, so I gave it 4 stars.

My daughter fulfilled all the "requirements" listed on the box, e.g. she can crawl, gums food, etc., but she still got a big piece of these stuck in her throat and started chocking. There is nothing more scary than finding your nanny hold your child upside down trying to get a piece of food out.<br />I don't recommend these. They should be recalled, or at least not called "teething" biscuits, more like "toddler" biscuits.

review/text: My son almost choked to death on one of these. Instead of slowly dissolving they break apart in large chunks. I would pull them out of his mouth whenever one broke off but today he managed to swallow it before I could get it out and it was nearly lethal. The biscuits are wide and flat. The pieces that break off have sharp corners. The piece that he swallowed was completely blocking his windpipe and because of the sharp corners it was nearly impossible to get out. Baby heimlich did not work. I had to stick two fingers all the way down his throat, carefully dislodge it and pinch it between my fingers to get it out. He is 13 months and eats all kinds of crackers and other solids. These should be taken off the market.

review/text: My 1 year old has choked on these biscuits - he is old enough to feed himself cereal pieces, baby mum-mums, etc. but choked within 1 minute of eating these biscuits.  They are hard enough that when they break off in a baby's mouth, the pieces still stay big and hard rather than dissolving like baby puffs or mum-mum biscuits, and the big pieces immediately get caught in the back of the throat.  I might keep the box around and give them to him when he's much bigger, but then it should be marketed towards toddlers who can eat them safely, definitely not to teething babies.  DANGEROUS!

review/summary: Turns into a sticky mess; may be a choking hazard
review/text: Let me first say that my daughter loves these from when she was 6 months old.  They are tasty and fun for her to eat; that's not the problem.<br /><br />After having been gummed for only a short time, these biscuits turn into a gluey, sticky mess.  It's amazing how tenaciously the goop sticks to mom, baby, clothes and anything else in the vicinity.  Be ready with several wet naps or a clothing change if you give these as a snack.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, they are HARD.  When my daughter is 3/4 finished with hers, she stuffs the whole thing in her mouth.  It will not dissolve, and instead becomes a rather large (in my opinion) choking hazard.  I will note that I have never had a choking incident with the product.  However, when I give her these biscuits I monitor her closely and take it away from her when about a quarter of it is left.

review/text: These barley teething biscuits are very similar to the wheat ones by the same brand. My baby seems to really like them. They're hard enough that they don't break apart or dissolve too fast. I can say that, to me, the wheat are sweeter than the barley. I personally think barley anything tastes absolutely disgusting, but like I said, my baby likes both flavors. At first, I didn't understand why they were wrapped in packs of two, but then I realized that the first one is undoubtedly going straight to the floor, so a replacement is necessary or tears will ensue. Great product, good price, organic! So no worries.

She lost a few teeth this year and has always loved a crunchy bone after every meal...we just couldn't give her those colored, fake bacon, clay looking dog treats that seem to be the only soft dog treats out there.  We were giving her no salt soda crackers but she decided she didn't like those.  So, we decided if babies with no teeth could eat these, our Husky with some teeth might be able to crunch her way through them and...she loves them!  She can crunch to her hearts content without hurting her gums.  And, the sodium content is so much lower than even the salt free soda crackers!

review/summary: Choking Hazard!!!!
review/text: I gave one of these to my 9 month old (with 9 teeth albeit!) last night, and he choked!!  Of course I assumed they'd dissolve like other teething biscuits and didn't try it for myself first.  Thankfully I was right there and by the time I had flipped him over and got him in position to try and get it out, he started coughing and crying, but I hate to think what could have happened if I couldn't get it out!  If your baby already has teeth and can break pieces off - buyer beware.  I tried it for myself afterwards and these do not dissolve very well.  It took a while for me to dissolve it. I agree with a previous reviewer, all it's going to take is one death, and these will be pulled off the shelf.  Thankfully my baby wasn't that statistic last night, but very well could have been.

review/text: I agree with all of the previous reviewers - these biscuits are dangerous for babies and even young toddlers who are unable to chew well.  My son broke one of these biscuits in his mouth when he was very close to one year old and had quite a few teeth.  Fortunately, I was able to remove the broken piece from his mouth.  I was still pretty frightened by the incident.  He is now 15 months old and has 15 teeth, including all of his molars, and I finally feel better about giving him these.  I still supervise him, though.  These are convenient when out and my son, a very picky eater, likes them.

review/summary: Tasty snack that sooths baby's gums
review/text: Our 9 1/2-month old daughter LOVES these teething biscuits! We initially tried them upon recommendation from another Mom in our Mommy & Me group.  The biscuits can be rather messy as they disintegrate but part of this may be due to the fact that our daughter only had one tooth at the time we introduced these teething biscuits; she does not seem to get quite as messy now that she has a couple of teeth. My husband and I try out everything that the baby eats and we found these to be pretty tasty - not quite as sweet as a graham cracker (she loves these, too) but not too "wheaty." We keep packs of the biscuits in the cars, diaper bags, stroller caddys, my purse, etc.  They are often a lifesaver when we are out and about, running errands or out to dinner! They make the baby's gums feel better, keep her preoccupied and are tasty snacks.

About a couple minutes after my son sucks on the biscuit, it softens, and he's able to break off very large pieces into his mouth. Luckily, I was right there watching and was able to retrieve the huge chunk out of his mouth. This is just not safe. I do not recommend these teething biscuits.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Product
review/text: Let me first address the low reviews found here: Please disregard any low review on here that points to the fact that their kid wasn't ready for it. Each child is unique and just because the package states that a certain age is appropriate, it is just an aggregate suggestion and still leaves the determination up to the responsible parent to supervise and make an informed decision as to if their child is ready to consume the product. Just because their are parents who threw these at their kids and had a bad experience, doesn't mean this product is lacking, just the parenting skills.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT: Earth's Best is a brand I love, they use all organic, non-genetically modified foods without any fillers, or artificial nonsense. This teething biscuit is awesome. It is a 3 inch long by 1 inch wide biscuit. This is not a cracker like Ritz or Graham because it is firmer and doesn't crumble all over the place leaving a mess when the kid crushes it in their hands. This biscuit encourages the child to 'teeth' it until it is soft. We began giving these to our daughter at round 7-8 months with proper, responsible supervision and they worked great for her early teething requirements. So much so that we used Amazon's subscribe and save feature.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and hope you consider the reviews for what they are saying; are they critiquing the mistake they made or reviewing the actual product? Because the product is not the problem, it's the user.

review/summary: Takes forever to eat & super messy
review/text: I laughed my head off because when my twin babies were finished eating these biscuits, they were literally covered from head to toe. My babies take about 30 minutes just to eat one biscuit. Afterward, they would need a bath! I like the fact that it keeps them busy, but boy do I have to pay for it in clean up time. Also, biter biscuits are not for younger babies. Most biter biscuits are for twelve months and older. Before ten months of age, my babies had some trouble with pieces getting broken off into their mouths and choking. Now, they eat these like pros. It takes some experience, time and close supervision. Gerber biter biscuits are less messy because they crumble easier instead of getting sloppy. But, my 10 month olds can eat Gerber BB's in less than five minutes. It keeps them busy while I'm making their food, which is a big plus.

review/summary: Tasty, but too dangerous for teething
review/text: While these little biscuits are quite tasty and my 9 month old LOVED the first one I gave her, it will be some time before she gets another one.  Within a minute or two the biscuit had broken into pieces just the right size for her to choke on.  These are not the sort of teething biscuits I was looking for.

review/summary: Biscuit broke very soon after chewing on it
review/text: My son is 5 months old and teething (no teeth yet). The first and second time we gave him these biscuits, they broke into several pieces within about 20 minutes, one time leaving a big chokeable piece in his mouth. I think they are too thin and not sturdy enough to be used for gumming/sucking.

review/summary: Choking Hazard - Beware
review/text: My 10 month old has two teeth coming in on top and three on the bottom. He eats cheerios, gerber puffs, soft cooked vegetables and ripe fruit with very little problem. I tried the Earth's Best barley biscuits because he is prone to food allergies and I wanted to avoid wheat. Every time I gave him one of these biscuits (3 times) he was able to bite off too big a piece and gagged, not to the point of actually choking, but enough to send me into a panic watching him struggle and turn red. They don't seem to dissolve in his mouth fast enough. On the upside they taste good without being overly sweet. I think they are better suited for a little older babies who have more teeth and have really mastered chewing. I will try the Mum Mum rusks as a previous review suggested.

review/summary: Excited to finally have teething biscuits!
review/text: I am a new mom of my 7 month old son with a new one on the way.  My little guy has been teething for 2 months now and needing something to chew on that will teach me to eat "big people food" and also subside the pain the teething is causing.  My mom used these teething biscuits with my brothers and highly recommended them, I was very excited to get them.  At first my little guy wasn't quite sure what to do, but after a few minutes he learned not to bite off pieces but rather to gum it and enjoyed it for a good 20 to 30 minutes!  However, since they say "9 months and older" I kept a good eye on him to make sure nothing bad happened.

review/summary: these are great, all food should be supervised when &lt; 1 yr
review/text: These worked great for us.  When your kid is just learning to eat, you should always be supervising!  Food is kinda dangerous :  That said, babies are very good at choking stuff back up.  My doctor mentioned not to confuse "can't breathe" choking with "too much food at once" choking.  The 2nd 99.9% is fine they'll choke it back up.  The 1st you worry most about wind-pipe sized things like whole peanuts, marbles, grapes, tomatoes, etc.<br /><br />If he's fussy, we give out baby one of these and it makes him happy long enough so we can change him & cheer him up other ways.

review/summary: Best for older babies
review/text: We gave this to our 9 month old and it broke off in her mouth as other reviewers had mentioned.  Now that she is a year old she is able to eat them without a problem.  I would suggest waiting until your child has been eating finger foods long enough that they can comfortably handle these biscuits.  Once they have reached that stage, the biscuits are great.  My 4 year old loves them too!

review/summary: Crumbly, but Good
review/text: I bought these for my baby after standing in the snack aisle for 20 minutes reading labels. They seemed to have the most real ingredients despite the addition of "evaporated cane juice". When I first got them, she was about 7 months old and had just started solids. I broke them into small bite sized pieces (which was very messy) and she didn't seem to go for them much. Now, she's 10 months and we have started introducing a couple snacks after naps and desperate for a little variety, I broke these out again. I still break the pieces up because we like to "donate" to the dog and I really don't want to waste them. So, I break them into about 6 pieces and she has enough to hold and can bite off little pieces or suck on the end until it's small enough to pop into her mouth. In regards to the other parents talking about choking hazards, I'm not sure how that would happen unless the crumbs got caught in their throat. Or, if the baby took a huge bite and tried to swallow it whole. I would recommend introducing these in small bites until the child is used to the texture.

review/summary: Beware
review/text: Please be very careful of this buscuit, it is too thin, a baby biscuit is supposed to be hard and melt upon contact and not be breaking off in chunks enough to choke the baby. Just the thin look was scary to me and was later confirmed.<br /><br />Looks more suitable to a toddler.
