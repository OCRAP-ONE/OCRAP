review/summary: Very Good! Great as a gift and for parties!
review/text: This are yummy quality chocolates with a good but not great hazelnut filling. Their taste, along with the gold-colored foil wrapping make them look more expensive than they really are. They're great to indulge in if you find yourself not being able to afford $50.00 for a box of milk chocolate truffles or French pralines. A cute little gift for that special someone as well.

review/summary: A key ingredient in my new favorite BBQ sauce for chicken!
review/text: For the past 30 years, I've preferred an old family BBQ sauce recipe for my chicken - but NO LONGER! Combine 4 oz of this rich and flavorful syrup with 5 TB chili sauce, one small onion (chopped), 2 TB apple cider vinegar, 1 TB regular mustard, and 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce. Marinate your favorite chicken parts in a covered dish in the fridge for at least four hours, turning the chicken pieces occasionally. Grill chicken until thoroughly cooked, basting occasionally. DELISH!!!

review/text: This product has been pretty awesome. I could tell the difference in my energy levels about a week after using it and I feel better since I have started drinking it. As for the taste, it is very gritty however, all you have to do is just drink it through a straw and it will go down easier. I usually mix it with some lemonade or in a smoothy. The taste is something to get used to but the benefits far out weighs the taste. As for the quantity, the canister is relatively small, but if you level off the scoop, you will have enough to last for the month at one serving a day.

review/summary: Amazing Grass Greens
review/text: This is the first time I've ever used a greens superfood. I don't think the taste is all that bad, almost taste like a mocha flavor to me. I will say that you do have to stir it real good and drink it down fast and then add more water to the glass to mix in what's left. I've taken it with orange juice before and it was fine that way too. It's just that I don't drink oj that much, so water works just fine for me! After drinking it, I find that I have to drink a little extra plain water to wash down some of the powder, it tends to stick to my throat a little bit. But I still highly recommend.

review/summary: Good for you, but doesn't mix well.
review/text: It doesn't taste great, but I don't think it's awful. I didn't really expect a mix of dried powdery grass, fruit, and veggies to taste like a glass of grape juice so the taste didn't bother me. If you can tolerate straight wheatgrass juice, you should be able to tolerate the taste of this.<br /><br />It does NOT mix well. One scoop in even as much as 20oz of water produced a gritty mixture that left sediment in my mouth, in the container, and on the bottom. I tried stirring with a spoon, shaking vigorously, and even tried with juice instead of water. It seems the only way to avoid the sediment is to put it in a smoothie. I don't regularly drink smoothies and don't plan on finding a way to integrate them into my diet.<br /><br />It's certainly nutritious according to the label, and the vitamins all come from the whole-food ingredients. So if that is what you're looking for and you drink smoothies, you might give this a shot.<br /><br />I haven't felt magical or full of energy when I drink this, so I can't really verify that it is doing anything noticeable. I probably will not buy the powder again. I do like the nutritional value so I may try the capsules or go to another brand.

I'd say at least for me, it is about as effective as taking my glutathione/coenzyme q10 pills for energy - except that I don't have to deal with the side effects of magnesium stearate (which slimes your intestines making absorption worse)..  It has a flavor reminiscent of chocolate to me so that it actually tastes pretty good.  The only downside is that it is expensive.  But take your pick - your health, or your wallet.  Gives me more energy that eating raw kale for me.  Recommended.

review/summary: Love it, but I wish $20 got you more...
review/text: I ordered this with the intent to add it to smoothies and as a boost to my juicing regimen - so I'll say that the flavor wasn't necessarily a concern with me. I've been drinking odd and awful tasting concoctions in the name of health since I was a child. I guess you can say that it comes with the natural health territory, and I certainly don't mind.<br /><br />However, I wanted to try this out in a plain glass of water first just to get an idea of what I was working with. I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't more potently "grassy", and actually didn't taste half bad in the grand scheme of green superfood powders an all that. I've seen this in Whole Foods before, so I already knew what I would be getting in terms of what was listed on the label. It really is a great list of superfoods, and they specifically use Sambazon acai - a great product and great company as well.<br /><br />I will say that for $20, I wish that there was well... more. Eyeballing the container, if you were to just use one serving per day, this probably wouldn't last more than two weeks at most. The nutrition facts on the back claim that there are 30 scoops per container, but I really doubt it. And, if you're like me, this is only one of many health products you use on a daily basis - so budgeting in another one isn't so easy.<br /><br />Then again... it is a really great product, so maybe it can replace a few!

But the taste is surprisingly acceptable! My advice is to mix it up with some juice and you won't even notice it's in there. Great product.

review/summary: Not sold on this.
review/text: I gave 3 stars for  some good ingredients but this does absolutely nothing for me.  My daily vitamin does more.  I think it's the caffeine.  I guzzle caffeine daily  (yes, I know it's bad for me and I'm not going into why I do that..) so if that was what was spiking people's energy then no wonder I feel nothing.  I was hoping to find something that helped me with a more natural energy but this isn't it.<br /><br />Those of you that are thrilled with it's energy-giving properties, do you think it's the caffeine?  Are you used to drinking caffeine?  If not, that could be why you feel so excited about this..  NO healthy drink powder should contain caffeine.  There is no reason for it! I'm trying to get off caffeine and bought this not knowing it was there.  Stupid me but shame on the company for passing this off as a "superfood" then throwing that in.

The taste is not horrible, but more like a mind game because my body is not used to such an earthy/natural type product. It's not your typical juice mix :) ! I mixed it with grape juice which seems to be doing the trick, def. more manageable. 1/3 mix, 2/3 grape juice! Updates to come later!

review/text: I'm 54 years old and have never acquired a taste for most vegetables.  Some time ago I started having a "green drink" mixed with 100% fruit juice in the mornings.  It relieved my guilt for not eating vegetables and I had a noticeably higher level of energy.  I used one brand for over a year and wanted to try another brand.  I purchased "Amazing Grass Green Superfood". The taste isn't too bad, but the powder does not mix well with the juice.  When I get down to the bottom of my drink, it's mostly powder and tastes terrible!!<br />No refunds on groceries, so it's been an expensive lesson.

review/summary: WAS choking it down better than wheat grass.
review/text: I was drinking a lot of wheat grass juice, thought I would give this a try.  It's more expensive at Whole Foods than Amazon.  The taste is nauseating in the water, juice, and yogurt/fruit smoothies I've tried so far, but it goes down easier than the wheatgrass juice.  I think it's the aftertaste of mint that is getting me.  If it works well, I'll give it more stars later...<br /><br />UPDATE:  I had to stop eating this, it makes my kidneys hurt.  Once I stopped ingesting it, things went back to normal about 1-2 days later.  I returned it.

You're fooling yourself.<br /><br />Grass is grass. Period. Grass shouldn't taste like chocolate or strawberry. The flavors are just artificial flavors, chemical garbage.<br />Amazing Grass is not bad, but only the original without flavors.

review/text: This green powder is SO good, I just had to get the word out. Others I've tried (Whole Foods brand, Barlean's Greens, Berry Green, many others) literally taste just like grass clippings, so you have no choice but to mix it with juice or a smoothie. THIS green superfood is palatable enough to drink just mixed with water! (Let me explain: do not expect it to be SWEET. This is a veggie drink, but it has an ever-so-slight hint of raspberry that's pleasing to the tongue when you gulp it down.)<br /><br />Healthwise, I've notice that my skin has gotten clearer, my energy levels have evened out, and I've harly even gotten a cough, let alone a cold, in the several years I've been drinking this- and I work with the sick and elderly.<br /><br />Yes, there is sediment, but that is because this drink has FIBER in it- the kind that is naturally in fruits and veggies.<br /><br />Accept it for what it is, compare it to the alternatives, and imagine how incredibly amazing you will feel. Then make your decision.

review/summary: Good taste, great nutrient density
review/text: Product: "Amazing Grass Green Superfood" (unflavored)<br /><br />STRONG LIKES:<br />* Nutritional Density:  This product contains a well balanced organic mix of nutritionally super-dense dehydrated grass & vegetable extracts (wheat grass, barley grass, alfalfa, "spirulina" blue-green algae, spinach and broccoli), natural plant-based antioxidants (Acai berry, maca, carrot, beet, raspberry, rose hips, pineapple, green tea and acerola cherry), fiber (ground flax seed, and apple pectin), enzymes & pre/probiotics (chicory root, acidophilous, amylase, protease, lipase, lactase, cellulase), and mild herbal stimulants (peppermint and eleuthero root).<br /><br />* Pleasant Taste: For the unflavored powder (the only version I've tried as of this writing), the texture is very slightly gritty (as you'd expect from dehydrated plant extracts and ground flax), but the flavor is pleasant and pairs well with other flavors ... the finish is faintly sweet, with a vague hint of raspberry and cocoa powder.<br /><br />MINOR NITS:<br />* Premium Price: This is a somewhat expensive product, but don't let that deter you because it's very good value, given it's quality and high nutritional density.  On a serving for serving basis, it's still cheaper than a shot of freshly squeezed wheat grass at your local healthfood market - and it's more balanced too.  Prices should begin to slowly decrease as other companies jump onboard with wheat grass and spirulina production, and you can always use a bit less than the recommended serving size (especially if you're mixing it with other supplements).<br /><br />* Mixability: I'd classify it as "ok" on mixibility.  Stirring doesn't work well, so I've found it best to either use a drink blender, or scoop a little into a small reusable jar (along with any other nutritional powders you like), and shake it with your liquid of choice (I use fat free milk).<br /><br />* Nomenclature:  The claim of "amazing energy" is slightly misleading, because this is NOT an energy drink - it contains only a small amount of carbohydrate.  What it DOES contain are B-vitamins and pre/pro-biotic ingredients that indirectly help your metabolism. This is not a complaint per se, but rather an attempt to help clarify the claim on the label.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />* Highly recommended - a good and fully organic supplement for busy people on the run.  I'd have given it 5 stars if it blended a little better and was a bit more economical, but regardless I'm very happy with it, and will continue to buy it regularly.  You don't have to be a vegan to enjoy it.

All that being said, for those of us that are trying to live a healthier lifestyle, this product is really amazing.  I have loads more energy and I just plain feel better every day.

review/summary: A boost of health in a bottle
review/text: Very healthy stuff. I don't eat as much vegetables as I should, but this helps balance my diet with the chock-full of nutrients it provides. The most appealing benefits to me are 100% DV vitamin A as beta carotene, powerful antioxidant blend, and probiotic active cultures like those in in yogurt.<br /><br />The aroma is pleasant and so is the taste, but the solubility is difficult. Since it contains insoluble fiber, it doesn't dissolve completely with water or juice. Smoothies are best for this mix. I tried cold water and hot water, and its quite gritty in both --not sand-like mind you, but sort of like not completely mixing cocoa powder and trying to drink it. Speaking of which, for some odd reason the taste and aroma reminds me of hot cocoa. After discovering hot water doesnt help dissolve everything, I wouldn't recommend it since heat can diminish a lot of the nutrient power this mix provides, especially the antioxidants.<br /><br />Per the label, it is best kept frozen or refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/10/2011 ***********<br />I find that I like the taste when it is mixed with vanilla-flavored soymilk. One way I use the mix is to add flavor to my high-fiber cereal and soymilk, which looks gross since your milk turns green, but at least the gritty bits are masked by the cereal and dont bother me one bit (pun?).<br /><br />UPDATE 1/20/2012 ************<br />I'm really enjoying this supplement powder! I can sense myself feeling better throughout the day. Since I take this supplement first thing every morning, I have become more regular in my bowel movements (almost clockwork) and noticed good changes in my stool, defecating clean and easy. At first, I was very gaseous as my body tried to get accustom to the high volume of fiber in my supplemented diet. But after a couple days the flatulence subsided, and I was reaping the benefits of fiber without the sound effects (which by the way did not smell... at least to me =P ).<br /><br />UPDATE 2/2/2012 ************<br />I noticed that there is another size available for this Green Superfood (17oz vs 8.5oz) for a cheaper price per ounce value. Just to let you guys know, I bought this one back in November 2011 and the expiration date for my container says August 2013. Thats nearly a 2-year shelf life! But I think they are referring to the shelf that is in your refigerator, rather than your cupboard.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/24/2012 ************<br />I've been taking this every weekday at work, one scoop every morning with my cereal. Finally finished the container roughly in two months. As I try to reflect on any long term changes, I do notice that I wake up easier for work, which is at 4:00 AM every morning. I try to get at least 7 hours of sleep, but most of the time I fall asleep between 10:00-11:00 PM, and surprisingly I'm still mentally awake until that time.

review/summary: Super value-great supplement!
review/text: After reading several articles maintaining that vitamin supplements are basically a scam, with no positive correlation to health or longevity, I decided to ditch my multivitamin and switch to a natural food supplement instead. The ingredient list in Green Superfood is impressive-I'm not sure how costly it would be to duplicate through juicing but this accomplishes the same goal for me without all the shopping, food prep and cleanup! In the past year I've cleaned up my diet quite a bit, but I always seem to come up short in consuming green leafy vegetables, so this product fills that gap nicely. As for the drinkability, I have tried mixing with V8 and some water. Not very good. Today I tried mixing with just straight water, and surprisingly, it wasn't bad! My advice to anyone who wants to get the best health result: don't use Green Superfood as a magic bullet that allows you to make multiple bad food choices on a daily basis. Dump the processed sugars, refined flours and sweet drinks, eat as many natural foods and whole grains as possible and over time, your palate will readjust to a normal state. Your cravings should become manangeable and weight/fat loss will begin to occur naturally! I would definitely recommend this product to any busy, health-minded and budget-conscious person who wants an easy way to enhance their diet!

review/text: Hello,<br /><br />This is hands down the best green powder I've used.  With others I've tried I wouldn't have dreamed of just drinking the powder mixed in water.  Amazing Green is great mixed in a glass of water or as an addition to a smoothie.  The best part is that it is slightly sweet (although I don't think there are any added sugars) and blends easily.  Note that if you do not drink it quickly, you will want to give it a stir before you take another gulp as it has a tendency to settle on the bottom of the glass.  In a smoothie it blends without a trace.  It does look like pond scum, but it actually tastes pretty good.  Plus, you can always hide it in juice or a shake.<br /><br />Once again - Amazon has the best price and it is a Prime product so if you have a Prime account, it ships free.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />SR

I also just feel good about having something so healthy everyday :)

review/summary: Increased energy, pleasant taste, less food cravings!
review/text: I have been using this powder for over a week now. I mix it with water and ice cubes in a blender before work outs. The taste is neutral with just a hint of peppermint and quite pleasant, not grassy at all. It is a bit grainy in texture and does not dissolve very well. Some of the powder gets stuck inside the blender and the glass. That's the only draw back.<br /><br />I do feel much more energized and less hungry an hour into exercising. I have also noticed an overall increase in my energy level as well as decreased food cravings. I used to crave salt and sweets all the time. Even after a late night out having had several cocktails and little sleep I feel great whereas before I would feel sluggish, hung over and craving junk food. This is amazing and I just ordered my next month supply.

review/summary: First super foods purchase.
review/text: I just recently started looking into super foods and a way to get more healthy in the way I eat. About a year ago my food needs and wants completely changed. I started to eat more vegetables and fruits but noticed its actually pretty expensive to buy those things and the rate they can go bad is very quick.<br /><br />I bought my first order of Green superfood and i must say im pretty impressed out of the box. I made my first glass and the taste is not bad at all. I Drink alot of water so i mixed it in with a tall glass of water and im drinking it as i type this. The taste is really not bad at all, tastes a bit earthy but if you are used to drinking green tea or any other earthy blends this will be know different.<br /><br />Worth the try, and i will be purchasing more when this is done.<br />Ill redo the review when I use it for a while and see if there are any benefits.

review/summary: if you can swallow the superfood sediment...
review/text: I've tried mixing this in different things and the taste is overwhelming.  To me it tastes mostly like green tea and peppermint, which in and of itself is not too bad, but the fact that the powder does not seem to dissolve at all kind of grosses me out.  The only way I could swallow it is by using only half a scoop in a very large (24oz) glass of water.  Then the flavor is much lighter and actually kind of refreshing.  It still doesn't seem to dissolve completely and the bottom gets pretty grainy. Despite this, it truly is a superfood; the ingredients in it are the healthiest green foods as well as the more exotic green foods, some of which would be difficult to get in your diet other ways (wheat grass, barley grass, alfalfa, spirulina, spinach, chlorella, acai, green tea, flax seed, and digestive enzymes).  All of these foods have been suggested to be some of the healthiest foods around.  The 'non-organic' version of the product depicted here is actually 70% organic, and if you're a 100% organic kind of person, Amazing Grass also offers an all organic version for a slightly steeper price.  A list of the ingredients and nutritional information can be found on the amazing grass website.

review/summary: The taste isn't bad at all
review/text: First a bit of relevant personal history: I've never been a "health nut" and although I've tried various potions and tonics over the years, I never tried any of them more than two or three times because they tasted so awful. I am definitely NOT the kind of person who will drink something disgusting that belongs on the slimy bottom of a tropical lagoon somewhere just because it will supposedly make me live to be 200 or something.<br /><br />With that understanding, please understand that my opinion of this product's taste and texture is that it is NOT BAD AT ALL.  This is a health supplement I can actually see using for the foreseeable future, because although I'd never say it's a treat, it's really just kind of inert - there's a very weak, mild "musty" flavor, a decent amount of mint (but not strong) and pretty much no other flavor. There also doesn't seem to be much if any aftertaste.<br /><br />Those who complain about "grittiness" either have a MUCH more sensitive mouth than I have, or don't understand that the drink must be stirred before each swallow, or are just plain picky from a visual standpoint.  No, it definitely does not and will not dissolve, but the particles are very small, seemingly soft, and completely non-offensive.  I notice virtually none of them when drinking this.  However, they will settle fairly quickly, so it's important to keep stirring before each swallow.  Failure to do this would result in very "rough" dregs at the bottom of the glass.<br /><br />The toughest thing to get used to is the look of the unmixed powder, and the color of the water once the powder is stirred in. Neither is exactly appealing and I had to psych myself up to actually try the stuff.  But despite my expectations, it wasn't at all bad.  It doesn't taste exactly good, but it's a flavor that I, even with a strong gag reflex, texture sensitivity, and major aversion to most similar products, can drink easily and actually hold or roll in my mouth for a few seconds without spitting it out or feeling sick.<br /><br />I haven't been taking this long enough to comment on the health benefits (although I do seem to notice some increased energy).  I will update this review in a few weeks to reflect my experience in that regard.  My main point in writing for now is just to say that based on the taste and texture, this is a health product I can try long enough to see if it makes a positive difference in my health and energy levels or not.<br /><br />Edit 2-22-2012: After a few days of taking this product, I have found that the slightly "musty" taste seems to be the green tea it includes. The green tea flavor is more apparent when using less water, while using more water brings out the mint flavor more powerfully. I'm feeling only slightly better energy since beginning this product, but I also have had a cold for the past ten days or so (caught before I began using this product), which is definitely dragging me down. I'll update this review again when I'm close to the end of my first month's supply.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: My aunt recommended years ago that I try Greens First, or something like that. She is a dietician and knew my eating habits, which is to say she knew I didn't eat vegetables hardly at all. I never really liked the idea, I imagined it would taste gross and I really didn't care much about my health at the time.<br /><br />Fast forward to age 31 and I'm looking to lose some weight and try to avoid major health issues down the road. My girlfriend was using this stuff, and when she moved out, she left a full, unopened container of the Berry flavored version of this stuff. I decided I'd try it out. I read that you were to mix 1 scoop with at least 6 oz of water, and so I put a scoop in a 16oz glass and filled the cup with water, and mixed it all around. The visual disgusted me. It looked like I had taken a glass and dipped it into a scummy pond and filled it with it's water. But I got over that and took a sip. It wasn't bad! Not something I crave, but it wasn't disgusting at all. So I took a bigger drink, licked the chunky crap off my lips, and set it down. I kept going until the glass was half full and I noticed the sludge at the bottom. So I poured more water in, and kept at it.<br /><br />Moral of the story, it tastes good enough for me to mix with just water. However, I need lots of water. I just take on scoop, put it in my glass, then poor in water. When I get to the sludgy bottom, I poor more water in, re mix and drink down. Repeat until it's all gone. This gives me a healthy dose of water for the day, plus the greens.<br /><br />I can't say I have any more energy then before. I can certainly see how it would help with constipation issues, if you have those. And I've been losing weight, but I've also been working out and consuming fewer calories. In the end, I'll keep using it because my diet needs improvement.

Days that he doesn't have it he almost drags himself around the house and with it he is robust and filled with energy despite his condition.<br /><br />Every morning and evening we put it in his water bowl with half the amount of water he normally drinks that way he drinks what he needs with the green juice in it with none left over. Plus I have started putting it in his raw food supplements along with shredded carrots and inside home baked dog biscuits. Thanks to this company I will have a few extra years with my Ray!

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty with just water
review/text: I was hesitant to try this powder, as I'd been adding wheatgrass to my smoothies and it definitely altered the flavor (though I could still drink them; it wasn't awful).<br /><br />Then I passed a sample table at a health food store & I poured a cup. It actually tasted somewhat pleasant. Somewhat is all I need, since I drown these powders in smoothies anyway.<br /><br />I use 1 little scoop every day. My skin is definitely reacting well -- knock on wood, no blemishes since I started with this. I also use a scoop of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OHUVVQ">Whole Food Smoothie Infusion by Vega - 16 oz</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SG1H6O">Shake & Go Smoothie Vanilla Almondilla By Sequel Vega - 10.6 Ounces (300 grams)</a> . I use lots of fresh ingredients (kale, spinach or collards, coconut water, banana, 1/2 avocado + some frozen fruits). It makes for a tasty breakfast. For me, anyway. I don't like things too sweet, and I hate the sickly sweet taste of many protein powders.<br /><br />Another powder I like is Spiru-Tein Protein Energy Meal Cappuccino 1.1 lbs Pwdr (but not the other flavors, except maybe vanilla).<br />I'm happy. Loving my smoothie breakfasts.<br /><br />7/11 update: I have had an amazing healing happen that I can only figure is due to the wheatgrass (and all the greens, though I've always been a healthy eater). I had a collection of plantar warts on my heel for about 30 years. A group the size of a quarter. So pretty big & painful. Never went away. Only got worse, 'til there was also a 2nd group of warts, dime-sized. I had tried every home remedy I heard about over the years, from duct tape to banana peel and neem oil. Nothing worked. So I was resigned to a lifetime of these things & had given up on the home cure attempts. Then one day, a few months after I began upping my green quotient with this powder in my daily smoothies, I brought my heel facing me during yoga one day and all the warts are gone! I know doctors say warts go away on their own eventually, but come on, after 30 years? I'm pretty convinced it's my green smoothies and Amazing Grass. So I'm a super convert now. So so amazed by this surprise development. Yay!

review/summary: WOW, taste is great!!!!
review/text: I must say being new to this whole "green drink" and "whole food" thing I fully expected this to taste awful (like some of the reviews have said). However being a bodybuilder I have taken some NASTY stuff, so I figured if this stuff is as good for me as it says it is, I'm drinking it no-matter the taste. I am not sure how to even respond to the people that say the taste is awful because I thought it was so good I had 3 drinks my first day!!!! The taste is amazing considering what's all in it, it tastes a lot like a slightly sweetened tea and the texture is a lot like if say your tea bag broke open a little bit. I loved it so much I ordered the larger 60 serving size. As far as the effects (mind you this is still my first day using it)...seems I'm less hungry and my stomach is not as bloated feeling as usual. The biggest reason I decided to get this is because I am trying to bump up my veggie intake and this will help. I mixed mine with water and then tried another one with milk both were great. ENJOY!<br /><br />**Update** been a couple weeks now, and the biggest things I've noticed is<br />(1)I don't feel drained and grumpy at the end of a long day anymore....feel I could keep going if needed<br />(2)Slow and steady weight loss (though keep in mind I also added a lot more veggies to my diet besides the drink)<br />(3)This I was not expecting at all, but my sex drive is through the freak'n roof now, after some research I found that an ingredient called MACA in this is prob. the cause of this welcome effect.

review/text: I hate veggies...REALLY have veggies, so I used frozen wheat grass juice in smoothies, until this product was recommended to me by a colleague.  I'd be lying if I said I've ever consumed this on it's own, so I can't comment on flavor.  After my workouts, I typically make a smoothie with a few greens, a slew of fruit, and protein powder.  I dumped the trays of wheat grass, and now simply add a scoop of Amazing Grass to my amazing concoction.  Whole Foods charges over $30 for the same size container; great pricing here!

I have a VitaMix blender and have had no problems with texture.  The berries' "grit" is more noticeable than anything.  The green taste is not unpleasant, appealing in a "fresh cut grass" versus "pond scum" way.

review/summary: Not very tasty in my opinion
review/text: I tried this product for the first time today, and it was pretty hard to chug it down.  I did that with my nose plugged:)  To me it tastes like something a barnyard animal would be ingesting.  It's not absolutely horrible tasting, but it is gritty and tastes like a mildly sweet grass and hay mixture.  However, with that said, I think it is a good product.  It has a very impressive ingredient list, with one exception.  It contains Maca powder, which can be a great supplement for many; however, not everyone should be consuming maca due to some side effects that a simple internet search will verify.  It can mess with hormone levels and have other ill effects on certain individuals (people with thyroid disorders and pregnant women should avoid it).  I felt an energy surge after using this product, but I think I will stick with To Go Greens.  I don't think the ingredient list in To Go Greens is quite as extensive, but it also doesn't contain anything that I would prefer not to consume.  I think TGG also tastes much better, so I am more likely to be consuming it on a regular basis.  The Amazing Grass is a great supplement, but due to the less than yummy taste I don't see myself using it on the regular basis that I would need to be taking it to get optimal results.

review/summary: Great for my digestive health
review/text: I don't usually write reviews, but I was really compelled after trying this product.<br />I have been using Green Superfood for about 3 weeks, drinking one scoop with 12 ounces of water once every morning.  While I don't feel like I've gained energy like some of the other reviewers, it has done wonders for my digestion.<br />Everyday after a workout, I usually drink a whey protein shake, which contains moderate amounts of lactose.  This used to give me bloating and gas (which I kept drinking anyway because I needed the protein intake) and occasionally, the #2 problem...if you catch my drift. I've had this problem for 3+ years.  After taking green superfood, I haven't had any stomach issues since.  I can't believe the improvement and feel that my body is actually able to absorb and digest all the nutrients and protein from my post-workout shake.  Now I don't really know how green superfood does it, but I'm guessing it's helping to balance the acid in my stomach, giving my stomach's natural bacteria a better environment to do its thing.

Before buying it, I had read all of the reviews about the gritty texture and sludge that accumulates at the bottom of the cup, so I was nervous! However, I made it using a mixing bottle with a metal ball (like this one- Black 28 Oz. Blender Bottle W/wire Shaker Ball and it turned out just fine. I gave it a hard shake at the beginning, and then another every couple of minutes while drinking it, and it was pretty smooth. As for the taste, it tasted like a watery, slightly earthy tea. Not delicious for sure (although I wasn't expecting it to be), but not unpleasant either. Will definitely buy the larger size canister next time.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112ILZM">Amazing Grass All Natural Drink Powder, Green Superfood, 8.5-Ounce Container</a>  I've been using this product for about 6 months, and have hooked at least 4 others on it.  I'm 53 years old, and have more energy, better/healthier physical appearance and overall well-being than many of my younger acquaintances.  I do free weights 4 mornings a week, 20 minute mini sessions.  I also split the rest of my aerobics between kickbox-interval training, zumba, ballroom dancing, and a weekly 3-mile walk/jog.  I understand that energy be-gets energy when working out.  But this product makes a good fuel supplement.  I still have to read up on the sexual effects of the MACA (as cited by another user), but I won't dispute his word.  My hair care technician says my hair & scalp are in great condition.  I always get compliments on my skin--I've stop wearing cover-up foundation.  I take one dose in the morning, and it carries me until about 10 p.m., then I sleep like a baby.  The texture is a little gritty, but I also stir after each swallow, and that helps a lot.  I mix mine with 100% cranberry juice or orange juice, and it's very easy to swallow like that for me.  I haven't tried the chocolate, but I've tried the berry--yuck!!  I prefer the lime flavored.  I'm totally satisfied with my results, and intend to continue using this product.  Last note--each of us are different, what works for me may/may not work for the next user.  Each of us have to learn our bodies; then learn what works for us, based on our environment, activities, current health, and health goals.  DRINK UP AND STAY HEALTHY!!!

review/summary: Happy & healthy
review/text: This stuff is awesome in smoothies. The flavor is much like a lighty sweetened green tea, in a powder form. I can say that it never seems to quite "disolve" if just mixed with juice or water, there is always a "chewy residual" to it. I find that it's best well blended in a blender with unsweetened almond milk and some fruit. I do think it's a great subsitiute if you or someone you love, does not get enough veggies in their diet.

review/summary: Once you learn how to mix it.....
review/text: Once you learn how to mix it, not half bad. You must mix with some fruit juice like Apple or White Grape. First you need to put a little liquid and make a paste, once the paste is well mixed then you can pour in more liquid and it would taste fine.

review/summary: I can't start my morning without it...
review/text: I adore this stuff. I first purchased a few packets of this at Whole Foods to test out the flavors. For me the original flavor worked best with my smoothies. The first week I started using it I noticed a crazy energy boost, almost like coffee but without the jitters. Eventually, my body got used to it and while it still gives me energy it's a little more subdued. Lots of fiber, so if you have any regularity issues, 2 servings per day will do you right. Tastes great, and mixes well in smoothies and juice. Order via subscribe and save, and the savings is Amazing.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I have used the product for about a week and have actually sensed a subtle rise in energy after each meal. My digestion seems to be a tad bit better as well, I am hardly clearing my throat anymore.<br /><br />The list of items in the product is awesome and the benefits should improve considerably as time goes on.<br /><br />An excellent buy.

review/summary: VERY PLEASED WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THIS ITEM
review/text: I bought this about a month ago from Super Supplements.  Because I read all the high reviews regarding this product I had high hopes.  All the reviews from others were correct...this product is amazing.  The taste is not my favorite but considering all the GOOD VEGGIE stuff inside it...I can't complain.  I've noticed a more balanced energy level throughout my day.  Sleep better at night,  and my sex drive has increased well above the norm.  My girlfriend and I normally "fool around" every 4 days or so.  But I found after a month on this stuff...it's everyday if not every other day that I'm ready for it.  Very happy.  Never knew what I was missing.  This goes to show you how my past diet was affecting my day to day life.  Purchase this stuff!  I recommend mixing it with apple juice and a bananna.  Really makes for a good smoothie!

review/summary: Kind of grainy
review/text: I'm sorry, but i just had to go back and update my review. The over flow of reviews saying how great the taste is, is true to the people who have been drinking this kind of product for awhile. If this is your 1st time trying this (like me) and you were mixing it with the suggested WATER it says to mix it with, it is TASTELESS! YES,..I WILL BUY THIS AGAIN & YES,..IT DID GIVE ME ENERGY! But the taste is bland! IT DOES NOT MIX WITH WATER WELL. You feel just about every grain going down your throat. But the fact that its extremely healty allows you to get pass the grainy feel you're swollowing. Buy it & drink it because its healthy for you!

review/summary: Improved taste
review/text: I used to buy this brand/product a few years back and what I noticed was the improvement in taste. Back then, I had to mix it with powders and drinks that covered up the grassy taste....now, I just use Vanilla flavor Almond Milk or the Soy Milk and it taste great....the only thing is that it is a little gritty. In terms of how I feel..with the old version, I had improved energy and my skin looked nice....I don't notice anything with this version...but it cannot be bad for you, there is good stuff in here. So I will still drink it.

review/summary: Great, makes me feel good, but a little grainy..
review/text: This really makes me feel good, but it has become hard for me to drink sometimes due to the graininess of the product. If its blended though, it's easier to swallow, but that is a pain. I will put in my shaker, shake for a good 20 seconds and there is still some grainy residue. Maybe that is normal? Regardless I gave it five stars as it does what it says, gives me energy and makes me feel great! On the Auto Ship program for a better cost :)

review/summary: Great Stuff, Great "Natural" Energy
review/text: As a college student it's very hard for me to get 6-8 servings of fruits and vegetables a day.  Even in the summer when I'm home at my parents house, it's a similar situation and very hard to consistently eat 6-8 servings a day.  After watching some Food documentary on Netflix I Google'd one of the ingredients they were praising about, and ended up finding reviews of this product.  Needless to say, this stuff does everything it says it will do.  As a bodybuilder, I am very aware of supplements and the effects they have on my body.  This is working wonderfully.  Upon taking it, I immediately feel an onset of a pleasant, very clean body buzz.  The way I can describe this buzz is like taking an organic version of redbull or adderral, but without the chemical feeling and crashing that is often involved with these man-made ingredients.  I assume since all the ingredients are taken from the earth in this product, is the reason for this clean buzz I am getting.  It clears your mind and makes it feel like your brain is working at 100% efficiency, which improves all fascists of daily life.  Also, I notice it immediately clears up the food in my stomach and increases the speed of digestion.  One other last benefit I have noticed since taking this the past 2 days, is it's effects on smelling/breathing.  My lung's seem to be much more clearer and sense of smell increased.  This is coming from a smoker as well.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this to ANYONE regardless of your health.

review/summary: Has Good Ingredients-Hard to Tell Effects
review/text: I purchased this drink supplement some time back, and after trying it, quit, because of the gritty tasteless feel it had in my mouth.  Finally tried it again since I didn't want to throw it away, this time with apple juice (which I only purchased by chance to make BBQ).  That was everything, tasted okay, not bad at all.  I now take it more regularly. The container says to try it with juice, but I never did.<br /><br />On the container, it uses the term "delicious".  I would say thats misleading, but with apple juice or whatever works for you, its not bad at all.<br /><br />I don't notice any effects, which I think is hard for most people anyway.  I drink it because I think its<br />healthy and I want to optimize my heath.

review/summary: This can be addicting
review/text: I saw this at Fresh and Easy and thought - I bet you I can get this on Amazon for cheaper (and free shipping since I have Prime).  And yes, I was right (I heart Amazon).<br /><br />So far I love this stuff.  I mix a scoop with coconut milk and sometimes I add other things like Fish Oil (orange flavored), and MCT oil and the mix is tastes really good.  I have not yet tried this with water.<br /><br />The texture has particles in it that aren't clumpy or sticky.  You don't have to gulp it down to swallow the sediment as it's comprised of tiny grains.  I use my Magic Bullet to mix this up so I'm not sure what others have said about the clump factor via manual mixing.<br /><br />At any rate, this is good so far and I'm happy but sad because I can see myself following the instructions and taking this three times a day.  Which means of course, I'll have to buy more real soon.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Great Product!  Cheapest on Amazon!
review/text: New user of this product; it's somewhat difficult to disolve w/o a blender.  But, it's totally palatable when mixed with 8oz of OJ.  Not sure of long term results yet, but it does seem to give me an energy boost.  The powder is more economical than the liquid shots.  I'm sold!<br /><br />6/1/12 Update: They have new packaging, and, unfortunately a new formula that has omitted the siberian ginseng (boosts energy, immunity and concentration) that was in their previous formula.  Disappointed.

review/summary: Not everyone will like the taste, but you'll love how you feel!
review/text: You may not like how this tastes. As others have stated it does taste "earthy". However, I find it has a cocoa taste at first. I don't mind it mixed with water, but it does get harder to drink the closer you get to the bottom. I tend to stir it before every sip. I prefer this mixed into my morning smoothie (mixed frozen berries, a banana, some 1% milk, and a handful of spinach = YUM!). I'm a juicer and also enjoy mixing this in to my juice blends. The best part is how you will feel. I'm a teacher, and when I take this in the morning (6:30ish), I do not need/want breakfast and do not eat until lunch (11:45). It gives me amazing energy starting about an hour after consumption and the energy lasts all day... there's no crash. Your body will definitely thank you for drinking this.

review/summary: Finally an easy way to get your vegetables
review/text: The hardest part about trying to lose weight is, obviously, eating healthy. There are literally fast food restaurants everywhere! And if you have the willpower to walk into one and leave with a salad then you have more will power than most. Enter the Green Superfood. No longer do I stop to pick up a bagel and coffee on my way in to work. I now make a breakfast smoothie consisting of soy milk, 1 scoop of peanut butter, a banana, one scoop of protein powder, some ice cubes, and the green superfood. I've never felt so energized in my life.<br /><br />I'm no nutritionist or dermatologist so I can't confirm whether you'll see improvements to your health or skin, but I can tell you that I feel great and have no desire for junk food. I recommend the product whole heartedly. Only downside to me is that I can only ingest the stuff when I include it in my morning smoothie. The taste is just too "grassy" if you will when simply mixed in with juice or water.<br /><br />Again, great product and best of luck to you in your quest to get healthy.

review/text: I'm so glad I found this Green Superfood drink - many of the drinks I've tried are so sweet, I can't stand them.  This has a nice mild flavor.  I'm hoping it'll be effective... but I like the taste and it's not overly powerful in flavor or sweetness, so that's a big plus for me.

review/summary: Great way to get the nutrients you may be missing
review/text: I use this every morning in my smoothies. Would I drink it alone with water? No way. It does not taste amazing on its own, and I still have not found a similar product that I would drink just with water. I think they all taste like grass and twigs, so if you like that sort of thing, more power to you! Drink up! I suggest mixing with a morning smoothie or something that will make it more palatable. It also does not dissolve well on its on, so, again, smoothie is ideal. Why do I give it 5 stars then? Because it does what it says it will do. I get tons of nutrients to help energizer me in the morning and assist with my digestive system. I am usually on the run, so this is a great way to get the nutrition I need to stay healthy.

review/text: Its a little grainy but not very. I do constantly mix it as i drink in between drinking periods. Its my first day drinking it so i dont know the benefits or energy i should feel, i do feel tired after drinking it the past 2 times, but it could be my new sleep cycle lol i put a scoop in a cup and add juice. So far the juice i added to it was 'mango peach, pineapple' drink. I think it goes better with peach or mango flavors alone a well. So far its been a great buy.<br /><br />I dont know what people are complaining about! It tastes like a green machine smoothie drink from the Naked brand drinks..when i mixed it with the juice i mentioned lol<br /><br />I'll keep you posted!

review/text: Knowing I don't pay enough attention to my health, I've made some changes, and this Super Green food is one of them. I cut up fresh pineapple and a banana, put in blender and pour water just to cover (You could use milk or soy milk, etc), then one scoop of this (The scoop comes in the package) I drink this every morning, and then go out and take a walk. It blends in fine in the blender, and the taste is good when mixed with the juice. It is very mild smelling and tasting. I've never tried any other green supplements, and after trying this one, I don't think I need to. I'm going to reorder. I have more energy, my mind is clearer, and I am much more regular now.

review/text: It does taste like hay or grass to me.  That being said, it's ground up grass and greens, so what do you expect?  I tried it mixed into to water and I gagged as I choked it down, but mixed with my pea protein powder (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OP5ZHE/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00) it doesn't taste to bad.  I have only been drinking it for a couple of days, but I already feel like it gives me more energy.
