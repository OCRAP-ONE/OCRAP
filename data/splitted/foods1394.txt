review/summary: worth the convenience
review/text: These are the best! They may be a little more expensive then regular applesauce in a cup but it is so worth it when your kids (any age) suck them down one after another and you have NO mess to clean up. They don't even know they are healthly!

review/summary: SUPER SOUR!!!
review/text: My 5.5 yr old son LOVES apricots and sweet potatoes so I was excited to try this flavor. I tried a sample package sold at Target and it tasted pretty good so I ordered a bunch online. He took one taste of this batch and handed it right back to me. I tasted it and whoa- it is SUUUUUPER SOUR - much more so than the one I tried at the store!?!? It gave me goosebumps! Wha???? I now wonder if they changed the recipe, started using unripe apricots or I mistakenly bought the wrong brand of this combo??? I'll have to try mixing it with some applesauce in a GU bottle or try to add it to my baked sweet potatoe/apple dish so it's not a total waste of money. Beware of this flavor!

review/summary: HORRIBLE tasting
review/text: I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a VERY picky eater.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and vegetable servings each day.  This does NOT do the trick!  He took one suck, made a horrible face, and has refused it since.  I tried it thinking it couldn't be THAT bad.  It was.  Terribly bitter (just the thought makes my mouth water) and runny.  No wonder he wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't either!  I did buy some of the other varieties offered by HappyBaby and he loves them.  I think this is just a bad taste combo.  Yuck!

review/text: This is probably my toddler's favorite pouch.  I have to admit, there's a lot of lemon juice in this mix, which makes the pouch somewhat sour.  My toddler loves lemons though so this is just exactly his taste.  If you're unsure whether your baby likes sour, don't buy this in bulk - it's probably for an acquired taste! :)

review/text: My one year old can actually "drink" these right from the package, using the spout like a straw, which makes these a super convenient option to have for snacks when we're out and about--no bib or spoon needed. He has food allergies, so finding processed foods that meet his needs and are still healthy and conveninent can be tough. He has loved all of the Happy Baby products we've tried. The multi-packs are a great deal and it is nice to be able to stock up this way instead of just buying singles from the only store around here that carries them.

review/text: I found these at Target a few months back and decided to give them a try for my dairy/soy allergic one year old son. It is tough finding on-the-go food options for him that meet with his dietary needs and satisfy my pickiness for healthy kids food. The deals for the multi-packs are great. My little one is old enough now that with a bit of help, he can just suck the food straight from the "spout" of the package like a straw and he LOVES them. He gets so excited when he sees me pull one out and they are so easy to throw in a purse or diaper bag so that I always have a good snack for him with me, no bib or utensils needed.

review/summary: Tasty & Nutritious in one easy to administer pouch!
review/text: My 15 month-old twin boys aren't big fans of spinach, but they LOVE these pouches. This is a great combination with the mangos and pears and you can still taste the spinach. Anytime my boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.  Also try the Beets, Blueberries, and Banana combo!!!<br /><br />These pouches are especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage. For the teethers, it's been helpful for us to place a few pouches in the fridge. For the picky eaters, we administer a swig of this inbetween bites and we can cram in a few more bites. These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy. If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food. The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all. Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later and if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack. No yucky jar top taste, no spoons to mess around with, and the combinations are tasty.  Just make sure your little one doesn't place the tops in their mouths.  Mine have done that a couple of times but with all the advantages of these pouches, I can keep an eye on the top a bit more.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save through Amazon, it's so much more cost saving than purchasing these in the stores.

The only hard this is that she can't open the cap by herself (which I don't mind, or else, she's "break into them").  The cap is also resealable, which is nice in case.  I highly recommend these. I used to buy Ella's Kitchen Organic Smoothies and baby food pouches, but they are WAY more expensive!  The taste is just as great!  Buy these!

review/text: All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.

review/summary: AWESOME Products
review/text: I started using HAPPYBABY foods when my son was about nine months old.  At that time I was only aware of their frozen line.  I was SO EXCITED to hear about their pouches.  Although my son is now eating solids, I purchased some of the Stage 2 and 3 to use as snacks/fillers for other meals.  I loved the food combinations in the pouches.  An added plus, all the pouch packaging is BPA and pthlate free.<br /><br />My son loves the pouches.  I put the Stage 3 meat combos over pasta with a little cheese sprinkled on top for a nutritious, great tasting meal for my son (or the whole family).  He thinks he's getting a special treat.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend HAPPYBABY products.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Pouches Not Recyclable
review/text: This product tries to skirt the fact that the pouches are NOT recyclable, and the caps are a choking hazard. It doesn't make a lot of sense....buy an organic food product that puts more trash in the landfill. They toss around the buzz phrase "BPA free", but it is still more plastic going into the landfill. And, they use another buzz phrase, "lower carbon footprint than glass jars". Huh? Glass may have a higher carbon footprint, but it can be (and is) recycled over & over into food containers. Plastic cannot be recycled into new food containers. Yes the caps are recyclable, but recycled plastic often has no market for reuse. And, make sure your child doesn't try to eat them first.

review/text: My 2 year old daughter loves these sort of squeeze pouches so I ordered a whole case of these thinking that I could sneak some veggies in. Unfortunately this is not the case. These are so sour that she shudders after taking a sip!  So just says "don't like it!" and wants the plain mango one. Curious, I tried it and although it has a very sweet taste in the beginning the after taste of sour beets is awful!  Be prepared, if your little ones aren't a fan of beets, they may not be a fan of this flavor!

I am going to keep it so that when he older I can mix it with some oatmeal for breakfast.

review/text: I was hoping to "sneak" beets into my sons snack, but there is no hiding with this brand. In fact, the beet flavor is rather overwhelming, and rather on the "raw" side. I enjoy beets, pickled and roasted, but this flavor is just not appealing at all. If your kid loves beets (maybe even raw ones?) go for it.  Also, someone commented on it being a runny consistency but my recently ordered batch is on the thick side.

This was his first mix of foods after he's had his first foods an ingredient at a time...You should see how he opens his mouth big like he's about to swallow me whole every single time I bring one of these to him and am about to open it. It is so convenient, too...because when we are out at the park or after a doctor's appointment and he's hungry, I can just take one of these out of the diaper bag and squeeze it into the spoon for him to eat it. Also, when he only has half of it, we put the rest in the fridge and then in the evening we heat it up in a bowl of hot water. It's also great that we never actually touch the food w/ the spoon, so no bacteria goes into the pouch...We love it...We really have no negatives about it...I'm about to order a new batch now as we're vising some friends in TX next week and we need to grab food for the plane and also for the trip. These are great because they're not as heavy as the jars.

I would like some more flavors with veggies in them!

review/summary: Pears and pears
review/text: I was happy to see the list of ingredients here listing the peas and broccoli before the pears, thinking that as in package ingredients the larger ingredients are listed first. But after ordering I see on the package ingredient list that, yes, pears are the majority of the ingredients. Common but misleading the way this prodcut description was written.

review/summary: Sweet and a little tart, but delicious and fresh!
review/text: We were a bit apprehensive about purchasing this banana, beet and blueberry flavor after reading several reviews that it was sour and their children did not like the taste.  However, our 8-month old daughter loved this flavor and in fact, hasn't opened her mouth as widely for any of the other Happy Baby flavors as she did with this one.  The consistency looks like a berry smoothie and it smelled great.  So I tasted it and it does have a bit of a tart taste, but it's very slight to me.  I almost wanted to finish it because it had just enough sweetness to go with the slightly tart taste.  It's too bad this isn't made in the 4.2oz package because our daughter usually wants just a bit more than what comes in this package.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than some other organic brands, but well worth the price.  In our opinion, the flavors taste so much more natural and fresh and taste great to us as adults rather than having that "baby food" type of taste that many brands have.<br /><br />Also, there is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4BV5U">Plum Organics Dispensing Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that can screw onto this packaging as well as the Plum Organics packages of food.  It comes with a carrying case for the spoon tips.  This makes feeding time so much easier when you screw the spoon onto the package and then can easily throw away the package and put the spoon tip back in the case rather than having to bring a separate spoon and container to squeeze the food into so you can feed your baby.

review/summary: Too sour, 16 months old doesn't like it at all. A waste of my money!!!
review/text: My boy is not a picky eater. He likes these pouched food except this flavor: it is too sour, even I have a problem with it! He is eager to try, sometimes he even takes it out of the food storage box and asks me to open for him, but after one sip or two, he gives up. Now I am stuck with a box of these, not knowing what to do with it. I'd like to give them away, but if my son doesn't like them, how can I know if other babies will eat it? I will not buy them again. My mistake was that I didn't read all the reviews on this item :(. A hard lesson learned!

review/text: We love these. They are absolutely delicious and the handy pouch is convenient for sipping on the go. A previous reviewer indicated the puree is a bit thin for a spoon and I agree with that. However, it doesn't bother me because if your diaper bag space is at a premium, like mine, you can forget the spoon and just sip from the pouch. My 7 month old has no problem doing this.

review/summary: Too sweet!
review/text: We generally make food for our little one at home, but I wanted to try a couple pouches because they seem like a good option for throwing into the diaper bag.  I chose the Happy Baby Broccoli, Peas and Pear because of the great reviews from other parents.  It's true, our baby opens his mouth WIDE for this stuff.  He is a fairly good eater of whatever we give him, but I don't think I've seen him this excited to eat since he first started on solids.  The problem is, I tasted a tiny bit of it and it was extremely sweet.  The package doesn't list any additional sugars or sweeteners, but I find it hard to believe that pears can be THAT sweet.  Even if the sugar comes 100% from the pears and is natural, I still think it's too much.  I'll be mixing it in with oatmeal until it's done and after that I will try a couple other brands to see if there is anything less sweet out there.  If not...I'll just have to suck it up and bring homemade food with me everywhere.

review/text: My baby started refusing baby food at 9 mos and my 2.5yr old is a picky eater. I started ordering all of the different flavors of the HappyBaby and HappyTot (which has the magic supergrain Salba in them)line through the automatic delivery service (which lowers the price/amazon mom's helps too) and I call them smoothies. My toddler gobbles these up and asks for more! Even the ones that are green bean, peas, pear, and salba. It's like a miracle! My baby eats them too, but not with quite as much enthusiasm. It makes me feel so nice that my kids are getting some good for them stuff and I don't need to break my neck trying to do it. Oh and they are wonderfully anti-messy. I shove a few in my purse when I know we will be out during hungry times.

review/text: All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.

review/text: I like the idea of the pouch baby food, but I was hoping that with a baby on the cover and a Stage 2 written on it, that it would be thicker. It was almost like water. It was a disaster.

review/text: We're big HappyBaby fans here, and this flavor pouch is one of my favorites for my son, who is now two. I tried to make my own baby food for him when we were first introducing solids, but I had trouble finding all the fresh organic fruits and vegetables during certain times of the year -- and apricot was one of them. I would have never thought to combine apricots and sweet potatoes on my own, but the combination works! I love that it is really nutrient dense and an easy snack for on the go. My son is in the picky-eater phase and these pouches help get the veggies in! I also think this pouch is the reason behind his current love of dried apricots :) Overall, this is a great flavor combination and a super nutritious food for little ones.<br /><br />I don't find that these pouches are runny like other commenters have mentioned, FYI.

review/summary: Delicious, healthy ingredients!
review/text: I love all of the HappyBaby pouches because of their fresh taste and healthy ingredients. My toddlers love feeding themselves with these. I also mix it in their yogurt and even make smoothies for myself. This is one of my favorite flavors to use because of the health benefits of blueberries and beets (plus my little ones love the taste!) HappyBaby makes it so easy to introduce my kids to a wide variety of fruits and veggies.

review/summary: Daughter's Favorite
review/text: This is my daughter's favorite Stage 2 food! This smells great and actually tastes good. Why would I give my daughter something that tasted bad? I always mix her Stage 2 foods with baby cereal (sometimes yogurt). I switch this out with the Stage 2 Spinach, Mango, Pear pouches.<br /><br />Some things you should know about Happy Baby:<br /><br />Organic ingredients<br />BPA-free packaging<br />Many Vegan choices<br />Gluten free snacks<br />Stage 1 and Stage 2 Pouches are Kosher<br />No GMO's<br />Allergy conscious (no soy, gluten, dairy, or added sugar, and processed in a nut free facility)

review/summary: Update: Runny Consistency Good on the Go!
review/text: My daughter loves this (as well as every other Happy Baby food she has tried)! The only reason I docked a star is because the consistency is thin. I normally mix all of her Stage 2 foods with cereal, so it's not a big deal for us. However, if your baby eats this straight, try one of the various "squeezie" spoons on the market. It is too runny to use a traditional spoon.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I changed my rating to five stars. Yes, it's still a bit runny. However, I have found this to actually be a good thing.<br /><br />My daughter is almost seven months old. We were out the other day, and I had a pouch of this food in the diaper bag. I had just gotten her seated for lunch when I realized that I'd forgotten her bowl, spoon, and cereal to mix with the food. I decided to let her try to "eat" it directly from the pouch. (We both drink homemade green smoothies a lot. The consistency is similar.) It was great! She was easily able to suck it out of the pouch, with me holding the pouch, making sure that there was always food near the opening. She only spilled a tiny bit onto her bib. It also took less than five minutes for her to eat!<br /><br />I am going to keep a pouch of this food in the diaper bag from now on. It's great that I don't have to worry about carting a bowl, spoon, and container of cereal anymore. However, I will continue to mix it with cereal at home.

review/summary: Great first baby's food!
review/text: These flavors are so subtle (I ate a whole one before I gave to my kids!) but so great to have your tot introduced to such healhty veggies!<br />I've added about half to jarred organic pasta sauce and it gave it a sweet mild taste...all 3 of my kids loved it!<br />I like that if my little one only eats a bit of the pouch, I can put the cap back on and keep in the frig for later in the day or tomorrow.<br />My 2 year old (picky!) will now eat broccoli most times I give it to him and I'm sure it's because he was used to the flavor in the tot!

review/summary: Yummy Flavor!
review/text: My 2 year old loves these tots!  I started feeding these to my son when I would squeeze them in to a bowl and feed with a spoon when he was under a year.  After that, I would give the pouch to him and he would drink it like it had a straw in it.  It wasn't messy at all!<br />The spinach gives it a savory taste while the mango and pear make it a bit sweet~the falvors combined are perfect!<br />It's a great snack to throw into your purse.<br />I also like the it's dairy and gluten free and not processed in a facility that processes nuts1

review/summary: Used to be the only way I could get veggies down my baby!
review/text: Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.  I'm sure she would have survived without veggies, but it still bothered me that she wasn't eating any.  (It's a mom thing I guess!)  I saw these in the store and thought that the combinations of fruits and veggies in these looked "interesting."  I picked up a few, not really expecting my little one to like them.  However, she really liked them - a lot.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they come in a pouch that she can feed to herself.<br /><br />Not only were these great to give her as an infant, she still enjoys these as a toddler.  These are great to take with on outings - when it's otherwise difficult to give her produce.  She can eat these without making a mess and we don't have to worry about spoilage.  So far, she has liked all of the flavors.  I like the fact that these aren't stored in plastic or in jars with BPA.  I wish that these would have been available years ago.  :)

review/summary: What a great snack
review/text: These pouches are wonderful to keep in the diaper bag. They do not require refrigeration or heating so it's great for on the go. My son likes to hold the pouch and feed himself (warning: I always put it in his mouth for the initial squeeze or else he will squeeze so hard it flies in the air).  I also use them in the house for those days when he says no to all other foods. He has never turned down one of these pouches. Figure it's more nutritious than eating goldfish crackers for a meal.

review/summary: Most convenient way to feed a baby ever!
review/text: I love these little food packs.  I squeeze the puree directly onto a spoon and feed my baby, and that way no dishes get dirty other than the spoon.  He loves these purees, he'll eat any flavor and they seem quite natural and healthy.  As he gets older he can even suck directly out of the pouch, though sometimes he squeezes too hard and makes a little mess if I let him hold it himself.  They are also super portable and conveniently stored.

review/text: So I bought a couple of these for my son's birthday party to put in a goody bag for the babies that were attending. The moms went crazy over them. I don't find the consistency to be thin like other reviews have expressed. In fact, I ended up using the left over pouches for my 5 year old daughter's lunches. I used it on her almond butter sandwiches instead of jelly. So I thought the consistency was fine.<br />The taste was obviously delicious as my daughter didn't even notice the difference. Plus organic, no GMO, BPA free...can't really beat that.

I highly recommend this product and company. no gmos and organic what a mom wants in food that she didnt make. it is thin but makes it easy to eat out of pouch with little to no sucking involved. i even like them, but i try all food before i give it to my son, quite tasty!

review/text: I was so impressed with this product that I felt compelled to write about it. My 14 month old picky eater would not eat ANYTHING but toddler formula and english muffins. I started cooking for him since he was 5 months old and he ate well but something happened when I went back to work and he no longer accepts "good" food. However, he happily ate entire pack of HappyBaby Spinach, Mango & Pear and asked for more two days in the row! My husband is a Mr. Mom for now so weight off his shoulders as far as feeding. We ordered other flavors and hoping trend with eating organic veggies and fruits will continue with our picky eater.

review/text: My 8 month old has eaten nearly on the flavors of ellas, happy baby/tot, and sprout meals.  This one is so tart, she shuttered with a sour face and then started to cry- something that NEVER happens.  I tasted it and it is pretty sour (I like sour), perhaps overwhelmingly so for a fresh pallette (not a beat up adult one). I served it along with a savory meal and she was fine with that but I wont be buying it again.  May be good for an adult smoothie where you want some tang.

They are such a fantastic way to get quality foods into picky bodies.<br /><br />However, this is the only combo that he has refused to eat.  I've tried it multiple times, and he continues to leave the pouch full after taking just one sip.

review/summary: A Very Good Sugar-free Catsup
review/text: After starting the Jorge Cruise Belly Fat Cure eating plan, I made an effort to replace the sugar laden items we generally use with xylitol-sweetened ones. Nature's Hollow is the only one of this type on the market. As another reviewer stated, it is a little on the runny side, but I find the taste very good and it works well in cooking where I need a catsup. It also makes a good sugar-free barbecue sauce base for a recipe I devised using sauteed onion, liquid smoke, added xylitol, dry mustard, Worcestershire, bourbon and hot pepper sauce.<br /><br />I'm a bit of a purist and won't use artificially-sweetened products, so that leaves xylitol or other sugar alcohol sweeteners and stevia. Nature's Hollow sugar-free catsup is a very nice substitute.
