review/summary: Overwhelming scent
review/text: May have just been a glitch in the batch that I received, but upon opening the bag there was an overwhelming scent from the lavender and bergamot. Made a few batches anyway to try it out, and each one was like drinking straight lavender and bergamot. I've ordered other teas from Davidson's before and they were all great. Not sure what happened with this one.

review/summary: Great Value
review/text: My stores of Teavana and Tea Geschwender teas had run low and I needed to re-order but hated to spend the money. I wanted try a bulk tea option from Amazon to use my Prime shipping option. I bought Davidson's Early Grey with Lavender and Green tea with Lemon and Ginseng. Both were just as good as anything I bought from the other stores and around 4-6 times cheaper. I was a little worried about some of the reviews which implied some differences in quality batch to batch. I guess I got lucky this time. The Earl Grey was very similar to Earl Grey Creme from Teavana although I liked the Davidson's actually a little better.<br /><br />  I'm very happy so far, the main problem is going to be drinking 2 pounds of tea before they go stale (12-18 months is usually reccomended when in air tight containers). Then I will see what the next batch is like

review/text: I was not sure about ordering a large amount of this tea when I did not know how it tasted, but I shouldn't have been worried at all.  Upon opening the package it had a very strong fragrance but the fragrance was not overpowering when brewed.  The tea is nice and smooth and is even good without any added sweetener.  We had guests over when I made it for the first time and they liked it so much that they just had to know the type of tea.

review/summary: Nice Zen energy boost.
review/text: After visiting an English tea house and having my first earl grey lavender blend, I searched for similar product and did not come close until purchasing this loose leaf tea.  The REV tea did not cut it for me and I was disappointed until I came across this brand.  The Earl Grey caffiene is an effective energy boost, but the lavender also has a Zen calming effect --this might seem contradictory.  To further explain, I use this to wake up in the morning and it allows me to productive in a calm manner without the frantic panic that can sometimes come from having too much caffeine.  This tea is a great value per ounce compared to bagged tea.  A little goes a long way.  In fact, a little pinch appears to expand to 7X it's volume after puttting in the water -- besides the flower bud tea I have had, I have not seen this amount of expansion in other teas before and definatly not the expansion I have seen from any bagged tea.  Very pleasant taste.  I don't get the reviews about too much lavender. Earl Grey is a very strong tea and the lavender has to be strong to not get buried under the flavor of the Earl Grey.

review/summary: Great tasting Earl Gray and Lavender Tea
review/text: It's a lovely combination of earl gray/lavender tea, the menthol of the lavender is not overwhelming and the earl gray is the perfect combination, since earl gray denotes hints of bergmont which has citrus undertones. Please do not let the smell when you first open the bag deter you from brewing it. If it's a bit overwhelming in flavor cut it with some black tea. I personally love the lavender and do not want a weak insipid flavor, I wanted the full lavender experience.

review/summary: Earl Grey - er??
review/text: My wife and I have been searching for a replacement for a more floral variety of Earl Grey tea that we enjoyed for years, but can no longer get. As I paged through Davidson's tea catalog I saw this blend and decided to give it a try. I was pleased by the aroma of lavender and bergamot when I opened the package, and so was my wife, so the first thing we did was brew a pot and give it the taste test. I'm glad to say it passed the test, though with just perhaps a tiny bit too much lavender - but that is being very picky. The pricing is good; packaging is excellent; delivery was timely. We like this tea and will be re-ordering in the future. We give this a very high recommendation.

review/summary: delicious from a tea-lover, good ethical choice
review/text: I am so happy to find this tea--and all of Davidson's bulk teas--on Amazon for such an affordable price.<br /><br />First of all, I have visited tea plantations in South Asia, and out of respect for the workers, I believe very strongly in buying organic teas, not only for my family's health but for the health of workers who would otherwise be getting cancers and all kinds of health problems from spraying the pesticides day after day.<br /><br />At the same time, Fair Trade and organic teas can be much more expensive! but this tea solves the problem. I love buying it in bulk, and the 16 oz lasts us awhile, and it is not very costly.<br /><br />Secondly, THIS TEA IS DELICIOUS. I am a big bergamot fan, and all of Davidson's earl grey teas have a delightful amount of it. They are also stored in packaging that retains the bergamot oil even after several months after being opened.<br /><br />The lavender addition is calming and quite nice, hot or iced.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

review/summary: A good simple tea very well priced
review/text: The ingredients are black tea, oil of bergemot, and lavendar, all organic.  Mixed at 1tsp per 8oz and steeped 3 min the taste is a mild earl grey.  Much less robustly  flavorful than say Tazo earl grey or Rishi.  Some here have complained that is was too lavender but i'd say the batch I got was too weak on the lavendar, it tastes very close to earl grey.  The flavor has a distinct citrus note.  Which makes sense because Bergemot is citrus, but it is noticably more lemony than Tazo or Rishi.  My preference is for Rishi when I'm in the mood for a hearty tea with lots of lavendar and fragrance and less lemon.  But when I want a simple cup of hot tea this fits the bill and is better than the deflavorized supermarket so-called teas.  The big deal here is the price.  16 oz  for 11$ versus 3.3oz for $11 for rishi.  Now the RIshi is totally worth that price in the spectrum of tea, but mild teas have their place too.  This does have a good caffeine kick.  If you oversteep it, it does become bitter, but that is how most earl greys are.

review/text: The flavor of Italian sausage comes through in this product, but it is not overpowering as some Italian sausage can be. The fennel flavor is mild like it should be (in my opinion) and my only addition to this would be adding a little more red pepper to kick it up a notch. Some can't handle spicy, so I guess I will just have to 'doctor' it up myself. It is good for a quick meal (about 20 minutes from start to finish if hamburger is not frozen). Add a salad and some garlic bread and you have a complete meal.

review/text: I used these for the first time this summer hiking the Grand Canyon and other places out west, we took down bottled sport drink and these tablets to save weight. At home I tried them and thought they taste like watered down grape jello, but not bad. On the trip I was amazed, sports drinks got hot and tasted gross and sticky, made you feel bloated yet still thirsty. These little tabs cover the taste of water, didn't make your mouth feel gross and you could feel the pick up it gave you. Completely satisfied with the product and willing to try other flavors. It was easy to use, pop them in your bottle and they fizz away, a quick shake and your ready to go. Don't pop them in your mouth, as a buddy of mine did thinking thats how you used them, he gagged his way through for quite a while, I still laugh at the memory.

review/summary: Relief from the Texas sun
review/text: These are great. As a Central Texas deck builder, I'm in the sun all day long. After years of struggling with hydration, I've finally found a solution. I freeze 2, 1 liter bottles and 1 gallon bottle every nite. I add 1 tab to each bottle and I haven't had a single problem hydrating this summer, no cramping at all. THANKS

Roughly chop and add to pot.<br />Deglaze onion/garlic pan with tomatoes, allow to reduce slightly.<br />Pour over roast & veg.<br />Cook 3-5 hours on high or 5-7 on low until meat is falling apart.<br />Serve over basmati rice.<br />Yum!

review/summary: If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash
review/text: Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach "is green and sticks in your teeth" in comparison to the water that "comes in a cool bottle." Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual "special" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids "buying power" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach.

review/text: I liked the sound of these chips (thus the purchase), but I am so far disappointed.  They don't seem crispy to me.  I have never had sweet potato chips before so perhaps sweet potato chips are naturally softer than regular potato chips.  These chips are not soft soft;  they are just less crisp than I am used to.  The flavor doesn't thrill me either:  they're sweet, but not super-sweet.  Perhaps a little more time in the oven, a touch of honey, and/or an extra dose of salt would help (this is coming from a salt addict).  I am having a hard time eating these chips by themselves, hopefully a good dip can save them for me:  I have 11 packages to go!

review/summary: No longer Superior, but Douwe and less convenient
review/text: I've used Superior Capuccino for 15 years and Amway, who originally distributed it in 2 boxes of 50 envelopes each for $30, sold it to Sara Lee, who sold it again. It's no longer available in the single-serve envelope, but in a 2lb. bag and you have to use 4 heaping teaspoons to get the same 1 1/2 cup size serving, as opposed to 2 envelopes. It's a wonderful product, but, as I've learned, coffee products are apt to disappear and reappear, as has the International Foods Capuccino Coolers, once available in cartons of 12 boxes w/6 envelopes each. It's been sold to General Foods, who now sell only original, mocha and french vanilla in 2-quart carton. The hazelnut is no longer available and your drink will become too sweet if you add flavored creamer to it. The caffeine is much less, as well. I have located the original hazelnut flavor, today, but at scalper prices. BOO!

review/text: First off, the supplier is excellent, they ship fast and they have many interesting products.  Persian (let's say) pistachio nuts are suppose to be the best, and being a pistachio fan, I had to see if the claim is true.  This is the third time I've tried various types of middle eastern pistachios, and the Tadim nuts were fresh and clean.  Aside from being smaller than the bloach California nuts found in every grocery store by the bin load, they also . . . don't taste nearly as good.  Check them out for yourself, it's a good thing to try new foods from around the world, but don't expect the hype to come true.

review/text: True Himalayan Pink Salt.  I won't bore you with all the wonderful benefits of this mineral-rich salt.  I'll figure you won't be here if you aren't already aware of them.<br /><br />This is excellent, rich, pink salt.  It is ground very well, and is suitable for use as both kitchen and table salt. It has a nice flavor and works perfectly in all our recipes. If you plan to store it in a shaker, you want to add some uncooked rice in with it, or it will lump badly.  It is very fine, so it absorbs all the moisture, without rice to help it.<br /><br />We love the quality of this brand, and will buy more, and more. :)

review/summary: Best Tasting Salt AND So Incredibly Good For You
review/text: This is the best tasting salt I've ever had.  I learned about this after starting a "raw" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw.  I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo).  I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur.  However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it.  This really does enhance almost every dish I eat.  In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us.  Move over table salt with your history of ridicule and side effects; move in Himalayan salt.

review/summary: Product not as described
review/text: Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.  The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt.  I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it.  If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food.  This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled "finely ground".<br /><br />I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.  The three stars are only because the salt was not what I would consider finely ground.

review/summary: Delicious Nutritious Non-nuclear Salt at a Great Price
review/text: I love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range.<br /><br />This salt, I think, may be the same as that sold by David Wolfe's LongevityWarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price.  Not only are the descriptions similar, but comparing the salts side-by-side, they have the exact same color, flavor, texture, grind, fragrance, etc in my opinion.<br /><br />Himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the Fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the Pacific Ocean last year if not before.  Many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or YouTube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it.  I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.  If the sea salt wasn't harvested before Fukushima started dumping nuclear waste, it is just too risky to ingest.<br /><br />This salt is from the Himalayas which may be just as far from Fukushima's dumping ground as you can get!

The salt taste about knocked me off my feet! The 2 pounds of this salt will last a very long time! I can use a lot less to salt whatever I want to have a salted flavour. It takes very little sprinkled on food or when cooking to obtain the desired salt flavour. It is great salt and it will last much longer than normal every day salt from the grocery store down town that I usualy buy for 78 cents to a dollar something. I recomend all people give this salt a try. As far as Iodine as a nessary nutriant, just eat potatoes ever so often and you will get the nessary iodine that you need in your diet, so no worries there. I can not wait to try this Himalayan Salt on Popcorn. I have been very un-satisfied with the normal every day salt from the store for a long time. Even sea salt has no "punch" to it like this salt. This is salt as it was meant to be and taste. (my opinion)

review/summary: good salt, good price, but not fine!
review/text: I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt.

review/summary: Very pretty, but would not buy again
review/text: I bought this as an alternative to the sea salts that I normally purchase.  I find that the salt does not dissolve fully - it leaves a gritty residue behind, whether in sauces, soups, pickles or pasta water.  The flavor is fine, and when cooked in dishes the grit doesn't seem to be an issue, but I like my salts to be versatile, and this one doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I've got a Himalayan pink salt cooking plate, and I'm quite satisfied with that, but I don't use any liquid when cooking with it.

I did think the shipping was a bit steep but I don't often ship a "pound" of something. I kind of felt the shipping was making up the sales price but maybe it was justified.

review/text: I won't bore you with stats about salt, the good bad or ugly. Yes, you are supposed to take it in moderation, so when you do salt your food, it should be done with this salt. It is a really high quality pure, and tasty treat. It offers a little more distinction that your Kosher Sea Salt, which is a bland NaCL. This is chock full of trace minerals that your body needs.<br /><br />Bottom line: good product.

review/summary: This salt blows away "Real" salt!
review/text: I went to the Sunflower Market in Dallas and got a bag of Real salt from Utah. It is way better in flavor than chemical salt however the dirt and sand are off putting! You see, I add salt to all my drinking water and right away noticed real salt was leaving a sand-looking substance at the bottom of the bottle so I could only drink 80% of the water before re-filling. Real salt is the laziest company I know for not using an evaporation/filtering process to remove the dirt and sand!<br /><br />I am now the happy new owner of 4 lbs of Himalayan salt and it's not only clean unlike real salt, it tastes 10 levels better too! The company also has something like 200 different salts for your salt tasting pleasure! I will be ordering much more and sending as a gift to all my friends and family! This stuff is the "real" deal unlike Real LOL. Real salt should use as their motto "Hey, just tryin' to keep it real"<br />LOL ...losers

When I smoke Salmon, I will dry rub this salt on to the fish 8 hours before I hot smoke it with hickory.  Himalayan salt taste is quite unique and the flavor it imparts to smoked meats and fish is very good.  It is not at all bitter as some other salts are.

review/summary: Pine Salt
review/text: Perfectly ground Himalayan salt or pink salt.  This was recommended by a holistic practioner and is stronger tasting than regular salt.  I use this salt for all my salt uses including cooking but cut the amount in half since it is so salty.  This salt is not processed like other salts so is not iodized if you need that process.  We like it much better that our regular table or kosher salt.

review/text: I had been looking for this for a while and hadn't been able locate it locally. I prefer it over sea salt or kosher. It is amazingly smooth with slight but perceptible mineral notes in the flavor. Kosher type salts seem to have a sharper edge to the taste. I highly recommend it for steaks or grilled salmon. It also gives a unique flavor and appearance to margaritas. Wonderful product.

review/text: One reviewer  described The spice Lab Finely Ground Himalayan Salt  grains as being too  being large.  Not mine.  Mine  is finer than course kosher salt.<br /> I ordered a small package first to check it out and now I am ready to spring for a big one.<br /> It seems to take less salt,  it's easy to control with your "pinches", and it tastes great!<br /><br /> I love the consistency of this Himalayan.  It is in no way as fine as table salt but somewhere in between table and Kosher - leaning more to the Kosher.  Maybe half as fine as course Kosher.<br />  Some salts I have bought have just been too fine for me to predict how much salt I'm really adding.  I'm not good with really finely ground salts and end up over salting or under salting.<br /> I like to see each individual grain of salt if you will...and I can with this  Himalayan.<br /><br />I couldn't be more pleased and the price is good too.  Came in great shape nicely packaged...
