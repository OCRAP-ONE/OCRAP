review/summary: Greatly improved my dog's skin and fur
review/text: When I adopted my dog he had a rash all over his body and big hairless patches. He is a white pitbull with very short fur, so he was pink and raw all over. I switched him to this food and after several months his coat grew in thick and soft everywhere, even the bald patches. The rash gradually disappeared. I tried switching him to a (cheaper) rice-lamb food, but the rash immediately came back within a couple weeks. I put him back on the grain-free Nature's Recipe food and the rash went away again. Definitely a great food for dogs with sensitive skin/food allergies. The only thing I don't like is the cost, but all grain-free foods cost about the same and this is actually the cheapest one at the pet store I go to. My dog is a 100% happy, equal-opportunity lover of everyone, and he loves this dog food too.

review/summary: Tasty and Healthy
review/text: A dog trainer suggested we switch to grain free dog food for our two dogs. The young Jack Russell mix not picky at all, but the elderly Shih Tzu will sometimes refuse to eat. The trainer also suggested we steam the dry food with boiling water so the dogs, especially the Shih Tzu, could smell it. We've been using this brand for some time now, and both dogs love it. Steaming it produces a bit of a gravy. It also softens the food which is helpful for the Shih Tzu. We've tried different types and flavors of dog food in the past, but this one is still a huge hit with the dogs. They also seem quite healthy and active on it.

review/text: This food is amazing, our doberman pinscher Isis has a really sensitive stomach. Chicken will make her really ill. This is an awesome dog food with the fact that it's grain free, uses simple carbs, and  fish for easy digestion. The only thing is this product is a lot cheaper at petsmart. I pay about $45 for 24lbs there. I wouldnt buy this online.

review/text: My husband has a thing for fortune cookies so when the local store that he typically got them from went out of business I went scavenging for someplace to buy them.  Amazon has an amazing price on these and unlike what I was expecting after reading the item description, they each came individually wrapped to help with any freshness issues!  The flavor is the same vanilla with a hint of lemon that you will get at your local Chinese take out place.<br /><br />The fortunes aren't super fun (especially with this quantity- you get repeats regularly) but we have found about 12 unique fortunes, including one that says something along the lines of you have a wonderful wife, which totally makes the purchase even more worth it!

My entire circle of family and friends now chew only this gum. The flavor last forever, the consistency stays new and does not get hard or mushy, you can blow bubbles if you like, and it does NOT stick to dental work, or anything else for that matter! There is no need for any other gum other than Ice Cubes, as far as I am concerned. Love this gum!

review/summary: Flat, dull, lacking in aroma
review/text: I received the green pouches as illustrated, and the price for a full pound of tea was very attractive. The Amazon listing currently (Sept. 2011) describes this Assam tea as organic. Nothing on the package indicates this is so. However, the company's website states that this and nearly all of their teas are USDA Certified Organic.<br /><br />I have been drinking tea for some decades, and keeping notes to remind myself of favorites. I expect a quality Assam tea to have an appealing aroma and a complex flavor with hints of malt. This product failed to deliver. This Two Leaves & A Bud product is flat and uninteresting. It has little aroma and has little taste at all. The package I received was probably old inventory, long past its peak. Older tea does not go rancid; packaged tea simply looses its aroma and flavor as it ages.<br /><br />This Assam tea had mostly whole leaves, not the smaller fannings or dust-like particles you sometimes find in bargain-basement teas. You can add boiling water and infuse up to 3.5 or 4 minutes without causing excessive bitterness, but you get very little of the classic Assam flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: Bland, with little flavor or aroma. I might buy another tea from this brand, but only if I knew that it was fresh inventory ... and that it had received good reviews.<br /><br />Options: As an alternative for bargain hunters, Ahmad brand Kalami Assam tea can be purchased for about $10/pound in South Asian and Middle Eastern grocery stores. This inexpensive Ahmad tea is not great, but it is more appealing than this tea. Of the more upscale packaged brands, I recommend the Assam offerings from Peet's, especially their Assam Extra Fancy. I wish you fun and good luck in your tea tasting.

review/summary: BEST CRUSHED TOMATOES
review/text: Tuttorosso makes the best tomato products, bar none.  This is simply my opinion, but having moved off the East Coast to Arizona, and having been deprived of the Tuttorosso Brand for the last 3 years, I am so happy to be able to make my spaghetti gravy again and have it taste like it  should.  The  only "down" to buying  this is the shipping cost, but it amounts only to the price of another case of product; basically if you buy 2 cases of product, you pay for 3rd case, that "3rd case" being the  shipping cost.  Thus $21 per case x 2 cases = $42- and $21 to ship comes to $63 for 2 cases; As lonkg as the shipping cost doesn't go up any higher, I will be back again to use this vendor.

review/text: I have been using Tuttorosso Crusted Tomatoes for years, never had a problem wouldn't use any other brand. My family thinks I am crazy but the last couple of batches of gravy (yes I call it gravy not sauce) taste different to me. I even used the tomatoes in my Chicken Cacciatore and it tasted different to me.<br />I think there is a bad batch of tomatoes out there. Today I made gravy and when I was opening the cans of tomatoes I realized the cans expiring in November of 2012 taste better then the cans expiring in Febuary of 2012. Also the blue cans taste better then the green.  I will still buy the tomatoes(not the ones expiring in Feb 2012) but would like to know if anyone else has had this problem

review/text: The younger members of dream factory have taken a liking to mozzarella cheese sticks.  We don't frequent restaurants often.  So we tried these here TGI  Fridays sticks.<br /><br />What a grand disappointment.<br />  A disappointment at many levels:<br />A). Chinzy on the cheese.  Mostly breading.<br />B). After numerous attempts the sticks always leak, and your left with a half empty shell in a cheese glue pool.<br />C). In order to crisp up the breading crust you have to keep em in long enough, but then that allows for the cheese to leak out.  So it's either a under crisped stick or a half empty one.<br />D). The overall yum yum taste just isn't there.<br /><br />The king of mozzarella cheese sticks is at the fast food joint 'Sonic'.  But they don't cater to the make it at home crowd.

review/summary: Obviously a matter of taste
review/text: Just had my first cup and I think it is tasty. Good but not outstanding.<br /><br />I have to think most of the one stars are people who just don't care for artificial sweetener or they are expecting Vermont quality fresh squeezed cider.<br /><br />It is a decent product if you have realistic expectation and are accustomed to artificial sweetener.

review/summary: One happy diabetic
review/text: I got one of these kcups in a sample pack a few months ago.  I've been hesitant to try it as I am not the biggest cider fan.  I looked up the nutritional info- 10 calories, 1 carb- if it's not sweet enough, I have Splenda.  So I brew it and my kitchen starts smelling like a caramel apple.  I found myself fanning the steam from the cup towards my face.  My first sip was heavenly.  I decided to put it over ice since it is summer and it's great cold as well.  I am one happy girl right now as I keep drinking it.  Try it.  You'll love it.

review/summary: My favorite K Cups!!  Only 10 calories!
review/text: I was a bit scared to order these, because of the mixed reviews...I honestly cannot figure out how it's possible to NOT love these!  They are probably my favorite K Cup beverage...AND the cheapest, to boot!<br /><br />I am used to drinking artificial sweeteners (diet soda, Splenda, etc.) -- maybe some people didn't realize that these were sugar-free (i.e., people don't know how to read product titles & descriptions)?  If you're used to straight-up sugar, maybe these would taste off, like people think diet soda tastes bad if they're used to regular.<br /><br />As a diet soda drinker, these taste awesome to me!  I seriously want to drink one or two of them every day when I get home...and by the way, it's June now, so I imagine in the winter they'd be even better.  :-)  I think these also taste good cold.  I make them on the 10-ounce Keurig setting -- 8 ounces and they're too sweet...which is great, since I get 2 more ounces of cider.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd say give them a try...they're cheap, and I think they're awesome.  I guess just make sure your taste buds are used to artificial sweeteners, and you'll probably love them too!

review/summary: OBSESSED!!!
review/text: I am absolutely OBSESSED with these k-cups. I don't want to admit to how many of these boxes I've gone through in the past few months. It's embarrasing.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, sweet and tangy. It's better than any other hot cider drink I've tasted and the best part is, it's sugar-free and only 10 calories. As a treat, I like to top with fat free whipped cream -- it seems like SUCH an indulgence, but it's very low in calories!<br /><br />As someone who is always watching watch I eat, I do not like to "drink" my calories if I can help it -- which is why I shy away from the other hot cider/hot chocolate/teas for my Keurig. Most clock in at around 60-80 calories, so I only have one every few days or so. I can't drink one after another...like I do with these. See? I told you I was obsessed!<br /><br />All that said, I am someone who is USED to eating/drinking artificially flavored/sugar free drinks. I'm a diet soda/Crystal Lite drinker, so the taste isn't anything "new" to me -- in fact, I don't quite understand what all the complaining is about these k-cups on here is all about.<br /><br />You can't beat the price -- I'm on the subscribe 'n save plan but I am already ordering more frequently than that because I drink these k-cups like a fish!

review/text: Like many of the reviews here this household agrees that the taste of this sugar free cider is horrible.  Don't know if it's the heat with the artificial sweetner or what but it's horrible.  We tried it hot and over ice.  Either way it's horrible.  We are a household that drinks plenty of diet soda too so it isn't that we aren't used to artificial sweetner either.

It is a bitter sweet taste that wasn't all that appealing to me.<br /><br />I tried 3 different settings for this.  The smallest setting was down right bad.  The medium and small-medium are alright.

review/text: As someone who is used to artificial sweeteners, I have to say that these were exactly what I hoped for.  Are they a little extra sweet?  Sure.  But let's be honest, I haven't had real apple cider in years and this was close enough for me.  If you're watching your blood sugar and would like a non-coffee/tea treat for your keurig, I recommend these.  The caramel ones are decent too, although they are stronger than these in my opinion.  A single 24 pack is a fairly reasonable price, try it out for yourself.

review/summary: Too Sweet
review/text: The sweetener used in this over powers the flavor.  It has a decent aroma but the closest approximation of taste I could give it is hot apple juice with extra sugar.  It may appeal to someone that likes very sweet drinks without the calories.  I enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AWTR6M">Green Mountain Naturals Hot Apple Cider</a> and was hoping this would be a caramel flavored, less calorie laden, version but was sorely disappointed.

review/text: When I made the first cup, I was not sure about the taste. It is more caramel than apple flavored and seemed a bit too sweet. But after making it again, it was more like having a dessert! Now I am enjoying it. There are so few sugar-free k-cups available with the various fancy things, so I appreciate finding this.<br />UPDATE:<br />I made another cup of this drink today and I chose the largest size cup to brew in my Breville k-cup brew machine. That was a good thing, as the flavor was not so highly intense. It was most enjoyable when the flavor was not as concentrated.<br />Next, I will try using the "iced drink" setting and see if this flavor is good when done as an iced beverage.

In fact, I can drink two in the evening as I'm relaxing and I do not have to worry about the calories.<br /><br />If you're used to drinking drinks flavored with aspartame, then these will be just fine!  My husband doesn't like them because of the artificial flavoring.  And he also doesn't have to worry about his weight like I do.  So I bought two kinds of apple cider and neither of us touch the other's cider.

review/summary: A delicious winter treat!
review/text: When I first ordered this Cider, I wasn't expecting it to be great, based on some of the reviews. Since it is priced so low, I thought I would give it a whirl and expand the use of my Keurig brewer.  To my surprise, it is great tasting and really warms you up. To be fair, it isn't as good as real hot apple cider, BUT it is only ten calories a serving and even though it isn't real apple cider, it is a delicious hot beverage. For the price, this is an amazing deal (in terms of Keurig K-Cup prices).  I would recomend Grove Square Sugar Free Cider Cups to anyone who wants a warm, low calorie treat! I will buy these all winter!

review/summary: Sweet indulgence for those counting WW points
review/text: I love hot cider in the winter, but since I'm currently on weight watchers I didn't want to waste the calories. This is a perfect treat for zero points! I didn't think it was weak at all (brewed on a single cup personal size Keurig). It is very sweet so you definitely have to enjoy a caramel flavor. It does not taste like real cider (and of course can't rival Sbux hot caramel cider!) but is certainly a fun low calorie indulgence. The sweetener is aspartame which I have no problem with but I know some people don't like. I would say give it a try!

review/text: Ordered this via subscription to save more, even though the price for a K-cup is very reasonable as a single order.  Received my first shipment on Tuesday and just upped my subscription to two boxes a month instead of one every three months since I'm going through three or four a day.  Love the taste and I don't find it too weak even on the largest cup setting on our Keurig.  It's better than the full sugar apple cider I bought...and only 10 calories.

review/text: I thought I was buying regular Hot Cider Cups at Wal-Mart but when I got home I saw the sugar-free label and was very disappointed since I had read some of the reviews here on Amazon.  I usually use splenda in my beverages but the after taste in this cider drink is so noticeable and artificial I could barely get it down.  Not recommended, now what do I do with the other seventeen cups???

It is warm and sweet and the hint of caramel is something really special.  I keep it as a special treat for those cool nights.  It's  must try for anyone who needs to or wants less/no sugar and likes hot apple cider!  Now if I only had a fireplace still.

I don't know what product the people who are dissing it are trying.<br /><br />It is not apple cider, but it is as close are you are going to get in a sugar free product. I can't drink real apple cider because I am on a low carb diet and apple cider is basically just liquid sugar, so is completely inappropriate for me.

review/summary: Apple Cider
review/text: I found the Grove Square sugar free hot apple cider, caramel apple flavor to lack either apple or caramel flavor and to have a chemical/medicinal taste and prolonged aftertaste. I tried brewing it on both the 7.25 and 9.25 ounce settings and didn't care for it either way. Not nearly as good as the hot apple cider brand that came with my Keurig. The company does not refund customers based on "personal taste" so I plan to donate it to my school and hope someone finds it drinkable. I will stick with a brand I trust in the future, even if it means paying a couple dollars more.

review/text: I am not one to leave a review but after reading the reviews for this product I almost didn't buy it. I don't want anyone else to make that mistake. Thank goodness a few decent reviews made me take the chance.  Please don't read the reviews that hold the fact that it is sugar free against this product. If you don't want sugar free then buy something else, don't give this poor reviews! For us diabetes this product is wonderful!  It tastes great and satisfies a sweet craving.  It has a heavenly scent and the taste is like apple pie topped with sweet caramel.  My husband likes it stronger/sweeter than I do, so we use different settings on our Keurig, but we do the same thing with coffee.  This has become our late evening beverage choice and we plan on repeat purchases.

review/text: While this Cider is sugar free, I wouldn't know it unless I saw the packaging.  It's still a little too sweet for my liking, but that's just me (hence 4 stars instead of 5).  I brew it with 10 oz of water instead of 8 to help with the sweetness.  And for the price, you can't hardly beat it!

review/summary: nice, clean flavor
review/text: After trying it for the first time today I am absolutely blown away by how delicious this is as an iced cider. I purchased these k-cups for my parents for Christmas to go along with the Keurig brewer my sister bought for them. I choose these specifically because they were sugar free and seemed to be a good value compared to other k-cups. As other reviewers have noted, I simply cant understand why there are so many one-star reviews!  The flavor is clean and refreshing and it's hard to believe these are sugar free and only 10 calories.  I keep retasting but I don't notice any hint of "plastic" or artificial sweetner as other reviewers have noted. Of all the beverages I've had from the Keurig so far this is my favorite.  Going to stock up on a few more boxes so I can bring my own when I visit my parents.

review/text: I love my Keurig, and use it several times a day. These K-Cups were the worst I have tasted. Grove square is one of the few brands that, for there coffee, uses a mix of micro ground and instant coffee. But since this review is for their apple cider, I will briefly tell you my opinion. The Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider is by far one of the worst drinks I have ever made in my Keurig. It hardly is apple cider. For Thanksgiving most of my family tried it and none of them even finished their cups. I will never buy any Grove Square product again. I have heard that Green Mountain Apple Cider is much better and I am sure would be worth buying.
