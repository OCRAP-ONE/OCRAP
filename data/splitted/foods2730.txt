review/summary: Tough and Inedible... the worst I've ever tried
review/text: Sorry to be so negative, but when something is SO bad on the market, you want others not to make the same mistake. I ordered 4 bags - all of which have sell by dates of more than 10 months from now, so I know they are not supposed to be "stale" by Oberto's standards - and they are simply horrible, grizzly, shoe inserts of cardboard with no flavor.  Ironically, I found Oberto by a google search of "tender" and "beef Jerky", and was obviously mislead by someone's spin on this inedible garbage. Shame on Oberto for passing this off as "premium steak strips"; these taste like unwanted slaughterhouse scraps.

review/summary: Tough & Flavorless
review/text: I ordered Jack Links & Oberto's at the same time and the Jack Links didn't last a week but the Oberto's took a long time to finally choke down.  Basically, Jack Links jerky was tender, flavorful & delicious while Oberto's was tough, hard and not so much flavorful as extremely salty.  I'm never buying Oberto's again, which is too bad because I used to like Oberto's a few years ago.  I don't know if their management has changed since then but the product has gone way downhill.

review/summary: Stays fresh and great taste!
review/text: I have ordered this jerky several times over the past few years, but never bothered to write a review because I was satisfied with the product.  Now that I have read the negative reviews, I am compelled to comment that I have been happy with all the orders.  I have sent them to my son, he loves this brand better than others, and has never complained it is dried out or tough.  It is beef jerky, it is supposed to be a little tough!  None of the packages have had quick expiration dates, it takes me a couple of months to go through 4 packages (whereas the son takes about a week, or less), first is as fresh as the last.  It is not too spicy, the flavor is meaty, the  pieces are not fatty, like some types I have purchased.  The amazon price beats anything in the grocery, and service is always prompt.

Oberto's other jerkys, it has just the  right mouthfeel - tender enough to chew without that artificial, over tenderized texture that many brands of jerky have.  Beware!!  This will spoil you for any other brand of jerky!!!

review/summary: Why the malic acid ?
review/text: I really wanted to love these. I waited so long to try them because of all the Thinkfruit varieties, this is the most expensive one. While most of the Thinkfruit varieties only have sugar, maybe a little oil, and/or "natural flavors" added, this blueberry variety has malic acid added. I don't know if this is causing the problem for me but the blueberries tasted "off" to me. Nothing like a dried blueberry. I looked it up and (simplified), malic acid provides a tart flavor and that's not what I'm tasting. I'm not tasting blueberry either.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this one star is because I can stand them if I rinse them or soak them in something before using them for baking or consuming. Once rinsed and soaked, they taste much better, regardless of what I had to soak them in. (water, juice, amaretto)<br /><br />The best variety of all of the Thinkfruit flavors is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UZX06Y">Thinkfruit Whole Cranberries , 1.5 Ounce Bags (Pack of 10)</a> in my opinion. They taste just like what you'd expect a dried cranberry to taste like.

review/summary: Bad taste, sugar, dry, expensive.
review/text: These were expensive, even with a coupon, and I still hated them so much I threw them out.<br /><br />Here's why:<br />1) They taste a lot like raisins.  I don't like raisins, but raisins taste better and are juicier than these. Other than the raisin-taste factor, there was something else off about the flavor, which the other reviewer mentioned.<br />2) They are flavored with sugar.  That would be fine if the sugar made them taste good, but it doesn't.<br />3) Dry.  Most of the berries were flat, dried up little pellets; only a couple per pack had any puffiness left.<br />3) Expensive.  If you like raisins, they are a far better value than these.

review/text: I received Char Crust in a gift basket.  I tried it once and was hooked immediately.  All you have to do it sprinkle Char Crust on top of chicken, meat or fish (I like it best on chicken) and toss into the broiler.  It forms a spicy crust on the outside of whatever you use it on which seals in all the juices.  The flavor is outstanding.  It's flavorful without being overbearing and I wouldn't call the hickory and molasses variety "spicy".  As one might expect, it's a little smoky and a little sweet.  It tastes kind of barbecue-like without the stickiness of a sauce.

review/summary: Okay variation, but no real ice cream (or malt) flavor.
review/text: Ordered a 5 pound bag of malted milk balls, in 4 ice cream flavors. The bag arrived quickly, weighed about 5 pounds, and had 4 different flavors: pineapple, orange sherbet, lemon, and raspberry. The orange is orange sherbet, the pink is raspberry, the yellow seemed to be pineapple, so the green had to be lime, by default.<br />...That's the problem. I should have been able to identify the flavors by taste, not sight. The flavors weren't too intense, more a slight suggestion of lemon or orange, etc. There also wasn't much malt flavor that regular malted milk balls have.<br />...No complaints with the speed, size or freshness of the order, and it was kind of fun having something different. I was just expecting a stronger ice cream flavor. If it did have a stronger flavor, I'd give it five stars.

In fact, my husband brought me a cup of decaf the other AM - and I couldn't tell that it wasn't "hi-test.!"<br />If you like a dark, deep, smooth coffee, give The Pod a try.

review/text: My precious young cat "Phat Boy Cuddlecuss" is a VERY picky eater and he has a very sensitive stomach which he takes medication for. He won't eat Science Diet, Blue, Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and just about any other expensive canned cat food there is. My vet even prescribed Science Diet ID for Sensitive Gastrointestinal and he ate that for about a week and then he'd never touch it again.<br /><br />As soon as I pull these Whiska's open he comes running. So far he likes all the flavors he's tried so far- Filet Mignon, Rostisserie Chicken (his favorite!), Tender Turkey and the 2 Tuna varieties. When you open these they have a lot of meat juices which looks just like meat juices that you'd have from cooking a steak and letting it rest correctly (au jus). It doesn't seem to dry out like other canned cat foods if you have some leftover.<br /><br />Usually, you can find these at Wal-Mart for .54 and other stores at .69 each. Whiska's usually has some great coupons for B1G1 if you go to their website. So, unless you just want the ease of having them delivered, you can find a better deal for these than they are listed here.<br /><br />Overall, these are great cat food for my picky eater with a sensitive stomach. For my 5 cats one of these split up lasts only through one feeding, but, I like knowing that they are always fresh. I'd recommend as this is the ONLY canned food that my Phat Boy Cuddlecuss will eat.

review/summary: They Don't Throw This Up!
review/text: Thank you Whiskas for coming up with a formula that my girl's ( 4 of them) will eat and not vomit up as soon as they are done.  I do wish that there were more flavors in the Pate line though.<br /><br />This is  easy to open packaging and the plastic container only needs a quick rinse before throwing into the recycling.<br /><br />This company has amazing shipping  -- I ordered on Sunday and got it Tuesday.<br /><br /> With the Subscribe and Save option, the cost of having this delivered monthly and  me not having to drive to the store with gas at nearly 4.50 a gallon is a wonderful savings/convenience.

review/summary: Quiet container good for sneaking food
review/text: The cats eat it.  After that, what I like best is the container, it is a plastic/metal tub with foil lid.  This means rather than a can opener or a loud opening tab lid on a can, this is quiet to open.  I can easily feed one or two cats without everyone running because they hear food.  This is important if you are giving medicine or special feedings.<br /><br />It is a nice pate texture with juice/gel around the outside. The texture and juice/gel is always consistent, not dry one time and liquid the next, always the same firm yet moist pate with the juice/gel around the outside. (juice/gel is just that, mostly juice but a bit of the gel like you see with meat).<br /><br />My cats like all the flavors.

review/summary: quieter than a can
review/text: If you are reading this chances are you have a cat, so you know, I can't tell you if you're cat will eat this or not, but, all 7 of mine like all the Whiskas in a tub.  With 7 cats, what I like best about this is I can open it without any cat hearing it. That means if 1 or 2 missed the main meal, or need special feedings (like medication added) I can do it quietly without the whole crew running in demanding their fair share.  I feed the Whiskas about 1/4 of the time.  They all have their favorites, but I feed can food most of the time due to the cost.  Whiskas is priced well in line with other foods of that size, but again with 7 cats, I need a larger size.  But all my cats like all the Whiskas line of foods, their dry, the pouch, esp the purrfectly tuna and all the tub food.<br /><br />It is a nice pate texture with juice/gel around the outside.  The texture and juice/gel is always consistent, not dry one time and liquid the next, always the same firm yet moist pate with the juice/gel around the outside.  (juice/gel is just that, mostly juice but a bit of the gel like you see with meat).

review/summary: THE BEST!!!
review/text: This stuff is great, tastes just like sugar and measures like sugar. Best of all, it smells like cotton candy. Don't bother with the packets, they don't give you enough in the packets to do the job. Stick with the 12oz bags. This is a great price. I pay over $10 for this stuff at Mothers Market...but it's worth it. Only one drawback with these "natural" sugar alcohols...they do cause you to retain water, so just make note of it if you have water retention concerns. One more thing...although it measures same as sugar it doesn not bake or cook as well as sugar. For instance, don't try melting it with cocoa powder for a frosting...will be solid cement in your pan. Also, when you back with it you won't get a light texture, much more dense and does not help the recipie rise, stays rather flatish. When I say it's just like suger, it really is, which also means it won't dissovle in your iced tea very easily, same as real sugar. It keeps it's grainy texture in cold things but works fine in hot drinks. Love it in coffee and oatmeal...the main 2 ways I use it.

review/summary: great sweetener/acceptable for diabetics
review/text: This is a plant based sweetener, but has only a few calories and is acceptable for diabetics.  It is also easy on your gastro-intestinal track.  I had tried Zylotol, another plant based sweetener.  Because of a medication I am on for very low borderline diabetes (Metformin, which can cause diarreha), the Zylotol made things even worse.  This product is called a Eurethatol (?), but doesn't cause me any intestinal problems.  I haven't tried it in anything except hot tea yet, so I can't tell you how it works in baking or cold drinks.  It doesn't have any aftertaste like Stevia based products.  It's definitely cheaper here than in health food stores by about $2.00.

review/text: I have a small single cup coffee maker for those times when I need a quick cup of coffee but don't want a whole pot.  All right, that doesn't happen very often - I can usually handle a whole pot.  But when I want a quick cup, I don't want to be grinding beans, getting out a filter and going through all the same steps as making a whole pot.  These filter packs are the perfect solution at a great price!  The coffee is almost as good as Starbucks for a fraction of the price.

It isn't as strong as I expected it to be, which could be one reason for my disappointment.  If you like mild coffee and just drink coffee for effect this is a decent and well priced product.  I enjoy coffee and drink it for taste as much as effect.  The packets are easy to open, which I appreciate.

review/text: Here's the problem... after eating something of this caliber and deliciousness, how can I ever go back to gas station pork rinds? These are by far my favorite pork rinds. They are a bit fatty, but that's what pork rinds are supposed to be like. They are crunchy, but won't break your teeth. They're also mildly seasoned with salt, so you can add in your own spices and make something with it, too. All in all, I'll buy another box once I finish this box. Thank you :)

review/text: I remember when I was in my teens and hanging around Broadway in Seattle/Cap Hill area.  There was a small shop that sold all kinds of hemp related products.  One of them (my favorite actually) was the garlic & tamari toasted hemp seeds.  I have never been able to find anything like them for a long time.  These seeds may not be garlic & tamari, but they do have that wonderful crunch, and nutty flavor that I enjoyed so many years ago.<br /><br />Overall this is a fantastic product from a great company.  I will definitely be making more purchases from this company in the future!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003A9Q8IQ">Foods Alive Organic Toasted Hemp Seeds with Sea Salt, 14-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>

This is not one of those sauces.<br />This is a sauce with a kick, but sill has a lot of wonderful flavor.  Great on just about any kind of meat (I used it on beef, chicken, and pork), and I like it on scrambled eggs, too.<br />Despite all of the flavor, it's lower in sugar and sodium than many other sauces, so it's a less guilty "guilty pleasure" for those watching their diets.<br />You can't go wrong with this sauce.

review/summary: So glad I found this
review/text: I've been hoping to find gluten free instant oatmeal and Glutenfreeda's Instant Oatmeal is the perfect answer.  It tastes and feels like non-GF instant oatmeal and it cooks like non-GF oatmeal. I am so pleased. I hardly ever ate oatmeal any more because other GF oatmeals took too long to prepare.  To have the option of buying it in large quantities in order to keep the cost down really sold me.  I'll be a repeat customer many times over.

review/text: Okay I have to admit that this Gluten Free Oatmeal is REALLY good, but it is tooo high on amazon. I order alot of products from Amazon but this price for 8 packs of oatmeal is just to much. I order this exact same oatmeal from luckyviatmins.com for what about $4.00 a box & it also has 8 packets in it. I hope that this helps someone that is looking to pay a cheaper price for the EXACT same product!! (all smiles)

review/summary: A Good Quick Choice but not longterm...
review/text: I was so excited to find these a couple years ago as an alternative to other oats that are not gluten free.  I love my oats every AM, keep me regular and satisfied until lunch rolls around.  With this product, the convenient paper packets are occasionally not well sealed and you will find the oats in the box instead of the packet now and again.  These are heavily sugared even with natural flavorings.  I prefer adding my own sweetener and fresh fruit/nuts, etc.  But these were my best choice at the time and I would not hesitate to use them for a quick meal when traveling or for fussy kids who may not want whole oat cereal.  (Made right, whole oats taste infinitely better, I think, than ANY quick oat product.)<br /><br />I found Bobs gluten free whole oats on this site and use them instead now.  I am getting more fiber and better nutrition and the taste is more wholesome and satisfying to me.  The whole oats do come with the occasional husks and some bags are worse than others but this is the small price you pay for better nutrition and superior taste without all that sugar and gummy dried fruit bits.  To me, all the flavors of these instant packets taste almost the same.  Altogether, I found them too sweet and not sufficiently satisfying but in a hurry, they will do.

review/text: I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review.  I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.

review/summary: Not a Gluten Free Product
review/text: I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product.

review/text: I actually tasted the Berry/Vanilla flavor.  If you've ever eaten a fig newton, then try to imagine a fig newton, minus the fig center, with rice crispies mixed up in it.  It tastes a little grainy at first, but once I read the ingredients and realized that the grains were puffed rice, I was more at ease.  Really a good taste.  One of the better gluten free/casien free/egg free cookies I've eaten.

review/text: I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are "No Gluten" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again.

I find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid breaking the cookies.<br /><br />If you want the cookies crumbled, just break them up in the packaging and then cut open with scissors to dispense neatly.<br /><br />I like to cut up strawberries and crumble a Nana's cookie over them.  With a little whipped cream, it's just like a good strawberry shortcake.  They are great crumbled over bananas, too.<br /><br />Despite being somewhat fragile.

review/summary: Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults!
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the "glue" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana's Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than "regular" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren't cheap, and cheap cookies aren't good!  Give Nana's banana cookies a try.  (No, I don't work for Nana's but am a happy, loyal customer!)

review/text: My 2 year old eats the Chocolate Munch Cookie and LOVES them. I bought them not because they were gluten free, but because they are sweetener free. He calls them "chocolate treat," if that gives you any indication of how good he thinks they are. I would definitely recommend this flavor to everyone. I have found that with the subscribe and save discount I can get the boxes cheaper on Amazon than in stores like Sunflower, Sprouts and Whole Foods.
