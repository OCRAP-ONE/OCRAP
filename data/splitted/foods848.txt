review/summary: Great Sesame Seed Flavor!
review/text: Biegel Beigel Sesame Mega Sticks are a favorite snack of mine.  They have a nice sesame seed "nutty" bite to them, more-so than Beigel Beigel sesame rings.<br /><br />They're a wonderful snack to have on hand when you watch TV, etc.  I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Just ordered our second case within a month...
review/text: These Israelli snacks are truly wonderful.  I ordered my first case a couple weeks ago based on what other people commented.  It is hard to not eat just one package in a day, but I will just have to force myself.  And these are cheap... at $17 and change for 20 bags, they are by far the best value among the Amazon listings for Beigel & Beigel products.  They are worth every penny too!!!

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: Crunchy, just enough salt and lots of sesame seeds--this is an addictive snack. Don'worry about buying a carton of packages from Amazon; it will disappear from your pantry soon enough even if you are just one person  The price is very good, compared to that at the many supermarkets and Kosher markets that carry the stuff. I have always found Beigel and Beigel's snack products far superior in taste and texture to the competing Osem products.

review/summary: Not so Mega and too salty
review/text: I ordered these without having purchased them previously, so wasn't entirely sure whether I would like them. What I really wanted are Pretzel Rods without salt on the outside. That is, "Baldies" but in rod shape instead of twists. I have previously had sesame pretzels, and liked them, so thought this might be an acceptable substitute.<br /><br />However, these are much smaller/thinner than pretzel rods and are much saltier than needed given the sesame seeds. We'll use these, but I'll keep looking for a lower-salt pretzel rod.

review/text: A very small amount of what is obviously a high-end extra virgin olive oil.  Used it quite sparingly for a definite unique flavor.  As the old ad goes, "a little dab'll do you."<br />Always wanted to try highest quality virgin olive oil.  Now i have.  Not for those on a budget, and there are some other "true" virgin olive oils available at more reasonable cost.  Best for those with a champagne budget as well as champaign taste.

Very hard for me to find in my community and have to get it online.  I thank a friend for telling me about it.  It was a very good find.

review/text: This sugar substitute is the best on the market.  It looks  and tastes like sugar and I use it on my unsweeetened cereal every day.  It is granular, unlike most sugar substitutes, and I just LOVE it!!!  I also use it on fresh fruit, but don't put it on fruit until just before I eat it as it melts and looks like sour cream.  I want the granular rather than melted.  It does not generate juice as sugar does, but it is still great.  It's is a wonderful sugar replacement for diabetics!!!

review/text: I should have saved my money, but curiosity got the best of me. I did not have great expectations for this product, but when it arrived, I was surprised to see how small the gumballs were,that when chewed became pretty small in the mouth. The flavor left something to be desired, as it had a smokey chemical taste to them which to me was not enjoyable. Perhaps it would be enjoyed by someone else. By the way I love bacon, but this was not bacon.

review/text: I must agree with the other 2 reviews. My cats are so-o-o-o-o picky but they never turn up their noses when I offer these treats.<br /><br />My cats refuse almost every other treat I offer. Sometimes they will eat another type of treat but after 1 or 2 days, they refuse to eat anymore. These are the best!<br /><br />ps: when your cat gets bored with a favorite toy, don't throw it out. Put it away in a closet for a few months & one day when they seem bored again, bring it out of the closet and give it to them. They will be excited about it again. Cats are like kids so rotate the toys and everyone will be happy.

It's not just my cat either; my friend's cat doesn't like them as much as the ones in the orange or blue bags.  Stay away from the cheese flavored ones in the yellow bag; I can only assume they're really gross as they just set in the dish, untouched.

review/text: I'm glad other people's cat liked these, but my cats are both indifferent to them. I got these because my cat went crazy over the cheese puff treats I bought at Target, I think they are call crispies or something. They literally almost ripped the bag apart when it was left closed sitting on the counter because they can smell it through the bags. I have 2 kittens and they fought each other whenever I grab for the bag, no other time do they act like this it's almost as if it's drugs or something. I was hoping for the same effect with these, but my kittens both treat these like it's slightly tastier dry food. P.S. I have 1 himalayan and 1 orange tabby.

review/text: Our cat loves all the Party Mix flavors, but I ordered this bulk package since it was the best price at the time, plus it helped me get to the purchase threshold for the free super saver shipping!  We generally use these treats a few at a time to get her to bed at night (she sleeps in an extra bathroom with her litter box) or out from under couches, beds, etc.  I've used many of the Friskies products over the years and have liked them all.

Our older cat, Cowboy, thinks he is quite refined and is very proper, even HE gets excited about these treats.<br /><br />Judging from the cat's behaviors these must be great treats!  Other treats just don't bring on as much enthusiasm, and to think I bought these on a whim and just grabbed any old bag.<br /><br />I'll be sure to buy the Wild West flavor from here on out!

review/text: I've given my cats a few different kinds of treats daily & these are by far their favorites.... They love them more than any of the others and come running as soon as they here me get the package out. Really helps clean their teeth so it helps get rid of that bad kitty breath from eating other soft chewy treats. I won't buy the soft treats anymore as thier breath is so bad from it & they love these the best & so do I. They cost $1.50 a pack in the Walmart store so they are even cheaper here to buy & no sales tax, at least not in Iowa on these. I haven't tried the other flavors because these give them a variety so why bother with just one flavor.

review/summary: Party mix is now one of my cat's favorite treats
review/text: The various Friskies "party mix" flavors of treats really appeal to my cat's taste buds. They are his new favorites. Especially the Beachside Crunch version. He used to be a treat fanatic, but lately he hasn't been eating as many treats because he's been filling up more on wet food; that's sort of replaced his "dry treat" routine. However, he usually will still eat the party mix if I give it to him, even if he shuns other treats.<br /><br />And one other great thing about party mix - the price is cheap, but you get a lot for your money, since it is a good-sized bag. Great taste, great value - what's not to like?

review/summary: What's this?
review/text: While in a pet shop, and new to cats, the owner suggested I try this Tuna Dash product.  So I bought some.  One night the cat food was not what the cats wanted, so to encourage their eating I added some of this product to their food, just on top to get them started, and they ate their food.  This was my way of discouraging "finnicky" eating.  It worked.  I would use it off and on as needed, and most of the time I forgot I had it because it was not needed.  But oh when it was needed, what a help!  When might it be needed?  After vaccinations, for example, when they were mad at me for that vet trip.  Or, once in a while one of them would go off feed, probably from eating a mouse or something, and I would let them fast a day and then reencourage them back to regular food with the help of Tuna Dash.  I like the product, and glad I found it here as the pet store went out of business.

review/summary: Bird's Custard Powder
review/text: My Granny was British, a great cook (ahhhh! Granny's comfort food!!!), and just an angel on earth.  When she passed, I wanted things that reminded me of her.  I remembered her making Bird's Custard for me once, after she'd been to the British foods shop and found some.  I found it on Amazon and ordered a couple of the smaller tubs.  I made it one evening and offered some to my hubby, who doesn't care for too many sweets.  He LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this stuff.  My small tub disappeared within a week's time.  I found the double size tubs and stocked up.  My husband will eat this stuff nearly every night.  I have some dollar store salt/pepper shakers that I keep nutmeg in... I just put a few shakes of nutmeg on top (like Granny did) and it's perfect.  When I want to make a richer pudding, I'll make with some half and half or heavy cream.  That's just for special occasions (like PMS!).

review/summary: It isn't blanc mange, but isn't bad . . .
review/text: I'm not sure that custard is really custard without eggs.  But this comes close.  I got it for use in a "Vegan pancake" recipe.  We were having houseguests who were Vegan and I wanted to make some special breakfasts while they were here.  One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!<br />However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.<br /><br />If you want a really good egg-free "custard" get an original recipe for "blanc mange."  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference.

It left out the amount of time it should be cooked.<br /><br />For Microwave, using the high power setting, the time is stated as 6 minutes. Gentle heat on a hob does not equate to high power heat in a MW. I have not used the product, but gave it a temporary 3 stars because I had to provide a rating for the review to be published.<br /><br />Anybody have suggestions about the amount of time simmer when cooking on a hob?

This is my dog's absolute favorite.  Amazon's price is very reasonable.

review/summary: Does "Made in USA" = Ingredient USA Chicken or from China?
review/text: I would like to hear from Smokehouse as to "country of origin" for the chicken they use in this product - since all the other products they sell (like regular chicken strips) are from China.  Is this basically the same Chinese-processed chicken imported and then combined with some vitamin E inside a US factory? Made in USA doesn't equate with product country of origin.<br /><br />I wouldn't be suspicious except that they are a huge importer of chicken from China.  Why would this product be any different?

review/summary: Healthy treat
review/text: I had been feeding mostly the chicken jerky treats, feeling good about it since the only ingredient was chicken.  Then I saw the reports of kidney failure linked to the ones made in China.  It's hard to find them made in the USA, and they are much more expensive.  Then I found these.  They are made in the US.  Ingredients are chicken and Vitamin E.  The texture is different, but my dog likes them just as well and they have the added advantage of being "breakable", so you can give them smaller portions easily.

review/text: My dog goes absolutely berzerk when I pick up this bag and he knows he's about to get one of these treats!  He loves 'em!  Probably his favorite.  All that said, if I have to think of a negative - the treats are crunchy - so when he eats on carpet, they do produce crumbs - but he cleans up after himself pretty well, so it's not much of an issue.

review/summary: One of Two dogs accepts them, but shipping is a problem
review/text: I've been trying to find chicken jerky dog treats not made in China and these are the closest I've been able to find to this point (but I've found some made in Maine that look possible - I haven't tried them yet but intend to). These are US made, but not like what comes from China. They are hard and brittle and formed in some fashion into strips/bars. One of our dogs accepts them OK (not her favorite, but will take them), the other just turns his head away and only eats them when he realizes it's all there's going to be.<br /><br />But my last shipment from Amazon is going to be my last. I ordered several bags and they arrived with the pieces mostly in small shards. Don't know if Amazon shipped them in that condition or the shipper managed to mangle them en route (the box was not mangled in any way but it could have been dropped). But given the fact they're not ideal anyway, I'm not ordering any more.<br /><br />Not my favorite and not really recommended. Going to keep looking. The Blue Buffalo chicken treats (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ITWDKO">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Chicken Dog Jerky Treats</a>) are good, but outrageously expensive ($10 for a 3.2 oz bag!) and mostly very small pieces, so after one bag, no more.

review/text: Our 10-year-old Silkie Terrier Mabel is a very picky eater.  Because she has such a little mouth, she can't manage most treats.  These can be broken up into little pieces for her.  And because they're natural chicken, at least they're good for her.  I'm sure she'd recommend them highly.

review/summary: Okay but not a home run
review/text: I ordered these when trying to find a chicken treat that is USA made. For years I had bought the Waggin Train brand.  My dog loved them, but had a diarrhea every time she went "number two" and neither we nor our vet could figure out why.  Finally after seeing the story about chews made in China, I stopped buying them.  Within a week my dog had totally stopped her diarrhea!  She has hardly had it one time since and that was last year.  Back to topic - the bag does say USA made which is comforting, but the chews are very hard and crunchy.  I just rescued a male Shih Tzu and he ate them, but my girl wasn't impressed.  I am still searching for a USA made chew that is not hard as a rock.

review/text: A UK recipe that I was making called for Bird's Custard powder and I was lucky to find it here on amazon.  I've since used it twice: for Nanaimo bars (marvelous) and a homemade banana custard.  In both instances, the result was excellent.  I've always made homemade puddings for my kids and this definitely gives a lighter, smoother consistency than plain old cornstarch.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I was searching for  this product specifically because I wanted to make Nanaimo Bars.  In the area of the United States I live in, I've never found it.  I was glad to find it available here on Amazon, and the price was fairly reasonable.<br />The powder made it to my home in a timely manner, and it worked wonderfully in the cookie recipe. Our Nanaimo bars tasted great! It has an expiration date of about a year from the time I bought it, so to get my money's worth, I'll need to use the whole container up in that timeframe, which shouldn't be too difficult.  I know lots of people say this is just glorified corn starch with a little flavoring in it, but having the authentic flavor in the recipe was important to me, so that's mainly why I purchased it.

review/summary: Back to childhood
review/text: I purchased this product a little while ago and just got the chance to make it this morning.  Oh, what memories this brought back from my childhood in England.  Even though I don't have many happy memories, this custard was my absolute favorite.  We'd have it in trifles, over cake.  I remember having it in school and now I can enjoy it here in my very own home.  If you grew up only knowing the American vanilla pudding, this is different - it has a much more delicate flavor which I prefer.  Well, I'm off to make a pound cake to accompany my custard.  YUMMY, YUMMY !!!  Ta Ta!!  UPDATE:  I refrigerated the custard and when I tasted it something was missing - that flavor of freshly made warm custard.  I decided to nuke a bowl of the custard for about 30 seconds and then stirred the custard - the freshly made flavor returned so I suggest you reheat the custard before use.

I've tried plenty of home made popover recipes and most of the time they came out flat, no matter which little tricks I tried.  This mix is easy to make- and they bake perfect every time!  The hardest part is letting the batter sit for 30 minutes before you bake them.  I'm so happy I found them here on Amazon so now I can get them whenever I want!

review/text: This coriander was 'okay' but not as fresh and as aromatic as I'd hoped. Also, the best by date was only for July 2012 which would give me only an optimal window of around four months, but, I went ahead and vacuum packed half of it and stored it in my pantry which will hopefully extend the shelf-life.<br /><br />That said, I love coriander and this is a decent quality if not optimally fresh.

review/text: I like marshmallow that has a squishy pillowy texture, the marshmallow in this is a bit on the firm side and doesnt contribute much to the overall flavor.

Although I like these and recommend them I prefer the caramels.<br /><br />Shipment was fairly quick and included a cool pack to keep everything protected from the heat.
