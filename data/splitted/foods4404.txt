review/summary: Hershey's Air Delight -  Just payng for air
review/text: Being a real chocolate lover, I'm always on the look out for something new.  Typically I look for dark chocolates but thought I would try the Hershey's Air Delight milk chocolate.<br /><br />The verdict?  Tastes just like the standard Hershey's milk chocolate bar, maybe even a little milder (due to the air bubbles and lack of chocolate).  Got two stars just for tasting like regular Hershey's  but no more because the price is absurd.<br /><br />Using current Amazon pricing, the regular Hershey's milk chocolate bar is 1.55 ounces and sells for about $0.35 per ounce.  The 1.44 ounce Air Delight sells for $0.56 per ounce.  I guess air is expensive.<br /><br />Not recommended at that price.

review/summary: 3.5 stars, it's good but not excellent
review/text: I like Nestle's Aero chocolate, but Aero is little too expensive here in the States because it's imported.<br />And I found this similar product, so I gave it a try.<br />Taste of it is just like good old Hershey's milk chocolate.<br />Texture is not as good as Aero. I think air bubbles are smaller than Aero's, so it's not fluffy enough.<br />I guess I have to spend more to satisfy my tongue when I'm craving for bubble chocolate.

review/text: I was looking specifically for these little jars of jelly to go with our COUNTRY baby shower theme as guest give-aways. Found many options with other companies, but Bonne Maman had the BEST prices and LOOK I was going for.  Placed the order 1 week before the shower and they were at my door 3 days later.  They were perfect! Two weeks later in Bermuda, we were staying at a beautiful Resort and to my surprise they had every kind of Bonne Maman product available at their breakfast buffet!  I was even more proud of my choice then!

review/summary: Great crunchy stuff.
review/text: Sometimes I forget what my cats actually like, so reviewing this will remind me exactly what to reorder next time. Indoor Mature 27 is pretty much the best product to meet the needs of my three indoor cats, including a really elderly male cat who probably should not have too much protein. This is not a grain-free product and I do blend it with several other brands and varieties that are mostly meat and vegetables - neither of which my cats like as well, but have to eat just in case cranberries, sweet potato and duck are essential dietary elements. (And would a cat in the wild really eat avocado? I have to wonder...) This particular Royal Canin variety never seems to be available at the pet food stores, and I'm just as happy to order it from Amazon though I do wish it was offered in much larger size bags as three cats make quick work of 2.5 pounds.

review/summary: Taste The Century
review/text: It is hard to believe that Oreo cookies are celebrating their 100th anniversary, and they have put smiles on so many faces for generations. They have always went back to their classic taste for so many people. When I found out they were going to make a special cookie for their 100th birthday, I was skeptical because I have been a fan of both Oreo and Hydrox cookies for years. Oreo's 100th Birthday Cake Cookies taste pretty good, yet they don't stand out that much, even with the sprinkles in the vanilla creme. Still, they are worth while, and taste classic for any die hard Oreo fan. I suggest you give these a try, and celebrate the legend that Oreo has been for everyone for so long.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B

review/summary: Most disgusting Oreo ever made
review/text: While the seller performed excellently, the cookies themselves were totally gross. I have an addiction to Oreo cookies and figured that a cookie 100 years in the making must be delicious. Totally disappointed! The filling has a artificial flavoring taste and stench somewhere between concentrated funfetti and cotton candy. Children may appreciate the sugary sweet overdose but I myself will pass; and this is coming from someone who often eats a third of a 15.5 oz pack of Oreos in one sitting.

I had to go to 6 stores (no targets or walmarts here!) to find these, and walgreens had them- luckily I got the last 2 packs! I'm also a frosting-a-holic, so these are extremely dangerous in my presence. I downed a whole box to myself in a few days.. so awful! I'm kind of happy they're so limited. ;)  I definitely recommend trying them!

review/text: I saw these in my local grocery store and passed since I had given up sweets for Lent. Well, as a regular Oreo lover, I was still intrigued so I ordered 2 boxes from amazon.com. I kept them at home until Easter Sunday.<br /><br />And was it worth it!  They taste similar to a regular Oreo, but are a little sweeter.  The extra sweetness makes them seem "richer" so fewer cookies will fill you up. But, they taste FANTASTIC.  Yum!<br /><br />Totally worth it. Enjoy!

This leads me to believe the cookies must have been smashed before they were sent out. I was shocked to find only 3 at most whole cookies in the package. They were completely crushed. I was hoping to use them for a birthday celebration on Saturday too. I couldn't use them at all.  I paid way over retail price plus shipping and then realized I couldn't return them as food items. I feel ripped off. They don't even deserve one star!

They just didn't taste good at all. I couldn't even finish one cookie. Thankfully, my boyfriend's boss liked them, so I gave him the rest of the cookies.

There's something in them that does what no other candy or even medications can do -moisten my dry mouth that I have from medications I am on.  I suck on a couple of those and my mouth is moistened enough that I can go with just drinking water, oj, or whatever before I gotta eat a couple more.<br /><br />This stuff rocks - if I could afford it, I'd buy a whole year's worth!!  But it's probably a good thing it's not available because I'd gain 100lbs just from eating them!!  Wonderful product.

I was buying it the stores and they were running out a lot so then I couldn't get it for a while.  So I thought buying a case from Amazon was a great idea.  Unfortunately, when it got here it was very stale and I didn't eat it.  Amazon gave me my money back but I decided not to replace it.  I didn't eat the rest, I threw out the whole case.  Amazon said they were working with the manufacturer to eliminate the problem.  If you use a lot of it, give it a try.  Hopefully they got the problem sorted out and your case will be good.  This happened several months ago, just reviewing it now.

I research constantly for new things for natural skin care and I came across coconut oil; I just have to say I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love this product! I don't break out a lot, just a few on my chin every now and then, but it is usually painful cystic acne and after applying this at night the next morning I woke up and my face was glowing, I couldn't believe it! I don't have wrinkles, but I was getting a few fine lines under my eyes and they have disappeared after only four days of using this at night before bed and in the morning after my shower. I am absolutely amazed, this is a miracle product! I also use it as a moisturizer and hair mask. I have my mom and sister-in-law using this now and they said the same thing!

review/summary: Pure Coconut Oil with nice flavor and good price
review/text: I'd been reading about the health benefits of eating pure, unadulterated coconut oil, and found that the little jars in the supermarket were just too expensive. So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity. I looked at many options here, and found this one. For me, the taste is a plus, but some might find it a problem. It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.) I heartily recommend this oil if you are looking for organic, pure, not hydrogenated coconut oil at a good price, (unless you don't want the coconut taste.)

review/text: I read about the miracles of coconut oil. Though it is not what I would call miraculous I would say it does a nice job. I have sensitive skin, and this seems to work as well or better than most moisturizers I have tried, plus you can eat it. It has a coconut flavor to it. Subtle, and not sweet like a Peter Paul Mounds bar. I believe it helps a little as a laxative, but that might be me wishing it to do so. Anyway, just a small amount goes a long way, and my skin feels less sensitive and cooler. I'm a guy, and not looking for silky smooth skin, but this does that also.<br />This stays a solid until it touches your hand, then it melts quickly. This summer I may need to refridgerate so it stays solid, or knowing me, I'll spill it all over the place. Large jar for low cost. I'd give it a go.

It's pure coconut oil so of course it smells like coconut.

review/text: I am glad that I chose this production as my introduction to coconut oil.  I love it.  Yes, it has a soft coconut fragrance but the fragrance dissapates during the cooking process.  I have replaced 90% of the oil and butter in my house and I don't even miss that other stuff.  I add a nickel-size drop to my lotion after bathing and it knocks the ashyness right out of those ankles and elbows!  It also works great on my coarse straight black hair. After having issues with shedding, my hair stylist complimented me on taking great care of my hair.  "Keep on doing what you're doing," she said.  Ha!  I love that.<br /><br />As for cooking, I am in awe everytime I use it.  I recenty made omelettes for Saturday brunch.  Oh...My...Goodness!  They were absolutely amazing with tons of flavor in every bite.  That alone, sold me on this product.  I could have opened a restaurant on those omelettes alone.  (Patting myself on the back.)  Talapia works great with coconut oil as well since it is a delicate fish and one of my favorites.  I was very impressed with my cooking recently and I know it has to be the oil because that is the only thing that I've been doing differently.  I could cook before but now my food has reached another level and I feel more empowered when I cook.  The large 54-ounce jar will be a staple in my house so I won't have to worry about running out.<br /><br />Try it and see how you like it.  You may want to start with the smaller size if you are not sure about this product, or your can just jump in feet first like I did.

review/summary: Lasting forever, tastes great, works great.
review/text: I use this for cooking and for my skin as well. It has a very pleasant light coconut smell. In cooking I have never noticed a transfer of any coconut flavor to the foods I cook, which is a good thing. Basically you can use it to pan fry various food items without worrying about flavor conflicts.<br /><br />It works nicely as a skin moisturizer too. It's a little greasy (it's oil), but absorbs well, and again smells good (unless you don't like coconut).<br /><br />Tried it as a hair conditioner but that didn't work out too well. It is very easy to apply too much and end up with hair that looks like it has to be washed again. Maybe it takes practice. :)

review/summary: Amazing!!!!!!
review/text: I started buying this coconut oil about 2 years ago and now use it dually as a cooking oil and lotion. It's excellent for eggs, curry dishes...really almost any meal where you would use another type of oil. As for use as a lotion, it's amazing. Any and all skin issues I have ever had, have disappeared. When I first started using it on my face there was a bit of a transitional period (some breakouts) but after that, I have year- round clear, healthy looking skin. Yes, I am a bit fanatical about my love of this oil but I really don't care because everyone should be in the know.

review/summary: For Everything
review/text: Yeah, I use this both for eating and for moisturizing.  It's great on my skin.  I do a head-to-toe with it nightly and it keeps my skin all creamy-soft.  It has a nice sweet smell and stays solid at room temperature.  I'm turning thirty and hopefully it'll keep my face totally free of crows feet for a good long time to come.  No expensive anti-wrinkle creams here.  Also, it's fantastic for cooking Thai and Indian food.  Really high heat tolerance.  Takes forever to go rancid, so the shelf life is awesome.  It also clears up the allergic skin rash I get when I use latex gloves.  That stuff makes my knuckles crack and bleed, and the coconut oil is incredibly soothing.  This stuff is a great deal!

review/summary: Great Oil - Great Price
review/text: There's been a lot said recently about the benefits of Coconut oil.  But it's difficult to find quality oil for a good price.  Nutiva extra virgin coconut oil from Amazon.com makes it affordable.  Coconut oil is the best oil to saute with as it doesn't turn into a carcinogen at the regular temp we cook at.  We also add it to our green smoothies, and often use it with a drop of essential oil as an overall skin conditioner in conjunction with our chosen safe skin care line that is much more natural and effective than other things available on the market.  I'm always looking for better ways to help our family be as healthy as possible.  This is a great product to help with that goal.

review/summary: Nutiva Organic EV Coconut Oil
review/text: I LOVE this stuff.  It arrived fairly quickly, but had leaked a bit inside it's box (I suppose that's to be expected with trying to ship an oil in the middle of summer).  I've had it for a month or so and it's only just starting to solidify in the cupboard.<br /><br />The oil smells wonderful, a yummy coconut smell, and when it's heated in a pan it just smells that much better. I use it every time I pan fry anything (eggs, fish, chicken, etc) and it always works wonderfully.  I haven't noticed it adding any coconut flavor to anything really, except perhaps eggs which I don't mind at all.<br /><br />I have used it in baking a couple of times and have had only one issue.  Because it's a 'solid' oil (depending on temperature) when I added cold eggs to the oil and didn't mix fast enough it started to chunk up so things didn't mix very smoothly.<br /><br />I should also add that my son has exzema and has since he was born.  I haven't found anything better then coconut oil to use as an after bath moisturizer for him, and he smells sooooo good when we are done.

review/summary: Great alternative cooking oil
review/text: I first read about the benefits of coconut oil while reading an article in Oxygen Magazine.  I was curious about it's potential benefits so I did more research. I was very surprised to learn how this oil had been the primary source of oil in the United States until there was a propagandist pitch against buying this oil due to conflicts of the world war at the time, as well as the increased interest in corn oil manufacturing in the U.S. Coconut oil became a target of U.S. corn and vegetable oil manufacturers. Today, it's nearly been forgotten or written off because of it's high saturated fat content.  Interesting to note that this oil's properties do not act like other saturated fats because it is a medium-chain triglyceride, which breaks down differently in the liver. After reading the information I gave it a go and I love it.  It is great for all sorts of cooking. It even blends well into a protein shake. It smells wonderful and works as a great skin conditioner and massage oil.  I would highly recommend coconut oil to everyone. Once you try it you won't want to go back to the unhealthy corn or vegetable oils.

review/summary: Create product - hit or miss shipping
review/text: Found this same product for about $5 less at the Vitamin Shoppe website and bought it there.<br /><br />Even with their lowest price shipping, the Nutiva Coconut oil arrived quickly.  However, it opened during transit and leaked everywhere.  Called the customer service number and the gentleman who answered immediately wrote an order to send another shipment to replace my shipped spilled one and the replacement arrived quicker than the quoted time frame for the discount shipping.  This time, it was packed much better and didn't spill.  Seems I'm at least the second person to complain about how Vitamin Shoppe ships their coconut oil - hoping they'll ship it better next time so that they have more profit and I have more instant gratification.<br /><br />On to the product itself and the 5 stars it earns:<br /><br />Nutiva's extra virgin coconut oil has just a faint coconut smell and no taste.  It's liquid at 77�F and great inside and outside the human body.  Can't wait to saute veggies in it tomorrow!  Very psyched Nutiva markets this superfood and The Vitamin Shoppe sells it.

Since yesterday I have tried it on my hair, skin, and on toasted cinnamon bread.  I was surprised at how great it smelled, but I was blown away by how yummy it TASTES!  I really wish that I would have bought a bigger jar!  This will be something that I continue to use for a long time!  Thanks Nutiva and Amazon!<br /><br />UPDATE: I have used my 15 oz. jar in 2 months and I am now ordering the 54 oz. jar...  I am blown away at how delicious this stuff is.  I eat it on toasted bread ALL the time.  I also use it on baked sweet potatos, baked butternut squash, and to cook pancakes on the stove.  My skin and hair are considerably softer!  I want to tell everyone I know about this stuff.

review/summary: Good Deal - Good Oil
review/text: I've been using coconut oil for years.  I took several T. a day for 2-3 years but never lost weight, so I can't recommend it for that.<br /><br />To eat several T. daily, I made a concoction of chocolate melted with coconut oil and kept it in the fridge.  I found that I ate less sugar and chocolate that way--the coconut oil helped me feel satisfied with a little less chocolate. But, perhaps you can see why I wasn't losing weight . . .<br /><br />By making this coco/choc mixture, I was able to add fruit or ground flax seed (I'm allergic to nuts and this gave the choc/coconut oil a nutty flavor like a ganache) or wheat germ (a nutty-like crunch).  These additions helped me maintain a good glycemic index while eating so much candy.<br /><br />When I was using the coconut oil daily, my total cholesterol did rise but my ratio of HDL:LDL greatly improved.  I do believe that coconut oil is the best one to use, I'm just not much of an oil user.<br /><br />Perhaps if I had been substituting for something besides chocolate, I might have lost weight.  I was really adding oil to my diet instead of swapping.  But, even adding 3-4T. daily, I didn't gain weight, either, and I did get the improved cholesterol ratio.<br /><br />By God's grace, I stopped eating sugar in 2008. Now, I use coconut oil on weekends as my "weekend treat" in homemade popcorn.  (Not eating sugar really made me lose weight:  1#/week for 30 weeks, where I've remained for months.)<br /><br />This Nutiva jar is easy to open.  It's probably good to keep smaller amounts in another container to keep the big jar less contaminated . . . but I don't always do that.<br /><br />There was a slight coconut scent at first but that disappeared.  When I lick off the spoon when I make popcorn, I can taste a little bit of coconut, but not much.  I'd highly recommend this brand unless you really wanted that coconut scent.  the lack of scent does make it extremely versatile and much easier to substitute as a butter spread (hot vegetables, toast, etc.)

review/text: This coconut oil is raw. It smells amazing and is super healthy. I use it for everything, from salad dressing to raw vegan deserts, to stir fry, skin moisturizer, hair finisher, massage oil, etc. It's amazing on baked yams. If you eat toast, try mixing raw coconut oil with honey and using it as a spread. This is a great value, and a fabulous product. Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too.

I actually have a small jar I refill for keeping in<br />the bathroom. It has become my lotion after showering.

My skin is supple, no more dryness, more elasticity, and the best of all is it is antibacterial, antifungus and a great disenfectant. I put it on everything. It dries it up. I eat 3 tablespoons of it a day, I cook with it, put it on anything I would normally use butter for. Its great for high heat. I have read it is good for the gums and digestion as well. The body synthesises it well and is beneficial. I would encourge anyone to read about this and try it. there are cookbooks and how to use this on amazon. Thanks to Nutiva and Amazon for carrying it.!!!<br />Its flavor is lightly nutty and love that coconut flavor.

review/text: Our family now uses this in place of butter or other oils for all our cooking needs. It tastes sooo good - it has a very nice lite sweet taste to it. Also it is much healthier for you than butter or other oils. We use All Clad cookware and have no trouble with sticking as long as adequate coconut oil is used when cooking.

review/text: You have to get this if you bake! This makes the BEST pie crust and biscuits ever. We also switched from  butter to coconut oil for frying eggs and it requires a lot less to get the job done. Great product and I will be buying more when we run out. Oh, also I am an extremely picky eater and coconut is a flavor I can not tolerate at all...I can not taste any coconut flavor using this so I'm a very happy camper.

review/summary: Amazing on the face, body, and on food!
review/text: I adore this coconut oil.  It smells incredible, tastes delicious, and adds a lovely sheen to your skin.  I put this on my face before washing it to clean off makeup and regularly use this as a body lotion after showering and to remove eye makeup.  It makes your skin wonderfully soft and yummy-smelling and doesn't have any difficult to pronounce ingredients like regular body lotions do.<br />Also, I use this as a topping for air-popped popcorn (since it's oil, it doesn't have water and doesn't make popcorn soggy - butter does this), and I put it on bread in place of butter since it melts faster and is tasty, and I use it in the pan to cook stir-fry, eggs, and anything else I want to cook!  All in all, this stuff is awesome!  I just wish it came in a better container, but as soon as I run out I'll buy another jug of Nutiva coconut oil (this is my second one).

review/text: This is soooo delicious. Some reviewed the taste as too coconut, I guess you should complain if you purchased Vegetable oil or Olive oil. But it is COCONUT oil, hence the flavor. I use it on toasted bagels, potatoes, to stir fry string beans/ almond slivers. I've used it in my lotions, and hair conditioner (in its liquid form, I mixed it into the products). When my son was a baby, we used it for his delicate skin instead of baby lotions, a great massage oil for adults as well.

review/summary: Working Nicely for my Dog's Itchy Red Skin
review/text: Based on reviews and information I found online I decided to try putting coconut oil on my poodle's dry itchy skin..she was getting yellow flakey areas and pimple/pustules and was itching and licking all the time. In a matter of hours I started to notice a difference (hardly any licking) and by the next day the color of her skin started to normalize. Overnight the redness seemed to return a bit so I'm going to continue applying it. She likes to have it as a treat on her food as well!<br /><br />I'm SO pleased, and incredibly relieved that I've found something natural that seems to relieve her itching a bit.

review/text: I mix a little bit of this with my body lotion and it does wonders for my skin. You don't have to mix it at all and can use it right out of the jar, but this is how I do it.  The smell is incredible and a little goes a long way... I am moisturized all day long.  The downside is I can't apply it to my curly thick hair as a moisturizer because it will get frizzy, and also when I put a little bit on my face I tend to break out...so I only use this as a body lotion and I LOVE it. I live on a island so the smell of the coconut oil keeps all the bugs away...just how I like it : )  Bought this jar in april and still have TONS of it left...

review/summary: Simply THE best tasting!
review/text: I've tried other organic coconut oils, but this is by far, the best tasting one yet!<br /><br />We use this for baking, cooking, as a spread (or mixed in spreads) and even in our huskies' homemade diets.<br /><br />There is a calm scent of coconut when you open the jar... not overbearing at all, while also not bland...and the taste is even better than it smells. It's so good in place (or mixed with) butter and/or olive oil.  I've even used this on orange roughy (and other white fish) and the taste is dreamy...and made a much loved meal even more loved.  --After that meal, my husband even said "when this gets down to 1/3, we will reorder"... he never says this about any "oils".  I don't stop with just fish... this oil gets used (either alone or mixed with other oils) with just about everything that needs oil.<br /><br />I've used this on my skin (and as oil treatment for hair) as well, and love it!  I have very sensitive and prone to dry skin, and this helps.  I'll definitely be using this in my skincare as well.<br /><br />It's a little more expensive than several other brands, but it is so worth it.

review/text: Everything about the oil is amazing the way its processed, you would think they know what a quality product they have...until it came in a plastic bottle. When in the picture you can see its glass and its referred to as a jar (kind of important)!

review/summary: Oil is good, bottle is not
review/text: I like the oil a lot. And do everything with it. The only problem I had was with the way the shipping was handled.<br />The box was obviously too big, oil bottles were not wrapped. A few pieces of bobble wrapped throw inside box did not provide any protection. Bottles were arrived crushed to the point almost broken. Fortunately, the oil was solid not liquid, so no leaking. But I did read another reviews about honey, having problem with the way they were shipped, it got spilled all over the place.

review/summary: Fragrance that takes you out of this world!!
review/text: I am so thrilled to have actually bought this oil. I wouldn't have done it had I not read the reviews of others so thanks to all of them!!  This oil is so pure, untouched, and it smells so perfect. It has delicate coconut aroma, and a taste that is similar to eating tender coconut.<br /><br />I would buy this again and again and again. For anyone who is looking for perfect coconut oil, this one is for you! You will never regret it.

review/summary: Good quality, great to cook with
review/text: We have enjoyed using this product.  I like it specially for cooking lightly breaded fish or vegetables.  It gives a faint pleasant taste of coconut.  I can hardly wait to do some tropical dishes.

review/summary: Completely Satisfied
review/text: I have been enjoying my Nutiva Certified Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.  I am on a moderate low-carb food plan, and it fits right in to a healthy diet.  I use it for sauteing,for making a low-carb chocolate candy, in a low-carb molten chocolate cake, as a spread, and I use it for a moisturizer on my skin.  I also thought this is a good value for my money.  I'm completely satisfied with it.
