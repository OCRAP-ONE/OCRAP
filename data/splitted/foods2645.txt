review/summary: Excellent Taste - No Jittery Energy Burst
review/text: First, the most important thing in my mind - taste. These orange flavored packets punch a wonderful citrus/orange flavor. Not too tangy, and not tart at all, they convey a perfect orange flavor. While not supplying a huge energy burst, they do make a noticeable difference. What they do NOT do, is give you that jittery feeling a lot of energy drinks do.<br /><br />Each packet contains a powdered flavor that completely dissolves in water. Each packet also contains the following - supplied by the company website :<br /><br />Anhydrous Caffeine<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Aids in Focus<br />* Augments muscle strength<br />* Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Chromium<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Regulates hunger<br />* Reduces cravings<br />* Helps protect DNA and RNA<br />* Important to heart function<br />* Helps control fat and cholesterol levels in the blood<br />* Compliments of Suite101.<br /><br />Copper<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Aids in Focus<br />* Augments muscle strength<br />* Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Glucuronolactone<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Aids in Focus<br />* Augments muscle strength<br />* Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Potassium<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Aids in Focus<br />* Augments muscle strength<br />* Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Selenium<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Aids in Focus<br />* Augments muscle strength<br />* Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Sodium<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Aids in Focus<br />* Augments muscle strength<br />* Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Vitamin B12<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Aids in Focus<br />* Augments muscle strength<br />* Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Vitamin B6<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Aids in Focus<br />* Augments muscle strength<br />* Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Vitamin C<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Aids in Focus<br />* Augments muscle strength<br />* Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />Zinc<br />* Increases Energy<br />* Aids in Focus<br />* Augments muscle strength<br />* Raises metabolism by increasing muscle activity.<br /><br />And all of the above come in a wonderfully flavored drink mix.

review/summary: MY Favorite New Energy & Immunity drink
review/text: I am a father who has 3 kids, works 60 hours a week and gets up at 5am every day to work out before spending a an hour with the kids before going to work. I have been forced to live on Energy Drinks my whole married life and every single one gave me a spike in energy and a bigger crash which forced me to over caffeinate every day which ran me down and was getting sick frequently.  My boss is a die hard EBOOSTER and recommended I mix it up and try it. I tried it on a Monday and have taken it every single day since. It gives me a healthy BOOST of Energy a real sense of alertness and sustained energy all day with no crash. Subsequently I have not been sick one time since I started taking EBOOST and I not only depend on it everyday I now recommend it to anyone looking to optimize their health and get great Energy.  Thank you EBOOST for making my life better!

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: I love drinking lemonade year round and this naturally flavored drink mix is really convenient. You just pour one packet into a bottle of water and shake up well. I drink this to avoid other artificially flavored drinks. Yes it still has a little sugar in it but is also sweetened with stevia. It also has some turmeric in it for color which is really good for you. At only 15 calories a drink I feel I can drink something sweet and not feel guilty about it. Give this a try I think you'll love it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Once I got over the mentality of puffs of this sort only tasting like cheese, they actually became quite addictive.  Very puffy, light and crunchy.  Not too sweet and not artificial tasting - check the ingredients, it actually includes more banana powder than salt.<br /><br />They're good.  You just might want to get more than one pack at a time.

I can't imagine making gravy without a tablespoon of this in it.  When I make a pot roast in the crock pot, I put it right in with the rest of the ingredients.  It adds a subtle but very pleasant flavor and gives a beautiful color to the gravy.<br /><br />It has a very long shelf life. It is not expensive and worth every penny.  It is one of my favorite products.  I was thrilled to find out I could buy it online as I ran out of it and could not believe not one grocery store in my area had it any more.  I thought life as I knew it was over. Buy this product.  You won't be sorry.  It can even be used in Turkey gravy.

review/text: I am a fan of Uncle Sam's flaxseed cereal and I wanted to try another cereal to mix with it.  Skinner's has four ingredients: whole wheat kernels, raisins, salt, and barley malt.  I opened my first box and I found that the raisins were somewhat clumped together, but they are plump. It's just like Uncle Sam's cereal without whole flaxseeds and raisins. It has no high fructose corn syrup.  If sugar's your thing, add it yourself.  Skinner's is a welcome addition to my favorite healthy cereal hall of fame!

review/summary: A Bowl a Day / 3 generations of fans
review/text: My Dad introduced us to Skinner's years ago. We are now three generations and extended family fans of this cereal. We have some dissenters in the family and I am controversial because I prefer my skinner's after it sits in the milk for a while as that allows all the flavor to emerge from the cereal. One look at the nutritional value of Skinner's versus Post or Kellogg's on the basis of sodium (skinner's very low) and fiber (skinner's very high) will tell you to give this a try. I admit the taste is maybe not for everybody as it isn't sweet but I have always found it to have a raisin in every bite and we enjoy it. We all add a banana, berries or other fruit to make it a wonderful breakfast. My family orders it in bulk because no stores sel it in our area. Thanks to Attune for remarketing this great cereal.

review/text: I have yet to try this product personally, because it is not currently available at our supermarket. But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

review/summary: Healthy family
review/text: I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste. But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great.

review/summary: Yummy~My treat instead of High Sugar Cookies.
review/text: First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda.<br />I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.

review/text: Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a "sweet" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/summary: Fab, as long as you understand what's in them!
review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

review/summary: Good enough!
review/text: For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

review/text: I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!

review/summary: wonderful alternative
review/text: My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/summary: Big Chocolate Taste
review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/summary: Best Sugar Free Cookie~You get 8 as a serving :)
review/text: It is hard to believe these are sugar free. They are so good. They are buttery and rich tasting and a serving is 8 cookies of 130 calories. That is so filling and yet still keeps you on whatever plan you are following.<br /><br />I have tried many of the flavors of these cookies and not found one to be bad or have an aftertaste. This one is my all time favorite. You will not be disappointed. In my town they are usually $3.99 a pack so this is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />They come with a long expiration date also.

review/text: I've really enjoyed these cookies, and came to Amazon as this one is hard to find. Much to my SHOCK the price is 60+ dollars.. and it shows they used to be 30.00 and some change? Huh?? Other cookies by Murray are more reasonable. No way will I buy them at this incredible markup :-P

review/summary: Disappointed with Amazon
review/text: Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite.

review/text: Have a family member that is diabetic, so I always keep some of these on hand for when we get together and standard sweets are not an option.  Very tasty.  They used Splenda, so that will be a pro or con to you, depending on if you like it.<br /><br />I am very thankful for these cookies for helping to provide a bit or normalcy for this family member.  Just like normal cookies, but sugar-free.  Several great varieties.  Worth a try if you are looking for a sugar-free cookie.

review/text: A friend bought me back this delicious Oriental Beauty Loose Leaf tea from her trip home to Taiwan. When you first open the carton, you'll think someone pulled a prank on you because the tea leaves look like dried twigs. But once you add the boiling, hot water and let it steep, it makes a world of difference. I am in love with its strong, fragrant aroma. I sweeten mine with a teaspoon of pure honey and recommend brewing it a bit longer than the instructions read for a bolder taste.

review/summary: not as expected
review/text: I ordered the chia seeds believing they were whole seeds but they are ground up. The beauty of these seeds is in the crunchiness added to yogurt, cereal, baked goods. They are very digestible as whole, no need for grinding. I would never want them ground up for use. This is a very poor choice for use. I would recommend to anybody who is looking for healthy foods to add to their diet, to buy whole chia seeds.

review/summary: Great for potty training!!
review/text: I adopted a 1 year old Yorkie rescue pup who is only semi potty trained. I was having some troubles getting him to potty outside today (like most days). Then these awesome treats arrived! I ordered the Zukes mini naturals roasted chicken treats last night and they were already here this morning with Prime. I gave him one to taste test and he gobbled it up and instantly wanted another. I then grabbed two of them, went outside with him knowing I had the treats in hand and I asked him to go potty. He went instantly! I think tasty treats really do make a big difference. These are also nice and small so giving them a few isn't going to pile on the pounds. We are feeding our pups a grain free dog food so it only makes sense to get grain free treats too. I will be back for more of these for sure both of my pups LOVE these!!!

review/text: Our puppy (5 month old labradoodle) loves these. They are great for training at home or at the park, but don't do the job very well when in puppy class. I think they don't smell as good/strong as some of the other stuff, so with multiple distractions it makes it difficult to get his attention.

review/text: Our dog loves these.  We started her on it when she was 7 weeks old (and had about 4 teeth), and she loved it.  She was still too young to eat milk bones or even beggin' strips, but she could eat these.  I also don't feel bad about giving these to her because they are only 3.5 calories each. There is a rapid change in behavior when she hears me open up the treat bag... she sits, stops chewing, and starts randomly performing tricks, hoping to get one... it's pretty funny. We have repurchased these and will continue to do so.

review/summary: My Dog & Pup LOVE it!
review/text: I call this product, "puppy crack".  I have a 3 month old lab pup who, against type -- Labradors are supposed to be gobblers -- doesn't gobble his high quality kibble.  In fact, he grazes.  But when I unseal the package of Zuke's, he bounds at me bouncing in the air.  I taught him "sit" in two minutes using Zuke's (Chicken).  My 19 month old Catahoula Leopard Dog-girl loves them, too.<br /><br />I like the small size of these treats (it's easy to carry them in a snack size ziploc) -- perfect for training/rewards.  I pretty exclusively purchase natural, high quality food/treats for my animals companions.  Zuke's is our household's favorite canine treat!

review/summary: Good size for training
review/text: My dog loves these and they're my training treats of choice.  I've only tried the chicken flavor.<br /><br />They're semi-moist, not messy, and pretty small.  They're not scored, but can still be halved or quartered with a sharp knife or a long fingernail.  Each piece has 3 calories.  For med-small dogs, you can cut them down into really tiny bits and still make a dog happy.  If you quarter them, you could give 20 rewards during training and only be adding 15 calories.<br /><br />The bag has a reclosable seal, and you'll need it because they dry out and get hard and crumbly if left exposed.  If I take some with me away from the house, I put precut treats in a snack-sized zip bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />They also come in a larger sized bag which is more economical.

review/summary: Great for training
review/text: We have tried a lot of different treats (Milo's kitchen meatballs, Train-Me treats, etc), all of which were great, but I have settled on Zuke's because they are already the right size for a small dog and seem to be made with not too many fillers.  I have a 2 1/2 year old rescue who had a lot of 'tude for 11 lbs.  We adopted her a year ago supposedly already house- and crate trained, but she was absolutely neither. Apart from great advice on aspca.org, it takes a TON of treats to start training an adult dog from scratch.  Of course we used plenty of things around the house (cut up string cheese, hard boiled eggs, stuffed frozen peanut butter in Kongs), but sometimes you don't have anything prepared and you have to crate the dog and get to work. She loves these treats and has proved a quick study.  Happy treating!

review/text: Using Zuke's mini snack for my 6 1/2 month Siberian Husky has been fantastic. Before starting her on Obedience classes I was required to find something she really went for. I guess it was the trainer's way of making her training easier for her. This natural product has been amazing! It's chewy and savory and just right for my picky dog/pup. Except my pup prefers the beef flavor but thankfully she is now becoming a well-behaved dog.

review/text: The aroma of these treats is fantastic--there's a tantalizing meaty, smokey smell that wafts from the bag. And the texture of the treats are pleasingly soft and moist. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed when I tried them. I think they are rather bland, and because they are coarsely ground there are hard bits of stuff in them, one of which got caught between my teeth. I think they could have used a little bit more salt. Also, they're a little small so it takes a lot to fill me up.<br /><br />On the other hand, my puppy loves these things and they have been great motivators for teaching her tricks, so I guess they have that going for them.

review/text: These are sooo great for training. I just stick a few in my back pocket, usually even break them into halves or thirds and use as treats. My dog loves them, and while she isn't the pickiest, she certainly doesn't like some treats. The real reason they are great though is because she likes them enough so that she will do her tricks for only a third of the treat! (This is an extremely tiny portion, which shows how flavorful they are.) And if they estimate correctly that's only one calorie of her diet! Can't go wrong, I've had chicken and salmon and both are great.

review/text: These treats are a great choice. There all natural. My pom mix has a very sensitive tummy and this treat does not bother him. As soon as I grab the bag my dogs try to do there tricks as fast as they can to get one of these. There soft in texture and the size is great for my 3 month old chi mix who is only 4 lbs. The only reason I gave this treat 4 stars is because they smell horrible other than that if you can deal with the smell. I recommend these! especially to anyone how has a small dog or a dog with a sensitive tummy!
