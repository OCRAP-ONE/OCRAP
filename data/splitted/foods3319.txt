review/summary: A Culinary Rainbow in Eden's Sea Breeze Garden
review/text: This recently redeemed saturated fat is an unusually elegant offering. Liquid above 78 degrees, when below that temperature this exotic substance solidifies into a white, wax-like, creamy fat which for my tastes is even more versatile, flavorful, and healthful in culinary concoctions than coconut milk [though I LOVE everything about coconut].<br /><br />Since other reviews have effectively detailed health benefits, varieties of uses, and comparisons of brands, I'll work another angle and design a recipe specifically for the assets of this oil as my experience with it conjures...<br /><br />Imagine melting this creamy solid as you might do with dry chunks of fresh, unsalted butter dropped easily into a chef's stainless steel [or cast iron] skillet.  After the coconut lard has melted, coating the pan with its clear, wavering liquid radiating from mildly searing heat [not over 350 degrees], carefully sizzle in a half-dozen large, cleaned prawns and a fresh salmon steak.  Prior to hitting the pan, the sea morsels should have been eased from a state of cool moisture into a warmer, drier presentation, to avoid spattering when placed into the heated oil, and to avoid cooling the oil to a temperature too low for an immediate, light searing to occur on the surface of the ocean-plumped, sweet-pink edibles.<br /><br />Think of the sweet, paradise-rich flavor of coconut, coating a crisp, caramelized surface onto the salty tang of the shrimp and salmon meats... [Your mouth might be watering now. Mine is!]<br /><br />Put on a CD with the happy 40's tune of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000005MWP">Rum & Coca Cola</a> sending dancing notes around your stove-top, putting an upbeat rhythm into your head ... from down in Trinidad.  [Your feet will be making up their own motions now.]<br /><br />Crack a bit of sea salt crystal over the hissing ocean treats. Overlap that seasoning with cleaned, halved garlic cloves dropped into the skillet, followed by large sprigs of fresh dill, fennel stalks, and a half-cup of shelled, dark walnut meats.<br /><br />After the pan's contents have been seared golden on all main sides, pour in about a cup of dry white wine [enough liquid to retain itself without simmering away into steam, but not so much as to smother the meats and dissolve the top layer of dark, caramelized coating]. Squeeze a fresh lime into the steaming liquid in the pan, followed by a splash or two of quality blackberry juice and a sliced, fresh, ripe peach [which will stew into the concoction, coalescing into an almost unimaginable flavor of sweet, sour highlights held by a texture of pulpy fruit]. Simmer and swish the heavenly blend maybe a minute, taking care to heat all participants but not overcook the shrimp or salmon.<br /><br />Crack fresh black pepper over the brew in the skillet, then serve onto a large, multi-colored, festive plate, over a mound of Quinoa [see my review  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0C56M">Alter Eco Fair Trade White Quinoa from Bolivia, 16-Ounce Boxes</a>] which has been cooked, then warmly toasted in Macadamia Nut Oil [see my review of  Macadamia Nut Oil 16 fl.oz] with garlic bits and chives, adding fresh mint as a last touch.<br /><br />Garnish the presentation of Quinoa, Prawns, and salmon steak with sugar snap peas which have been sauteed in almond oil [see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LVFSU">NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil, Edible, 16 ounce</a>] with slivers of red onion, angle-sliced celery, toasted, halved almonds, and sprigs of fresh cilantro.<br /><br />There you have a culinary rainbow, from a Shelnutt dreaming in Eden's Sea Breeze Garden.<br /><br />Before taking your first, saliva-rich bite, with your "Rum & Coca Cola" CD still dancing through the air waves in your gorgeous, eat-in, gourmet kitchen, be sure to have your KINDLE to read at the table, with a story ready which will rhythm your thoughts into the 50's, when songs from the 40's were still dancing in the minds of the cooks of the world, COAL & COCA-COLA, a short, true story with photos, about a bakery opened in that vintage era.<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />This review gives a complement, contrast to a video review I've posted on Dr. Bruce Fife's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle</a>.

review/summary: HAS ALL THE RIGHT ELEMENTS
review/text: Coconut oil is sensitive to light and can break down easily, so it should be packaged in a dark container (way to go Barlean's).  Also, to keep it as nutritionally rich as possible, it should be cold-pressed and Barlean's is indeed cold-pressed.  I have had flavorless and dry coconut oils, so this coconut oil delighted me--smells divine and has a lovely consistency.  Coconut oil is amazing, it can be used for cooking (it is the most stable--healthy--oil at high temperatures), baking etc. and it is excellent for your skin and your hair!  I keep a jar in my kitchen and one in my bathroom!

review/text: I learned that coconut oil of high quality is not only great for cooking but also for brushing on toasts and even for rubbing on skin with atopy. It soothes the skin after washing the face.  I love using the oil especially for stir fry of mostly vegetables as it gives slight sweet coconut flavor. This oil is a staple in my pantry now.

review/summary: Great! High Quality product.
review/text: I had never used coconut oil but I wanted to try it.  This is a nice high quality oil that I use for both hair and skin (and I use it on my cuticles as well).  It comes in a good container so that when the oil is liquid it can't spill out.  Now that its warmer the oil is about half/half solid/liquid.  When I first got it, it was still cold and I had to run it under hot water so that enough of it would melt for me to use it.  I'm still learning about the uses and benefits but so far it is a nice, very light oil that I love.

review/text: This stuff has just the lightest coconut smell.  I like many others use this in replacement for lotions and have been able to avoid a lot of the itchy reactions I get from regular lotions with added fragrance.  I had been paying extra for more natural lotions that were primarily coconut oil, avocado oil etc- this is cheaper, and just as effective.  It does take some serious time to absorb, and you'll need less than you think you do, but once it does the coconut smell is pretty much gone and your skin feels great.

review/summary: it smells good!!!!
review/text: this product came fast and was sealed, a lot of people dont mention if a product comes sealed or not but you need to know with coconut oil because if you live in a hot state it will be in liquid form and you dont want it spilling all over the place ok now on to the product when i first opened it, it smelled so good and it does kinda smell like roasted nuts but the smell is not too strong to turn you off and then i tasted it but it had no taste and i havent cooked with it because im using it for my body. after i shaved it put some on and it made my skin smooth and mosty importantly it wasnt greasy you just dont know how much i hate greasy oils that sit on top of your skin and do nothing oh and i put this on my hiarline and it made it feel soooo soft, i know in my previous reviews i've said that im giving up on oils but i was just using the wrong ones the whole time and now i've found an oil that gonna be sticking around<br /><br />ps. when it arrived it was in soild form so i just put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and it didnt turn into complete liquid but wasnt soild i think its easier to use this way because when you rub it in your hands it turns to liquid anyway<br /><br />pss. i hate the fact that this organic coconut oil came in a plastic jar it would have been nice if it came in a glass jar

It has a roasted coconutty smell, I really cannot explain it but it is not bad at all just different. I love how it is an all natural, cold-pressed oil and there's enough in the jar to last maybe a few months if you do not use too much. Honestly you do not need a whole lot to reap the benefits of this oil. As far as the packaging goes that was good also! It had a lot of air filled plastic bags inside to keep it from rolling around. I am very,very pleased with this product and I plan on buying more in the future.<br /><br />:)

review/summary: Miracle oil
review/text: I took the leap in trying coconut oil after reading about using it as a deep conditioning treatment for hair.  I have very curly, coarse hair and combination (though mostly dry) skin.  Barlean's was the first I've tried, and I think I'm a coconut oil missionary now!  I love the light scent.  Since I've been using this product, my skin is much softer and moisturized.  I used it as a skin lotion and I've noticed a significant improvement in the texture and elasticity of my skin.  My face is smoother, my legs don't get irritated after shaving anymore, and my hair is much softer and healthier.  I highly recommend Barlean's; it was the most expensive for the 16 oz. jar, but from what I'm reading, the quality is better.  If one wants the scent, it's the one to get.  If you want to go with something with no scent, another brand might better serve.

My nails are always damaged from weather and house work.  After 2 days I saw results with my hair and skin.  I literally put it in my hair everyday.  Once a week I message my scalp with it.  I use less conditioner.  I don't need frizz stuff, my hair is shiney and smooth. I use the oil right before putting on lotion and it just adds extra softness to my skin, my nails are harder, and longer.  It tastes great.  I have recommended this to other people.

review/text: I first tried Lou Anna Coconut oil for cooking, then moved to Spectrum Organic and thought it was decent.  By then  I was eating a tablespoon a day before work.  Then I saw rave reviews on Barleans and decided to give it a try.  I could tell the difference from opening the bottle and just smelling the coconut aroma and subtle sweetness.  Spectrum has a chemically coconut smell and mild sweet flavor, but Barleans is similar to drinking coconut milk.  Delicious!  I don't even mix it with anything, just eat it straight.  Then during the day I rub it on my skin and hair for extra benefits!  I'm a coconut oil nut, now.  I tell everyone how much it can help their health and general wellbeing and people are starting to wake up.  So just try it, you won't regret it!

I also put a tiny bit in my daughter's hair after washing it- she's mixed race and that super-curly hair gets dry so easily.  None of the J&J products were any good for detangling but the coconut oil really helps keep her curls defined and thus less tangly.  I also use it on our skin sometimes and it really softens.  I've heard that it can help with scars (acne, stretch marks) but I'm not sure about putting it on my face.  Great product and lasts a long time!

In regards to the packaging, I didn't have any bad experiences with it.

It works great, softens any rough spots on your skin and absorbs quickly. It also seems to sooth mosquito bites and skin irritations. Sometimes I put a teaspoon or two in my morning coffee if I need a little pick me up, and it works great for that too. I had some blood work done after using coconut oil for about a year and my blood work was much better. Great stuff and reasonably priced too!

review/summary: "Lovely bunch of coconuts"
review/text: Barlean's organic extra virgin coconut oil has a wonderful taste - great on toast, with a light sprinkling of cinnamon over the coconut oil!  Also tasty when mixed with hot oatmeal.<br /><br /> I accidentally discovered that it makes a top-quality hand treatment, setting up a moisturizing barrier for my dry skin.  That lead me to massage the oil into my arms and legs, with gratifying results!<br /><br />It's reassuring to know this oil is organic and free from man-made chemicals.

review/summary: Great addition to your kitchen
review/text: I have been using Barleans Coconut oil for about a year now and it has been a great addition to all of my cooking adventures.  It comes in a mostly solid form, so it is easy to use just the right amount.  It has a very nice but soft aroma and it adds minimal flavor to any dish that I have used it in.  I'm a fan.

If I get any other brand I will report back to compare.

review/text: Okay so tell you; I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! Well I love coconut oil period. I purchased this product at the health food store almost twice this amount and have been using it everyday on my face, skin, and hair. The dark spots on my face have lighten up to the point were they are almost gone, my hair is much softer and stopped falling out so much and my skin is super smooth. My next thing is to try to eat a couple tablespoons like some others to see if the weight loss really happens like some have said. But if it doesn't I'm still very satisfied about the other things it has done for me. It is definitely worth trying and sticking with.

review/summary: product's visual appearance?
review/text: Two jars of Barlean's organic coconut oil arrived on time and in excellent condition with a sale date in 2013.  All seals, external and internal, were intact.  Upon opening, no suspicious odor of any kind was noticed, only a light coconut smell meets the nose.  However, the oil, currently well solid, does not have a uniform appearance.  In places that might be due to proximity to the black jar. In other places, however, swirls of oil seem denser or grayer or perhaps not as gelled.  Any frequent user could tell me whether this is common with this product.  A call to the manufacturer's representative said comment could not be made unless the contents were seen and that I might easily return the jars to Amazon, which I would rather not do if it is able to be used.  Thanks.

review/text: I have used this in my cooking & on my skin, and it's amazing! When I add it to my smoothies, it seems to suppress my appetite in the morning as well as give me a little boost of energy! Not caffeine sort of energy, but just a natural feel-good kind. I also use it every few nights on my face as a moisturizer and it's been phenomenal! I had awful dry patches this winter and it smoothed them out in days! It's also helped me even out the tone of my skin. I don't use it every night, however, because I'm scared it would break me out, as I have sensitive skin. This is definitely worth the price and you get SO MUCH product. I've barely made a dent in my jar!

review/summary: RUINED SHIPMENT
review/text: I ordered this product along with another brand of coconut oil and six CD's. I arrived home to find an oil soaked box sitting on top of my mail box (I was away from home 2 hrs during which the mail was delivered) ....the temp was almost 100 degrees.  I opened the box to find a huge mess!  The other brand oil was enclosed in a sealed plastic bag that was dry inside even though the oil itself was liquified....when I removed the lid, the seal on the top was completely intact.<br /><br />This product, however, was put in the box loose.  The plastic jar seal was unbroken but the lid turned easily so I could clearly see how the liquified oil had come out and gotten all over the interior of the box.....including the six CD's....with oil seeping up into their plastic coverings and onto the paper jackets.  When I broke the plastic "ring" that is supposed to seal the outside of the jar, I found that the seal on the top was not secured to the top but had come loose so the oil came out and under the loose top.....since it wasn't in a bag, it went everywhere in the box.  This was a packaging DISASTER all around!!!!<br /><br />I found this order didn't "qualify" for leaving feedback under the packaging feedback tab in the order category.......so I can only assume it is the seller's responsibility; and the inner seal does definitely need to be addressed by them.  The oil tastes fine but I certainly will never order again.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I was gratified to find that Amazon reads these reviews and reacts to them....after posting this review, I received an email apologizing for my experience and advising that I would receive a replacement for the Barlean's.  I did receive the Barlean's which arrived with no problem; it was packed the same way but was sent two-day shipping so didn't sit in any heat for extended times....also, this jar didn't have the failed seal under the lid when I opened it.  I appreciate and was impressed by Amazon's response but, to be honest, I have to wonder if when regularly shipped it still wouldn't be a problem since it's not enclosed in a plastic bag inside the box and if sent via USPS in this heat is almost certainly going to melt.

review/summary: Smells like cinnamon toast
review/text: I love coconut oil. I use it on my skin every day and I use it in my cooking (different container, lol).<br /><br />I get another organic coconut oil from a local store that doesn't have a strong smell like this one. It's not a bad smell! I love putting it on my skin, and I think it smells wonderful, but my boyfriend complains that I smell like toast! Haha! Because of that I don't know if it would work as well in cooking as the other coconut oil I get, and I have only used this one on my skin.<br /><br />It makes my skin feel softer. I also like to use it on my feet, not only because it has made them feel soft like real feet again (I walk around bare foot a lot) but because it is anti-fungal and anti-bacterial it can protect my feet! I like that!<br /><br />Great product if you like the smell of toast!

review/text: i like the jar/packaging for this product for a couple of reasons-- one being just basic marketing but the other being that it is a wide-mouth open jar which makes it easier to extract the oil out of when it gets low. That being said, when it comes to taste & smell i didn't think this one was nearly as delicious as the Spectrum brand. purchasing this one over another brand really depends on your personal preferences and what your intentions for using the product are.

I use it on my hair and it has been better than any over the counter overpriced oil.It has been great on my skin without any breakage since I have sensitive skin.I only have one problem.It gets hard when cold and is sometimes hard to melt. I have found a warm place in my house and keep the jar there yet I see it can cause the plastic jar to be greasy. All in all I will get a lot of use this winter and not go broke buying skin and hair oils.

review/summary: All purpose oil
review/text: So I had used coconut oil in the past but wasn't enthralled with the brand I had or results.  I decided to give coconut oil another try.  I did a lot of research and decided to try this one.  First off, packaging was great and fast (I love Amazon Prime)!<br />  In regards to the product itself...I love it!  I use it for my skin, hair and cooking.  I like coconut oil because it is not too heavy.  I have natural hair and a bit of a product junkie so I am always looking for a product that works with my hair.  I've used it for detangling, sealing, and in my hair mixtures.  This product leaves a subtle scent in my hair which I like experiencing and it moisturizes my skin without leaving an oily residue.<br />  I tried cooking with it for the first time.  I made a curry dish and used the coconut oil as a base.  It was awesome and easy to cook with!  Not too greasy, did not burn.  I could definitely taste the coconut but it wasn't overpowering at all.<br />  So all in all I would definitely recommend this product and I plan on buying it again!

review/summary: Even better than my high hopes!
review/text: After much research on amazon and other websites, I chose to buy this organic coconut oil to use primarily on my skin.  I love it more with each use, my skin is noticeably and increasingly softer and more supple after a few weeks of use, but even after the first use my skin felt and looked very healthy.  I have used it as a replacement for lotion, both on my body and my face.  I only need about two tablespoons to cover my entire body.  I believe it has even improved the skin on my face, which can be sensitive to synthetic lotions and break out.  The oil has a pleasant fresh coconut smell and taste, which fades after rubbing it in, so don't worry about smelling strongly of coconut (not like tanning lotion).<br /><br />As other reviewers have said: coconut oil is solid (hard vegetable shortning-like texture) at room temperature, but turns softer and eventually to liquid at 76 degrees fahrenheit.  So, it melts quickly on your skin of course.<br /><br />I also used some of the oil in a homemade hot cocoa recipe, it had a pleasant taste and didn't seem "oily".<br /><br />Hope this review helps!  I highly recommend this product. Great price for what you get, too.

To be on the safe side, in case the supermarket does raise the price, I purchased four boxes - for the same price as Amazon is selling a single box!<br /><br />The one-star I rated this item was for the Amazon price, not for the quality of the product.

review/summary: Best Fruit Snacks ever!
review/text: When we were visiting out west, our grandson had a box of these snacks.  Of course, Mama & Papa had to be sure that this wasn't just junk food with no nutrional value.  Were we ever surprised when we tried these little gems!  The center is filled with fruit juice - not just sugar water or some other substance.  When we returned to the east coast we immediately went looking for these snacks but to our dismay we couldn't find them anywhere.  As always when I need something I look on Amazon since they usually have it for less than anyplace.  Low & behold there was our grandson's BIG box of Black Forest Fruit Snacks!!  It took only a minute to order a box and we have been enjoying them ever since!  Thank you for stocking these great snacks!  Please don't ever stop!!

review/summary: Delicious- best fruit snack ever
review/text: These fruit snacks are delicious and I thought I got a great deal. I did not price compare between 50 different physical locations like some of the reviewers. All I know is that these are the best fruit snacks I've ever had. I also recommend their Juicy Oozer's which actually might be better. The juice actually gives me the goose bumps when I eat them sometimes. These things are terrific.

review/text: I purchased this item at the super market at Halloween time.  They are very flavorful soft, chewy treats. Similar to Gummi Bears but they have a juicy center and intense flavor. I went back to buy more because my teen age grandson loves them and they were all gone. Much to my chagrin they are only available in my area for Halloween. They make great snacks for children and adults.

review/summary: Picky cat loves it
review/text: I've been looking for a good wet food to feed my picky cat.  Previously went through every brand of canned cat food, and he'd eat the first portion out of the can, and turn his nose up at everything after that.  But he has kidney issues so the vet strongly recommends wet food...<br />Found this food and he LOVES it.  It actually looks and smells like something I might eat (at a pinch), and I love that I can prepare only as much as he'll eat right then.  It also feels more environmentally friendly - one small bag vs. dozens and dozens of tin cans.  It appears to have all the nutrients and such that he needs as well.

review/summary: Our cats really like it.
review/text: I was looking for a good, clean food that was easy to store, easy to carry up 5 flights of stairs (if the elevator was out), that came at a reasonable price. Grandma Lucy's met those criteria. We feed mostly grain-free and high-quality foods to our two cats, because we've found over the years (with several cats) that this helps maintain their weight best and prevents dander (and allergies) for their humans.  I tried Prowl first, but it just didn't appeal to them or me: it was really powdery and, when prepared, looked like pureed meat baby food, way too soupy when prepared according to directions. So I looked at other options.<br /><br />Our vet had Lucy's on their list of recommended brands, but I never saw it in the store. Finally just ordered some, and it's a great success.  The cats don't always like it served alone, but we try to feed a variety anyway, so they don't get too set on one food. I usually mix 1/4 cup with a tablespoon of Wellness canned (flavors vary) and a tablespoon of pumpkin (to boost the fiber for our intestinally-challenged cat), all blended with some hot water (to warm up the chilled canned components), and they NEVER turn up their noses. They will eat it alone if they're hungry, but they prefer a mix.  The first time I tried this food, I was impressed with how appetizing it smelled--like Thanksgiving dinner, really.  Amazing.  The powdered flakes are NOT all potato, like other reviewers have implied. Some of the flake material is chicken or fish, but there are also chunks of chicken and fish for some textural variety.  I'm not sure if the flax seeds make any difference; I thought flax had to be ground or at least abraded to be digested. I might e-mail the company to ask.

review/text: I ordered this item a couple months ago and love the flavor.  I use it just about everyday on so many foods(even popcorn). Since the grinder bottle is refillable I just ordered a large jar of it. I didnt give it 5 stars because I found one thing quite annoying.  The label information, except the Faerie's Finest logo, disappears as you twist it to grind the salt. I have never had any problems like that with other grinders.  So I hope the company reads  comments and come up with a label that will withhold the use.  As of now, when I refill the jar I need to somehow mark it with what type of salt it is.  (NOTE: all other information regarding what the contents are etc. are gone.)

review/text: I'm really pleased that Korean food is beginning to ebb into the mainstream, but anyone who's interested in cooking Korean food should still make the trip down to their local Korean market and buy the genuine article.<br /><br />Annie Chun has altered the taste profile of gochujang significantly, as well as consistency.  It has the consistency of sauce that's already mixed with sesame oil, but not the richness, and it's far too sweet.  The spicy is not full bodied, but flat, and there's a slightly weird aftertaste in the bibimbap I made with this sauce.<br /><br />I've never had any of these problems with gochujang from any of the major Korean brands (all you'll find in the vast majority of Korean/Asian markets).  Ugh.

review/summary: Very healthy for your babies - different texture; but good!
review/text: Let me start by saying I'm a very cheap person and for the past 4 years have only give my cats Friskees wet food. I actually did splurge and get them Royal Canin Sensitive Stomach as dry food though, in my defense. And that stuff isn't cheap. However, in the past few months, my older cat started licking all the hair off of her stomach and was scratching constantly. Two trips to the vet and two steroid injections later, everything was ruled out but an allergic reaction to either the litter I was using (Arm & Hammer) or the food. To avoid paying more vet bills and to make my little fur baby happy, I decided to man(woman) up and get the good stuff. You know, the stuff with no disgusting animal by-products, rice, grain, and brewer's yeast in it. I never really took the time to read the back of the Friskee's label or the label of the Royal Canin. You think if you pay a lot for something it will be healthy, but it's not! I feel like such a bad parent.<br /><br />In any event I completely switched everything. Started using pine pellets for the litter, which is all natural, and got this Core brand food because it appeared to be exactly what my cats needed -something completely free of anything bad for them. I was also instructed by my vet not to feed them chicken or beef because a lot of allergies come from that. So I have only purchased the Turkey/Duck/Seafood types of Core food; both wet and dry.<br /><br />Summary of the wet: Yeah, it's almost $2.00 a can. Makes you a little ill thinking about it. But I've never seen my cats literally lick the entire plate clean and want more than two servings in a day of ANYTHING. When I fed them Friskee's I was easily throwing away half a can a day just by having it be left over and stale on their plate. Not with this Core food. They devour it and come back for more. It's amazing. My wallet doesn't thank me but those cats sure do!<br /><br />As for the dry food: It's a little different in shape/texture than other dry foods. They eat it, but I think they like the wet better. I leave out dry food during the day in case they get hungry so I know they are eating it, but they much prefer the wet.<br /><br />My animals eat better than I do and get better medical care than I do. *Sigh*

review/summary: True peach flavor
review/text: I admit, I am picky when it comes to peaches. They have to be really fresh! And when we moved into our own home recently, the very first thing I did was plant a Sweet Georgia Peach tree. My favorite kind.<br /><br />Now, I have to warn you, these are NOT as wonderful as biting a peach still warm from the sun and fresh from the tree before you bring it in and wash it. The juice from these jelly beans don't run down your chin when you bite into them. BUT these are the best peach flavored candy I have met in a very long time. There are only a couple of these flavors I would consider buying a whole pound of in individual flavors. The first is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007J6JY7S">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Lemon Jelly Beans</a> and the second is this one.<br /><br />While your taste buds may find others that are better, these are the two that hit the spot for me.<br /><br />I was originally given a complimentary sampler of all of the flavors (which I reviewed) but these beans are so unique that I wanted to share my opinion of them on some of the individual pages as well. These ate A+ Jelly Beans!

review/summary: Tastes like strawberry chalk
review/text: I bought this 24-Count box of Extreme Berries over six months ago to liven up bottled water for my long stays on campus. I didn't really consider the purported health benefits and I think I snagged them when they were discounted. The first time I mixed some up I noted the taste was unusual in some way but also picked up on its "natural" flavoring. I'm not implying it's not naturally flavored, but that the flavor tasted natural, which is a good thing. Even at a discount they weren't exactly cheap either so I really wanted to like them. But 6 months later I have more than half left and I rarely finish them once I've mixed them up. I typically get through about 3/4ths of it and then I can't really stand the taste anymore. Now part of the problem is they may have aged and the ingredients may have deteriorated without the demonized preservatives I presume they excluded. But now it tastes, if it didn't always, like strawberry chalk. If it was the only sweet thing I ever allowed myself to have, it probably would taste pretty good. But now it kind of tastes like a bunch of ground up sweet tarts suspended in water without the sugar. Now that I've picked out this chalkiness it seems very distinct and I just can't enjoy it anymore. Now considering all the good stuff its supposed to have in it, and the ingredient list does seem to impress, it's important to be fair. This is a health food (dietary supplement as it says on the box) and that wasn't really what I was looking for. It's not the worst tasting of that kind of product I've ever had and all I can really say is that in that regard it meets expectations.<br /><br />Note that it is sweetened with stevia if that interests you. Really this is all about the antioxidant blend. I don't know what competition is out there but I can say the other means of imbibing the antioxidants in this seem to me like a far less palatable endeavor.

review/summary: Delicious Acai from Amazon
review/text: I have been using this product for years.  Like all products, the price may stay the same, but the contents are reduced in order for the manufacturer to convince the consumer they do not raise their prices.  Just keep one packet and watch in a year - contents will be reduced.  I now find myself using 2 packets to make one good drink.  I also like to sweeten it up a bit and found a great natural sweetener (great for diabetics) - Xylitol.  Been using this to satisfy the sweet tooth and it makes Acai drinks that much better, plus helps me to lower my Glucose levels.<br /><br />I also found Amazon was very competitive on Acai, so I always will purchase it from them.<br /><br />As far as Amazon is concerned, they are always the best, very responsible, delivers on time, and stands behind their sales.

review/summary: Exactly The Vermont Style Of Childhood
review/text: Maypo Vermont Style does indeed have a different texture than regular oatmeal - this is exactly what makes it so delicious.  It has a finer grainy texture rather than the more swollen pasty texture of regular oatmeal.  I love both.  The Vermont Style Maypo must be cooked exactly to the package instructions or you will not be satisfied with the texture as a previous reviewer stated.  When the instructions are followed to a T, the outcome is delicious.  The difference is just enough to make this variety a category on it's own in the hot cereal line-up.  Maypo products are one of the very few companies who have not meddled with it's original recipe.  I'm so glad I found an affordable way to buy this childhood delight on-line.  Needless to say, living in Iowa makes Maypo Vermont Style hard to find on the store shelves.

review/summary: NOT MY MAYPO
review/text: I was so thrilled to finally find Maypo, but didn't realize it said Vermont style when I ordered it. This stuff is NOT my Maypo. It is ground fine like cream of wheat and has a pasty texture. I will be more careful the next time I order. I want My Maypo, the original maple flavored instant oatmeal!!!!!

review/summary: Maypo Vermont Hot Cereal
review/text: Maypo Vermont style is very good if you like the pulverized kind of cereal.  Next time I will order the blue box.  That is the Maypo I haven't been able to purchase anywere in the last 12 years. Was my childs daily breakfast while in school.

review/summary: My Favorite Breakfast
review/text: I have been eating this for breakfast for over 25 years!  I have found that when microwaving it is best to use cold tap water and it takes exactly 2min 15sec on normal power to cook to perfection without boiling over.  I also like to add a few chocolate chips and a layer of cold milk on top.  Yes I've been eating it for that long!!!!!  Mixing ground flax seed in also gives it a good nutritional boost (not that it isn't already full of vitamins and minerals).  It fills me up for a good 4 hours or more.  But not everyone loves it.  You either like it or you don't.  I am a Vermonter, but I don't really care if its "Vermont Style" or not.  I don't taste much maple through the chocolate and milk anyway!!

review/summary: My Dentist recommends chewing this gum after each meal
review/text: After my dentist recommended chewing this gum after each meal, I decided I needed to purchase it.  Amazon.com has a good price on it. The gum was fresh and just as described.  I like this gum and knowing it helps prevent cavities... YIPPPIE!

review/summary: Best Gum You can Buy
review/text: I chew gum (and blow bubbles) during my 3 hours 3X a week on a dialysis machine. The peppermint is not overwheleming and tends to soothe an upset stomach. It also stays soft and plyable for the 3 hours. I also notice it controlls my thirst.

review/summary: I'm a gum addict, and this is my drug of choice
review/text: I chew an inordinate amount of gum-- I have a dry mouth from medication, and I'm also losing weight--so no munching--and this is great stuff. It does hold a nice flavor for a long time (not as long as spearmint, but longer than any other peppermint gum I know of), and it has a nice springy texture that doesn't get hard or stick to my teeth, and it's a nice sized piece, too--not too big and not too small. I have ordered several "cases" of this from Amazon--it's hard to find in bulk in stores, and Amazon's price is excellent!

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: I am so disappointed that we can no longer buy the Ice Breakers stick gum.  It has been our favorite for so long.  There seems to be no reason we can't get it anymore except that they want to promote the more expensive cubes.  They are okay, but we love the stick gum.  Hershey, please bring back the sticks.

review/text: This gum is excellent tasting. Has a nice flavor burst when you put in your mouth. It's not traditional gums its little cubes that look almost like someone already softened them up before you...<br /><br />Flavor lasts long time. And tastes good. Recommend. My 2nd order of 10 piece boxes.
