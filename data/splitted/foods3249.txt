review/summary: My Fave Veg Jerky
review/text: The "Original Wild" is a bit spicy for me, but "Original Mild" is spectacular, and Teriyaki Beef even better. Also like the spicy chicken one. I've tried all the veg jerky products and bewildered that none of the others come even close to this one for quality of flavor and texture. The others are loaded with sugar and taste more like candy than jerky; a couple of them are outright slimy; one was hard as a rock and flavorless. But the only time Stonewall's Jerquee ever displeased me was when the Poulsbo Market used a paper-punch to create holes along the top edge and hung them on a peg to dry out -- which I didn't realize until I got them home and they'd all been turned into hard lumps (which I ate any way). So now I have to buy them on amazon. I'll still get the fresh sushi at Poulsbo Market, that stuff's a dream, but what possessed them to poke holes in packaged foods???

review/summary: I love them:)
review/text: I have always liked these but I haven't had them in years.  Today, I was hungry and saw them at the natural market checkout counter.  I got the flavor "spicy 'chicken'" and LOVED it.  It is clear that this is a love or hate product.  I buy Primal Strips when in need of a snack I can eat in the car and they are just ok...oily and get stuck in my teeth.  Flavor is just OK.  Stonewall's are drier and puffier and chewier but somehow, don't get stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />I am on a low-carb diet and these are only 7 g of carbs for 13 g of protein.  I am getting a case of the original mild since it is Prime.  Would like to see more flavors available on Prime.<br /><br />Definitely suggest buying a small pack first given the love/hate aspect.

review/summary: moldy!
review/text: I've been eating this stuff here and there for many years.  I purchased a packet at the grocery store and the product was speckled with mold.  Unfortunately I didn't realize this until I popped a piece into my mouth whereupon I instantly realized something was very wrong.  It was not expired.  I traded it in or another which was also moldy. ick.

review/summary: Horrific Flavor and Terrible Texture
review/text: I love other brands of vegetarian jerky. This one, I hate. It is spongy instead of chewy and smells and tastes like concentrated, stale, off-brand dog food. I could not get this funky crap out of my mouth fast enough. I should also mention that I'll eat just about anything, including bugs and grass. If it came down to it, I'd turn to them before ingesting another piece of this food-like substance.

review/summary: Terrible. Couldn't finish bag.
review/text: I just purchased this jerky from a local store because they recently quit carrying the kind I like in my town. I ate a piece and thought it was disgusting. I wanted to give it a chance, so I ate a couple more pieces. It has a grainy, nasty texture and a terrible burned BBQ sauce flavor. For some bizarre reason it's made out of soy flour instead of strips of soy.<br /><br />The best soy jerky I've ever had is Tasty Eats jerky, since it's chewy and had a wonderful flavor. Flavor is of course subjective, but personally I thought the taste of Stonewall's is terrible, and the consistency is nasty. It tries too hard to look like meat, which I feel is pretty irrelevant to the demographic of people that will be eating it in the first place. Luckily it's Gluten-Free, so hopefully I can pawn the leftovers on my boyfriend...

review/summary: Best veg jerky
review/text: I think its interesting how spread out the reviews are on this product.  I guess its one of those love it or hate it type things.  Personally, I LOVE this jerky and cannot get enough!!  My favorite flavors are the hot pastrami and teriyaki. You do have to chew quite a bit but its not the same weird chewy texture some other veg jerkys have, like primal strips.  I hate primal strips but I had them about 10 years ago and never ate once since, so if the formula has changes on those then disregard...  So maybe try a small bag of this before ordering in bulk.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: I picked these up at Natural Grocers because I used to really love jerky, but am now vegetarian for four years, and I didn't like the Primal strips enough to re-purchase. I purchased the Original Mild and the Teriyaki flavors.<br /><br />The texture of these is spot on if you like toughier jerky (I do), although the outside has a weird sort of clumpy coating. Unfortunately, the taste is TERRIBLE. Both varieties honestly tasted like dog food. I also had two friends (one recently vegetarian, the other not) try them, and they said exactly the same thing. My friend's toddler-aged son loved them, though.<br /><br />I liked these even less than the Primal strips, and would not recommend them.

review/text: The overall flavor is pretty good (esp. for being vegetarian) and the texture was fine but, the one I tried, "original wild" was just TOO (spicy) hot! I don't mind a little heat but this was rediculous.  My mouth was burning for an hour afterwards.  This may be "fun" for some but not for me!  And I will give the "mild" a try - just to be fair).

review/summary: product was moldy, but company willing to fix problem
review/text: I think the jerky would have been good, but...<br />The packages I received contained jerky that had fuzzy white stuff growing on it. None of the packages had a read-able expiration date. The clearest packaging shows Aug 2011 (which means the product still had 6 months left in its life). When I contacted Lumen, however, I did get an email and phone call from them expressing their concern about my complaint. The man I spoke with was genuinely interested in investigating the problem. The company directly sent me three free packages to replace some of the moldy ones.

review/summary: not my favorite.
review/text: The seasoning is good, but the texture is not to my liking; it's almost spongy, and microwaving did not improve the texture for me. It is a little too dry and chewy, and has a weird aftertaste. I have not tried the other versions of this jerky. If you prefer a dry and chewy veggie jerky, I would go with the Vegan Dream brand. They have a sampler pack, with 6 different flavors. Also, as I follow weight watchers online, the 1.5 oz package has 4 points, with 8 grams of fat, 152 calories, 3 grams of fiber. There are lower calorie veggie jerkies available, if that is a concern for you.

I prefer the Hot Pastrami, but try a few of the others to see which you like best.

review/summary: Addictive and Actually Gluten Free (despite label)...
review/text: This stuff is like crack.  There's no other way of describing just how delicious it is.  If it gets old, it gets a little hard, but they never sit around long enough to get old at my house.  I order this constantly and sometimes they run out, which leaves me craving it and miserable-- or begging my local health food store to dig in their back room for stray bags.  It's THAT good!!!  The only catch on Amazon is it's ingredients list wheat (in the soy sauce) as an ingredient, but the kind I've been getting are also labeled gluten free on the front.  I'm fairly confident it's a typographical error, because I've been eating it for a year now and no gluten reaction!  Enjoy!!!

review/summary: not like jerky
review/text: i had high hopes for this stuff. i have tried several types of veggie jerky, in search of the tough, fibrous, highly seasoned jerky of my old meat eating days. granted, my memory is likely hazy as i haven't eaten meat for about 20 years. however, this stuff is NOT like beef jerky. true, they are a bit hard and chewy. and they are very flavourful, but....in my opinion, not in a good way.<br /><br />if you have ever had those dehydrated soy slices made by "so soya" (and others) then you know what these are. take those slices, marinade and fry or bake, and you've probably got something like this jerky. they have a distinct flavour - i really can't pinpoint exactly what flavour it is, but it is consistent in all of the varieties and it is not too pleasant. i found the tofurky jerky to have a better flavour and nicer dense texture, but i think my search for the ideal jerky shall continue.

The fat content is somewhat higher than I'd like for very frequent consumption, but if you have an active metabolism/don't diet, it's a great higher protein veggie snack. Very tasty and satisfying to chew. Easy to pack, toss in a purse, travel bag, etc. Helpful for vegan's/vegetarians on the go, looking for protein away from home.

review/text: As with all foods, your mileage may vary with this product depending on freshness and all that. I didn't much care for it at first, but I found it to be an acquired taste and I actually do like the product now.<br /><br />It can be a bit greasy, but word has it that if you let greasy 'jerky' products sit out overnight in the open air that it helps with that. I've never had an issue with it, so I don't know for sure, but I suppose it'd be worth a try if you like the taste but find it a bit oily.<br /><br />All in all, compared with some of the gross real-meat jerky products I've tried, this stuff is pretty good. But don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself.

review/summary: So far, this is the best coconut water I have found for the price!
review/text: I have been a great fan of coconut water for years since I was a kid growing up on Key West.  Now it's become a fad item.  I've tries every differnt brand.  I prefer non sweetened without pulp, but will settle for pulp when it's as good as Jumex's.  Most other coconut water with pulp in it, the pulp is all mushy.  The pulp in Jumex's coconut water is crisp just like it was cut from the coconut right before they handed you the can.  I would love to find it Jumex in an unsweetened formula.  And with Amazon's Prime Membership, you can't beat the free 2 day shipping on it.  I normally buy Conchita at Meijer here in Metro Detroit but it's a $1 a can and their pulp is all mushy tasting.  I'll be a returning customer, ESPECIALLY if you get it unsweetened.  I go through 2 cases a month by myself.

review/summary: Swiss Miss changes their formula
review/text: Swiss Miss has less chocolate in their hot chocolate mix. This makes it week tasting. I just bought a 60 count box and now find that I don't like the new formula. We checked with Swiss Miss and they admit to the change.

review/summary: ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER
review/text: WATCH OUT! You would be surprised at just what food products have artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />READ THE INGREDIENTS!<br /><br />The people at Swiss Miss added ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS to the REGULAR SWISS MISS.<br /><br />I was drinking it because it was the one without artificial sweeteners. Then it began to TASTE FUNNY.<br />I read the INGREDIENTS. You can't trust anyone these days.<br /><br />SWISS MISS is NOT advertising this change.<br /><br />I guess the FDA is letting it slide when companies add artificial sweeteners to NON-DIET food.<br />Maybe that's the government's way of putting people on a diet.<br />Makes me wonder if they are putting it in the food in schools.<br />As usual the gov't doesn't get it--artificial sweeteners make you sick, NOT SKINNY!

review/text: Title says it all.  They reformulated to add artificial sweeteners to their regular hot cocoa.  I didn't notice until I tasted it and thought I accidentally bought the diet stuff.  Nope -- they put splenda and asculfame K (asculfame potassium) into their formula now.  It's really gross -- much too sweet with a terrible aftertaste.

review/summary: Smooth, creamy, comforting cocoa!
review/text: We've used Swiss Miss cocoa for years, and I was excited to find the big box of 60 envelopes sold here on Amazon. With our large family, this size is much more efficient than the smaller boxes. With the available Super Saver Shipping, it's also good deal.<br /><br />It's simple to make, dissolves well, has a nice chocolately taste, and the individual envelopes travel nicely to school, work, sports and camping. Because the envelopes are metallic (mylar) inside, this product also stores for a long time without getting hard.<br /><br />My only complaint about this product is that it has just a little too much sugar in it.  But you can add more milk or water to it if it's too sweet for you.

I eagerly await Amazon Prime stocking it. Easy to make and chock full of flavour, reflecting its German origins this sauce is versatile and an easy way to add some kick to your cooking.

review/summary: Extremely good alternative for diabetics
review/text: I'm not diabetic, but my girlfriend has Type I and missed being able to drink margaritas with Mexican food so she tried this mix.  I even tried it too just to see how it differed from regular (ie, Cuervo) margarita mix.<br /><br />Surprisingly, it tastes nearly identical to the regular mix.  We added just a splash of triple sec and mixed it just a bit stronger and it tasted just as good as a Cuervo premixed bottle.<br /><br />Some claim that there's a Splenda aftertaste, but I didn't get any aftertaste whatsoever.  Maybe certain tastebuds are more sensitive to that particular sweetener.  However, if you're looking for a sugar-free margarita, this is certainly worth giving a try.

review/summary: Pretty Good Stuff
review/text: Of COURSE a real margarita is going to be tastier.. just like a coca cola tastes much better than diet. However,my guess is that they type of people that will buy Baja Bob's are diet coke drinkers and who want to have a mixed drink without the spare tire.  If you're used to diet drinks, Baja Bob's will hit the spot.  It's especially a treat if you've been avoiding margaritas because they're so darn high in sugar.  Tequila is 64 calories a shot.  Add your 64 calories of tequila to 0 from Bob's and you've got yourself a low calorie drink that's pretty darn good.<br /><br />One other note:  When I ordered the Margarita mix, I got a three pack and gave one bottle to a friend.  She's also a habitual dieter and very used to artificial sweetners, but she agrees that it's a good substitute.  I will probably end up trying other Baja Bob's cocktail mixes as well..

review/text: I have tried a couple other brands of sugar free or low carb margarita mix and this one actually tastes like it should.  The problem I had with other brands is they weren't tart enough or had a distinct artificial aftertaste.  I found I was adding lime juice to them to get the proper tart taste that regular margaritas have, but all that did was add carbs that I didn't need.  This one has the tartness I am looking for.  I did alter the suggested recipe by adding 1 part tequila to 2 parts mix instead of 3.  Excellent!

review/summary: Average sugar-free mix
review/text: I have tried every diet margarita mix I can find over the years and have yet to find a sugarless mix that I like well enough to give up the real thing. I am trying to cut calories where I can, but when it comes to my favorite cocktail, I have to go with the sugar. I was hoping that the Splenda would do the trick because I use Splenda when cooking and to sweeten ice tea and I like it, but sorry to say this mix still has the after taste usually associated with sugar substitutes.<br /><br />Even when using the half sugar-free mix with half regular mix the taste is still not to my liking. I hate to mess up good tequila so I have stopped using this stuff. I honestly feel that is is about the same as the mixes found in the grocery store or liquor stores. Bottom line: I'll have to cut some calories somewhere else. Too bad you have to buy 3 bottles to try it and find out it is not to your liking.<br /><br />Try it if you like but don't compare it to the mixes that contain sugar or you will be disappointed. If you only use sugar-free mix now, you might find that you like it better than the mix you are using, but you probably won't see much difference.<br /><br />I'm giving it 3 stars because I find it to be just average. Cheers.

review/summary: A way to cut the guilt when enjoying a margarita
review/text: I first found Baja Bob's in our local state-run liquor store, and I do love it.  Mind you, I'm a seasoned diet drinker (diet soda, Splenda in my tea, Crystal Light, sugar-free Koolaid, etc), so I personally couldn't taste the difference between Jose Cuervo margarita mix and Baja Bob's sugar free margarita mix.  I also like to add a splash of Diet Coke to my margaritas, as it makes it taste like a really good, smooth Long Island Ice Tea, so that further blurs the difference between regular and sugar free mixes.<br /><br />The only downside?  Those 32 oz bottles disappear *fast*!  And they're not cheap.  I'm going to experiment with making my own diet margarita mix, but until that day, I'll continue to use Baja Bob's.  (There's also a powdered margarita mix available at Baja Bob's website, that's a little cheaper and easier to ship, but I have not tried it.)

You *can* taste the difference between the high-cal high-carb syrup in regular mixes vs. the Splenda in Baja Bob's.  I am a diet soda drinker, so this is not a turn-off for me.  I used to cut the regular mixes with diet tonic to decrease the sweetness, anyway.  This mixer can be "sweetened up" a bit by adding some Diet 7-up, Mist Free, or Fresca.  I will purchase this again.

Other than that, you have margarita mix that tastes like the bar mixes.  And by the way, this stuff also makes a killer whiskey sour.<br /><br />Anyone knows that for a cocktail it's not the booze but the mix that's the diet killer.  Double tequila = 200 cals.  Add Baja Bob's, and a 'rita = 200 cals.  It's a no-brainer.  I don't know what motivates the the one-stars, but their benchmark mix for margaritas must be toilet water, or maybe somebody at BB's ticked them off.  Ignore them.

review/text: I am a registered dietitian and was having a fiesta for my husband's 50th complete with Margaritas....  knew there must be a "diet" variety of the corn syrup, high calorie mixers on the market and found Baja Bob's sugar free on Amazon.  Ordered six bottles to get the free shipping---three of each variety and they were a big hit.  No one could tell the difference, especially after mixed with ice and Tequila (now there were some calories and more...).  Will definitely order again.  Only gave 4 stars out of 5 because I don't often drink marjaritas and really don't know a good one from a mediocre one, but my friends loved it.

review/summary: Very Good, Too Tart For Some
review/text: This is 10 times better than the pina colada or hurricane mixes. It actually tastes like it should. Some here have found it to be a little too tart, but overall it is a very belivable substitute for the 'real' thing.

review/summary: Not Great But What Do You Expect?
review/text: I have been using Jose Cuervo margarita mix to make my vodka collins. It's very sweet and fattening.  Cutting down on the amount of the margarita mix didn't help so I tried Baja Bob's.  It's not great.  You can tell it's no-calorie but what do you expect?  So what I do is use half Jose Cuervo and half Baja Bob's.  It cuts the calories in half and you cannot tell the difference. Until Skinnygirl comes up with margarita mix without tequila, it's the best there is.

review/text: This may be the worst margarita mix I've ever had, and it wasn't the sugar-free aspect.  It just tastes bad.  I got the 3-bottle set and drank 2 drinks out of one bottle.  That was enough (too much) for me.  The rest is going down the sink.

review/text: I was skeptical for good reason.  How can a mix with 0 calories be any good....well it isn't.  I wasn't expecting the taste to be as good as the real thing but it's absolutely awful. It's un-drinkable.<br />I let 4 other people try it and overtime the same thing.... sip....1 second delay ..then the I really tasted something bad face.  One person even spit it out into the sink.  This stuff is gross.  Its basically green colored splenda water.  Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Tastes great, wish it were healthier!
review/text: "Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Polysorbate 60"<br /><br />It's really good cocoa, and I make it every morning for my husband (he won't drink coffee); we even bring it along on vacation so he can have it. I just wish that list of poisons above weren't included.  I've suggested to Land-o-Lakes that they make a ... "Sweet Nothings" version or whatever they want to call it:  a *totally* unsweetened version, so we can add whatever sweetener we wish to add.<br /><br />The corn syrup is unhealthy in the extreme; the 'partially hydrogenated' means trans fats (and soy is *not* healthy, contrary to the "common" "wisdom"), and the polysorbate has been shown in cosmetics to cause problems (and why is a cosmetics ingredient in a food item?!).<br /><br />That said (er... written), until someone comes up with a healthy product that tastes as good as this stuff does, he's gonna keep drinking these poisons every morning. {sigh}

review/summary: Supreme Chocolate Makes My Heart Sing!
review/text: Instead of creamer and sugar, I add a packet of this to my eight ounces of freshly ground coffee each morning! For a mere 140 calories, I enter bliss! Comparable, both in yummy-ness and nutritionally, to a whole milk Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino�, this Supreme Chocolate mix comes in at 3 grams of saturated fat (30 calories, 14% DV, from hydrogenated soybean oil and coconut oil), 0 trans fat, and 24 grams of sugars (sugar and corn syrup solids). As for price, since I live three hours from the nearest Wal-Mart, the shipped price is actually a little better than I would pay locally, and it arrives practically overnight. The entire box of 72 packets is only 7"x7"x18", and consists of six smaller display type boxes of twelve packets each. These 6"x7"x3.5" display boxes will tuck neatly into the smallest kitchen upper cabinets, and will maintain the individually wrapped single serving packets in a neat upright position. All in all, this is a big luxury for a little price, which is something that makes my heart sing!

review/summary: An Excellent Cup of Hot Chocolate!!
review/text: Being a hot cocoa lover as I am, it's hard to believe I've never tried Land O Lakes Supreme Hot Chocolate until I received it as part of a gift basket. I must say, it was one of the best cups of hot chocolate I've had in a long time.<br />I've tried soooo many different brands....from the most expensive to the least expensive. This ranks up in my top 3...which is a hard place to get to in my eyes (or taste buds?).<br />At approximately $0.40 a serving, this is a great deal.<br />You'll find this hot cocoa rich in taste and quite creamy as well...even though it's simply made with hot water.<br />Make sure you follow the instructions on the packet....6 oz. of water per packet.<br />Go ahead...try it...you won't be disappointed!

There are several other delicious Land O Lakes cocoa flavors including French Vanilla, Supreme, and Caramel. It's yummo in my tummo ( I find myself saying this a lot when I'm drinking it!).

The lobster meat is pure lobster.  They list mayonaise as an ingredient {I hate mayo} fortunatley I did not see any on the meat...if there was any it was minimal. The rolls were very fresh.  You can easily grill them and have a meal in 3 minutes or less.  I actually ate about three of these for lunch..........it ended up being about a 45 dollar lunch worth every dime!

The rolls themselves are hard to come by outside of New England and if you can get them, you pay through the nose.  This was the best of everything!  The lobster meat was wonderful...just the right amount of mayonnaise on it too!  And the quality of everything was just superb.  In fact, I can't remember having a better lobster roll...and I've had lots of them from all over southern coastal Maine & various other New England spots.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPONTED!
