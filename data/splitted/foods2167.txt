review/summary: Amazing Taste!
review/text: Tried it three different ways: black, just cream and cream & sugar. This was such a smooth flavor that I enjoyed drinking it all three ways, which has never happened before. I also love the pod design; I used my regular coffee machine, so the pods make clean up quick & easy.

review/summary: For people who Like Weak Coffee
review/text: I like my coffee strong so to me this tastes like strong tea that smells vaguely of coffee.  I prepared it the way you would tea--just put it in the cup and poured.  Maybe I should have done something differently but that's all we have (except a conventional coffee machine).  I tried squeezing it with my fingers and that helped a bit.  The only problem was that afterwards my fingers smelled like bitter coffee.  Squeezing the coffee bag with a spoon didn't produce quite the same result.<br /><br />So bottom line: if you like weak coffee, this is worth a try I think.  Otherwise, not so much.

review/summary: Pod Brewing - Bleh;  LOOSE Brewing FANTASTIC
review/text: I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.

review/summary: Amazing smell, good flavor
review/text: It should be noted, since it isn't in the product description, that these are pods for a pod-type coffee maker.  They are not to be used without one.  That being said, I thought the flavor was good, nothing that blew me out of the water, but it was pleasant.  My first 2 cups weren't really strong enough for my liking.  I think I will try using a bit less water next time.  Overall, I love the aroma.  This product is organic and fair trade certified.  They also claim to be grown on a biodiverse farm, with workers who are treated ethically, and through sustainable cultivation...all good points for me.  Each pod is individually packaged which seals in freshness.

review/summary: Flavorful but weak
review/text: This coffee comes in individually foil-sealed pods. If you don't use a machine that uses pods, you could brew it like a tea bag but you might get a more bitter brew with more residue. The pod machines are like espresso machines in that they pump very hot water, or steam, through the coffee.<br /><br />I don't know what it means that this coffee is 'organic.' I thought all foods were organic. If 'organic' means the coffee bushes were not treated with pesticides or fertilizers, that might affect the yield (and therefore the price) but how might that affect the flavor?<br /><br />The flavor is nice -- a little fruity. It has none of the bitter bite that's typical of espresso or dark roasted coffee. If you like strong coffee with chocolaty, full-body flavor that stands up to sugar and half-and-half, and can dissolve silver spoons, this is not for you.

review/text: I've been brewing this in a proper pod brewing machine the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBUWHM">BUNN MC MyCafe Single Serve Pod Brewer</a>. Even in a 15 oz. mug these pods produce a good, not great, slightly bitter, strong cup of coffee. I don't know about 'exotic floral and berry notes' as the description states. Perhaps my palate isn't refined enough. I just like a strong cup of black coffee and that's what I got. There wasn't anything really special or exciting about the One Love Organic Coffee but there also wasn't anything really bad about it either... I doubt I would get this again, there's better coffee out there.

review/summary: Strong Branding, Weak Flavor
review/text: I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager. Back then, drinking coffee saved my job. In the 30 years since then, I've come to appreciate the multiple nuances about the classic brew. While I don't consider myself a coffee snob, I know what I like.<br />One Love, according to the package, is Organic coffee and Fair Trade Certified, and a piece of the family dream,  which I don't mind standing up for. I still harbor a fondness for the music of the Marley men, and it was with great anticipation that I tossed a pod of One Love into my coffee maker.  For me the coffee was more on the light side of medium. Actually, it tasted on the light side of light.  I prefer a dark bold flavor but don't mind a good medium roast. The package also said Exotic Floral and Berry. Try as I might, I just couldn't pick the Floral and Berry notes or much of a coffee flavor and strangely, no real fragrance. Honestly, I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't recommend this.

review/summary: Not Quite Feeling the Love
review/text: These coffee pods ae from Fair Trade farms that are committed to sustainability.  The box is attractive and each of the pods is sealed in its own little packet.  I used them in a Senseo pod coffee maker as well as in the generic Mr. Coffee.  The coffee brewed up nicely and was a pretty dark color.  Unfortunately, the coffee itself was insipid.  It had weak flavor for a medium roast despite the deceptive darkness.  It was not the worst coffe I've ever had kbut not the best.  In fact it was not memorable at all, on a par with the complimentary packets you get in hotel rooms.  There is alot to like about this company but this brew left me cold.

review/summary: Very light coffee-  not medium roast
review/text: Let me say I like a medium roast coffee.. and this is NOT a medium roast coffee. I would call this Light or very LIGHT.<br />This comes as indicated in the description in single coffee pods for use with Single pod coffee makers.<br /> I notice when I opened the package the coffee smell was missing.. Now I don't know if that is particular to this type coffee or if my package had a little age on it.. I even opened a 2nd package to see if my first didn't get punctured accidentally.. but sadly it wasn't..<br />  I even brewed this in my  single serve coffee maker on BOLD setting.. but it just didn't do anything to improve it.<br /><br /> I do support the concept of this coffee company but this particular type of coffee is not to my taste.But saying that  everyone has their own taste when it comes to coffee and tea so this is just my PERSONAL OPINION AND TASTE.. Just to be fair I am a regular Dunkin donuts whole bean user so that is what I am comparing this coffee.<br /><br />Sadly I won't be ordering more of this particular version but will see what other flavors they may be selling at this company But if you like your coffee LIGHT this might be a version you would enjoy, it just didn't do it for me.

review/summary: Dark Color, Watery Flavor
review/text: Upon opening the single packet, I smelled something that did not smell like coffee. Because I'm a polite person, I can't actually say what I smelled. Let's just say that it would be an odor one might come in contact with near a water treatment plant or a paper mill.<br /><br />After reading several reviews here before making coffee with the product, I decided to use a microwave to brew it. I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button. This means that I actually brewed the coffee for longer than recommended at higher water temperatures than a single-pod machine would use.<br /><br />The result after this method was STILL a weak cup of coffee. When I added soy and stevia, it actually tasted more like warm soy milk than anything.<br /><br />I will use the rest of the box, but only as back-up when I run out of my regular single-cup bags. Sorry, not really a coffee product I would buy.

review/summary: Lovely Coffee, Shhh, Here's a Tip!
review/text: I loved this coffee and it has an outstanding taste that I am sure will make it a big success! The coffee comes in  15 single serve ready-to-use-bags pr pouches that I found to make a "strong" cup of coffee.<br />I split open a bag and discovered that it hold three teaspoons full of coffee. I ripped open a couple of bags and made a 10 cup pot in my MR Coffee Coffeemaker (bought right here on amazon.com and was an "open-box" absolute bargain) and found it made a really fantastic pot of coffee. I ended up using it all in this manner.<br />I like the idea of this coffee, it is grown in an ethical manner in Jamaica and also in Africa and Central America)by the Marley family (of Reggae fame)<br /><br />A quick look on their web-site reveals they have several other offerings plus a neat (if pricey) coffee-maker)<br />If you like a great tasting coffee, this is worth a try even though it is a bit pricey!

review/summary: Unique flavors,  mediocre taste
review/text: We're a 2-3 cup a day coffee household.  This doesn't include all of the weekly trips to the coffee shop while at work for more specialized drinks.  Most of our home coffee is whole bean Colombian which we grind in a Krups espresso machine and coffee maker.  We're generally not terribly adventurous with our coffee choices so we were more than happy to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Organic and Fair Trade.<br /><br />+ Pleasant aromatic smell.<br /><br />+ Works great in a French Press.<br /><br />+ Great for travel.<br /><br />+ Appealing packaging and good overall message.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Tastes more like coffee flavored water than real coffee.<br /><br />- No instructions on or in the box on how to brew properly.<br /><br />- Improvisation may be necessary if you don't have a pod brewer.  We used a French Press which worked really well.<br /><br />- Flavors may not be for everyone.<br /><br />Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee is a great concept but really fails to deliver on taste.  The first issue arises with the product being in pods.  Many people don't use pod machines.  We used a French Press which worked amazingly well but the pods won't work well in a standard coffee maker.  Our second issue was the lack of overall flavor.  As I mentioned earlier, the coffee taste was more like coffee flavored water than an actual brewed cup of coffee.  Despite the lack of taste, these pods are really handy if you travel or have a French Press at work.  If you're feeling adventurous or just want to support Organic and Fair Trade coffee growers then you may want to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try.

It is a stronger blend coffee and someone with more acute taste buds than mine might argue, but I thought it tasted identical to Starbucks House Blend. This is a fair trade coffee so you are helping out the locals here more than the corporations. These are pods so you might want to have a machine that brews pods before you order, unlike me.

review/text: This is good coffee! As soon as the Marley Coffee arrived I brewed up a mug of the elixir, added only real cream, and sat back to see how it went. And it went well! I like my coffee strong, and although this is a medium bodied brew, it can be brewed to be stouter if you have the right coffee maker. The taste is smooth, not bitter, with a bit of fruitiness on the palate - particularly, nice hints of dark cherry. For a smooth and delightful change of pace, I recommend that you give Marley Coffee a try!

review/summary: Let me be blunt; I shot the roaster.
review/text: When I finally manage to convince myself to peel out from under the sheets each morning the second thing I'm interested in is a good strong cup of coffee. I categorize myself as a coffee drinker as opposed to a connoisseur since I'm amenable to buying whatever happens to be on sale at the market and spending my money on boutique blends happens about as often as the pope personally dispenses contraceptives.<br /><br />Now, my palate is sufficiently sophisticated to distinguish between premium and plebian but the miserly gene invariably kicks into overdrive and inhibits forking over the cash for the former and definitely precludes an outlay for what my taste buds inform is a decent product yet well short of remarkable.<br /><br />The Marley organic medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is a step above valued oriented Arabica but I was reminded of an ground variety with a bitter, burned aftertaste from the most notable of those upscale caf&eacute; house coffee providers (hey, I'm cheap and a hypocrite. If someone else is paying, I'm drinking).<br /><br />I tried the pods in a variety of ways (single cup brewing; steeped like tea for five minutes; open grind percolation; microwaved to the cusp of boiling) but regardless of method with eight ounces of water I found myself less than overwhelmed, and definitely unmotivated to order more.  Drinking it with cream and sugar was less offensive than black; the additives tended to mask the burnt aftertaste I detected.<br /><br />For some this group's commitment to social responsibility may influence a purchasing decision. Unfortunately, in my case that altruistic gene is in dormant state so it's all about the taste and price rather than ethical considerations.

The pod floated to the top of a coffee mug with hot water in it.  I waited for about 5 minutes, then I used a spoon to purge the pod against the inside of the cup.  I like strong coffee.

review/summary: I Love The Message!
review/text: I had never heard for Marley's Coffee before, so as the was reading all of the information on the box, the last thing I looked at was the top of the box, to find out that the Marley is as in Bob Marley!<br /><br />Upon first looking at the box, the first thing I noticed was how the perimeter of the box reminded me of Christmas, with the red, green and gold colors.<br /><br />I especially loved what I saw written on the back of the box.  It really seems to come from the heart.<br /><br />It says "That pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial.  They know where their beans come from, and how they are grown.  The coffee is 100% arabica beans.  This coffee is made in small batches, roasted and bagged on demand to ensure freshness".<br /><br />This coffee is organic and fair trade, which are two issues very close to my heart, and I wholeheartedly believe in supporting both of those issues.<br /><br />This coffee is called One Love.  It's supposed to be exotic floral and berry.  I did not taste either of those notes, but to be fair, I really do prefer flavored coffees over non- flavored, so it's not that this coffee tastes bad, because it doesn't, it's just not the kind of coffee in flavor that I prefer, because it really is not flavored, at least not to me. Maybe your taste buds may be different than mine.<br /><br />Maybe you are one of those people who prefer unflavored coffees who really would enjoy purchasing this coffee.<br /><br />If I were just going to buy this coffee because I like it's message and what it stands for, without a second thought I would definitely purchase this coffee, but if I were only going to buy it based on flavor alone, I probably would not purchase it.  It's really just a personal preference.<br /><br />I wish I loved the coffee as much as the message.<br /><br />I hope you will!<br /><br />What really touched my heart was the last paragraph on the back of the box. "We believe that the proper place for children is on the playground, not the workplace".  I wish every country felt that way, but unfortunately doesn't.<br /><br />Part of the proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs.  The program is called Kicks For Cause Foundation.<br /><br />On the top of the box where you can see a small photo of Bob Marley, the coffee was founded to honor his father.<br /><br />That he came from farmland in Nine Mile?  There he learned to have deep respect for nature and humanity that helped guide his life.  I second that thought!  To me they are one in the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I enjoyed reading what I read on the box more than I did actually drinking the enclosed coffee, which the box inside the box there are 15 individually wrapped coffee pods.  I had alittle hard time opening the first pod from the the packaging.<br /><br />There is also a Best Before sticker on the back of the box.<br /><br />If you prefer unflavored coffee, and want to support a good cause with an excellent message behind it, this coffee may just be the kind of coffee that you are looking for.

review/summary: Darn good coffee, but don't "teabag" it!
review/text: I've seen some reviews for these coffee "pods" where people say they used the pod like a teabag, just throwing it into a cup, pouring boiling water over it and letting it steep for a while. Those reviews usually also complain that their coffee is too weak.<br /><br />The coffee is weak because "teabagging" with these pods just doesn't work, in my experience. You need to use a pod coffee brewer, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>, or, if you feel like spending a lot of money, maybe the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00580QKVK">SunCafe Coffee Pod Brewer</a>. Personally, since I don't own one of these brewers and I didn't know that "teabagging" doesn't work until I tried it, I ended up tearing open the pods and emptying them into my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z48XZ0">Frieling Coffee-for-One Filter</a>. (Putting an unopened pod into the coffee-for-one filter didn't work either.) The packaging of this product really ought to include some instructions about how to (and how not to) use it.<br /><br />Once I started brewing it correctly, I really liked the flavor of this coffee. I like yirgacheffe coffees in general, and this is a good one. It's a rich, fairly dark roast, with some nice earthy and berry flavors to it.

review/summary: In the Middle
review/text: I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say. The coffee inside was good, as well.<br /><br />However, to break it down -- it was one of the smoothest coffees I've ever had, like drinking silk. The flavor was mild, pleasant, but for me, the taste was too bland, did not stand out. Perhaps another way of putting it is to say the coffee was thin and therefore, not ultimately satisfying. I do feel there are others, though, who would appreciate a coffee lite.

review/summary: Mild, Weak
review/text: Even though it says it's a medium roast, it's more mild and weak flavored. Would definitely have to use more pods to get better flavor. My son also tried it and used 2 pods for a 16 oz to go cup. He agreed it was weak but also commented that it had an odd flavor note to it.

review/summary: Too Weak For My Taste
review/text: I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.  It seems like a nice concept, but the execution is not there yet.  Kudos for the attractive packaging and spirit behind the concept though.

review/summary: Inconsistent (was:Coffee for tea drinkers)
review/text: As in, I think I need to double the amount of coffee I use per cup, then the next cup is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I like a coffee that has a bold but not burnt flavor.  Well, the first cup of Marley coffee did not have any burnt flavor to it.  This is a great one for someone who has a lifetime of drinking tea and wants to try coffee.  But for a lifelong coffee drinker, it lacks the kind of body you can stand a spoon up in, the flavor that leaves you knowing you've just drank parts cleaner, and caffeine that has your molars humming.  But this cup lacks presence and is just a bit too subtle for me<br /><br />The next cup was far better, with some character to it, but a little bit burnt.  Not bad, not exceptional, but would make for a good, routine morning coffee.<br /><br />I'll keep experimenting with my remaining stock of Marley.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court

review/summary: Surprisingly easy to make but lacking the bold flavor
review/text: It's about time that coffee takes the road of tea and become more user friendly. The battle between pods/bags/filters has been firmly for filters in the past few years. Can this product sway the battle?<br /><br />Sadly, it only produces a mediocre cup of coffee. The 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, produced under free trade and in an organic environment, should have a bold robust flavor. Maybe it is the bags themselves or the beans but the flavor was thin enough to be overpowered by minimal amounts of sugar or milk.<br /><br />That being said, on the road, it's not a bad cup of joe. 4 stars for portability and ease of use.

The down side is that the packaging is appropriate for 'pod' brewing only and ends up brewing a pretty weak cup of coffee at that (maybe I'm biased, since I tend to brew Gevalia Dark Roast at about 7-8 scoops per 12 cup pot). I think that, at best, this is an average cup of coffee. P-)

In fact, I've had cheap instant coffee that taste better.<br /><br />I use my pod  for a quick cup or take them with me when I'm traveling, so I don't expect the product to taste like my fresh ground brewed coffee. But I do expect flavor. The flavor of this coffee was similar to re-used grounds.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality about this  Marley product is that it is a free-trade, organic product.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the left-over packages because I don't want to insult guests by serving it. It seems a waste to just throw it away.  Maybe I can use it in the garden.

review/summary: Not quite strong enough
review/text: I gave this product only three stars simply because the coffee was not quite strong enough for my taste.  My usual morning coffee consists of a stronger brew, and this particular product did not give me a strong enough coffee.  The coffee has a couple of redeeming qualities, first it is a fair trade coffee, which I really appreciate.  Secondly, the coffee comes in very convenient single serve packs, which make brewing coffee very simple and fast in the morning.  The single serve packs were also a disadvantage for the coffee because you could not adjust the brew strength of the coffee.  I found that when I made my coffee in the morning, using my normal proceedures that the coffee was not strong enough once I added the cream and sugar to the coffee.<br /><br />The overall taste of the coffee was palatable, if you are a person that likes a light roast, or a light brew.  If that is the type of brew that you are after, this is an excellent coffee for you, personally however I found the coffee a bit too light for my taste.

I use one scoop of coffee with my Bodum French press every morning.<br /><br />So how did this coffee fare? Very well. I didn't find it too weak nor two strong. Very robust, not harsh. I don't think I'd recommend buying it if you have to cut open the pods and pour out the coffee the way I did, but you can buy the One Love Whole Bean Organic coffee from their website and grind it yourself. However, if you do have a pod brewer, then I'd recommend the pod version here without any reservation, because this is very good coffee.

It's not as good as, say, Gevalia - if you like your coffee very flavorful. The proceeds do go to a good cause, though - helping children gain access to the positive influence of sports. If you happen to be a fan of this particular Ethiopian bean and you want to support the cause, then Marley Coffee is the coffee for you. Incidentally, the package design is gorgeous.

Besides the flavor, this brand goes the proverbial extra mile in being earth friendly. The packet describes the treatment of the workers and plants as well as states that part of the proceeds go to an organization started by this brand --- Kicks For Causes-- which assists in the development of youth soccer programs. As stated on the package "the proper place for a child is on the playground, not in the workplace". A statement we as consumers need to be more mindful about!

review/text: The flavor of this coffee is average, in my opinion.  Tastes vary from person to person, and I am not partial to any one brand, I just didn't find this particular coffee to have any stand-out aspects.  It tasted fine, and I have no complaints.<br /><br />I will say, I did not find myself shaking from a caffeine let-down later after drinking it, so thankfully it's not as heavy on the caffeine as some coffees I've tried.<br /><br />I realize these pods are for a specific kind of machine, but I wanted to brew some coffee like tea with boiling water while on our camping trip.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any trouble with making a single serving mug - I simple pressed on the pod several times during brewing with the back of a spoon as it steeped in the mug with the water.  I had rich, dark coffee with very little fuss.

review/text: Love, love, love!  The smell of the coffee packs!  When I got this and opened it, honestly, the aroma was just so amazing, it is one of the best smelling coffees I have ever smelled!<br /><br />  If only that taste transferred over....  Unfortunately, when I actually made the coffee, it wasn't extremely flavorful, not was it as dark and rich as I would have hoped.  In fact, it taste a little more like nutty coffee flavored tea, which isn't bad, I love tea!  But if I was coffee, I usually want something that taste strong.  I have had plenty of non-expresso coffees that are rich and almost thick, but this is not one of them.<br /><br />  It is a good light coffee, I suppose if you don't want something too strong, maybe to have with some cookies or muffins at tea time (not a lot of Americans have tea time, but if you do...), it is a nice coffee for that, since it is not too overpowering, it works well in that way.<br /><br />  As long as, when you get this, you know its not a super rich, strong coffee, I think you will enjoy it, its just all about expectations.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/text: As a general rule I gravitate toward heavy bodied, dark coffees but rules are made to be broken. From time to time even I bring home a medium blend to break things up. I was quite excited to give Marley Coffee a try but found that a name can't make up for a yucky cup.<br /><br />As lovely as the idea behind this particular line of coffees is I found it lacked the body I look for in a cup of coffee. That said the taste was so pleasant and delicate I actually tossed a couple of the pods into my tea pot and used them like tea bags. The result was actually delicious but far more tea-like than I would pay for in a coffee pod.<br /><br />If you enjoy lighter roasts or prefer tea I would definitely recommend the One Love Organic Coffee pods. Otherwise I would suggest a pass.

review/text: Update: I have come to realize (from others) that this is meant to be used in one specific machine. Unfortunately, that was not apparent at the time of my selection, and I just thought they were tea bag type coffee-bags. I have also learned that my taste in coffee is WILDLY different than most others, or at least it would seem. I have since tried to brew it in my Keurig (anothers recommendation that I read on a message string) and found it came out pretty good still. I still give it 4 stars, and I still think it wasn't bad at all, in spite of using it the wrong ways. :-)<br /><br />This is so strong that I could almost make an entire pot of coffee with one bag. I love it. A little goes a long way for me. I also like the tea bag type of brewing. Keeps everything clean and good tasting. This is great for those lazy days when you just want to boil water and have a coffee. If you like your coffee really strong, put one in a mug and you will have one VERY strong cup of coffee. If not, make a small pot and you will also be very pleased. I really didn't know what to expect. I remember trying something similar a long time ago with an instant type of coffee and it was terrible. This is much better than I expected. I also think this offers a good value. Try it, you'll probably like it.

review/text: I love the smell when I open one of these foil pouches - whatever one thinks of the coffee, they have packed a great smell in every bag.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I normally like dark roasts. I expected this to be a medium roast, good for variety, but it's really a very light roast. There are some nice berry notes in the bean, but the coffee flavor is just too weak.<br /><br />It also brews up too weak. I don't know if there is too little coffee in the bod, or if the pouch material isn't as effective as others - but something's not quite right here.<br /><br />So: 4 stars for fragrance and berry notes, 2 stars for the pouch material, 3 stars if you like mild roasts.

review/text: Coffee for me is a necesity now. Because of that, combining with availability at different moments, I have developed a broad palette.<br />I also pretend to be hip sometimes and opt for LOFT("local", "organic", "fair trade") and eclectic. So this one - organic artisan roasted Ethiopian yirgacheffe - seems to fit the profile quite nicely.<br />After figetting with the pod and the holder for quite a few minutes and finding that this pod is about twice the weight of Senseo pods, yet it would not fit snuggly into the double holder, I tentatively plugged it down with the single pod holder into the Senseo machine and made a 8oz cup.<br />The taste was bold but not bitter (maybe slightly bitter, but quite enjoyable). However the nose or the smell made me hesitate - it was too earthy, almost herbal medicine like.<br />I left the half drink cup there.<br />As I went about my day, I remembered one of the best cup of joe that I've ever had was boiled under open fire in a copper pot, not even a percolator, just a regular old copper pot, where you have to drain the dregs.<br />So I went back and heated up the now cold cup and drank it up. It was fine - I guess the nose was no longer strong.<br />So I decided to make a new cup and try again. The taste is still very good, and now I think I am getting used to the nose.<br />Now I have used up 9 pods and I am liking it more.

review/text: This coffee is a great way to start your day! I read a few other reviews that said it was weak.  Perhaps some of that is machine? We use a Keurig and empty each packet into our re-usable filter.  My husband says it's about as strong as his other "medium/bold" roasts, but with a better flavor.  I would agree with that - the flavor is better than most coffees, and I can drink it with my regular 2 creams, which I can't do with "bold" coffees.  I only knocked off one star because of the price.  I can get 15 of these for ten bucks, or 50 of the Donut Shop Brand for thirty bucks.  If it were a little more comparable, I'd probably be willing to spend a little more for something both my husband and I really enjoy.  As it is, we will stick with a slightly more economical brand and this might be a "treat".  :-)

review/text: ... well, actually you can but the results will be something less than stellar.  Well, imagine someone did that and then complained about the quality of the nails they received.  That is what is happening with some (but not all) of the bad reviews here.<br /><br />Coffee pods are made for coffee pod machines.  They are not made for use as "teabags with coffee" and they are not meant for Keuring machines.  If you put Keurig cup inside a regualar drip coffee maker, would you expect coffee to come out the other end?<br /><br />Now for those who have a Keurig machine and bought these, there is a solution.  If you have one of the cartridges that allow you to use loose coffee, for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>, then you can cut off one end of the pod and use the coffee.  This will give the product as intended.<br /><br />With that out of the way, let's turn to the product if you use it as intened or the "Keurig workaround" I illustrated above.<br /><br />Each pod comes individually foil wrapped for freshness.  When you open it, you are hit by the smell of strong coffee - perhaps even to the point of being pungent.  When brewed, however, it is strong but not overpowering and actually has a surprising sweetness to it one would not have expected from the aroma.  This is not a coffee that would appeal to those used to the mass produced variety or those who prefer a mild brew.  It is fairly strong and best savored rather than guzzled.  Overall, a solid coffee experience.

review/text: I like good coffee and when I find it I stick with it.  Nonetheless, when a chance comes along to try something different, I'm willing to give it a try.  When I got the samples from Marley Coffee, my first reaction was the socially responsible credos listed on the box.  Nothing wrong with that but if the coffee isn't good, the good deeds don't matter to me.  After tasting it, I found that the coffee IS good.  The blend I received was "Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe" and it is very enjoyable.  The coffee is packaged in individually sealed coffee in their own filter packets.  Having an ample supply at home of other good coffee (and after enjoying a weekend of Marley Coffee) I decided that this was the coffee to take on the road.  I have been using motel coffee makers for years with the ground coffee I took with my wife and I.  We even bring our own measuring spoons and filters.  Alas, the motel coffee-makers have shrunk in size and I can't make a good job of making my own coffee.  These packets are just the right size for those dinky coffee-makers so I'm taking Marley Coffee on the road.  In fact, I did just that last weekend.  I even threw an extra packet in my coat pocket.  Good thing too because I had put the other packets in a different bag which left me with the local mediocrity.  Why the long story?  Well, the quality of coffee was the difference of night and day and I made sure I now have ample packets in all my travel bags.  It's that good.

It brews a great cup of coffee either way.  In fact, I brewed the bag in a one cup brewer first and then saved it for the next day.  I then tried it as a "tea bag" and even having been used previously, it brewed a great cup of coffee, dark and rich.<br /><br />I normally put milk/cream in my coffee but I found I liked it black.

I have noticed that some people are saying that these pods make week coffee and that just shouldn't be the case at all. They might be using them incorrectly or in the wrong type of machine if that is the case. The pods also tell you which side is up so maybe if you brew it backwards then it might make a difference but I honestly haven't tried it that way.

review/summary: Strong
review/text: I like this coffee its reminiscent of the strong ethiopian coffee's often found at Starbucks which is great for me because although Im not an avid coffee drinker, when I do engage, I like it to be real strong.  Its a pretty good offering with the tea One love, so you cannot go wrong especially if looking to try something different.  Sip and be merry.

review/summary: Great Coffee!!
review/text: I really hoped for the best on this one after becoming disillusioned with my local coffee shop's organic ethically produced Ethiopian offering, but happily this is a great tasting cup of coffee. My husband orders these specifically to take with him to work. Flavorful, bold, rich, really nice for a single serve. Usually we need two pods per cup of other blends to make it work for us but not with the Marley Coffee. A+

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I must have somehow "missed" that this was designed for a pod brewing system.  I thought that these were just individual brew bags.  I am not sure exactly what pod brewer these were designed for, but I was pretty sure that these were not going to work in my Keurig, so I decided to go ahead and try to use it as a brewing bag anyway.<br /><br />I filled a microwave safe cup with water, and put the packet in the water.  At this point it is important to note that there are no directions on either the box or each packet.  So, I was pretty much winging it.  I put the cup (with the coffee packet in it) in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I knew this would make it very hot, so that it could continue to steep/brew as it cooled down.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I took the packed and squeezed the excess water out.  The cup of coffee looked robust, with a dark brown color and a nice smooth scent.  This was my first experience with Yirgacheffe, and while it tasted good, I did not taste any of the berry or floral notes that the description mentions.<br /><br />So all in all, a decent cup of coffee, but there are much better brews out there.

review/summary: Pleasant but nothing to get excited about
review/text: I love coffee and I start my day with it and I drink half a pot in the evenings too.  So I was excited to try this blend but it was not as exciting as the description on their website. The scent was fragrant and inviting but the taste fell flat. After drinking 3 cups I think it is a bit bitter and it has an aftertaste with no hint of the "floral notes and reveals hints of blueberry, cocoa and spice. This well-rounded coffee features a bright acidity. One Love tantalizes your palate, and leaves a profound cherry finish" as described by their enthusiastic marketing department.  Try Komodo Dragon by Starbucks instead. Bob Marley needs to stick with his day job.

review/text: I'm the only coffee drinker in my household, so I really like the convenience of these single serve pods. They've got a great flavor (I really liked a little bit of vanilla creamer in mine). They make clean-up a breeze - just toss the used pod into the trash or compost bin when you're done. Since they are individually packaged, they stay nice and fresh (and I don't have to worry about my two-year-old pouring a new bag of coffee out on the floor. I enjoyed the flavor and the convenience. Five stars. :-)

review/summary: Bitter Brew
review/text: I liked the packaging and the idea behind the company- which was why I decided to try it out- but it's more a case of style over substance.<br /><br />The aroma is enticing, but that's where the magic ends.  The taste was bitter and a little acidic; even experimenting with different flavored creamers didn't completely mask it.  Which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.  It's not bad if you're into bitter coffees, but since it's billed as being made with "exotic floral and berry beans" I can't really recommend it too much.

review/summary: Best overall Pod coffee
review/text: I have a Gevalia pod coffee maker with 6, 8 and 12oz. cup choices. Most of the pods I try need two pods for any size larger than 6oz. This makes a robust but not better 12 oz cup. And to boot it's cheaper than the other pod coffee brands. The senseo pods  are useless if you want a man sized mug. At the price of most pod coffees {$12.99 to $19.99) using two pods per cup is not cost efficient. I only wish Marley Coffee had more blends to choose from.

review/text: I prefer coffee that is a little bolder, but if you like smooth, mild coffee, this is a good choice.  The flavor is mild, but with some subtle accents.<br /><br />I tried making this coffee first in the type of single pod machine that it is designed for, but found it way too weak for my tastes.  Next I put several of the pouches (6) into a regular machine, with three cups were of water.  Even in like this it was too weak for my taste, but you can tell that it is good coffee.  It is smooth and delicious.<br /><br />The packaging is nice, but I found the little packs to be hard to open.  I couldn't get any of them open with my fingers, instead having to use scissors.

review/summary: Coffee  ***UPDATE*** added
review/text: I love coffee, and a particular fantasy of mine would be to go to all these exotic places, make friends with the natives, tour their coffee plantations, sample their wares, and pack my bags with a supply of their goods.  (Of course, I would pay them dearly for their goods and services.)<br /><br />Since I can't go to any of these places, I have to settle for imported coffee.  This box of coffee is "Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe", "ethically farmed-artisan roasted", and is also fair trade certified and USDA approved.<br /><br />This particular coffee that I am reviewing is "exotic floral and berry".  This particular box has 15 individual, individually-wrapped (that's the part I like!) servings.<br /><br />I made this coffee this morning, and I love it.  It isn't very strong, so it might not be for everyone.  (Sometimes coffee is just too strong.)  I plan on making more of this coffee later today.<br /><br />I currently don't have an Espresso machine in my kitchen, but I hope to one day have one.  Whenever that time comes, I look forward to the day that I can make cappuccinos and other exotic coffee drinks with all these exotic coffees.<br /><br />UDDATE Sunday, April 15, 2012:  I did make more coffee last night (the coffee was so good - who could resist?); however, that was a big mistake.  I did not go to bed until early this morning; consequently, I slept late, missed church, and the day was ruined.  (I will go to church tonight.)  The caffiene must have been strong.  From now on, I will only drink this coffee in the morning.  I sure wish I had of had this coffee back when I was in the Army and had to pull all-night duty.

review/summary: I Really Wanted to Like This
review/text: I am convinced that fair trade, organic food is best for us, the planet and our neighbors. So when I saw this option for coffee I was eager to give it a go as good organic coffee is rare. This is a good, but not great, option.<br /><br />I found that most of the time I would get either too weak or too strong coffee. If I went with one package it was too weak. Two packages was too much. I couldn't find the sweet spot. With the packets being pre-packaged you would think the amount would be just right.<br /><br />Incidentally, the packets are hard to open. I don't know if I got a pack of glitched packets but mine did not have notches in them. This didn't affect my score.<br /><br />Overall, if you can get the right mix it is still organic, free trade coffee and I'll take it any day over the stuff from the big manufacturers. But I was hoping for an easier just-strong-enough experience.

review/summary: smelled & tasted burnt
review/text: My husband has one of the Hamilton Beach One Cup Coffee makers that uses Senseo pods.  So when I saw this coffee came in pods, I decided to try it since I haven't found any other competitors for Senseo.  Unfortunately, this was just bad.  When I opened the pouch, it smelled bitter.  When he brewed a cup, it smelled and tasted burnt.  It wasn't weak, as some other reviewers have stated, but it tasted so bad he poured the rest of thecup down the drain.<br /><br />Obviously, any food item is a matter of individual taste.  However, this smelled bad to me (a non-coffee drinker who loves the smell of brewing coffee), and even flavored creamer couldn't make it palatable for my husband. The price is reasonable, but I just can't recommend it.

review/summary: Weak, tho tasty
review/text: I read some of the other reviews here and decided to try putting a pod in my espresso machine. Worked fine, except the coffee was not very dark. Then I took the pod and dropped it into the coffee to make it darker. Still weak. This is the same problem I have with all the pod/cup/premeasured coffees. While I do know people who drink coffee brewed like this, it's not strong enough for my taste, and I think most people's. The flavor is good, would be delicious if strong, so maybe next time I will use two pods. However, the price is kind of high if you have to use two pods per cup.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today, I tried using two pods and boiling them in a cup of water, thinking it might work for camping. Still weak. I think you'd need two pods and half a cup, 4oz or so. I noticed that the coffee does not taste full-bodied. It could be dried out from all the processing -- ground coffee should probably be stored in a packed brick, not individual, non-vacuum-packed packets. Oh well.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this but..
review/text: Given the name and the talent behind it, I was convinced this would be awesome. Even the description had me sold however it just didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />Since I didn't have a pod brewer, I originally tried brewing this coffee in a standard coffee maker which came out super weak even though I used 3 pods. Then I tried squeezing each of the pods into my coffee cup which made it a tad better but still weak. I drank this coffee black which I rarely do but any creamer would have just ruined it.<br /><br />I also tried brewing it like a tea which just didn't work at all. Eventually I found a pod machine and it was weak just using one pod. After using about 7 pods to try out this coffee and get a desired result, I just gave up. I couldn't get the desired quality and as for taste, it's equivalent to something you'll find in McDonalds. I didn't get a hint of anything else.

Nearly all foods in our home is organic or better so I am only comparing this with other organic single serve varieties we have tried (and there aren't that many). This is by far the best one we have tried. Even our coffee-discerning Colombian friend really likes this coffee. It is a true medium roast, not too rich or bitter. Very smooth and not acidic. Good enough to have with cream alone. When this box is through, I will buy this one again!<br /><br />I hope this was helpful. Thanks for reading!

review/text: 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - means a very distinctive aroma and flavor that may not be familiar to many American consumers. This coffee brews up a nice medium roast with exotic floral and berry notes. The pods work well, as intended, and the company certainly tries to spread around the positivity. The individual foil packets keeps each pod fresh and ready to use. I have since tried several of their different coffees, and yet this remains my favorite!

It comes in a box of 25 single serve pods that you just drop in your cup (the pods are marked with "this side down") and add hot water.  Let it steep for a few minutes then remove the pod and enjoy.  One Love is smooth and mild with a nutty coffee flavor.  I keep a box of it at work since each pod is individually sealed in a foil pouch.  That way, when I just can't stand another cup of "work" coffee, I brew up a cup of One Love and become the envy of all my friends.

I heat water in a mug and then add one of these coffee pods and brew it like a tea bag. I also take a spoon and squeeze water through the pod while it brews in my cup to get a strong coffee out of it.<br /><br />Of all the different coffees I have had, like Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain, Folgers, and so forth, the coffee this most reminds me of is Starbucks. It is not exactly the same, but I would think someone who likes Starbucks roasts would probably enjoy this.<br /><br />I like the nice box and especially that each coffee pod is individually wrapped to keep them fresh.

review/text: I usually like to grind my own beans but tried this because I had it once before and because it's organic. I tried it a few months ago and only had one cup and was pretty sure I liked it and wanted to confirm.<br /><br />I got this to use in my Cuisinart that is made for keurig k cups - I cut open the pods and poured the coffee into my set reusable kcup. Because the coffee is ground so fine, it didn't work too well in the keuring but I expected that. I just brewed two small cups with the one kcup-ful and it worked fine. The coffee is rich and full bodied, not bitter and only mildly acidic. And, it tastes pretty fresh for preground coffee.<br /><br />I love a deep, bold coffee but don't like acidic or bitter flavor, and this was a pretty good cupful, and it's organic to boot. I find it a challenge to find a bold coffee that I like that isn't bitter/acidic, so was pleasantly surprised with this. I would probably buy again if I could use pods directly or if I could get whole beans.

If you haven't tried this, I think you should. I think you'll like it.

review/summary: Pricey, But Delicious
review/text: These are pods, designed to be used in a single-cup brewing system made for pods.  I don't have one of those expensive, pod-using, coffeemakers.  I do have a single mug coffeemaker, which I normally fill with water using the provided fourteen ounce mug.  For the purposes of this product, I tried just putting in a cup (8 oz) of water, and placing the pod in the basket.  This produced a weak, undrinkable liquid.  The second time, I filled the pot with 8 oz. again.  I cut open two of the pods and put the coffee in the usual No. 2 filter.  This produced a very strong, but very delicious cup of coffee.  I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.  Filling the one-cup coffeemaker with the usual full mug of water and the contents of two opened pods makes a slightly weaker but still very full-bodied, rich coffee.

review/summary: Love It. Smooth, Not Bitter, Wonderful Taste!
review/text: I have been using a Tassimo brewer like this one made by Bosch for several years now. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W3V88W">Bosch TAS1000UC Tassimo Single-Serve Coffee Brewer, Anthracite</a> . I purchased mine from Tassimo Direct online. Gevalia, Starbucks, HAG,  and several other brands were my main brews. I love the convenience of the Tassimo system and easy cleanup. However, after drinking this Marley Coffee, I am now rethinking how I brew coffee. The Tassimo takes up a fair amount of counter space. You have to use the Tassimo disc coffee packs and they are limited in choices. I wish this Marley coffee came in Tassimo discs. I love it.<br /><br />I am now thinking that I will simplify my coffee station by getting rid of the Tassimo and using a french press or this Aerobie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a>. Not only can I get everything off the counter and store it in my cabinets, but I can also use any kind of coffee I want. I have an instant hot water unit that is supplied filtered water from a sediment and carbon block filter. I also already have a spinning blade coffee grinder. So I think I am going to purchase the Aerobie brewer and open up one of the Marley pods and give it a try.

review/summary: Great Full Body Taste
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee and tea everyday, my normal brand is Gevalia Limited Edition but I like trying different brands when the mood strikes me, as it did here.<br /><br />I don't have one of these machines that uses the pods but my normal use machine is the Keurig and I personally fill the K-Cups with which ever coffee I'm in the mood for, and it was simple to empty one of these pods into my re-usable K-Cups and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I'd read the different reviews and the opinions were all over the place and I think it had to do with the preparation that each person used. I decided on the Keurig because I just wanted a single cup this afternoon but in the future I will brew several cups using the French Press (LOVE! the Richness with the press)<br /><br />But enough about the style of the maker and back to the matter at hand, the coffee!<br /><br />It's a delightful, full and rich tasting coffee and I will be enjoying it and I'll be ordering more because it's great stuff.<br /><br />It's a joy to find a coffee this good because most leave a lot to be desired.

review/summary: tasty coffee, with additional novelty value
review/text: These coffee pods are probably intended for use in one of the  single serve  coffee machines. There were no instructions anywhere, they do have "This side down" on the pod but there was nothing on the box, outer pouch  or in the product description that indicated that the pods were not  the (identically appearing) coffee pods that are directly immersed in water.<br /><br /> You cannot  use them successfully just by putting them in a drip filter and pouring water through because the water flows through too swiftly. I was able to get  very nice coffee with these pods  by putting them in the cup of hot water and bobbing the pod up and down to keep the water flowing through the pod and the natural oils from settling on the grounds. It did not take long to brew.<br /> The coffee made this way was good tasting, reasonably strong but not overwhelming and somewhat sweet. The coffee was  does not have much caffeine. This would not be  the cup to have when you really need a stiff jolt  to wake you up. This is definitely a coffee I could drink at night without having any problems getting to sleep.<br /><br />Marley One Love Coffee pods are elegantly packaged in cream colored mylar pouches with red green and gold accents. There are images of Bob Marley and the Ethiopian Lion on the package and pouches. These would almost be  worth it for the conversational value of the package alone. Everyone who came into the kitchen and saw the box was enthralled. Everyone who tried the coffee enjoyed it.<br />I do not have a single serve  coffee maker so I cannot tell you  how well the pods work in a coffee maker.<br /><br />.

review/summary: Fresh Great Taste
review/text: I am a tea lover and am not really a coffee drinker.  However, the new single serve pods of Marley Coffee caught my attention.  I really enjoyed this coffee.  It had a fresh great taste that was not over powering or too strong like some coffee can be.  It can be consumed black or with sweetners...it was great both ways.  As I drank my cups and read the box...I was pleased to learn that farm workers are treated ethically and that partial proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs (kicksforcause.org).  If you enjoy coffee, then you must try this 100% Arabica coffee bean/Artisan Roasted. Uhm Uhm Good!

review/summary: Great Aroma; Mild Taste
review/text: Marley Coffee comes with no directions on the package, only the statement that it's single serving. It doesn't state what system of coffee brewing this was manufactured for.  The aroma is wonderful, however, I'd describe the coffee as mild not medium roast.  I was, therefore, disappointed in the flavor. Perhaps if it was brewed in a cone system or similar, I might have had a stronger result.

review/text: Those have to be the three most boring cups of coffee I've ever had. The first cup tasted like watered down creamer and sugar. Thinking maybe I'd done something wrong, I tried again with the same result. Next time around I used two pods, no cream, and no sugar hoping for a stronger cup. No dice. I really like the idea of the coffee, the organic certification, fair trade certification, charities and initiatives they support, but come on, make me a stronger and more flavorful cup! Brown water isn't going to cut it.

review/summary: No Caffeine Boost
review/text: Brewed my first cup this morning and was not impressed.  You can taste the blueberry, wine and chocolate characteristics, but this light roast coffee does not offer a "first cup in the morning" big caffeine boost.  Maybe if you are looking for a simple midday break you could brew a cup, but do not look for any pick me up qualities, this brew is designed for a pairing with a fruit based snack.  So, if you are looking for a paring with you afternoon muffin, this pod might work for you.

review/summary: Not A Winner
review/text: A box of this coffee contains 15 packets. There are no preparation instructions so one would think that one packet means one cup. Since coffee makers consider a cup to be 6 ounces that was my starting point. One of the reviews mentioned that the coffee is weak so I doubled down on the amount. This meant two coffee packets in 6 ounces of water. While the coffee was brewing it emitted a very slight and barely detectable odor. When the brewing was finished it was time to drink coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the weakest coffee I have ever tasted. It would take all 15 packets to make  one 8 cup pot of weak coffee at a cost of over ten bucks. Not a good choice. There are far better coffees available at far more reasonable prices. They would be a much better choice than this Marley.

review/summary: Blech
review/text: This is probably good organic coffee in whole bean form.  It seems pretty fresh, even for ground coffee, and it's roasted the way I like it, which is medium-light.  The flavor (once you get some, more on that to follow) is mild.  It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br /><br />Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.  Two stars for the fair trade.  No stars for anything else.

review/summary: Bland Marley.
review/text: To start with, I'll be upfront about a few things:<br /><br />A) I got this coffee free to try through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />B) I don't have a pod coffee maker, so I ripped open several bags and put the grounds in a normal filter, making a full 10 cup pot at a time.<br /><br />This said, I'm not in much of a position to assess the pod concept as I didn't use them this way.<br /><br />As far as the coffee itself.  Its fair, but not great.  Like other reviewers have mentioned its pretty weak stuff.  The taste kinda reminds me of a smoother McDonalds coffee.  Not bold by any means, but certainly drinkable if you're open to that kind of thing.<br /><br />I prefer a stronger flavor, so I won't be buying it again.

review/summary: Use a French press
review/text: I poured boiling water over the pod and worked it over really well with a spoon until the water was good and dark. This produced a good, full bodied coffee with a rich taste. For my next cup, I put the pod in a French press and let it set for a few minutes before pressing, and the flavor improved even more. If you don't have a single pod brewer, this is the way to brew an excellent, environmentally-friendly cup of coffee from the individual packets.

review/summary: A Mild Taste That Pleases
review/text: I normally enjoy my coffee with a little bit of a kick to it.  I'm a fan of strong coffee that slaps you around and wakes you up in the morning.  Marley's One Love Organic Coffee, though, was a nice change of pace for me.  It has a very mild flavor (I detected no bitterness myself) that may not have enough punch for some folks, but for an afternoon break it is perfect for me.<br /><br />I removed this coffee from the filter pods it comes in and filtered it myself in my own coffee drip pot.  I used two pods for sixteen ounces of coffee and it came out wonderful.  I actually enjoyed just sitting down on a lazy afternoon to watch the world fly by for a few minutes while drinking this coffee.  I know it sounds a bit strange, but the coffee actually relaxed and calmed me down.<br /><br />I recommend this coffee for folks who enjoy a quick break once in awhile.  If you're in no hurry, this is a great brew to spend a little time with.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/text: I am relatively new to the world of pod coffee, but bought a Bunn My Cafe that I am thrilled with because it brews at the right temperature, easily, and with no ecological waste.  One of the fun aspects of all this is trying out all sorts of coffee pods made by different companies.  Most of what I have tried so far are very good, so I have no complaints about any of them, but the Marley One Love coffee pod is perhaps my new favorite.  Wonderfully smooth coffee from Ethiopia, and from the moment you open the wrapper and smell the first whiff of heavenly coffee until you get to drink the freshly brewed cup you will not be disappointed.  This is going to become a regular order for me.  YUM!

review/text: I liked the smooth, rather mild flavor of this One Love, One Heart, 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe bean. My only complaint is the single packets with no instructions anywhere.  I assume the packets are for a single cup brewer.  I cut open the packets and used several in a multi cup brewer.  I wish there was a number to call.  Beautiful packaging and an excellent flavor.  Wonder if there's an instant version as well as packaging as beans and ground.  In my limited experience, I think Ethiopian coffee ranks among the very best of natural coffee flavors.  I bet even Bob Marley would like this along with his morning ganga.<br /><br />"...let's get together and feel all right"  Indeed.

review/text: My husband and I travel for several weeks a year in an RV, and always take "instant" and "single cup" brews along with us. I have taken both Maxwell House and Folgers "brew in the cup" coffee bags, and found them acceptable (in lieu of a fresh cup of coffee from an actual coffee pot), so my expectations were that this coffee would be similar in taste and quality. I was wrong. I thought this was an exceptionally tasty cup of coffee - on par with coffee that has been brewed in a coffee maker. It is smooth and flavorful, with a very fresh taste. I highly recommend it for those who want a good cup of coffee without committing to a whole pot - or to lugging a K-cup type brewer along to work or on the road.

review/summary: Smooth, slightly sweet flavor
review/text: When I ordered One Love for some reason I thought they were single serve packets that you just add hot water to but they are not. My fault for not reading thoroughly. Since I don't have a pod coffee brewer this review is based on using these pods with my Keurig and French Press.<br /><br />My Keurig model is the B60 Special Edition that I purchased attachments for which enable me to use pods: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WU8PW8">Perfect Pod Holster Use Any Pod in Your Keurig Coffee Maker - Over 10,000 Sold</a>.<br /><br />The description of this coffee is floral with berry notes. I really couldn't detect the berry in the coffee by smell but the floral was definitely there and both were present in taste with a slight chocolate taste. I think this coffee is very similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>, just not as bold in flavor and more of a medium flavored coffee. I really didn't like the bitter smell of the coffee.<br /><br />Results:<br />Keurig My K-Cup with brew size of 9.25oz: weak, light colored coffee with hardly any flavor.<br /><br />Perfect Pod Holster with brew size of 9.25oz: dark in color with a smooth, slightly sweet medium roast flavor.<br /><br />French Press: near same results as the Perfect Pod Holster except the coffee was darker and had more flavor since I could let the grounds steep in the hot water for a few minutes.<br /><br />The Perfect Pod Holster and French Press were enjoyable successes with these pods, I was able to drink it with 2 packets of Splenda and no cream. I brewed a second cup in the Keurig, adding a teaspoon of chocolate coffee creamer, which brought out the chocolate flavor that's traditionally found in Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee, along with the Splenda made the coffee was very enjoyable. I've been drinking it this way ever since.<br /><br />Since this coffee is very finely ground it leaves coffee sediment in the bottom of the cup.

review/text: This gourmet coffee has a delicious aroma, but a very mild taste. Which is good for drinking while  having breakfast, but not to drink alone or with milk, if one likes strong coffee.  The little pods are convenient for taking along while traveling. They work well on those small coffeemakers provided in hotels. One thing I didn't noticed the first time I had one, and which makes a different when brewing the coffee pods, it's that each one says, This Side Down, and of course, placing it in that position inside the pod brewer helps improve the result. The lack of bitterness is a definitely a plus.

review/summary: A mild smooth coffee
review/text: There are several things a coffee lover looks for in their brew.. the aroma, the color and the taste are what I look for. When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.  The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs.  This is a good deal.  The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment.

review/summary: Aromatic Little Pods
review/text: These single-serve pods are everything good; Eco-friendly, "Ethically Farmed * Artesian Rosted," organic, and when you're done, it's ready for the compost bin. Other than the "This Side Down" printed on each pod, there are no directions on the package, but they are intended for use in most home and office brewers....and I guess perfectly acceptable to use like a tea bag, which I tried and got a very tasty cup of coffee from it.<br /><br />The aroma when you break open the individually wrapped little pod package is tantalizing, and the flavor very robust. The box is full of references to the great Bob Marley, and the company is owned by his son. There are other icons on the box too, from the coffee producers, ITAL, who are "...committed to sourcing the finest quality 100% Arabica beans" and "Kicks for Cause" which sends a portion of the proceeds to charity.<br /><br />All in all, this "Exotic Floral and Berry" blend makes a very nice cup of coffee, and is extremely handy if you are busy, so get your One Love pod in a brewer or cup and enjoy! I'm factoring the convenience of the product into my rating. If this was loose coffee, it would get 4 stars.

review/summary: Capitalizing on the Marley Legend-Organic Fair Trade Coffee
review/text: The great late Reggae singer Bob Marley's son has founded marleycoffee.com. The coffee is Fair Trade Certified and quite good. I drink my coffee black without sugar and really am keen on trying different roasts, etc. My only problem with this coffee is that it come in pods. I do own a Keurig and figured that I could put a pod in the fill-it-yourself chamber and brew my coffee. Alas, this doesn't work. I finally brewed it by steeping it in boiling water in the microwave and I must say it was pretty decent. At this point, I am not about to buy a pod brewer (available from a variety of companies including Marley). I think the pods are definitely more environmentally friendly than the plastic k-cups, but I have been buying my own coffee, grinding my beans and using the filters that I bought for my Keurig machine. This is definitely a less costly way to use a single cup brewer.

My pods were "Exotic Floral and Berry" flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.  I believe that Marley Coffee comes in an espresso flavor and that might be better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this coffee.

review/summary: Coffee's delicious, but not the easiest to brew.
review/text: Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.  I find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it, the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak.  I have tried using these like actual teabags, which definitely makes a better cup of coffee, but requires a little more time and supervision than I want.  I presume that the right kind of machine, or the right style of coffeemaking, turns these packets into solid gold for ease of use; for me, though, not so much.  But yeah: seriously tasty coffee, once you get the right amount of coffee-ness in your hot water.

review/summary: Amost as good as that place in Seattle.............
review/text: I tested this coffee using a regular Mr. Coffee brewer and a standard coffee filter.  Although the product is designed for those one-cup brewers, I don't have one so I used what I had.  It comes in the sealed pods that are designed to drop right in the the brewer without and mess.  I had to open the pouch to brew it in the Mr. Coffee but still found it made a lot less mess just pouring it from an opening in the pouch.  The first time I just made one cup; the second time I brewed two cups using two pouches.<br /><br />I found the coffee quite good, especially the aroma.  (I really loved the aroma!)  It definitely has floral and berry notes that do not overwhelm the coffee flavor. I like that it is organic and Fair Trade Certified.  This product also claims that "We use beans only from coffee farms that adhere to strict sustainability ethics."  You really can't get a much purer source than this.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee gourmand so I shared this brew with a friend who is very particular about her coffee to see her reaction.  I will drink just about any coffee but she likes her coffee strong.  She found this coffee strong and thought that it came awfully close to the coffee she gets from that Seattle chain.  She found the floral and berry "aftertaste" pleasant and not bitter.  She said for her it's definitely 4-star. (Remember, this is a gal who knows her coffee.)

review/summary: Hard to believe what a wonderful cup of coffee it makes......
review/text: I must admit that I was skeptical when I requested this item believing that the only way to a great cup of coffee was to brew it.  I most certainly was wrong.  This coffee is great.  Just add boiling water and you are good to go.  Perfect for work or when you just don't need to make a whole pot of java.  The taste and aroma are wonderful.  Will be purchasing more in the near future.

review/summary: Much love for One Love Coffee
review/text: This product has a surprise taste and I truly wonder why nobody has thought of this before.  It's the best of both coffee and tea in one infusion. It's got the best of everything in terms of convenience, taste, and triple bottom line. Here's what I love about it:<br /><br />TASTE:  The rich earthy depth of Arabica coffee infused with exotic overtones of berries and flowers. It's simply divine.<br /><br />CONVENIENCE: Each pouch is individually wrapped to preserve the aromatics, and the drink is steeped like tea, so there is no need for a press or coffee maker.<br /><br />ECO Friendly:  The coffee is 100% organic and fair trade. What's not to love about that?<br /><br />CHARITABLE: A portion of the proceeds of this beverage go to charity to promote youth soccer programs<br /><br />All in all this is a delicious, convenient yummy beverage and a new favorite in our home!<br /><br />Our other favorite is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027CNY7U">Guayaki Traditional Mate Tea Bags, 75-count</a>

review/summary: The Coffee is Outstanding...even if you don't have the right coffee maker
review/text: We missed that this coffee is packaged "For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers." Doh. We don't have such a brewing device, so I cut open the packets and used the loose, ground beans in our french press (and this worked well).<br /><br />The coffee itself is outstanding (at least via our french press). A nice smooth, rich flavor; a hint of fruit in the smell; very little acid taste. We quite enjoyed it.

review/summary: not a fan
review/text: I did not care for this coffee. The first thing I noticed when I opened it is that it smells bad and I'm the kind of person that likes the smell of coffee. Anyway, despite the unpleasant aroma I brewed a cup to try it. I didn't really like the flavor, even after I added a bunch of creamer and sugar (which usually makes most coffees okay). I wouldn't say it was horrible, but I will be going back to my old stuff.

review/summary: My Dad Would Approve
review/text: My dad was a coffee drinking fanatic and he used to tell me that a day not started with a good cup of coffee was destined to be a total waste. I started drinking the stuff very young. I don't overdo it, just a couple cups in the morning, so I like it to be good and this coffee fills the bill. It has a nice aroma, tastes good and leaves a pleasant aftertastes. My dad would approve.

review/summary: As good as Dunkin' Donuts
review/text: My husband is the main coffee drinker in our house and he's always searching for a good brew.  I accepted Marley's Coffee to review, mainly because I'd hoped he would find a good coffee that he liked.  I didn't notice they were pods.  Oops.  I'd literally just given away our Senseos because we can't get pods, only online and it's just too much to buy a case for just hubby to use.<br /><br />So, he had to improvise a little.  He tried boiling water and using it like a teabag.  That worked well.  He even ripped some open and used them in a regular coffeemaker with a filter - that worked well too.<br /><br />It had a good flavor and wasn't too acidic (I'd recently gotten him some Gevalia that he said was way too acidic for his taste, so this was a welcome change).  It wasn't too weak, nor too strong.  He compared it to Dunkin Donuts' coffee, saying it was just as good as Dunkin (and that was saying a lot for him).<br /><br />I'm hoping to find Marley's coffee in a regular grind now for him.  Overall, he liked the taste far better than many I've purchased for him.

review/summary: Wow
review/text: The smell in the single serve package is a little off putting, but I suspect that that's because it is actually the smell of good, organic coffee. Even brewing, the smell is a bit sharp, but that first cup is...<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />I was shocked drinking it, actually. The flavor was not too terribly robust, but not so weak as to be merely coffee-flavored water. Indeed, the flavor is one which is almost minty, but not overbearingly so. I love my dark, robust coffee (the dark the better) in the mornings when I would rather climb under the bed. This coffee, however, seems to be one that I can drink with just about anything thing, at any time.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I'm going to have other cup now.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fair trade, organic coffee that doesn't taste like it, but will add flavor to your morning without tons of sugar and non-dairy dairy creamer. This is a coffee I could drink without that stuff.<br /><br />Good stuff!

review/summary: Smooth - no bitterness
review/text: I made this in a regular coffee maker made for pods.<br />I thought it was find - it reminded me most of a breakfast blend.  It was very smooth with what seemed like a normal dose of caffeine.  It's not at all bitter - unfortunately, around here, we LIKE bitter in our beer and coffee, so I probably would not buy it again.  If, however, you like something like Maxwell House Breakfast Blend with a mild flavor, but a bit more caffeine, you'll probably really like it.<br />I love that it is fair trade.  I had to use scissors to open the packets.

review/summary: Bitter Brew, and that's good
review/text: Note: I snipped open the pod and tasted this coffee after preparing it properly, not in a pod.<br />"<br />This is the "organic medium ethiopia yirgacheffe" (really).<br /><br />I like a light roast; a fruity columbian.  It may be that I am reacting to the omnipresence of that bitter, over-roasted stuff Starbucks pours. Well, this Marley blend is bitter as well, but intrinsically so, with a tongue-slapping sting. I don't feel that it is a product of over-roasting, but rather, the nature of the bean. I like it. It makes me want to sip it while alternating chocolate mousse and cabernet. Seriously. Try that combination for dessert sometime. It is the great triumvirate.<br /><br /> I am particular about my coffee and yet compromise my taste by going the K-cup route. doing the 200 degree water drip through the unbleached paper with freshly ground beans thing is not for me on an very early weekday morning. I can barely put my pants on, let alone manipulate a container full of near-boiling water. That level of love is left for the weekend, when I have the time to take the time to linger lovingly over proper preparation as if it were the Tea Ceremony.<br /><br />That being said, there is no need to compound the sin of employing a pod or K-cup while using that stuff that sits on the grocer's shelf for months. Use good coffee. Marley's is packed in foil and tasted fairly fresh.
