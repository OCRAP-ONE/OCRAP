review/summary: Different, but Good Taste
review/text: There are to things I really like to snack on and that's, Jerky and Spicy Stuff. Believe it or not, these beef stick's have a little spice to them(not a lingering spicy).The reason I gave these a 3 of 5 STARS, is because I make my own Beef and Deer Jerky and although these Jalapeno and Cheese are something different and tasty, they come nowhere close to my awsome homemade jerky made from steak, not ground beef part's such as (beefheart).

review/summary: Does "Made in USA" = Ingredient USA Chicken or from China?
review/text: I would like to hear from Smokehouse as to "country of origin" for the chicken they use in this product - since all the other products they sell (like regular chicken strips) are from China.  Is this basically the same Chinese-processed chicken imported and then combined with some vitamin E inside a US factory? Made in USA doesn't equate with product country of origin.<br /><br />I wouldn't be suspicious except that they are a huge importer of chicken from China.  Why would this product be any different?

review/text: I had been feeding mostly the chicken jerky treats, feeling good about it since the only ingredient was chicken.  Then I saw the reports of kidney failure linked to the ones made in China.  It's hard to find them made in the USA, and they are much more expensive.  Then I found these.  They are made in the US.  Ingredients are chicken and Vitamin E.  The texture is different, but my dog likes them just as well and they have the added advantage of being "breakable", so you can give them smaller portions easily.

review/summary: One of Two dogs accepts them, but shipping is a problem
review/text: I've been trying to find chicken jerky dog treats not made in China and these are the closest I've been able to find to this point (but I've found some made in Maine that look possible - I haven't tried them yet but intend to). These are US made, but not like what comes from China. They are hard and brittle and formed in some fashion into strips/bars. One of our dogs accepts them OK (not her favorite, but will take them), the other just turns his head away and only eats them when he realizes it's all there's going to be.<br /><br />But my last shipment from Amazon is going to be my last. I ordered several bags and they arrived with the pieces mostly in small shards. Don't know if Amazon shipped them in that condition or the shipper managed to mangle them en route (the box was not mangled in any way but it could have been dropped). But given the fact they're not ideal anyway, I'm not ordering any more.<br /><br />Not my favorite and not really recommended. Going to keep looking. The Blue Buffalo chicken treats (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ITWDKO">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Chicken Dog Jerky Treats</a>) are good, but outrageously expensive ($10 for a 3.2 oz bag!) and mostly very small pieces, so after one bag, no more.

review/summary: Okay but not a home run
review/text: I ordered these when trying to find a chicken treat that is USA made. For years I had bought the Waggin Train brand.  My dog loved them, but had a diarrhea every time she went "number two" and neither we nor our vet could figure out why.  Finally after seeing the story about chews made in China, I stopped buying them.  Within a week my dog had totally stopped her diarrhea!  She has hardly had it one time since and that was last year.  Back to topic - the bag does say USA made which is comforting, but the chews are very hard and crunchy.  I just rescued a male Shih Tzu and he ate them, but my girl wasn't impressed.  I am still searching for a USA made chew that is not hard as a rock.

review/summary: Picky Papillons Love It
review/text: My Papillons (ages 8 and 9) have been the pickiest damn dogs I have ever met.  You know when the vet says "they will eat eventually, they won't starve"?  Well, no.  These damn dogs would starve if they didn't get to eat something they liked.  I have been struggling for years to find food that is not made in China, not made from chicken from China even if manufactured in the USA.  Finally, I found Halo.  I integrated the Halo Spots Stew kibble and the Halo Spot's Stew chicken canned into the Paps diet over 2 weeks.  Week one they ate half of the Halo and by the end of week two they were eating ALL of the Halo product and the small amount of the old brand was left in their bowls.  Their skin is fantastic, their poops are a perfect consistency (not too hard or too soft) and they are energetic and just happy and excited for meal time now.  I also feed them the Halo LiL Bits freeze dried chicken treats.  All of the ingredients are from USA and made solely here.  And, I am thrilled that my favorite TV talk show host, Ms. Ellen Degeneres is a part owner of the company.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for offering this here as it is hard to get in my somewhat small town pet stores who seem to cater to gross China food that will make all our dogs sick.

review/summary: my dogs love it
review/text: I have spent 2 years trying to find some sort of dog food that won't break the bank, that's made with dog health in mind, and that my dogs actually like. having said that, I was truly skeptical about buying this, simply because of the price. I mean, it's dog food, they all look the same. But. it's. awesome. I started off by mixing in a spoon full of it into their regular food, and for the first time ever my dogs were cleaning their plates. its got chunks of real vegetables in it, and in combination with the dried food (also Halo, I mix the salmon with the lamb) my dogs are eating like kings and queens: 3 types of meat, 15 types of veggies & fruits...wow.<br /><br />I'm totally in love with this brand. I have switched over EVERYTHING, their treats, their dry food and their wet food.if halo comes out with a flavored water supplement for dogs, I'll probably buy that too. its just a great brand, reliable, and with a conscience.

review/summary: Only dog food I will use
review/text: After reading horrible reviews about dog food and with the onset of my puppy having seizures, I made him only home cooked meals specifically for dogs.  He was having stomach problems and went through many different recipes always consulting with my Vet, but then I found Halo dog food.  My dog eats this and looks for more, his stomach problems have subsided and he's doing very well. This was such a relief due to his seizures and stomach problems and I tried so hard to make him well.  He's been on Halo canned chicken Spots Stew now for 2 months and I am so relieved.  Now if only I could do something about the seizures, all would be well.  However, I give very high recommendations for Halo food.  A bit expensive, but worth every penny.  I need to add that I know how much Ellen Degeneres loves dogs and put my trust in her advocating Halo food.  I'm not sorry. Thanks Ellen.  Thanks Amazon for carrying it and offering monthly subscriptions.

I wonder if he is just too little to try it...he is 4 months old.  Anyway, we may try it again when he is older because it seems like such a good quality food and that is what we strive to feed him.  I do have to say I was surprised when I opened the can.  I was expecting a chunky stew type food but it isn't.  It is a course puree with chunks of vegetable in it and that was fine with me too.  Also, he loved it!  If only it would have loved him back.

review/summary: Foolproof Ice Cream
review/text: You really can't beat this stuff.  It's so easy to make great ice cream using this product that I don't bother with the more complicated recipes anymore.  Mix 1 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup cream with a box of this mix, blend right in your ice cream maker's container with a stick blender and start up the ice cream maker.  That's all it takes to make a quart of lovely vanilla ice cream.  I decrease the fluid and replace with fresh chopped cherries and later chocolate chips when the mixture has thickened for a wonderful ice cream that has all my friends begging for more.  Since I use 2% milk and sometimes no cream at all, my finished product is much lower calorie than pre-made ice cream and just as good.  You don't have to feel guilty at all enjoying ice cream this way.  Fresh peach ice cream anyone?  The chocolate version of this mix is also delicious. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007SNZEI">Junket Ice Cream Mix Chocolate 12 count</a>.

Junket still makes great ice cream and in an ice cream maker it takes only 20 to 30 minutes.  You can use the soft serve immediately or let it set up in the freezer for a thicker product like you buy at the store.  Nothing store bought in the taste. Good rewarding ice cream to serve to guests or to sneak for yourself as  late night snack when no one is looking.

review/text: A friend of mine recommended to use this tea when she heard me complaining of my bowel movements. I am not into herbal teas or anything herbal that helps to resolve the physical problems. I am a "take a pill" person. But this time, I decided to go with it and does not regret at all. Besides of the great taste, it really improves your movement and does not give any cramps. It's very gentle. I am not the person who likes to recommend things, as tastes differ. But I can recommend this tea and you will enjoy it just as a tea too.

But they are cute, probably best they are all the same since its for a preschool class, they seem quite sturdy. not sure if they are really edible though.

review/text: Having purchased the Soulistic "Gelee" and BFF (made by the same company) I wanted to try the "Gravy" flavors to add some more variety.  Although the food looks appetizing and all the cats seem to like the food, I was dismayed to see that there seemed to be as much gravy as food in the cans.  I do not want to be paying the same price for cans that contain this much liquid and less food.  I will purchase the "Gelee" foods and BFF again, but it isn't likely that I will purchase the "Gravy" flavors.

review/text: Normaly I do not care for Spagetti sauce in a jar, I always prefer homemade. One day we were shoppin in Cosco and Rizzo's was handing out samples of their sauce, we were very suprised by the taste and bought a few jars. My personal favorite is the Tomato Basil, I fry up a pound of ground chuck and when its good and brown I add a jar of the Tomato Basil sauce, to me it tasts like the meat sause at Buca di Beppo. Like I said it is the best sauce that I ever found in a jar. If you look them up on the internet you will see that they have a popular resturant in Crabtree PA and have video links that show cooking recipies that they use there.

I purched a few packages from Amazon, and it turned out to be great at home too.  I've had Primo with regular bottled sauce, canned sauce, and home-made Pomidoro sauce, and it has never dissapointed me. The flavor is entirely different from regular pasta, and the preparation time is just the same.  I love pasta, and for my money, Primo is the best!!

review/summary: Very good but needs to be paired with other flavors
review/text: Amaranth flour has a very earthy and nutty flavor.  The flavor is stronger than many other whole grains.  It pairs nicely with other assertive flavors but may be too much on its own.  I used it in a recipe for corn fritters (lots of spices and served over black beans) and it was excellent (even my three year old loved it).  Amaranth is a grain with a lot of fat (heart healthy fat) so it needs to be stored in the fridge or freezer or it will go rancid.  Amaranth is an excellent source of protein, calcium, and iron.  Its considered a super grain because of its high nutrional content.<br /><br />If you are looking for ways to add whole grains to your diet I would suggest trying this grain. Bob's Red Mill is usually a good bet for these types of products.  I have always had very good luck with this brand (always high quality).

Amazon's price can't be beat on this item.  I used to buy it at the natural food store but it's very pricey.  Buying it in a three-pack helps too.  I store it in the freezer.<br /><br />Just in case you're wanting to make high protein bread, here is my recipe.  Both vegan and dairy versions are included here.  I make it in a Breadman 1.5 lb bread machine, set on white bread, regular cycle, light crust.<br /><br />Add 1-1/4 Cups warm water to bread machine pan<br />Add 2 Tbs. butter OR 3 Tbs. lecithin granules to water<br /><br />To a 1 cup measure add the following:  1/4 cup amaranth flour, 1/4 cup white whole wheat flour, 3 Tbs. soy flour, top up the cup with unbleached, unbromated white bread flour.  Add 2 more cups of bread flour.  1 Tbs. powdered milk OR powdered soy milk, 2 Tbs Sugar, 1-1/2 tsp. salt<br /><br />Use bread machine yeast, 1-3/4 tsp.<br /><br />Start machine.  After 10 minutes of kneading check to see if dough is too wet or too dry, add water or bread flour accordingly.

review/text: This product is by far the best ear cleanser; better than the prescription one as well. Max has chronic ear problems secondary to having atopic dermatitis. Ark cleanser is gentle yet very effective ; I use a bit of vinegar diluted with water regularly as well but then use the ark cleanser; it soothes his ear immediately and leaves a scent of cinnamon .  Poor Max his ears get so inflamed that it even takes the prescription meds 3 days to get the swelling to go down ; so this ark cleanser working on day one has totally amazed me.  It must make Max feel the difference as well because no more struggling with him to be still he actually leans towards me when I use this product. Super thank you please don't stop making Ark ear cleanser. and its all natural ; just doesn't get any better than that.

review/summary: BEWARE - TESTED ON MYSELF - BURNS LIKE FIRE!!!
review/text: My aussie mix acted like I was hurting her no matter how gentle I was applying this stuff for general cleaning of her healthy ears.  Noticing cinnamon leaf oil in the ingedients, I wondered if that might not be an uncomfortable thing to squirt on tender membranes. I tried a little on a q-tip in my own ear and YOW!!!!!<br /><br />It took copious rinsing with saline solution to stop the burn, which indeed felt just like I'd stuck one of those kid-treat cinnamon oil toothpicks in my ear.  I felt terrible for having inflicted it on my dog, and especially on the ears of my recently-deceased 21 year old cat, who didn't seem to enjoy the experience either.<br /><br />I wrote a detailed letter to Ark Naturals immediately, worried that this formula is out there being put in other animals' ears.  It has been over a month with no response whatsoever.  No matter what their response is, I think this is disgraceful and suspect.<br /><br />The ingredients claim to be human-quality -- I recommend testing it on yourself to see if you may be inadvertently hurting your pet. Mine is Lot #61180, FYI.

review/text: This ear cleaner is just the best for dogs.  My German Shorthair always has her ears flipped up and is in the bushes or trees. She used to shake her head and would have dirt in her ears. Just use some makeup removers and put this "Ears all Right" solution on the pads and gently wipe out her ears. It works right away and she no longer wakes up shaking her head. Highly recommend for your dogs if they have ear issues. I also have a male and when I get the ear cleaner out they both come out to get their ears cleaned. Try some as you won't be disappointed.

They are a yummy, healthy snack that is not a candy. (YEAH!) If you like nuts, you will love this bar. It also has sunflower and pumpkin seeds. YUMMY! If I had the choice between a Trio bar or a Snickers bar, TRIO would surely win.<br /><br />FYI... After you find out whether or not you enjoy these, you can set up for a monthly (or every other month) shipment and Amazon doesn't charge shipping fees for it this way, which is very cool! Do try. You will enjoy these! :)

review/text: I really like these nut filled health bars.  In the past I could only find them at my local wearhouse store so I went looking on line.  As usual, Amazon came to my rescue.  These bars are smaller than the wearhouse bars but not too much. The were at my door quickly and in good shape.

review/text: Mrs. May's bar tastes great and I have them before tennis or during a round of golf. Works well for me. The only thing is the size of the bar offered through Amazon is smaller than the size from Costco. Be aware of that!

review/text: These bars are so good.  They remind me of panut brittle.  When Costco stopped stocking them, I had to find another source.  So a-searching on the web I went and found them here at Amazon and on a subscription basis too.  So now they keep coming and I'm enjoying my Trio bars every evening as part of my bedtime snack.

review/summary: Excellent Natural Snack
review/text: I just tried these today and found the item to be very fresh and love the natural aspect.  There are no trans fat, no additives, no preservatives, no cholesterol. The item is gluten, dairy and wheat free, non-GMO and Kosher...for those who do not know what Kosher is that simply means it is a food that conform to the regulations of the Jewish Halakhic framework.<br /><br />Ingredients included for the Blueberry bar...which I might add is my favorite are Cashews, Almonds, Pistachios, Blueberries, Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds, Dates, Raisins, Rice Malt, Natural Flavors, Cane Juice, Sea Salt.  I was very happy to see they use Cane Juice for the sweetener instead of a refined sugar.<br /><br />3 nuts, 3 seeds, 3 fruits, 170 Calories, 14g carbs, 6g sugar<br /><br />This is the first bar I have been able to find that is truly natural and taste wonderful.  The Cranberry is a bit tart, but I did not find it so tart I would never eat it again.<br /><br />The only negative I found is that the product is made in China.

review/summary: Delicious bars
review/text: The bars are basically sweetened granola nut bars, without the oats, and taste much better than other granola bars I've tried. They have quite a bit more nuts than most, so despite the small bar they pack a lot of protein. I think they're a great balance of sweet, savory, crunchy, and chewy, the only downside is that the seeds sometimes get stuck in my teeth. So far I've enjoyed three boxes of these, all on sale, and got great value out of them. At normal price, they'd be a so-so value. The fact that they're made in China doesn't worry me (remember, the last major Salmonella recall was from a US peanut factory), but I would support them at higher prices if they were made here.

review/summary: A tasty snack bar, that's full of good stuff!
review/text: I first became aware of Mrs. Mays products through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGX2EG">Mrs. May's Dry-Roasted Snack, Almond Crunch, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> which our family enjoys.  So when I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFPW6I">Mrs. May's  Trio Bar Variety Pack</a> being offered on Amazon I decided to place an order.<br /><br />The Trio name comes from each bar containing the same 9 base ingredients which are:<br /><br />Nuts - Cashews, Almonds, Pistachios.<br />Seeds - Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds<br />Fruits - Dates, Raisins and the "flavor" of the particular bar.<br /><br />In this box you have Strawberry, Blueberry, Cranberry and Tropical (Pineapple, Mango & Papaya). So far I have tried Blueberry and Strawberry and I have to say the difference is slight, but it is there. I do like the consistency; crunchier than some granola bars, but still easy to bite. The fact that these aren't filled up with flours or oats like most snack bars is great too. Overall I like these, but if I had one complaint it would be their size. At only 1.2oz they are small, but I guess because of the nuts, seeds and texture they are still a filling snack.<br /><br />*I've included a picture in the customer images to show you just how little filler these bars have.

review/text: My mom first turned me onto these. Unlike gooey, sweet (and high calorie), granola bars (which I thought these would be), these are at the same time crunchy and chewy, not too sweet, and delicious!  Everytime I share with colleagues they demand to know how to order them for themselves (I'm in Iraq).  This batch was good but in the past I received a batch that was slightly stale.

review/text: We bought these bars at Costco and liked them enough that we wanted to see whether they could be bought more conveniently through Amazon.  Only then did I learn what I had missed on the box - that the food products are shipped to China for assembly and some content.  We would willingly pay more to have this become a product of the U.S., but because of the implications for environmental impact and job creation, and potential health issues with the current product, we will search for alternatives.

review/summary: Don't pay attention to the negative reviews!
review/text: These are easily the best snack bar product I've ever found.  They are solid nuts & (to a lesser degree) fruit.  No cheap fillers here...just crunchy, natural goodness.<br /><br />It is a travesty that the overall reviewer rating is not close to 5 stars.  This is because of all the knuckleheads who've left poor reviews due to the product being manufactured in China.  If you are leery of food products from China, DON'T BUY THEM.  Nearly everything we buy today is manufactured in China!  Leaving a negative review because of that, is similar to the jerks who give 1-star reviews to products that had shipping issues (delays, damage, etc.)<br /><br />One nitwit complained that they were too "hard" for his/her teeth.  Well, nuts are crunchy, genius.  A trip to the dentist might be in order.<br /><br />Bottom-line:  If you have concerns about these being produced in China, don't buy them (and DON'T LEAVE INAPPROPRIATE NEGATIVE REVIEWS).  For everyone else, do yourself a favor and try these...they are simply fabulous!

It would be the same as eating Mrs. Mays bars.<br /><br />This company is destroying the planet just to make an extra buck.<br /><br />We are SUCH a screwed up country...we're IMPORTING food!!

review/text: Neither the box nor the individual packages are airtight.  Ants penetrated the box and got into the individual packages. I had to throw the entire box away. I will never order or eat these again.  I suggest that anyone who buys these immediately inspect them for bugs inside the individual packages of bars.  If you don't have any, store them in an airtight container and examine them before you eat them. Or better yet, don't buy them. Because the packages aren't airtight, they're gummy, not crispy and will attract bugs.

review/summary: Made in China and bad for the planet
review/text: I loved the taste of this product but just noticed they are made in China.  I contacted the company to get more information. They said they test for quality but in fact the list they gave me was for bacterial contaminants only. They do not test for lead or other heavy metals, just salmonella, aflatoxin and microbiological testing. And they do not own the factory, they just contract out the production and inspect the factory.<br /><br />As for the ingredients, some of them are from China, such as the malt syrup. And the US ingredients are shipped all the way to China, the product is made, then it is shipped all the way back. This was to cut costs according to a business journal report on the company. I hate to see what the carbon production is for each bar based on that practice. And for the price they sell the product for, which is quite expensive, this way of saving a buck speaks poorly to the company's ethics. I for one will no longer buy this product.

review/summary: In a crowded market, there are better choices out there...
review/text: I picked up a case of these at costco because I was curious.  they were a great price, and the ingredient list looked good.  My first impressions were that they were Waaaay too hard and crunchy - I felt like I might break a tooth on these things!  But maybe someone younger would not worry so much about that :).  My second concern was when I read the small print that these are manufactured in China...not so good in my book.  As everyone has seen, in recent years china's foodchain has had some tremendous snafus and quality control issues, which I doubt are resolved yet.  I also am weary to support a company that would ship snack bars all the way from china to save a few cents on each.  Currently I'm using both "Bora Bora" bars and "Oskri" mixed nut bars, which I think are both much better quality (and much easier on my teeth, and organic, and made in North America, blah blah blah).  But these will cost you some more.  Bottom line, if you don't fall in love with these, or you share my concerns about China's quality control on basic food ingredients, then just shop around...

review/summary: Won't buy again. Product of China, went bad before delivery.
review/text: Purchased two boxes in the past. Latest order tasted very different and was stale (kind of had a moldy taste but no visible mold). Called Mrs. May's and they said there was nothing they could do about it. These are a product of China and the bars tasted really different like they had bad ingredients or had gone bad. Mrs. May's representative was not concerned and treated me like I was trying to scam them. Great product idea but I won't be buying any of their products in the future. Read the label and consume at your own risk.

review/summary: Taste stale
review/text: The box shows Best Before Feb 28 2010, but they taste stale.  Some bars are broken in pieces.  I wonder how long they have been on the shelf?  Very disappointed.
