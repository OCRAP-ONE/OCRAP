review/summary: very convenient
review/text: First I really like the smell of this product, at least out of the bottle. On my husband, it didn't smell quite as good. But like many fragrances, they smell just a bit different on each person. My husband said it wasn't his favorite scent, but that it was definately a manly smell. It rinses off well, but doesn't seem to moisturize as well as Dove's other products, which in my opinion was a bit odd. It does a great job making you feel clean, according to my husband. It is also convinient as it is a product that can be used for several applications, which means less clutter in the shower. Great product for a man who is not concerned about moisturizing issues and enjoys the scent.

review/summary: Good for cleaning your body/face
review/text: It's basically shower gel for men. Definitely has a manly-smelling cologne added: some men will like the scent and some will not, we found the scent to be okay. I'd recommend smelling this in the store before purchasing since scents are such a subjective thing.<br /><br />I found this product to work and lather exactly as most of our other shower gels do. Like most shower gels, it doesn't moisturize the skin much, so if your skin is used to being pampered with moisturizing soaps, this may dry your skin out.<br /><br />For being a "wash," it does a good job of cleaning and for its purpose, I give it 4 stars. While we would appreciate a more moisturizing wash, some folks (particularly young men with already oily skin) will appreciate the lack of additional moisturizers.

review/summary: Great Shower Product
review/text: New Dove Men Care has deep cleaning micro grains that exfoliate as they clean.  The wash leaves a good smell on the skin that isn't too floral. It lathers and rinses well.  The only complaint is that sometimes it isn't strong enough.  Keep your bar of cake soap and alternate.

review/summary: Leaves you feeling clean and fresh
review/text: So while this product may be for men, I think a woman could use it as well.  I loved the exfoliating beads that were in this body wash.  The exfoliating beads help make you feel nice and fresh.  The scent isn't overwhelming, you don't feel like you have been doused with a scent when you use this body wash.  I really think this body wash can be used by everyone in the house.  In fact, I have enjoyed this body wash far more than many other body washes I have used in the past.

review/summary: Nice scent. too runny.
review/text: I must confess that I am not a habitual body wash user, being more of a bar soap person myself.  The scent is very good, nice and masculine, and clean.  However, the consistency is too thin for my liking, it is far too runny and not foamy enough, so you end up have to use a whole palmful at a time.

review/summary: From slightly dry to slightly oily
review/text: I struggle with dry skin and I was excited to try this product, as Dove has always made gentle products that have irritated my skin less than some other brands. I have mixed results with this product, though overall I am pleased with it.<br /><br />First, I appreciate that the bottle is easy to open, which is something I have learned not to take for granted. I have used bath and body products that are packaged such that it is next to impossible to open the packaging. This is not one of them.<br /><br />The fragrance is actually very pleasant, on the masculine side but not overpowering. After a good shower there is still the slightest hint of the fragrance left behind, enough that it can be picked up when close but not enough to tell when more than a couple of feet away.<br /><br />The gel lathers up nicely and washes off nicely too.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that after using it, my skin is no longer dry but is actually slightly oily. I do not have severe dry skin so perhaps this product is meant for people who have more of a problem with dryness. The oiliness is short-term, though, and after skipping a day my skin returns to normal.<br /><br />This is a nice product for men with dry skin. It smells nice and it leave you feeling clean. If you struggle with severe dry skin this product will please you. If, like me, you have slightly dry skin you may feel a little oily afterward - keep this in mind when shopping for bath products.

review/summary: Smells Good, Gets Me Clean
review/text: I've used many different body washes over the years and this one is one of the more masculine smelling ones when you compare it to the normal brands of body wash, so that is nice if you would prefer not to smell like roses or peaches.  It has a good lather without being too overly soapy and rinses off without any soapy residue after feel.  The flip top cap is nice and easy to use and I like how it is stored with the cap down so you don't have to shake it to get it out like you do with ones with the cap on the top.  So it an overall good body wash with a well designed bottle.

review/text: I really liked this product.  First of all the size is much bigger than most body washes I have purchased.  I really liked that the cap was on the bottom and flat, it makes it easy to store, and reduces product waste.  The smell is a nice musk, and not strong at all, very pleasant.  The scrubbing particles are smaller than most body washes I have used, but still too big to be very useful.  To exfoliate well, they really need to be about the size of sand.  The product does clean well, and is very pleasant.

review/summary: Hubby hates it - I love it!
review/text: My husband complained that this left a film on his skin, so I tried it to see what he meant.<br /><br />I love it.  It has a pleasant, masculine scent, nothing like those teenager-targeted body sprays. It's not so overpoweringly manly that I can't use it, but it's definitely not a girly scent. It leaves my skin feeling nice, not stripped like most soaps.  I tried to explain to my husband that he was getting clean and putting light moisturizer on at the same time, but he refused to try it again, which is his loss.  It has a nice texture and make a good lather and won't leave your skin feeling dried-out.

review/summary: A great product!
review/text: Dove has a long history of making quality bath products.  This one is no exception.  Dove has expanded its line of products to include some men's products.  This body wash has a nice scent.  It is a masculine scent without being too overwhelimg.  It smells clean yet manly.  One of the advantages of this product is its moisture level.  Most bar soaps just aren't moisturizing and leave the skin feeling scaly, but this product leaves skin feeling moisturized.  This is a body wash and facial cleanser in one so it is two products in one.  It does contain some exfoliate type beads that are different for a men's body wash.  You may want to consider it that before purchasing it.  Overall, it is a good value and a great product!

review/text: This from the Man in my life:<br />Dove's Bath Gel for Men, their recent entry into the growing male skin care market, is a sure winner. The aqua-colored gel instantly turns into a rich, foamy lather when it hits the washcloth. The scent is mild and refreshing like good soap and the feel on the skin is gentle and soothing. I actually looked forward to showering with this stuff: it's a great way to start the day or to cool down after an intense workout. Highly recommended

review/summary: Lasting Fresh Neutral Scent-I am a believer!
review/text: I am not a big gel wash guy preferring the more tactile soap bar, but this wash has converted me!  Why?  Due to the small deep cleaning microbeads, the wash has the feel of really getting in to your pores and washing you clean.  I would say the best thing about the product though is the scent, which has a neutral fresh scent that is lasting on your face.  I actually wash my hands with this product as well because I love the fresh smell-that stays around for awhile.  Never fear-it is not feminine at all, but for ladies it is not too manly either as my wife uses it as well.  As a bonus, the gel is highly concentrated so a little dab will do it!

review/summary: Just for Men? not really..
review/text: Yes I know this says Dove for Men and I'm a girl but you know, it was in the shower so I was like, what the heck, soap's soap right? Also seeing as how my husband will use my girly body washes, I felt no guilt in using his. Well in all basic necessities, it did it's job, I got clean and smelled nice.  The smells not too overpowering nor did I smell like a dude unlike some other body washes who shall not be named.  Maybe guys aren't used to the "grains" to exfoliate but I liked them.  For a quick rinse shower, I could see how they could be a bother when you're trying to get in/out really fast and frantically trying to brush it off. But if you're taking your time in the shower, scrubbing with the beads was quite nice.  Husband likes it as well.  He really likes how there are now MEN lines in body washes and shampoos.  It's about time that companies realize that guys DO care about how they look and will take care of themselves.  Overall we enjoyed the product. It may say MEN but it can be totally unisex in a pinch.

review/summary: Felt clean after using it!
review/text: I was reading in "Men's Health" that washing with an exfoliating scrub can help with clogged pores that cause tiny blackheads and when your face gets dry and little bits of skin flake off.  The article recommended creamy soaps that are formulated with finely ground nuts and nutshells or other granules that slough off dirt and dead skin.  Dove Men + Care Deep Clean Body and Face Wash fits that category and I generally liked using the product.<br /><br />It's advertised as a deep cleansing gel that rinses off easily with purifying grains.  In use, I found it to be a gel that lathers up and did rinse off easily.  There are little "grains" in it, and I felt "clean" after using it.  The article I read did warn not to scrub too hard, or you'll irritate your skin.  I didn't have a problem with this and I used the wash on body and face.<br /><br />My main goal is to get clean, and it worked for that.  I'm not that concerned with scent, but I don't particularly want to smell flowery, so I'd rather use a product aimed at men.  I'd also prefer not to have my skin dry out, so I liked that this wash contained moisturizing elements.<br /><br />I also like shower gels and washes that come in ease tubes rather than messy bar soap that I used for so many years.  These are just more convenient and less messy.  Bottom line:  I felt clean after using it, my skin felt good, and it's easy to use.  It's a product I'll use.

review/summary: Effective and Pleasant Product
review/text: I don't usually pay much attention to things like body wash or soap, mostly just taking them for granted as about equally effective and as about as important as the background music in an elevator.  It's nice that it is there but I don't really notice that it's there so much as I (and others) notice that it is not.<br /><br />So, I wasn't too excited about what the possibilities for this product were so much as just seeing if it would work as well as the assortment of soaps and body washes I've used before.  When I received the product I noted that the bottle wasn't particularly fancy but somewhat similar to other brand name body wash or shampoo bottles.  So that lead me to believe that this product wasn't so much about the hype as hopefully just being a quality product that does what it says.<br /><br />In terms of what it claims for itself these are my observations and experiences:<br /><br />1.  Claim: It fights dryness -  Reality:  I found this to be true.  I don't pay too much attention to my skin but I know that when I use a soap that is harsh that it strips the oils from my skin and particularly if the air is dry and hot, that I will be uncomfortable an itchy.  I felt clean after using this product and I noted that I felt as if I had followed up with a skin lotion.  It wasn't overwhelming.  It was comfortable.  To my observation it does what it claims in this regard.<br /><br />2.  Claim:  Micromoisture Technology - Activation during lather to protect skin and keep it comfortable - Reality:  I don't really buy into this obviously marketing based type of appeal.  This is just attempting to put sizzle to the steak.  It's really just the same thing as the claim to fight dryness.  There are obviously common ingredients to this product as what you would find in a skin lotion.  So it's replacing some of the natural skin moisture with an oil based element that bonds to the skin despite the water of the bath or shower.<br /><br />3.  Claim: Rinses Clean  Reality:  I felt clean after using the product.  The water on my body beaded.  That's no doubt another result of the oil based moisturizer/lubricant it left on my body.  Also of note, was that the product is heavily fragranced and perfumed.  That also gives the illusion of cleanness and "freshness."  It wasn't unpleasant and no doubt I was clean.  If you have any strong aversions however to oils and fragrances, even ones less floral and more masculine, then this is not the product for you.<br /><br />The promotional material for this product notes that it is intended to be used with a special shower tool.  I did not have that to use so I can't comment upon it.  Just using it a normal body wash however, I found it to meet expectations, to leave my body clean but very fragranced (my wife noticed it and wasn't particularly thrilled with that element of it).  It isn't harsh.  It does leave a moisturizing layer of lotion like oils following the rinse and overall I can't fault it in terms of meeting basic expectations.<br /><br />It's not, however, something that I will purpose to buy or to continue using.<br /><br />3 stars.<br /><br />bart breen

review/summary: May Deep Clean but NO Odor Preventative Ingredients
review/text: I ordered this for my husband because I didn't like him using our Zest Deodorant bar soap on his face - thought he could use for a body wash as well. He tried it out but found he had body odor soon after washing.  He tried using his regular bar soap for his under arms after he washed with the liquid soap but had the same results - it must leave a barrier so that any subsequent soap can't be used.  He did use the Dove Men + Care Deep Clean Body Wash to wash his face ONLY* and went back to our Zest Soap (aqua or orange one) for his body.  And, no, he normally does not use underarm deodorant unless we are going somewhere special because he doesn't need it.<br /><br />*Update (11/17/11) My husband no longer uses this at all - he didn't use it after the first week.

review/summary: Find me a dirty boy ... on a horse ... for men
review/text: I enjoyed the chance to try "Dove Men", in part because I didn't know that real men weren't allowed to use regular Dove products.  Looking back, I believe my grandparents had Dove soap at their house ... it's amazing I escaped my childhood visits there with even a shred of manliness intact.  (Remove tongue from cheek).  Ok, can you tell I'm a little skeptical when brands feel the need to develop a "for men" or "for women" offering?  Especially when they feel the need to pour millions of dollars into trying to convince people to buy it: usually a clear sign that they are trying desperately to differentiate what is at heart a commoditized product.<br /><br />I think this product has a nice fragrance--if a little strong--although I will agree with another review that it almost seemed too calculated: this smells like the consensus of what a hundred focus groups decided "manly" should smell like.  I felt no more and no less clean than from using other soaps or body washes, so if the "micromoisture technology" was at work, I didn't really notice it.  But perhaps that's because I didn't use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TSA90C">Dove Men Shower Tool</a>, which is apparently a loofah but much more manly because it includes the word "tool".  Men like tools.<br /><br />I personally did not really notice or mind the "cleansing grains", but from reading other reviews they appeared to bother a good number of people.  So, note that there are versions of this product without these cleansing grains, if you have sensitive skin but want to try this product.<br /><br />So at the end of the day, it's a body wash, no more and no less.  It doesn't matter if you add the phrase "for men", try to convince people that they are a "dirty boy", or that they should smell like a man and not a lady (Old Spice has definitely won the advertising wars, haven't they?).  These products will all get you clean, and they keep the Madison Avenue advertisers in business.  I enjoyed the product ... but once it's gone, I'll probably go back to my good old bar of soap.  But not Dove soap, of course ... I want to smell like a man, not like a lady.  I'm on a horse.

review/text: Does it fight dryness? Yes<br /><br />Does it later up well? Yes<br /><br />Does it rinse off easily and completely? Yes<br /><br />Can you use it every day? Yes<br /><br />Can you use it MORE than once a day? Yes<br /><br />Is the scent `girly' or overpowering? No.<br /><br />How does it compare to other body washes? It' better, in my opinion, but I have by no means tried them all.<br /><br />I do still prefer a separate product for my face and neck, though, due to some oily skin closer to my hair. It really is good that I can get really clean after doing some heavy / hard exertion and scrub everything well without drying out my skin. The best process I have found for using shower gels is to get yourself and the applicator wet, turn off the water, work the product into a lather and scrub yourself, then rinse it all off. I also like to use the product on my feet using a brush like this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002NC1L">Rubbermaid Dish Brush</a> . It does seem a little more slippery on the soles of my feet until I can wash it off well.<br /><br />This is a good product. I will probably keep buying it after the sample is gone.

review/summary: Lonesome Dove
review/text: By time people read the reviews of this product, it will be lonesome.  Naive me (my husband) just started using the product without reading the label.<br /><br />My first shower was as advertised. Didn't feel any soap residue on my skin and I thought it had a nice fragrance left on my skin which lasted for about an hour.<br /><br />After about 3 showers my skin started to itch again. I nominally use a body wash that has no fragrance. I can usually get away without putting lotion on my body for about 4 showers, but not so with the Dove. I had to put on lotion after every shower.<br /><br />I'm back to using the other bodywash. So far I haven't had to put lotion on after 3 showers.  I haven't researched my regular bodywash, but I know I'm not itching a few hours after a shower.<br /><br />Dove has been around for awhile, so I have to believe people like it.  Just doesn't work for me, and the ingredients are little concerning.  Don't they make just soap anymore?

review/summary: Feels Really Clean
review/text: What I enjoy most about this body wash is:<br /><br />Clean and feels good.<br /><br />The body wash has this nice texture, and feels very high end.  I also enjoy the very large size.<br /><br />Things I don't personally enjoy:<br /><br />The fragrance, to each their own, but this doesn't smell that good.  It's not stopping me from using it right now, but I'd prefer either something with no scent, or a more pleasing one.<br /><br />I'll agree, as another reviewer wrote AXE does smell better, as does Old Spice.<br /><br />Give me some more flavors and I may switch to you Dove, but for now I'm still "stuck on" Old Spice.  (And hoping they come up with their new Fresh line in a bodywash!  (that stuff smells AMAZING!))

review/summary: Clean, crisp, refreshing
review/text: I like this clear gel-like product so much more than the cream-textured equivalents made by Dove and other body wash makers. It foams just as well, it moisturizes just as well, smells less cloying than most and, best of all, rinses cleanly. The scent is crisp and pleasant but with no undertones (fruit, floral, or citric) that I can identify. You mostly smell it while showering, because it doesn't linger on your skin later to compete with deodorants or other products.<br /><br />But, what made my rating go from a 4 to a 5 star is that I found it less slippery in the shower than previous products I had tried. (I recently almost slipped in the shower while using a Johnson and Johnson body wash that left my acrylic shower mat a little greasy.) Those of us who are in the age group in which we need moisturizing, are also in the age group in which we have to be very careful to avoid falling. Using ordinary caution, this product rinses well off the body, and doesn't make the shower floor or surfaces any more slippery than ordinary soap.

And anyone who endures seasonal dry weather should look into this product as well.  I've sworn by Dove products ever since moving to the Denver area in the `70's, and I'm happy that my "manly man" can now enjoy these benefits as well.  This body soap has a mild, clean smell - no perfume-y overtones.  If you're a male and experience dry skin at times, this one is for you

review/summary: It's soap. Not particularly special soap.
review/text: I've been using liquid soap... excuse me... body wash... for a few years instead of bar soap, and I haven't really found a strong commitment to any particular brand. Dove hasn't really changed that.<br /><br />By and large, it's not unlike any other major brand you'll see out there. It has the kitschy microbeads that most of the Axe varieties have, with a relatively strong scent that's somewhere between "designed by Old Spice" and "this is what a focus group of women at Dove think that men want or should have".<br /><br />On the plus side, the scent goes away relatively fast, so it doesn't interfere (or compete, in Old Spice's case) with your cologne or aftershave.<br /><br />It lathered pretty well in hard water, and left me feeling clean. If you don't like the gel-type body wash brands (Axe, Neutrogena, etc.) and don't mind smelling like someone cracked open a bottle of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C1VWJU">Brut</a> for a few minutes, you'd probably like this.<br /><br />Me? I kind of like gel more, and would prefer this unscented, or with a much lighter scent.

review/summary: Just Average
review/text: This body wash has a nice masculine scent.  The tiny abrasive beads are nice, and not nearly as "rough" as a lot of other microbeads I have felt.  Unfortunately, they are still too rough (and the scent probably too strong) to be used on the face.<br /><br />To get the full effect, I even purchased the oddly-shaped <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TSA90C">Dove Men + Care Active Clean Shower Tool, 1-Unit Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that Dove markets alongside the body wash.<br /><br />I don't think we'll stick with this body wash, as it doesn't seem to provide anything special in comparison to the existing favorite.

review/text: First of all, I'm not a dude. But I am the wife of a dude.<br />And as the wife of a dude, I like my personal dude to smell fantastic.<br />But not cologne-y, and not like a bottle of knock-off drakar noir exploded in his midst.<br /><br />AND because I am demanding. I like his skin to feel soft and smooth.<br /><br />Dove Men + Care definitely left his skin soft and smooth- for that I would give it maybe 3 or 4 stars... My husband uses regular bar Dove quite a bit, and if anything this seemed to rinse "cleaner"...<br /><br />The fragrance though... I give that a 1 (by the way, I love the fragrance of regular Dove).<br />It's an odd match for a dude...  It's more than a hint of perfumey fabric softener, fairly chemical-y.  As far as comfort goes- the fragrance was so strong that it was not comforting in the least, but I have a very sensitive nose and sensitive skin and with the combination of the two I ordered my beloved back into the shower to hose himself off with plain ol' awesome Dove bar....<br /><br />Perfection! And now he smells clean and that is sexy.

review/summary: Does what it says it does
review/text: The beads provide a nice tingly texture to the lather and it has a nice smell, which isn't too overpowering. I don't care for it as a face wash, but for a body wash it does what it advertises. The smell isn't too feminine or overpowering, it lathers up well, and does a good job of cleaning without leaving a residue or film. Four stars because it doesn't work for us well as a face wash, but does a good job of cleaning other bits.

review/summary: Smell not unlike the man your man could smell like
review/text: I understand that "body washes" are all the thing these days, especially among younger and more active types, and one of the most pleasant things about this product is that the refreshing scent is also mild, and doesn't make you smell like a hormonal teen who doused himself in Axe body spray. I've used Dove soaps and shampoos for a long time, so making the move to a Dove body wash wasn't that big of a risk. This is a nice cleaning and mildly exfoliating gel sort of thing, that notably does not leave feelings of either dryness or residual soap film. On the whole, I wouldn't have expected myself to become a believer in the utility of a body wash. But if anyone could convince me to give it a try, Dove would be it. And I think it's worked.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: This body wash lathers extremely well and has sort of a moisturizing feeling.  What I mean is that I don't feel as dry when I get out as I do with my Old Spice.  It also has these little granules (pebbles, scrubbies, whatever you call 'em) mixed in to if makes you feel like you're really scrubbing yourself clean (but it doesn't hurt)!  However, in reality I don't think it gets me any cleaner than any other body wash (but it does lather up thicker, which I like).  I usually use Old Spice hair and body wash, and I will continue to do so for these main reasons:<br /><br />1. Hair AND Body wash - This dove product is not intended to be used in hair.  Therefore i use it when I have to apply head and shoulders a couple times a week.<br />2. This Dove stuff smells very girly.  My wife likes the smell better than the Old Spice, but I don't.  So I guess if you're a single man and want to pick up chicks, this will work better.  However, if you're married and don't care what your wife thinks (she's going to think you stink 99% of the time anyway), then stick to what you like.<br /><br />Overall, a good product.  I just prefer my Old Spice, because I want to smell like the man on the commercial.  You know, the one on a horse!

I always heard people saying that it's not good to switch their foods.<br />When my husband did try to buy another brand at a local grocery store,our pup did NOT want to eat it.

review/summary: Winnie The Pooh's Honey
review/text: Winnie The Pooh was forever getting his head stuck in beehives and that sort of thing, and I imagine it must have been because the hives were filled with Greek Thyme Honey! Honey is incredibly varied in its flavors, and for those of you having grown up on Sue Bee Clover Honey, well you have had the blandest, most generic tasting honey ever made. Little wonder most people will opt for sugar packets over that sticky mess unless they are real health nuts.<br /><br />In the rest of the world, honey is a fabulous flavorful treat which varies from fragile, waxy delicate flavors (like Acacia Honey) to the pungent leather and iron tang of African forest honey. When I was in Greece, I greatly enjoyed waking up in the lazy island sunlight with a strong cup of coffee and a simple breakfast of fresh yogurt and honey. There is simply no finer honey on earth that the wild thyme honey from the island of Naxos. Unfortunately, you are unlikely to find that unless you go there. The next best thing is ApiPharm's Greek Thyme & Wildflower honey, which comes from the Aegean Islands (where incidentally Naxos is located).<br /><br />The flavor of this honey is wonderful. It is intensely concentrated and super sweet, while at the same time expressing a wonderful explosion of floral aromas and the minty herbal flavor of thyme on the tongue. The flavors and aromas are so complex, I guarantee you will have to taste this more than once to fully appreciate it!<br /><br />It differs from the thyme honey found in Crete, which has the same sweetness, but lacks the concentrated balance of flavors and ultimately seems a bit bland by comparison. Monastiri honey of Crete is very close in its flavor, and it will give you 90% of the experience at half the price, so you might want to consider that as an alternative for the budget-conscious. The other thyme honeys of the world really are a bit overwhelmed by the terroir -- which is to say you taste more of the New Zealand origin that the thyme in New Zealand thyme honey for example. That's not at all the case for Greek Honey, where each variety is remarkably distinct from each other. If you are a bit of a honey aficionado, ApiPharm makes a six-jar gift set with a nice variety that is fun to try, each quite meorable in their own way. After you taste them, you start thinking of when you would use THIS honey or when you would use THAT honey, rather than honey in general; so it's a bit of a slippery slope as you may soon find that you need to have several jars of different honeys around for different purposes.<br /><br />To avoid the confusion, perhaps it is best to simply start with the best, the Greek Thyme Honey, which may help you resist the urge to try the others...

It can make a quick weeknight meal look like a gourmet endeavor.<br /><br />I agree with the others here that it will keep in the fridge for a long time, but it does dry out.  when I get this large size, I will portion it out in tablespoon dollops, freeze them on a cookie sheet, then bag them in the freezer.

review/summary: My favorite of More Than Gourmet's three chicken reductions
review/text: I have been using More Than Gourmet's glaces and stock reductions for about 10 years.  I have purchased just about all of them and have at least 6 different stocks in my pantry or refrigerator at any one time.  I have often given a selection of the 1.5 oz. pucks to foodie friends of mine.  One of the things that the often ask is, what is the difference between the three chicken based products, so I thought that I would include that information in this review:<br /><br />*  Glace de Poulet Gold is a 20-time reduction of classic chicken stock. In other words, each ounce of Glace de Poulet Gold yields 20 ounce of chicken stock. Glace de Poulet is made with roasted bones and requires more than 24 hours of reduction to achieve its deep, rich, roasted color and syrupy consistency.<br /><br />*  Jus de Poulet Li&eacute; Gold is a chicken based glace that includes a roux for thickening sauces.  It allows you to make classical, lighter colored chicken based sauces without the added time and effort typically required to bind a roux into the finished sauce.<br /><br />*  Fond de Poulet, a 40 to 1 reduction of classic white chicken stock. Just 1 ounce yields 5 cups of chicken stock.<br /><br />Since the Jus de Poulet Li&eacute; Gold contains a thickening agent (roux) like the beef based <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010OQQ2Q">Demi-glace Gold</a> it allows the home cook to easily make classic sauces such as Sauce Provencale and Madeira Sauce or to experiment by adding other gourmet products and create their own unique sauces.<br /><br />This is not necessarily the product that you would add to a soup as it would thicken it more than most people would want.  However, if you are looking for a light colored chicken based glace to help you to create that special sauce quickly and easily this is the product for you.<br /><br />*  Note: Some of the above descriptions of the stocks were borrowed from More Than Gourmet's website.

review/text: The Thanksgiving gravy was better for it as have been a lot of other dishes recently.  It adds a richness of flavor without the salty flavor of boxed broths.  A couple teaspoons of this and a bit of water turns any sauteed vegetables into vegetables in gravy.  It was the bomb in a pork, roasted red pepper and potato hash.  Although it seems expensive, calculating having this concentrate on hand versus boxed broths means this comes out ahead economically.  The flavor is worlds better, it takes up less fridge space, and it's less salty.  I also have the beef version.<br /><br />Having read up on the various brands, the More than Gourmet seems to have the least salt per serving, much less than "chicken base," for example.

I use the veal stock, the chicken stock, and the demi glace religiously, and it is so easy to make great sauces with them.  I add a spoonful of stock or demi glace even to things which don't normally call for them such as marinara, soups, turkey stuffing, which gives the foods an extra degree of richness.<br /><br />If you try this product line, you will be more than pleased with the result.

Voila, a nice dinner with in minutes. I keep the chicken and the beef demi on hand all the time now.

review/text: The manufacturer describes this better than I can. I've been using their products for years with fantastic results. It lasts for years in the refrigerator -- but it does get tough -- so use it within 6 months if possible. One quart of reconstituted stock contains the 840mg of sodium (36% of DV) which is the most sodium from More Than Gourmet's chicken products.  Even so, this is less sodium than most low-sodium canned chicken broths.<br /><br />For the first time ever, a true classic chicken stock bound with starch for sauce preparations is available for your kitchen. Jus de Poulet Li&eacute; Gold� is a complement to the award winning Glace de Poulet Gold�. Jus de Poulet Li&eacute; Gold� allows you to make all the classic, lighter colored, chicken-based sauces without the added time and effort typically required to bind a roux into the finished sauce. It also has a more dominant chicken flavor and blonde color. Now you can make all the classics quickly and easily. It is also great for enhancing soups and binding a variety of fresh vegetable sauces.

review/summary: 3.5 Stars
review/text: At the risk of exasperating the professed connoisseurs I must now review this product. Bought More Than Gourmet Jus De Poulet Lie Gold Roasted Chicken Demi-glace, 16-Ounce Packages plus 3 other ones for the nice hefty amount of $75.00 and some cents. What attracted me was the reduction ratio attributed to the preparation of this demi-glaze. My logic was sound when I said to myself: With this concentrated flavor at my hands I can create the most delightful culinary endeavors known to mankind, for if I have learned any thing as a wannabee is that taste and flavor is 90% of the work.<br />As this product stated it is supposed to be roasted chicken (french connotations and all) brought to the 20th degree in flavor. So the very first thing I did was to boil some clean water and add the substance to the liquid. The product had the texture of rubber soft enough to take chunks of it and use in the water.  This thrilled me at first because I deducted the amount of times it must have been reduced to reach this solid state, way past gelatin or perhaps a hard type of gelatin. I smelled it and could not really tell it was a chicken product. So in the boiling water it went and after proper stirring it dissolved completely. I served  what I would call a consomme to my partner in crime (in this try out) and one to moi.<br />This is the results and the reason I am allocating 3.5 Stars to the otherwise 5 Star reviews: After consuming a hot cup of chicken flavored broth I asked my lovely counterpart how did she like it? She said she liked it a lot, that it was so low in sodium that we both had to add a touch of sea salt and peppercorns. The thing is it did not taste in a significant way like chicken. She said it could have also been beef? I was desperately trying to find the chicken taste, the one one would get if you boil a whole chicken with a proper mirepoix, also the one you obviously get from the much cheaper and I am sure not pure powder Knorr's Chicken Broth or even the sodium based cubes. The point being that I did not taste chicken. Or smelled chicken while making it. So I ask: what is the use of using a chicken based demi glaze or broth or liquid if it does not taste or smell like it. I have used the Minor's Chicken and Turkey Base, that one fellow reviewer of these products line had belittle in comparison to this supposedly great product, and Minor's taste, smell and all around convey the chicken or turkey taste, respectively. So maybe is so purified that the whole chicken impact has evaporated?<br />That would be something If I did my favorite rotisserie chicken or baked a whole chicken and later added some white wine to the drippings and when I took the first bite no taste of chicken could be found. That, in a nutshell, is why in my personal opinion this product did not deliver. I expected an explosion of flavor once the thing dissolved but even though it was a fine cup of broth it did not identified itself well at all. 3.5 and I can not wait to try the other three and if they are similar to this one then Minor's still delivers a more honest, easy to discern taste . Or Savory Choice Liquid for that matter.<br />PS: Must admit that regardless whether this product tasted like chicken (which it does not) it still works on a gravy situation. I did a roast and used red wine and mostly this product and by the end of the day, after slow cooking the roast for several hours, I had the most appealing broth or gravy that went very well with everything else. The texture remains very solid, almost like rubber, but with a sharp utensil it is a matter of digging in and pulling a chunk and have to make sure it is totally dissolved for if not is almost like glue. Perhaps a nice 4 Stars instead?

It's hard to find nuts that aren't roasted to death and salted beyond the ability of your body to regulate a healthy blood pressure but these are ones that can do it for you.  Just be sure to freeze the ones you aren't going to eat right away because they start getting rancid if you don't.  I gave them only 4 stars because the shipping is kind of expensive.

review/summary: My very picky Yorkies love it!
review/text: I have 2 male Yorkies, 2 yrs. and 7 mos.  They are both VERY picky eaters.  They would prefer to eat people food.  I have finally convinced my husband and mother they are better with just pet food (although I still catch Grandma slipping them crackers occassionally!)  I found that they would rather go days without food than eat dry, very good high quality dry food I might add.  Finally I ordered this canned food and I add a small spoonful to their dish with the dry food and mix it all together.  Wow, they wolf it down and lick the dish.  I also had a problem with them getting up 3 or 4 times in the night and picking at their food.  Now they eat AM and PM and sleep better in the night.  The food is gooey and soft when I open the can (great for mixing) but after sitting in the refrig. awhile it gets stiffer.  I use a spoon I run under hot water and add a drop of hot water and it melts the fat and makes it much more mixable.  All I can say is that my dogs love it.  Do they still beg?  Yes, but that will only end when my mother quits sneaking them  bites!

review/text: This canned dog food is organically raised human-quality beef, no grain. The "Newman's Own" company contributes all profits to charities. For my 40 pound, 12 month old Aussie, I feed a combination of Orijen grain-free dry food and Newman's Own grain-free canned food for a total of approximately 900 calories per day. The canned food part of that is 1/2 can per day. The food smells good (no, I haven't tasted it, but it does smell good) and my dog LOVES it. I did extensive research before choosing this combination. If you want to do some research of your own, a good place to start is at "consumersearch.com", where you can choose "Family and Pets" and then "Dog Food".

I just bought this tea at Wal-mart for 98 cents; plus tax comes to only $1.05.  The six-box rate here comes out to $1.60 per box, not counting sales tax.

About 20% less seems to yield 20% more volume.<br /><br />Second, the popcorn is a bright, pure white in color.  It just plain looks delicious.<br /><br />Third, it isn't chewy at all.  I don't think I've ever eaten more perfect popcorn.  Just exactly the right texture and flavor.<br /><br />Finally, there were almost no unpopped kernels.

review/summary: Ok Popping Corn not the BEST
review/text: This is Ok (not GREAT PopCorn) when it first arrived it popped great. We vacuumed sealed all the bags that we were not going to use. After a few Month's we had to open another bag,to our surprise only half of the  popped,did a little research and everything pointed to no or very little moisture left in the corn, we added 1 table spoon of water it helped but I think we should have added more water (WHAT A PAIN). I think this Popping Corn was old when it was shipped will not order it again unless they can guarantee the  freshness of the Popping corn!!

review/summary: My order was contaminated...you've been warned!
review/text: I am the owner of the WhirleyPop popper and like it very much. I purchased this product to use with my popper. This order came with 6 bags of popcorn, packaged very securely with no signs of opening or damage.  I did notice that each bag was secured with a hand twist tie rather than a manufactured seal but that in itself did not alarm me. However, when I opened the first bag and poured into a measuring cup, I noticed something irregularly rounded, black and hard go into the my cup. I prayed that it was a darkened kernel...but clearly it was not. When I fished this out (with my bare hand, yuck!)it appeared obvious to me that this was a rodent dropping.  I could be wrong, but I doubt it. It was definitely not a popcorn kernal.<br /><br />I suppose if I had opened any other bag in this shipment the chances of this happening would be small, but I did see it and thus am tossing out the entire order.  It was a totally disgusting experience and a total waste of twenty-two dollars (Subscribe and Save price). With all of the news of contaminated products these days it is disheartening to purchase "gourmet" popcorn and have something like this happen. You've been warned!

review/summary: Yummy, mummy, Yummy
review/text: Four dogs.  They were hard pressed to keep these away from the cats.  Had to break one up for the cats so the dogs could eat theirs. These are hard chews and I had to use a hammer to break it up for the cats.<br /><br />Larger dogs will go through these pretty fast, but they are worth the pleasure I know they had munching on them. My smaller guys chewed 5-10 minutes.<br /><br />For a long chew, the Tendons are one of the best, but I will order these again since all my fuzzy friends flipped over them...<br /><br />That should say it all.<br /><br />Company shipped promptly and product arrived in perfect condition.  Pumpers individually shrink wrapped.

review/summary: My dog LOVES these...Just wish I could find them at the local pet shop!
review/text: I have a picky rottweiler mix who, despite her rottie heritage, really isn't a tough chewer. She won't even carry something in her mouth if it's "too heavy" and she won't chow down on something if it's too tough. I bought one of these at a local pet store just to see if she would eat it, and I was totally shocked when she wolfed it down. I have drawers full of various bones and treats that I end up having to donate to charity so I had pretty much given up on trying new things, but I'm glad I found these!<br /><br />I can't find them anymore at the local store so I'm left ordering them on Amazon..started giving them to her after dinner and now that's all she wants! They don't seem to stain but they do break up into a lot of pieces, and she's not very "drooly" - maybe it would stain the carpet if she was.<br /><br />Also, these can be eaten pretty fast. They're more like pork ears than a rawhide or bone, they break up pretty fast once the dog starts eating them. All in all, though, I love giving them to her and I LOVE Jones Natural chews. We've tried a bunch of their bones and love them all! (well, most of them - she's picky!) They also have good guides as to what kind of bone to buy for your dog based on their chewing preference and size.

review/text: I really like the Byron Bay brand.  These are great cookies and showed up in good shape (my second order of the Byron Bay Lemon Macadamia cookies showed up in PURE crumbs.)  I highly recommend the Fig and Pecan variety; interesting taste; fairly dense texture.  Hard to put down!

review/text: This stuff works juts like any other energy drink, but the biggest selling point for this product is the price. The ammount of product you get for the price is great! If you were to buy the same ammount of 5 Hour Energy you would spend a small fortune compared to this price.

review/summary: Affordable
review/text: Hey, I really like this stuff for several reasons.  First it is affordable. It's like a dollar per energy drink equivilant.  I used to drink Redbull / Monster like they were going out of style.  Then I realized, wow it's getting expensive. So I searched for some concentrated stuff and found RavenShot.  It's a fantastic idea, I just mix it with watever I'm drinking at the moment and presto, cheap long-lasting energy.  I swear the energy lasts forever, and the crash isn't bad at all. Seriously, I am really impressed and recommend this Mixer for anybody wanting to save a buck.

review/summary: Great product for keeping me awake through my graveyard work shift
review/text: I work fulltime at night doing 12-hour graveyard work shifts and I decided to give RavenShot a try to help keep me awake and alert during my entire shift.  I was amazed at how much I liked the this stuff and how amped up and energized I get after drinking a shot!  I decided to try mixing it in with my regular beverages and it works great and tastes fantastic with my Mtn Dew Code Orange and regular Mtn Dew as well as regular orange juice.<br /><br />Great product and I'll def be picking up a couple more bottles asap!

review/summary: I like the taste
review/text: I was making a trip from San Francisco to Salt Lake city a total of 12 hours on the road, and I left at 11:00 PM at night. I had a bottle of this and some gatorade to mix it with and after several periodic hits I made it all through the night alert and awake, I had a great time listening to music and whenever I started fading I would just take a shot of this and chase it with some gatorade. The taste is mild and lemony, not to strong, With a whole bottle I could gauge how much I needed depending on how tired I was. It does make you need to urinate a lot if you drink that much. In general this was one bottle that did it all for me. Great Product.

review/text: I love energy drinks. I've had over 40 different kinds. This is the first time I have seen a mixer energy drink that didn't have some nasty over powering taste. I used this at a party I threw and was able to spike drinks with energy. It was also great for my guests that didn't want to drink.

review/summary: Excellent Asian Formulation of Milo
review/text: This product is made in Malaysia and is the same exact product you would buy in most Southeast Asian countries. The taste is the same as the Milo made in Singapore. The powder is very fine in composition and is approximately the color of milk chocolate before mixing. If you are looking for the South African or South American Milo, this is NOT for you as the taste is quite different and the powder looks very different.

review/summary: Exactly what I wanted!
review/text: I have been looking for a stock of Milo from Asian stores, particularly Filipino stores online and off. I can only buy these kinds when I go to Milwaukee or California or Las Vegas because Filipino stores there are flooding. Being based here in Central WI doesn't help at all, however, Amazon makes it possible for me to continue drinking the ever so yummy Nestle Milo. Having seen this at Amazon makes me feel so ecstatic. Will regularly purchase it here. I can only hope that they won't get out of stock. Lol. Perfect product-- exactly what I want at a price appropriately reduced! Thank you Amazon! Please don't get out of stock for me! LOL

review/text: This Milo product is popular throughout the world, as I purchased it for my wife who is from the Philippines and used to drinking Milo there.<br /><br />She loves the taste of it and wanted the same here in the USA.<br /><br />This seller's 2 pack 3.3 pound cans was at a fantastic price for the quantity, and one of the best prices I have seen in my research of the Milo product.<br /><br />I will certainly buy again from this seller, as my experience has been nothing but positive, and my wife smiles before, during, and after every cup of Milo she has.

review/summary: Good product but price could be better
review/text: My husband got our family hooked on this. He was born in Nigeria and says that they drank this a lot when growing up. The drink is a good mixture of malt and chocolate and not too sweet. It's best when mixed with half milk and half water although my kids like it mixed with half and half and water. We were excited to find that they sold on Amazon in bulk and thought it was good price considering free shipping. The product came and we used it up within the month. We decided to see if we could find this online for a better price and did not. We did however find that at the local Asian supermarket the unit sold for 12.99 a case so we will be purchasing them from there in the future. However, if you don't conveniently live near an Asian market that carries this, this is the best deal out there. If you haven't tried this before, I'd recommended getting the smaller cases before ordering this.

review/text: This milo comes somewhere from the east and is very different from the south african milo so i was sorely disappointed and now have 2 HUGE tins of the stuff. This milo is very fine and not course and crunchy and you cannot read the nutritional information because it is in a foreign language. I am surprised it can even be sold in USA without english nutritional information.
