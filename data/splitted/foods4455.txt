review/summary: Choking hazard
review/text: Seemed like a great idea, and my dog loved it, but when she began choking on the treat, I threw them away. She's a 40-lb lab and loves to chew on anything she can get. It only took her 5 minutes to figure out how to get the treat out of the ball. She's fine. I was able to immediately dislodge the treat from the back of her mouth, but the scare was enough to decide I wouldn't let her have them again. She does still enjoy playing with the ball.

review/summary: not so everlasting
review/text: my german shepherd went thru this in less than 20 mins. I was very disappointed. Everlasting must be a good tasting treat, or perhaps a smaller dog could make it last longer? who knows for sure.  So, although I personally didn't taste this, my german shepherd plowed thru in record time.

review/text: I have been using these for years to distract my dog when I leave the house and he loves it, it keeps him busy and gives him something to chew that I do not have to clean up when I get home (he eats every crumb).  I usually buy him the chicken and also the liver flavor, they seem to be his favorite and it keeps him busy for a long time.

review/summary: Not Round? But dogs seem to love them.
review/text: If you mistakenly think these are round, they are NOT. My wife put them in my cart, told me they were treat balls that we could leave in the yard for the pups to play with... or not, lol. The dogs do, at least, seem to enjoy them, one won't let me get within ten feet of him. I don't think I would trust leaving the treat holder around them, so I guess it's just not a treat for me to give my dogs in the future. But, again, to each their own.

review/summary: winner winner chicken dinner!
review/text: My dog LOVES these.  She loves to chew on things and this is the first toy that she has not destroyed within the first week.  We have had the ball that these treats insert into for over 2 months and it still is like new.  The chicken flavor appears to be her favorite so far.  They will last several days if we don't take the toy away, longer if we limit her exposure or rotate toys. She will lick and lick and chew and chew for hours.  Inserting the treats is a bit difficult but not too bad. We have not had any problems with her removing the treat as others have described, my guess is that they are not getting the treat set into the ball correctly.  This chew toy is a keeper!

review/summary: The Fifteen Minute lasting treat.
review/text: I got this for my Cairn terrier puppy when I first got him and I have to say, the idea is a good one but execution is poor. There are two basic problems with this toy.<br /><br />1) My dog just licks it until the treat gets smaller and then manages to pull it out and finish it. This takes maybe fifteen minutes at most.<br /><br />2) Even if he didn't do that, after about three uses the rubber became loose around the treat, so that now it basically just pops out by itself.<br /><br />So save your money and invest it in something more durable.

review/text: My 6 year old Shiba Inu loves these.  This is the only toy he won't destroy or devour completely in a matter of minutes.  He will basically drop whatever he's doing when he sees one of these treats come out of the package and cry until it goes into the everlasting treat ball.  He plays with it on and off for about a week before it's finally devoured.  It's really cost effective for us and we're happy knowing he won't break the treat ball and swallow non-food parts.

review/text: my dogs LOVE this treat. They also love the fact that they have to work to get it out but they get it out of the plastic cover in less than 10 Min!! I have three Jindo dogs and they are all about 55-60 lbs. I know they're smart but i just didn't think it would take them so quickly to figure out how to get this treat out. I will probably continue to buy it for them but I was a little disappointed that it didn't last longer.

review/summary: Delicious jerky!
review/text: I bought a few flavors of Buffalo Bills jerky based on positive reviews that I saw here on Amazon.  As a fan of spicy foods, I immediately chose the spicy jerky as one of the flavors to try.  It is very delicious and tender, with just the right amount of heat (not too mild and not so spicy that you feel like your tongue might melt either).  I highly recommend this jerky to anyone considering purchasing it, and can't wait to purchase some more myself soon!

review/summary: A Consistent Tasty Treat
review/text: We've been buying from Choo Choo Snacks(Buffalo Bills) for almost 2 years now.  No matter where I've been or what I'm doing, this is some tasty goodness.  It's moist, easy to chew, with peppers on the beef visible through the bag!  So far, I've tried all variations of the Country Cut.  Barbecue and Teriyaki are sweet and true to their flavors.  Honey Pepper is fairly sweet with that black pepper kick all over it.  Mild is exactly as it says, mild(it would be like Spicy with no spicy hehe).  Chipotle Habanero, though, is a whole different story.  It is VERY spicy and the burn will stay in your mouth for a while longer as expected so be careful.  Compared to buying Jack Link's for half the price(and almost half the flavor IMO), this is really good deal.

review/summary: Best jerky I've found
review/text: I can't speak for all of Buffalo Bill's jerky products, but the "Country Cut" jerky is simply wonderful.  My favorite flavor is the Spicy, which has an honest to goodness heat factor, enough to satisfy any "chilehead".  Apparently, the "country cut" jerky style signifies that it is moister than the rest of BB's offerings, and I'm all for that.  Moist, yes, with a marvelous mouthfeel, cut into succulent strips and hunks.  Another winner is the Honey Pepper flavor, which masterfully mates sweetness and heat in a winning combination.  Teriyaki is O.K., but it's never been a favorite of mine, so my opinion is biased in that arena.  I was buying World Kitchens jerky (at ten or so dollars a pound it's probably the best jerky bargain out there), but Buffalo Bill's is, in my opinion, far superior.  Just about double the price of World Kitchens (an eight ounce bag is about twelve dollars), but well worth it.  I would recommend only buying the large eight ounce bags (BB's also offers two smaller sizes), because, if you're like me, you'll munch through this stuff quick.

review/summary: I only see 3 stars tonight...
review/text: I found the reviews on here to be completely misleading.<br /><br />Let me put this simply...<br /><br />This jerky is mediocre at best. The meat is very moist and has a lot of flavor but is overly sweet and salty, almost as if they drenched this in syrup and soy sauce before cooking it. The name Spicy Country should be changed to Mild Country. The slices are too thick and look like boba straws. I also wouldn't recommend it if you prefer your jerky a little more chewier.<br /><br />Positive side: $15 for jerky might be steep but 8 oz is a lot and it's definitely worth the price.<br /><br />It's good jerky, but not the best.<br /><br />If you're looking for some good jerky. Try Jack Links Peppered. It's one of the best jerky's I've had and it's available at your local grocery store.<br /><br />If you're ever in Gilroy, CA, visit the Garlic Shoppe. BEST beef jerky I ever had. Its by the cashier in the clear box, get a bag and enjoy : )<br /><br />Cheers

The black does not work well on the hard candy melts.  i had to push hard and carve into the candy and the black would not show up (i was only making whiskers, and can not imagine writing letters).  Not sure how they work for other projects.  i was able to write on paper, not on food.

review/summary: Do not use for Cake Pops
review/text: I bought these to use on Cake pops also and they don't work. The color does not transfer on to candy melts at all. I don't recommend using them if you are doing Cake pops. Haven't tried on other items like cookies and such, but can't imagine how they would work on icing if they won't color on candy melt.

review/summary: Work GREAT on marshmallows
review/text: I bought a couple sets of these pens for my sons birthday party so the kids could decorate and doodle on some jumbo size marshmallows. They were a BIG hit! Just make sure you leave the marshmallows out for a few hours so the outsides are dry enough to write on, also if they're too soft the pen will likely tear it a bit.<br />Anyway these were awesome, I use them on cookies and sandwich bread, my son loves it. I would imagine that it wouldn't stick too well on chocolate because it tends to be melty-smooth, (if that makes any sense). Who knows. I've only tried it on dry textures and they've worked wonderfully.

review/summary: not as good as expected
review/text: I have used better dough relaxers than this.  The only way to have this work at all is to use considerably more than recommended, and even then you need to let your dough rest for several minutes in order for it not to "fight back". I was looking for something less expensive than the dough relaxer sold elsewhere.  I guess you get what you pay for !

review/summary: Strange taste
review/text: Really not what I expected. I think the asorbic acid in it over powers the dough taste; so you get a sour/acidic taste. Next time I will try to use alot less than the required amount according to the label direction (which says 1-2 teaspoon per loaf. A loaf size varies). However, I like how it relaxes the dough and allows it to be used easily.

review/text: It's hard to find a whey protein bar that doesn't come in a chocolate-nut flavor so I tried these.  Ten grams of protein, 5gr of fiber is a great meal or snack.  At first I thought it had an odd taste but the consistency is great so I kept eating them.  Now I really like them.  They fill you up for a bit over 100 calories and help you stay on your diet or get more protein in your day.  I always keep one in my purse or desk.  Much cheaper through Amazon than buying individually through a health food store- IF you can find them.  Low WW points too.

review/summary: Great for my picky eaters!
review/text: I have had all of my dogs on this formula for almost a year.<br /><br />I own a retail store and do a lot of research into what dog foods are best for your pet. I always take ingredients into account when considering a dog food for my dogs. When it comes right down to it, it doesn't matter how great the food if your pet will not eat it. I have also come to realize that every dog is different and what might be considered undesirable for one dog might actually be best for another.<br /><br />It took me a very long while to try the Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28 because of the corn gluten. My dogs were very picky eaters and basically grazers, eating only here and there. Once my dogs tried Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28, you would have thought I had fed them candy as they would consume all that I placed before them.<br /><br />I have 5 Yorkies and 2 poodles - this formula is not just for Yorkies. (I do not breed - they are simply my best little friends.)<br /><br />With the Yorkies, I no longer had to worry about whether they were getting enough to eat. As they stayed on this formula, I began to notice silkier coats and over all well-being not only in appearance but in energy. One of my Yorkies had a very thin coat, since being on this formula her coat has come in thicker and absolutely shines regardless of whether or not she needs a bath or a brushing.<br /><br />The 2 poodles are rescues. The oldest being around 20 years old. She will not eat anything but Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28. She is all bones with zero muscle tone due to ill treatment before she came to me, but I don't have to worry about trying to get her to eat on this formula. Before feeding this food it was hit or miss as to whether or not she would eat. She weighs 3.5 pounds so I worry about her a great deal.<br /><br />The other poodle is young. He came to me with a multitude of ailments, mostly stomach or parasite related. All the dog foods that had meat as the first and 2nd ingredients that also excluded corn, wheat and soy would go right through him. When I tried this formula on him, it was to me a miracle. His mobility problems ceased, no more stool problems - he absorbed the food better as stool size was greatly decreased. He also gained the much need 2 pounds.<br /><br />Overall, my dogs love the taste. They find the shape easier to chew as well. They will turn their heads if I offer them other choices.<br /><br />I wish it was corn free, but it works for them and that is what counts.<br /><br />The largest bag size is limited to 10 lbs.<br /><br />As I said all dogs are different and not all Yorkies are gonna love this formula. I raved about this food to my best friend and had her order from Amazon. She wanted to give her 3 dogs something new as they seemed bored with their food, but when it arrived they would have nothing to do with it. They wanted their Evanger's Pheasant & Brown Rice back immediately! (Which was a favorite of my dogs too, until Royal Canin.) So I would advise that you try a small bag first, even though not as cost effective, to see if your little ones like before getting the 10 lb bag.<br /><br />Full Ingredient List:<br />Chicken meal, brown rice, rice, chicken fat, corn gluten meal, barley, wheat gluten meal, natural chicken flavor, powdered cellulose, dried beet pulp (sugar removed), anchovy oil (source of EPA/DHA), dried brewers yeast, potassium chloride, soya oil, fructo-oligosaccharides, sodium tripolyphosphate, salt, calcium carbonate, taurine, dried brewers yeast extract (source of mannan-oligosaccharides), dried egg product, choline chloride, DL-methionine, Vitamins [DL-alpha tocopherol acetate (source of vitamin E), inositol, niacin supplement, L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), D-calcium pantothenate, biotin, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), riboflavin supplement (vitamin B2), thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), vitamin A acetate, folic acid, vitamin B12 supplement, vitamin D3 supplement], magnesium oxide, Trace Minerals [zinc proteinate, zinc oxide, ferrous sulfate, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, copper sulfate, manganous oxide, calcium iodate, sodium selenite], glucosamine hydrochloride, marigold extract (Tagetes erecta L.), tea (green tea extract), L-carnitine, chondroitin sulfate, rosemary extract, preserved with natural mixed tocopherols (source of vitamin E) and citric acid.<br />_______________________________________<br /><br />In my opinion, food ingredients to always avoid are : Animal Digest & UNKNOWN fats and oils which are NOT in this formula : )<br /><br />This formula works for my dogs. There are plenty of foods out there with better ingredients, but this is what is helping my dogs and keeps them VERY happy.<br /><br />I hope this review gives you something to think about when deciding whether or not to try this food.

review/summary: Wow! Shiney Coat!
review/text: I waited to review this food because I truly wanted to see what changes would be evident in my dogs coat, etc. She is a 5# and 6 year old breed of Pom and Yorkie.  (Pomkie)Breed specifically with excellent bloodlines on either side. But still she was having dry coat and skin problems. She was being fed Purina little bites. Well my bad! Her coat has turned glossy again as when she was younger. The dry skin is gone as well, although that really was due to her laying in front of the oil heater or the fireplace stove. (she's always seeking the warmest place) I'm very impressed and glad to be able to give an authentic review of the product. Well worth the cost. Especially if you can find it for the best price, which in my experience was right here. Consider the outreageous shipping some online 'pet' discount sellers charge!!! Forget that! This was the best price/shipping that I have found. Let me know if you can beat this and I'll check it out.

Not only does he eat it, he actually gobbles it up!  He is a healthy weight and has a shiny coat -- both of which I attribute to his diet.  Try it!  Your furry fella or gal will not be disappointed.

review/summary: I do not eat it, but my dogs do not seem to mind it.
review/text: So, 7 years ago when I made the biggest "happy" mistake of my life (getting the first dog) I asked a Vet what the best food I could purchase for my new puppy would be. She answered Royal Canin. I have no idea if this is true, nor do I even have the energy to look it up. I took her at her word and that is that. When the second biggest "happy" mistake joined the first, this is what we fed her. Both the dogs seem to really enjoy eating as dogs usually do. Though just because they eat the food does not mean it is any good...these are creatures who take great pride in eating each others poop.<br /><br />Both dogs are very healthy, have nice coats and teeth and wonderfully cold, wet noses. So no real complaints except for the price.

For family reasons we are in rural Tennessee for much longer than anticipated and the supply of dog food we brought with us was getting low. There is no stockist in the nearest town so in desperation I went on line to Amazon. My wife "Don't be stupid, they will not sell dog food".<br /><br />For once my wife was wrong. There it was, I ordered it and within a few days the food was delivered by FedEx to our door.<br /><br />A most impressive service especially as I am an Amazon Prime member and the delivery was free.

review/text: Well I read the ingredient list. If I am not mistaken dogs are carnivors? So why would you pay $1000 dollars for a quality puppy and then feed it corn that it can't digest? I think people think this is great because it says Yorkie on it and figure it must be great! For those thinking about this food let me tell you I hope you really like funky smelling poop. I tried the Royal Canine for all of my cats and dogs and well the funky smell permeated my whole house and hung on them. It took me 6 months of making my own food to get rid of that foul odor. Do yourself and your dog a favor and get them make their food, if you don't have time there is an awesome array of really good grain free kibble out there. I like evo. Remember they are carnivores that can not digest corn!

review/summary: dogs + corn = trouble
review/text: I'm not sure how a corn based diet got 5 stars from every one. before you purchase any dog food please identify all the ingredients and find out what they do to your dog. corn is really horrible for the coat and for the skin. go grain free, no fillers means better nutrition. better nutrition means they eat less, so in the long run those pricey foods that are grain free become cheaper. spend the extra money on food, not vet bills to figure out why you dogs itching so much or had skin problems. some good kibbles are, taste of the wild, evo, instinct, and the list goes on. if you don't want to spend that much you can go with canidae. if you really give two hoots about nutrition go with raw or freeze dry raw, or you could go with origin kibble which is nutritionally close to raw. I've never met a dog that turned it's nose to stella and chewy. take it from a certified dog behavior specialist, pass on corn.

review/summary: Great corn flavor, great for cornbread and casseroles
review/text: We like Libby's vegetables, and since this case of 14.75 ounce cans ($12.80 as of the day of purchase) was shipped free (for orders over $25) via Amazon's Supersaver shipping, it was a good deal.<br /><br />I love that the ingredients are simple - Corn, water, sugar, corn starch and salt - and that the corn is grown and packed in the USA.  The cans are large enough to make a cornbread/egg/cheese casserole for our big family.  I also add it to regular cornbread because it makes it moist, delicious and less crumbly.<br /><br />Although we don't eat large amounts of creamed corn, the cans will last for several years.  That combined with the lack of preservatives makes Libby's Cream Style Corn a great addition to my pantry.

review/summary: Love my cream style corn
review/text: No need to wax poetic about creamed corn from a can, but I just like to have this at times, plus it makes a great extender with some other preparations. It isn't gourmet food, but stick-to-your-ribs food that we can't do without at times. It is relatively inexpensive with Amazon's shipping if you buy more than $25 worth at a time. The expiration date is December 2014, so store it with confidence. An entire can is only 315 calories - good for dieters to know. A full can gives you about 55% of your daily sodium requirement. Gives you about 8 grams of protein (hardly 25% daily minimum requirement) but corn does not provide all the essential amino acids for building protein do you would have to have something else with it, such as beans, meat, chicken, etc. in order to make use of that.

review/summary: Great Bar!
review/text: Great Bar! Tastes good!  Close to exactly what I am looking for.<br /><br />When I want a light easy lunch, I eat this Kashi Roll with some fruit.<br /><br />The bar is pretty filling (makes me feel full for quite a while!). It is lower in sugar than most other bars, but I still wish it had less sugar.  Has a fairly good amount fiber, some vitamins and minerals, low fat, good amount of protein, lower calories than many other bars.  This bar is of substancial size (not tiny like some of the others).<br /><br />I wish Amazon carried a larger variety of these bars in the 'subscribe and save'!!!!

review/summary: Hit and miss
review/text: I love these bars - that's why when I get a stale pack, I am so upset.  It's not even passed it's "best by" date - but it's close Oct. 29, 2009.<br /><br />If they are good, the center is airy and easy to chew.  If they are bad, they are just WRONG!  Stale tasting peanuts - hard chewy center.  Last year, I bit into one and chipped a tooth because it got my teeth out of alignment as I bit through it.<br /><br />I can't really blame it Amazon selling old boxes.  It seems like every other box is this way and the manufacturer needs to rethink their "best by" date.

This makes a perfect meal on the go. I always have one in my purse for those days when I have no time in between clients to stop for a meal. This fills me up until I can get to my next meal.

review/summary: What happened?
review/text: Every Kashi product I have purchased has always been great.  I don't know if these were stale or what, but they tasted awful, like stale peanuts and no flavor.  In addition, the center was so chewy that my jaw hurt after eating one.  I gave it one star because if you really need something when you are out hiking in the middle of nowhere, it was filling.  I think the 2 worst things about this were 1) all other Kashi bars I have tried are really yummy, and 2)it LOOKS like it would taste great. I would recommend the chocolate almond bars instead.

review/text: Fiber snack.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this roll.  While it is tasty, it is messy, too.  Unlike other bars Kashi puts out, this one loses it's form.  Most bars retain their shape.  This one gets sticky, so have a napkin and/or  water handy. It does curb your appetite and gives you the benefits of fiber . . . all pluses.

review/summary: tasty, filling, and very healthy!
review/text: This is my favorite meal replacement bar.  It is lower calorie and a lot lower sugar (and not so sickly sweet) as a lot of the bars out there and has very high fiber and protein content.  It is very chewy, which, contrary to other reviewers of this bar, I find to be one of its strong points.  You have to bite, chew, and it eat slowly, which contributes to overall satisfaction.  The combination of crunchy and chewy is interesting.  And there is a lot of flavor here.  It won't be like eating a candy bar, but it is better, in my opinion, than eating any of its sweeter cousins.  The caramel peanut roll, not so far available on Amazon, is also very good.

review/text: I only made it 1/3 of the way through the Kashi Chocolate Peanut Roll. I enjoy eating other brand 'energy' and 'protein' bars (all of which have at least HALF the amount of sugar that this bar has) and hoped that this one would be tasty. It was extremely stiff to bite into, and much of the outer coating of rice fell off as I was trying to lever a bite from the roll. The dry aftertaste is like stale unsalted peanuts and with no hint of chocolate.

review/summary: Box crushed during shipment
review/text: In my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006VHMG8">EAS AdvantEdge Carb Control Nutrition Bar, Chocolate Peanut Butter Crisp, 12 Bars</a>, I noted that though the bars were good, they were often slightly melted or crushed during shipment.<br /><br />I decided to take another chance on ordering meal bars from Amazon. This time, I ordered Kashi meal bars, which have slightly more carbohydrate than the AdvantEdge bars but don't contain sugar alcohols, which give me gas.<br /><br />The Kashi bars are great: all 11 of them. The box contained 12 bars, but it was severely crushed during shipment, which destroyed the 12th bar. I know that the damage occurred during shipment because the outside box in which Amazon shipped the meal-bar box was crushed like an accordion, worse than the boxes of AdvantEdge bars ever were.<br /><br />So, my review of the Kashi bars is pretty the same as for the AdvantEdge bars. Kashi bars are a good product, but they're sometimes melted or crushed during shipment.<br /><br />With 11 usable Kashi bars in the box I just received, Amazon's lower price still makes them slightly cheaper than they are at the supermarket. But it's chancy. You can never be sure if the product will arrive in good condition.

You can expect to spend nearly twice the cost of this product to get something similar at the retail "Whole Foods" Market. On many alternative medicine sites research has been quoted showing the marvelous healing benefits of this honey. One of the benefits quoted is the ability of certain raw honey, such as this one, to be placed on a very bad burn and the burn will heal without ever leaving a scar. What do we know of in allopathic "modern medicine" that can do that without horrendous and most often debilitating or life threatening side effects.

review/summary: Our Favorite Coffee
review/text: My wife and I have been drinking coffee for over 40 years. Seattle's Best French Roast has been our coffee of choice for at least the last five, but sometimes it is so hard to find. Only one grocery chain in our area still carries Seattle's Best and often the space is loaded with everything but French Roast. After spending a recent morning driving around to four stores without success I checked Amazon and found it. The bags have changed, Seattle's Best no longer comes in the red bag, but rather bags in bright colors with a white circle and # on the front. French Roast is now in a purple bag with the #5 in the white circle. I did get the new bag from Amazon. I dislike the new design, but at least they didn't mess with the coffee itself. We make ours in the Cuisinart DCC-1200, the best coffeemaker we ever had.

Unfortunately we bought 3 bags of this garbage and I will end up throwing 2.5 bags out. Please DO NOT BUY this product.

review/summary: Used to be good - and used to be reasonably priced
review/text: A couple of years ago I discovered Seattle's Best French Roast ground coffee, which was delicious and a good value, as a 3-pack of 12 oz bags from Amazon was only $18.  This quickly became my daily coffee fix.  Recently, however, the original packaging changed (I understand the company was bought by Starbucks), and so did the coffee.  Now called Level 5, the coffee seems OK when brewed immediately after opening the bag, but beginning the next day or so after opening, a freshly brewed batch tastes burnt and has an odd chemical flavor.  Like another reviewer, I cleaned my pot and tried a different coffee maker (one at work), but the coffee still tastes bad. I have now tried all three bags from my last order, and each makes the same unpleasant coffee.  To compound this disppointing change in coffee quality, the price on Amazon has gone up from $18 (with free shipping via Amazon Prime) to $41.95 + shipping costs for a 3-pack from an outside supplier.  Amazon and Seattle's Best have both lost my business on this one.

Just right, very mellow for being a darkest and boldest coffee they offer. I like this company and Tully's for smooth coffee over bitter and overpriced Starbucks any day!! I'll buy this again.  They've changed the label, it's not purple and red  w/ a big 5. Great coffee. I DRINK IT BLACK. It costs $5.99 or $6.99 locally.
