review/summary: Life Savers
review/text: Was extremely happy these arrived totally unbroken!  I make Life Saver dolls for Kindergarteners out of these mints, sometimes for Christmas and then also make them into bunnies for Easter treats.  Wasn't able to find them in the stores anywhere!  It's a shame they only come out at Christmas.

review/text: Frequently, I find products at Amazon that are not available locally. This time is was rolls of multi-flavored Life Savers that I needed for table favors for an event I am planning. I hunted all the stores without sucess.  Alas, Amazon had exactly what I needed, as usual. It was the REAL thing, not a substitute or an off-brand. Good price. Prompt service. Problem solved.<br /><br />It is always great to find items from Amazon that are No Tax, and No Shipping Charge.  Always quality merchandise.  I have NEVER had to return an item.

review/summary: Why did they change the flavors?!
review/text: This used to be my favorite hard candy, but a few years back Lifesavers got rid of the original flavors (lemon, lime, orange, cherry and pineapple) Now I think it's watermelon, blackberry, pineapple, orange and cherry (or something similar). I don't like the new flavor line-up and I haven't bought Lifesavers since.

review/summary: Bang for your Buck
review/text: Alot of BBQ sauce for the price...I am from Hawaii, but I live in Georgia due to being in the military. So its never cheap to order or have family send this from home. This product came at a great price. If you like that classic natural BBQ taste, try this out. I especially use this for chicken. Marinate for 24hrs, add some sugar to the marinade if you want it on the sweet side. Once your meat hits the grill, you will know you made the right choice just by the smell.

review/summary: Not 100% erythritol
review/text: After having used plain erythritol for years, I tried Zsweet and noticed immediately the difference in color (off-white, a bit yellowish).  The taste was strange to me and upon checking the ingredients, I noticed "natural flavors" had been added.  I suppose if this is one's first experience with erythritol, it wouldn't taste bad.  But after using the pure version for so long, this Zsweet just tasted adulterated to me.

review/summary: What's not to like?
review/text: I've been using Z-Sweet, which is erythritol, for over a year. It's as much like sugar as any non-sugar-eating person could hope for! In my candies I mix in a few drops of stevia which balances the taste. It doesn't lose its taste when heated and it doesn't have that gassy side effect of other sugar alcohols like maltitol.<br />There are several erythritol sweeteners on the market. The thing about Z-Sweet is the size of the granules which gives it the "mouth-feel" (and the crunch!) of sugar. Try it on cinnamon toast- wow!

Still, this is one that I order over and over and over. If you like Sumatra or Starbuck's Sumatra, you should most definitely love this one!

review/summary: Belly Fat??
review/text: I have reordered this product before in 240 count. I was waiting for my appointment at Yale New Haven Hospital and viewing the hospital closed circuit TV which was explaining health tips. The topic changed to the benefits of green tea and it mentioned it's anti oxidant properties and the fact that it helps reduce belly fat!!. I do not have a real problem in this area as I am 5' 10 1/2" tall and weighed 209 lbs. After surgery I had to watch my diet and with the help of Stash Green Tea consumed cold from a 32 once thermos at least three times weekly I have lost 17 lbs and inches from my belly area. TIP; Cut the string and tab off four tea bags and place in a 32 oz. thermos, top off with filtered water. You can refill with water all day or add one or two additional tea bags while leaving the others in the thermos. Keep refrigerated if possible. Ice cubes will rupture the tea bags. Try this for three months for at least three days a week or more and see if the belly isn't flatter!!

The biggest negative for me is the price... at the supermarket they usually have sales on tea that would make this a lot cheaper if bought there.

review/summary: delicious.
review/text: I'm picky about my green teas. Sometimes they're too weak, sometimes it just doesn't smell/taste like green tea, or sometimes it's just horribly bitter/sour and unpalatable (think most grocery store teas).<br /><br />But Stash's green tea is TERRIFIC. There's a good element of leafyness (it IS green after all) without much bitter/sourness. I can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag.<br />I was actually previously disappointed by Yogi's Green tea (it's just purely green tea leaves, can't remember the exact name of it though) - when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires, so I almost lost hope in American grocery store teas. I previously would only buy the Yamamotoyama green teas (slight roasted flavor) and Stash's green tea tastes remarkably similar, which makes me incredibly happy due to the Stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets. WOO!!!

review/summary: Lemongrass and Mint
review/text: It should probably be called Lemongrass Mint to more accurately describe the taste.  It's especially good as ice tea, but drinking it hot is enjoyable too.  The mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass.  I notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass, while others think it overwhelms the mint.  It's a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes.  I usually drink Bigelow Plantation Mint black tea, so I'm accustomed to a strong mint flavor.  Lucky for me that I like lemongrass too, so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me.

review/text: I realize that taste in tea, and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference. For me, I found this tea to be unpleasant. Opening the tea bag, I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings. As I drank the tea, I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste. I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste. I do not get the sharp "bite" I normally expect from a good green tea.<br /><br />I will try this for a week, and see if I am missing something, but as for now, I can not recommend purchasing this tea.

review/text: I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor. However, the price they are offering you to buy in bulk online is higher than buying 6 single boxes at the store. I've found this tea is always between $2 and $2.50 per box of 20. Multiply $2.50 by 6 and you get $15.00. They are asking $16.50 before shipping for the same amount. I think I'll keep buying it at the store.

The new Mojito mint by Stash is also great.  I don't like it quite as much as this one, but I drink a ton of tea, and have about 5 favorites- and this and the Mojito are definitely two of the 5 (I also love the Stash organic Chai)

review/text: So this is the first green tea ive bought and the second ive tasted. The first one i tasted was alittle better tasting. This stash green tea however does taste lets say, 'natural'. what i mean by that is it taste exactly like what it is, all natural dried herbs. It does look like leafs though not just crushed up almost powdery stuff like the other bag i drank. Im not quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is NOT good but its NOT that bad either and its also NOT sweet at all. But hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor. Overall though i DO recommend this green tea just like the name says it does appear to be premium green tea judging by how it looks and the 'natural' taste, so if your just after those health benefits you wont be disappointed if you want good taste this probably wont make you happy.

review/text: I have tried many types of tea - from "the scoop your own, tea-shoppe, imports" to the "waiter swears this is the greatest one ever" - and never did I expect to find my favorite, bar none, in this simple unassuming little box. I drink this every single day at work, often using 4-5 packs a day. Fair warning: this 6-pack may not be that great of a deal, depending on where you live. I can get it at the supermarket for about $2.48 a box. To have this 6-pack work out to be a better bargain than buying local it would have to be 14 bucks per, or less. BUT, that has nothing to do with the quality of this product. The tea itself is great.

review/text: Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: No Bitter Taste like Other Green Teas
review/text: My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild. This tea contains green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil. I normally would not add milk to a green tea but adding two tablespoons of nonfat milk powder and a packet of stevia makes this tea perfectly soothing. If you don't like tea overly spicy this will appeal to you. I think it tastes better than a lot of chai teas made with black tea leaves.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: The Best of the Best!
review/text: I love Jasmine tea! More than anyone trust me. I got my first shipment of six boxes yesterday and have signed up for delivery every two months. The box it came in said "Stash" on the side. I'm assuming this tea came directly from the company. I should think it did by how cheap it is! At the grocery stores near me this tea is $3 a box on sell. This is a great deal!<br /><br />Stash is by far the best company for jasmine tea. I love this stuff! The only thing I would say to a new customer is don't reuse tea bags. Other than that, enjoy! It doesn't get better than this!

review/text: I was a bit shocked to see all the high ratings on here, so maybe it's my box: perhaps it was mishandled. So far the two cups I've made taste like plastic and chemicals. I'll try brewing it loose leaf in case the taste is coming from the bags, but so far I found this tea disappointing.

review/text: I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I didn't really drink tea, until about six months ago. I was drinking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HFA3XY">Honest Tea Half Tea & Half Lemonade 12 pack 16.9 oz. plastic bottles</a>  - I quickly grew tired of the cost, and disposing of so many plastic bottles.<br /><br />Making the switch to tea bags, I picked this tea at random from the local grocery store, expecting it would be one of many brands and types I would need to try before finding a favorite.  After trying a few others, this is definitely the one!<br /><br />If anyone has information on the quality of ingredients, EGCG levels, etc., please reply to this review.

review/summary: Green/white Stash tea
review/text: Every year, my grandmother would receive packages of tea from her relatives in Japan - she would pass a package or two to my mother - I loved the smell and taste when my mother would make a pot of tea with the tea - when my grandmother passed away, the tea packages stopped coming - so when I saw this Stash Premium green/white tea bags, I was excited - I decided to order it through the Subscribe & Save program and am happy I did - I'm cutting back on coffee and find this tea fills the need for a hot beverage in the morning

review/summary: This green tea is for me....
review/text: I would, by no means, consider myself a green tea expert, but, I definitely appreciate its place in my life, and as part of my morning breakfast ritual. I find that I feel the antioxidants percolate in my head. What's more, I actually am one of those weird people who like how bitter it tastes, when you've brewed it to its full potential. Stash Premium Green Tea does not fail to disappoint, in the antioxidant factor. What's more, there is a wonderful smoky quality, too. Stash has always produced a high quality line of teas, and this is another wonderful addition to their family of flavors and adventures in hot water......

review/summary: Just What I Wanted!
review/text: I was recently turned on to the health benefits of white tea, so I decided to try it out. Apparently, white tea doesn't have much flavor on it's own, which are why there are so many flavored whites. As a daily green tea drinker, I immediately thought this would be a good combo for me when I saw it. Stash is a very high-quality brand and you can tell by the taste of the tea. It has kind of a fresh, grassy (in a good way!) taste that is really distinct of high-quality teas. And now I can get the benefit of both green & white in the same cup. Yeah!

review/summary: On second thought...
review/text: One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I "brew" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~

review/summary: Delightfully healthy!
review/text: This tea is just so so so so so so so goooddddd!!! Can't have enough of it. Bought it last evening and had a cup of it and was raving all through the entire cup. Today, I had two cups and I felt like I wanted to have more. This tea has no sugar (read up its nutritional info on net). I am a mint lover and I love mint in everything. But here, the mint is not overpowering (as other reviewers say) but it has been given a good balance. I add half a tsp of Natural 'Sugar in the Raw' (it has only 2g of sugar) to give a lil' more sweetness to this tea, and its OUTSTANDING!!!!! Highly recommended. I am going to order the 6-pack version from Amazon soon after my current box empties itself.

review/summary: The fragrance is lovely, but it is too fermented to be good green tea.
review/text: The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.  I didn't like it at first, because it lacks the gentle subtlety of the blend of green and jasmine.  It's almost like an afternoon tea with jasmine added.  Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green.  However, when I want that delicate flavored, I look for something else, even the Bigelow (and I'm not a great Bigelow fan).

review/text: I was looking for a mellow green tea that I could drink on a daily basis either hot or cold. This one fits the bill. It is neither bitter or grassy tasting like a lot of other green teas that I've tried. I balked at buying a 6 pack, but now I'm glad I did since I'm down to the the last box and have not seen this blend at my grocery with the other Stash teas.

I make it in an iced tea maker using a little less ice/water than the markings on the carafe, and I use 6 tea bags which produces just slightly less than 2 quarts.  When it is done brewing, pour it over ice and be sure to squeeze in a little lemon which rounds out the flavors - it makes it the perfect beverage.  The fact that it is healthy is just a bonus!!  (If you don't have an iced tea maker, it's a really worthwhile, inexpensive investment if you drink a lot of tea)

review/summary: Good balanced Green Tea
review/text: This is a good green tea. It is balanced and doesn't have that often grassy taste that green teas tend to have. I would assume that is due to the fact that it is a mix with white tea also. Definitely better than most other green teas !

review/summary: Great tasting green tea!
review/text: I am a big fan of Earl Grey tea, because not only does it taste good, but I love the way it smells. I decided recently to try to switch to green tea because of the health benefits but I find I don't like most green teas out there. This one, however, is great. It tastes good and has the wonderful aroma that I like. I hope they keep making this for a long time because I will be drinking it!

I disagree about the caffeine kick noted by another commenter. Maybe I'm immune to the caffeine, but I don't feel it, I drink a cup in the evening and go to sleep just fine.

review/summary: Not as good as Tazo
review/text: I bought this tea because my husband loves the double bergamot from Stash. I'd been drinking Tazo brand, and I have to admit that Tazo is quite a bit better. This one is not strong enough for me, and I can't taste the mint as much as I can in the Tazo.

review/summary: Good tea blend. Not 'the best there is' but it's more than decent
review/text: The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this line of teas, you are just a tiny little bit above the average 'value' curve. The Stash Premium teas are not my 'number one' white teas but they are a solid 'number two'. The kind I drink almost like I drink water, several cups a day.<br /><br />I drink the Green-White (this one) and the 'all-white' versions alternatively for a little variation. They are both good and this combination reminds me that I used to be an all-green tea drinker until some 2-3 years ago when I switched to all-white. Now... I'm in a more moderate mood :)<br /><br />Oh, I subscribed for one box delivered every other month. This takes another 15% of the price and you get free shipping even when you are under the $25 limit. And you can cancel any time.

review/summary: Best Tea Ever!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this tea.  I am a huge iced tea drinker (more than a quart a day).  I have tried lots of different brands over the years and gradually gotten into lighter and lighter tasting teas.  For many years my tea of choice was darjeeling, which is the cadillac of teas; very light and refreshing.  Then one day I sampled this green and white combination and WOW.  It is light, refreshing, and since it is green, also good for me!  I've been hooked every since.  I even bought special mugs (16 ounces) so I can drink a decent amount and not have to refill so often.  Occasionally I see it in the grocery store but they can't keep it in stock (so the word must be out how wonderful this tea is!).  I now get my fix through Amazon's service where they send 6 boxes every other month.  I don't have to worry about 'when' the grocery is going to get their next shipment anymore.  So if you enjoy a light tea give this one a try.  I am sure you will be very, very pleased at the refreshing taste.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: I recently dropped coffee for tea. I bought some Moroccan mint to compliment my Stash double bergamot. The Moroccan mint wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It tastes almost exactly like spearmint. It isn't very strong either. I guess I like super strong teas (being a black coffee drinker). Either way, it is a great tea. Definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Tastes like Cough Syrup
review/text: I really wanted to like this tea because it is full of antioxidants. I was hoping for a fruity flavor, but instead it tastes just like cough syrup. I do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child, so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine, I can not drink it. I tried to drink it anyways, thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti-oxidants outweigh the flavor, but I just couldn't do it! Well, that is just my 2 cents. If anyone else has tried this and agrees with me, let me know!

review/text: I didn't really care for this tea that much. I've been trying out teas to find which ones I like, I've tried about 30 so far. I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time, then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried.

review/summary: Stash Premium Green - The Best Of The Best
review/text: After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!

review/summary: Not as good as I had hoped
review/text: I've been hooked on NOW's spearmint tea for awhile, and when that was unavailable for a time, I found this. I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6.

review/summary: Very good blend of primarily green tea
review/text: Both my best friend and I LOVE this tea.  Embarrassingly, we are quasi-tea snobs each in our own way.  We have tried all forms, brands, etc including the very pricey varieties, and we agreed that for a white/green blend this is perfect.  It is not too mild or smooth, nor is it too astringent or bitter.  It is a nice golden color with a tempting, soothing aroma.  It has good mouth feel - light but not too light.  It is very good plain or with some honey.<br />It contains white, green blend (Chinese, Japanese, Darjeeling and Assam from India, and organic green from Sri Lanka).  It is really a very nice tea.  Please note that of the teas that are blended into each sachet, only one is organic.
