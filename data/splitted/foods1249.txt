review/text: I can't say this de-puffs, because I don't notice a difference, but puffiness is not usually my problem.  It is however very moisturizing and smells great.  A little goes a long way and I would definitely purchase it again.  The fact it's natural is a bonus.

review/summary: perfect
review/text: This a a perfect solution to my creamer needs. I do not have to refrigerate it. It lasts at least a month for me. It meets my hospitality needs when friends come over (they love it). It's economical as I do not have to keep buying creamers every week. It is far better than the powder version! I would like to see the price go down, have it available in local stores or wholesale stores. My only negative is I have to take the top off when it nears the bottom to get the rest as the pump cannot reach it; however I love the pump idea - it works perfectly for my needs. This would also work great at businesses and church fellowships.

I recommend for home as well as any camping trip. So easy to make. Hydrated with boiling water for twelve minutes in the existing container, then fried up with a bit of oil. WOW, very great product.

review/summary: Easy and Outstanding
review/text: Here's a product that is easy to prepare and produces hash browns as good as you'll find in any restaurant.  Just follow the very clear instructions, salt and pepper to taste, and enjoy.<br /><br />You start by adding hot tap water to the package and letting the contents re-hydrate for 12 minutes.  For an alternative taste treat, add a few drops of Tabasco or a similar hot sauce to water before pouring it into the package.  I'm sure that other spicing (onion powder, etc.) would be good too.  After 12 minutes, drain off excess water and add potatoes to a non-stick skillet preheated with 2 tablespoons of oil--I use olive oil. Cook uncovered on medium high heat, and don't let your spouse tell you it's too hot--it not! In about 4-5 minutes it's ready to serve.<br /><br />Hmmmm!

Whip out a carton, hydrate the shreds and you are off and running!  I actually and tickled at how great they taste and are actually much easier than peeling and shredding fresh potatoes.  I do not detect any off flavors and no one has asked if they were dry potatoes, on the contrary everyone raves about the dishes I serve with them in it.  I have not served them solo, they are usually part of a recipe, but I think they would taste fine as intended too.

review/summary: Best ever for hashbrowns at home
review/text: These appear to be the same product which used to be sold at Costco under the Golden Grill brand in same size packaging and they could not keep the pallets full. The Golden Grill suddenly disappeared from Costco and Hungry Jack appeared at the local grocery chains.  Both are made by Basic American Foods.  History aside, these are as good as any hashbrowns anywhere.  Being single and retired I divide the carton into six small rubbermaid containers and prepare as needed.  I like to put a small amount of frozen chopped onions on top while pan-grilling and then flip over after 4 minutes for a minute or so to complete the process. The lowest price I have found thus far is at Walmart for $1.25 per package and their shelf is sometimes empty. I would give 6 stars if available.  Note: They also make a cheesy hashbrown variety which i do not care for at all.

I do have to combine this moist food with Seven Stars plain yogurt and then they eat it all enthusiastically. I also add some veggies to the mix. They have stopped their constant nagging me for food and seem much more content. My 15 year old boy was very thin and now he has filled out handsomely. The coats of both cats have become very silky and soft.

When their companions try to feed from the same log, the one in possession will hold the tree with rear feet and the whole log with front feet and continue to munch...so cute.  Healthy food, no messes to clean up like with corn cobs, deters squirrels from eating expensive bird food and provides entertainment and great photos. Very fresh when ordering from Amazon...not the same at the local stores!

review/text: My wife is a gourmet cook, and our youngest son is a professionally trained chef.<br /><br />We were given a tub of Ranida about 6 years ago.<br /><br />A tub is kept by our kitchen work area, and Ravida is used in the place of Kosher or other sea salt in most recipes.<br /><br />We were advised not to use it when  my son or I grill meat/fish/poulty. I don't know why. So we use regular sea salt or Kosher salt for our grilling.<br /><br />The nearest retailer is over an hour away. Their prices are higher on Ravida, plus California Sales Tax and our gas/auto expenses besides the hassle of getting to and from the outlet.<br /><br />So buying the 4 tubs from Amazon works great for us. A great price, and it is delivered at no charge to our front door.

I was really surprised to find this product. It tastes good, seems clean, not too salty, and I finished one pack in two sittings. However, watch out for the unexpected pit! In one pack, I encountered two pits.<br />The first one was unexpected so I nearly broke a tooth and chocked to boot. I was ready for the second one though. So, consider yourself warned, but go ahead and order it if you want black olives in small handy packs.

review/summary: Bring Back The Pits!
review/text: Amazon had featured the Peloponnese Whole Kalamata Olives in the same type of tubs.  These were delicious.  Then they stopped having those in stock and only offered the pitted olives.  Trust me, if you've tasted the whole olives, you won't be willing to eat these.  Because the pits are removed, the olives soak up far, far more of the brine.  Instead of a firm, meaty bite, you end up with most of the olives being shriveled and soft - like a fruit that has started to go bad.  And, while no one expects olives to be low-sodium, the pitted ones soak up so much that some of them actually taste as though you placed a teaspoon of salt in your mouth.  I think this brand has some of the highest quality and flavored olives - when you buy them whole.  The pitted ones were such a disappointment I threw the remainder away.  Please, Amazon, bring back the whole olives.  Meanwhile, I have gone back to my supermarket as source.

review/text: I adore this stuff and with Amazon subscribe and save it's wicked cheap. It's a great quick lunch or dinner for when I am feeling lazy.<br />I have a couple notes about it though:<br />- Of course it's not restaurant quality. If you're an elitist don't buy this. It comes in a freaking pouch. If you expect "properly simmered spices" and whatnot you're probably going to be disappointed. I love authentic indian food, but I also love cheap pouch food. I am the kind of person who adores authentic ramen, but also enjoys a good bowl of top ramen. If you take it for what it is you wont be disappointed.<br />- It says 'serves 2', but I eat a pouch to myself poured over a bowl of rice. I am 105lbs (of course I don't diet - that is my normal twinkie-scarfing weight so I do eat larger portions than most small women. Still two average people are not going to share one pouch of this stuff.)<br />- I usually get 8-10 chunks of paneer per pouch. I could use about 8-10 more, but I don't think it's an unreasonably small amount for the price.

review/text: I had really high hopes for MTR products, given the high reviews I've seen on Amazon. I bought a 5-pack of this Paneer Makahani, and it's just disgusting. I am very passionate about Indian cooking, and cook Indian food at least 4 times a week (and am an Indian myself). Firstly, MTR seems to use the exact same sauce base for all the curries (I bought the Mixed Vegetables and it has the same revolting flavor base), and the sauce is just not right! If you tell me that it has Indian flavors, I won't disagree with you. But Indian spices need to be used better - they must be matured properly by cooking them off in hot oil, adding aromatics in the right amounts, etc. The paneer was absolutely bad quality and tasted like rubber, the pieces were minuscule and lost in the river of bland, disgusting sauce. Paneer Makhani is one of the most beautiful north Indian dishes, with a nice and smooth, creamy tomato-based sauce, and a base of tandoori but mild spices. This one is grainy, the sauce is pungent, and it's just disgusting to be brief. All in all, it can be a poor man's emergency meal, but no way on earth does it even REMOTELY deserve the number of stars it has! Very very bad food indeed .. =(

review/summary: Fondarific Indeed!
review/text: We had a Wedding Cake for a St. Patrick's Day Wedding that they wanted in shamrock green.  Decided to order this and give it a go.  It was wonderful.  Very easy to work with, tastes great.  Bride was VERY happy and we were done in no time.  The color was spot on.  Since fondant is usually scraped off wedding cake slices, we were very pleased that everyone ate it and complimented us on how good it was.  Great job by Fondarific.  I may NEVER make fondant again!

review/summary: Great brand of fondant
review/text: Fondarific is a great brand of fondant, having a smooth, easy to work with texture and great taste. It can be a bit too soft at times so you'll need to work with a lot of powdered sugar to get it to not stick to your rolling surface and you can't roll it too thin for a big cake, but I particularly love it for shaping into figures.

review/summary: Yum! Yum! Yum!
review/text: These certified organic pistachios are absolutely over - the - moon delicious!<br />Once you begin to eat them you won't know when to stop!! The freshness factor, the satisfying crunch, among other qualities, make these pistachios uncommonly delicious. Someone asked me if pistachios are supposed to be red.  Those are the ones with dyed shells (and  most likely also sprayed with pesticides). It's easy to tell that a great deal of care is taken attending to the trees where these pistachios grow. Great care is also taken to maintain the integrity of the kernels' freshness.  That is why the end product, these Braga Organic Farms Organic Raw Pistachio Kernels, are so scrumptious. The freshness and yum factors are simply off the charts! Pistachios and most other nuts are healthy for you.  The trick is to  maintain portion control!  Finally, there are three separate one half (1/2) pound bags which were delivered quickly.<br />Now --- will you dare to share?

review/text: I've made these brownies several times and they are awesome :) Are they sweet like a sugar laden brownie? No, they are more like the other vitamuffins in flavor as in they are not super sweet. I like them because they are good and full of nutrition while helping me stay on track with my diet. I would recommend getting the mixes, whether its the brownie mix or the muffin mix because they are *Significantly* cheaper that way. I can't afford anything from Vitalicious unless it's the mixes. Their prices are crazy high for my budget.<br /><br />I will buy these again and again.

review/text: I used to buy the mix from the Vitalicious company web site. But the shipping was expensive. I have Amazon prime, and was glad when Amazon started having these. I make these brownies about every two weeks. They are easy to make, it takes me less than 5 minutes to mix, I make them in cupcake pans with the foil liners. So they are individual sized. I freeze them, and take one out every morning for breakfast. They are moist, and very tasty. Much better for me than a donuts and just as satifying. Very good product.

review/text: I purchased these after putting a few pounds on after back surgery and hitting 40 yrs.  I love these and portion out by baking in *cupcake* liners for exactly 12 brownies.  I used my own chocolate chips and cannot believe how incredible these brownies are.<br /><br />I've purchased Weight Watchers products and usually need a microscope to trick myself into believing I'm having cake or a cookie.  I also have sugar cravings from the WW products.<br /><br />Vita brownies are filling, satisfying and I'll freeze and pop one in the microwave for 30 seconds and use a little Fat free Reddi Whip for a SATISFYING dessert.  No sugar cravings with these brownies.  They have tons of fiber so be sure to drink skim milk or water to balance that out.<br /><br />You must buy...what a find.  Thanks Amazon for carrying a GREAT product and conveniently delivering.

I read all of the reviews and seriously wonder, do some of these people think a 100 calorie brownie is going to taste like a 500 calorie brownie?  As for me, I like that they are whole grain, no preservatives and only 1 point for a brownie.  After these are baked and cooled, I cut them up into 12 servings and freeze them.  I love to eat them frozen!  Also, buying the mix is tons cheaper than buying them already made.  I just ordered them (for the 3rd time) with subscribe and save and saved even more.  Score!

review/summary: Not like a brownie
review/text: Do not buy this expecting it to taste anything like a brownie.  I am a huge HG fan and she raves about these all the time.  I decided I would bite the bullet and try the mixes.  I made exactly as the directions said.  They aren't super gross, just not super yummy.  They are not very chocolaty, the only part that really tastes chocolaty is the chocolate chips which you have to add.  The brownie itself tastes strongly of wheat. Which like I said, isn't gross, just isn't super delish.  So I would suggest if you want a super yummy brownie and are dieting or on weight watchers, try no fudge pudge, that i what I will be going back to after I use the rest of these boxes.  My kids (3 and 5) who usually devour anything remotely resembling a dessert took one bite and turned up their noses.

review/summary: Delicious and $1 cheaper per muffin than vitatops. DIY!
review/text: Fans of Vitatops know that those babies are not cheap--can be almost 1.50 per muffin. If you buy the muffin mix on super saver shipping, the cost becomes .50c per muffin! Add it up after a few months, you'll be very happy with yourself:)<br /><br />These are so easy to make--I substitute for the egg whites with 3 TBPSs of ground flaxseed, 9TBSPS water, add 1 1/4 cps water to that and poof! in 1/2 an hour they are baked at 400 degrees and fabulous. The directions are on the back, it is really simple.<br />Taste-wise they taste the same as the vitatop--very moist, yummy, and good for you:)

Going to use pecans "and" chocolate chips next time. The amount of money you save by buying the mix instead of buying them made in the store is unreal! You pretty much buy 12 vita brownies, get 24 free when you do it this way. And buying it in 3's with automatic deliveries is the smartest way to go, with an additional discount and free shipping!!! These brownies are delicious, and a MUST BUY!!! Oh, and when making them, bake them for the least amount of time it calls for. That way they won't get dry. Also... freeze them after baking, and take them out to defrost on their own, or microvave for about 24 seconds. I wrap each one in saran wrap before freezing.

Among my very favorite are these TLC Trail Mix Bars. Aside from the fact that they contain 4g of fiber and 6g of protein per bar, they not only taste good -- I love those little bits of dried cranberry -- they have a terrific combination of nutty and five-grain crunch and sweet. This particular flavor of TLC bars is my favorite, by far, although I like the Honey Almond Flax variety, too. (Am not at all fond of the Peanut Butter ones.)<br /><br />Other data for these bars: 140 cals, total fat 5g, saturated fat 0.5g, trans fat 0.0g, cholesterol 0.0g, sodium 95g, carb 20g, iron 6% RDA.<br /><br />Scott Morrison

review/summary: A great flavor addition to your cooking!
review/text: Sometimes when you are cooking you just want to add a little extra flavor to your meal without raising the calories or add all the bad nutritional items that you can get in some additives.  This Massel bouillon powder is excellent to do just that.<br /><br />It is a great addition to season vegetables, soups, and stews.  It also can be sprinkled onto salads, fries, fish and all grill cooked items.  It does contain 232 mg of salt and 1 carbohydrate.  It contains no total fat, no saturated fat, no trans-fat, no cholesterol, no sugar, no protein, no lactose and no gluten.  A serving is � cup of broth or 0.05 ounces of powder.  It does contain salt and many people are on salt restricted diets.  The normal salt intake per day should be between 1500 and 2300 mg per day.  It is almost impossible to reach that goal if you eat any prepared foods or eat out.<br /><br />Benefits of this product:<br />* No Animal Content<br />* Gluten and Wheat FREE<br />* Lactose FREE<br />* Cholesterol FREE<br />* Trans fat FREE<br />* Garlic FREE<br />* No Added MSG<br />* Kosher Certified<br /><br />This is a very good product and it is easy to use and tastes good.  I recommend it to you.

review/summary: BPA free is great and they work well for the right recipe
review/text: We bought these beans because of the BPA free cans and we have bought other Eden Organic products at the grocery store that were good. Unfortunately, these beans are very bland.  They do work well in recipes with lots of other flavor.  For example, we use them often when making enchiladas, where a strong sauce can work well with the blandness.<br /><br />They are worth buying as a healthy option to use with some recipes. If they were more flavorful on their own, they would be our first and only choice.

review/summary: Dry but good quality and only beans in BPA-free can
review/text: These refried beans are quite dry and a bit difficult to get out of the can, but the quality is good, and I'll continue to buy them because they are the only beans on the market that are in a BPA-free can.  I thin them by heating and adding a bit of water, or mixing some salsa into them, etc.  They also be good with cheese melted into them (we're dairy-free here so I've not done that).  They are yummy even though on the dry side, and I appreciate that Eden Organic provides a BPA-free option for beans.  They're could use a bit more salt for my tastes, but it's easy to add salt to them to taste.  I'm giving 4 stars, not 5, because of the dryness and that I'd only give homemade a 5 star rating.

review/summary: Most tasty goulash
review/text: Our tour guide introduced this product on a recent trip to Budapest, and I brought one tube home to try, and found this website on Amazon so I could order more.  It makes cooking typical Hungarian goulash easy and quick: simply squeeze 1/4 cup or more (according to taste) - and voila!  you've got that special goulash taste!  Also use the paprika cream (another tube - simply squeeze out about 1 tablespoon - this tends to be salty, so go easy and taste to add).  Great product, easy to use, all you need are the vegetables and meat.  My order came quickly and well wrapped.

review/summary: Cheap but you get what you pay for
review/text: Product inexpensive but low quality.  Little black bugs were in the first bag I opened.  You couldn't tell just looking at the package, only after soaking in a white bowl did I see the tiny tiny black tick-like bugs.  If you could get past the gross factor, they are easy to wash off.  However, even if that was a fluke, the noodles are inferior and are not "glassy" like I expected.  They must be mixing something else into them as the consistency is a mixture between glass noodles and rice noodles.  Amazon, please offer some decent noodles via the prime program.  The other good noodles come with $7 shipping charge, which is not affordable.  I guess I will be buying in a conventional store.

review/summary: Glass noodles, cellophane noodles, long rice...whatever you're used to calling it - it's great!
review/text: I have eaten several brands of this type of product, but Ka-Me Bean Thread has a superior consistency in results that others of this type lack.  For me, it's important that the cooked noodle has absorbed the soup stock and is soft and slightly chewy.  So many others do not maintain this consistency year after year, or even reach this level of product.<br /><br />I learned about this food in Hawaii, where it's called "long rice", and have always sought something to match (they didn't have this brand there, so I had to try several others before finding it).  In NY it is typically called "sai fun" or "glass/cellophane noodles" but I just look for the taste, and the ability to absorb the soup.<br /><br />Thanks for a great product, at a reasonable price, too!

review/summary: The only coarse salt for me!
review/text: I found this salt one day in an Italian deli in Half Moon Bay, CA.  I got really hooked on the coarse variety.  After I ran out I tried other coarse salts, but they were not the same!  These crystals are smaller...just the right size, and NOT TOO SALTY.  Its hard to describe, but it makes all foods better.  You get that little crunchy taste which adds so much to fresh tomatoes, pasta, any food which needs a little salt.  I only use this right before eating....not in cooking. (I use the regular iodized salt to get my iodine when cooking!)<br /> The whole idea is that you want that texture and flavor.  I send for this online , and pay shipping (!) because I like it so much!  Highly recommended.

review/text: The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

review/summary: Not the same as the canned version
review/text: I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond "Roasted Almonds - Honey" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very "off" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and "other natural flavors", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not "slivered" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned "Honey Roasted Almonds" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased.

Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.

review/text: I LOVE the Blue Diamond Butter Toffee and The Chocolate.  This is my first try with the Cinnamon and they are fabulous!  I eat and live low carb and eat a lot of nuts...the flavored Blue Diamond Almonds are hard to find, so I am happy to find them on Amazon.  Even better to have them delivered to my door FAST & FREE!  Thanks Amazon and Blue Diamond!

review/text: I love salted and smoked almonds. I had never even heard of Butter Toffee almonds before.  But, wow, I'm glad I tried them.  They are just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth without overwhelming you with a sugar taste.<br />Another reviewer was right, they taste a lot like french toast.  I'm definately buying these again.
