review/text: What can I say..Amazon does it again...A huge amount of M&M's for a very small price.<br />What makes this a good deal as well is that they are all the individually wrapped M&M packages.<br />These are a great size for snacks, desserts, etc. where you don't want to sit and eat 300 of them...

review/text: I loved this great purchase at less than ten bucks, and they're M&Ms!  What's to say about them?  If you haven't had them, go out and buy a pack, they're a fantastic candy!  I prefer the ones with almonds best, but considering how cheap the milk chocolate version was, I wasn't going to pass up a great deal like that!  Thanks Amazon, I will keep coming back!

review/summary: Good Cold Shipping by Amazon
review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

I love the size of this bag because it fills a candy dish that I have out completely with a few left over for me to eat up right away.

review/summary: I received my M&Ms just fine.
review/text: I ordered the 4 large bags. I received them in a timely manner and appreciated that they were shipped in a minimal amount of packaging. The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

review/text: A pair of these giant bags of your basic peanut M&M's sort of shrinkwrapped together, for the same price others are selling just one bag.  I took these as a gift for a friend in Italy who hadn't been able to find them there.  I had to pull one out of my suitcase to get it back under the weight requirements and put it in my carryon, no problems with either.  My friend was delighted when they arrived and began snacking happily away immediately.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

review/text: I know it's the off time for smoked turkeys and the such but it didn't deter us from trying this 6-8 lb smokehouse bird.  Old tom came packed correctly and cryo wrapped.  It is tender, easy to carve and cooked all the way through.  It took us maybe 30 minutes to carve the bird and stack the meat up high.  A complete bird ready to go without the fuss.  Order with confidence and expect it to be shipped within a reasonable amount of time.  Gobble gobble.

review/text: This is a very good cereal.  I like having an organic alternative to shredded wheat.  I like the texture and size of the biscuits and that it is lightly sweetened throughout.  What I don't care for as much is that this Kashi cereal is too "cinnamony" for me.  I don't fault the cereal since it is called "Cinnamon Harvest", after all.  However, I would prefer a more subtle cinnamon taste.  I like Kashi Autumn Harvest better.

review/summary: Sweet Childhood Memories
review/text: I came across the Fizz Pops here by accident and ordered them immediately.  I hadn't had them since I was a kid and wanted to see if they were similar to those I remembered.  My grandparents used to bring one for me and one for my sister every time they visited.  I also recall them being in glass jars on the counters of small stores as we drove "up north" to visit grandma and grandpa.  I don't know what brand they were, but they were almost identical to these Paskesz Fizz Pops.  The best way I can describe them is that they are like compressed confectioner's sugar with a very light fruit flavor.  Kind of like the texture of a sweet-tart, but without the tart.  If you suck on them like a regular lollipop, it will hurt your tongue and the roof of your mouth.  They don't dissolve in the same way that hard candy does.  Instead, you kind of chip away at them with your teeth and chew the little pieces that come off.  Now, if I didn't have this good childhood memory, I admit there's a chance that trying them as an adult for the first time, I might not be that excited about them.  But, it was fun to find them again.  Everyone in our family liked them.  And, I found one friend who remembered having these as a child, too and said "Oh, I missed those lollipops that hurt your mouth if you sucked on them too hard!"  So, if you don't compare them to a regular lollipop and judge them on their own, you might find you like them, too.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised...
review/text: I looked everywhere for reviews of this product before buying it and couldn't find a single one, so let me spare someone in the same situation... This is really, really good. Far better than I expected after reading reviews of other low-carb barbecue sauces. It has no negative taste whatsoever, it's sweet, tangy, completely pleasant. If it weren't low-carb, I would still like it a lot. Do note that it has 3 grams of Xylitol per serving, which I know many people try to avoid. But 3 grams isn't so bad...<br />With that said, I have not tried cooking with it, only using it as a dip. I'm definitely going to be attempting a low-carb barbecue chicken pizza with it, and if it comes out well, my life will be complete.

review/summary: Tasty, but way too expensive through Amazon
review/text: Grew up with these and have always liked them.  It's hit or miss where you can find them, as only a few stores carry them in some parts of the country and in other parts they can't be found.  I used to buy a case or two when I back home visiting to bring back with me until Wal-Mart opened up and now carries them.  If you want them and can't find them locally, get a friend that lives where they can be had and have them shipped to you.  The price through Amazon is double the price you'll pay in most stores.

review/summary: Not nutrional but dogs love them
review/text: I let my puppy eat these all though they are not intended for puppies. She is 25lb. giant breed so bigger than most dogs. She loves these because she can chew and chew since she is teething.<br /><br />The ingredients are very poor and these do not contain meat, even though they say meaty center on the front. Also they are not a good source of vitamins and minerals although they say that too. Dog food is a better source itself.<br /><br />My dog likes these probably because they are made mostly of sugar and meat flavoring. She also likes the fact they are chewy.<br /><br />Conclusions: These treats are alright for a treat. Something used once in awhile. I wouldn't recomend giving them more then once a week. Do not assume they are a healthy treat full of vitamins and minerals...mostly sugar.

review/text: I bought these by mistake at the grocery store--I usually buy the Mini Dentastix, which my two Bostons love with no problem.  I gave each of them one Jumbone about 6:00 pm, and this morning they both vomited it up.  They didn't woof them down whole, they were chewed, but came out this morning in solid chunks.  I trashed the rest of the treats.  Maybe it's just my dogs that couldn't digest the Jumbones--they never had sensitive stomachs before, but thought I'd pass this along.

review/summary: Great if you love Seaweed
review/text: There are many who state that they aren't a fan of fish... but really, this isn't a fish taste- what you're tasting is the seaweed. Even the ingredients state its just seaweed, salt, canola oil, and sesame oil.<br /><br />Seaweed on its own is sort of crunchy, but this roasted kind by Annie Chun's adds some more crunch, and the seasoning is just enough to be even more delicious. This is a good alternative to potato chips. The bad is that you can go through a package very quickly, and I had to eat two in one sitting  - but I LOVE seaweed. Kind of high on the sodium side, being 3% per serving and there is supposed to be 2 servings per package. But its a great alternative for when you're on a diet or getting into shape and want something salty but better for you than chips.<br /><br />If you love sesame oil this is also a plus, has a light smell and great taste. Give 'em a try! :D

review/summary: Turkish Sweet Turnip Juice (Salgam)
review/text: This product arrived as a birthday gift.  After chilling it as instructed, I attempted to drink some.  The first thought that came to mind as it hit my palate was sea water.  Salty!  Then lemony sourness followed.  Not a sugary taste that I was expecting.  No this does not taste sweet at all and had the sourness approaching that of a lemon.<br /><br />It has a strange but interesting aroma that is not at all bad.  In fact I felt drawn to smell several more times trying to put a name on the unexpected yet familiar complex aroma.  It reminds me  of a bologna sandwich on white bread with overpowering hints of celery.<br /><br />If you are not used to this kind of drink, I will say that it is probably much more of an acquired taste.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br />&#350;algam is a popular beverage from southern Turkey's cities of Adana and Mersin. Although the Turkish word &#351;algam literally means "turnip," &#351;algam is actually made with the juice of red carrot pickles, salted, spiced, and flavoured with aromatic turnip (�elem) fermented in barrels with the addition of ground bulgur. It is traditionally served cold in large glasses with long slices of pickled carrots, called tane (or in some accents, dene.) Hot paprika relish is added just before drinking. Hot or regular, it is a popular drink with Adana kebab.<br />&#350;algam is often served with rak&#305; (alcoholic beverage)--not mixed, but rather in a separate glass. While &#350;algam is commonly used to cure hangovers, consuming excess amounts may cause bloating.

This offer was a great price for a great product - now when I really want a chocolaty treat, I can have one!

review/summary: horrible product...fully hydrogenated oil in it...unbelievable in this day of age...
review/text: So, I ordered this product and to my amazement, it has FULLY hydrogenated oil in it...okay, partially is bad enough, but FULLY?  Who are they kidding?  This stuff is, in effect, a poison for your body.  This is not my opinion, science supports this.<br /><br />I sent it back promptly and went with another product offered on amazon that has NO hydrogenated/trans fats of any kind...and guess what...it tastes better too.<br /><br />Shame on Swiss Miss..they need to change their formula....the ingredients are not listed for a reason...

review/summary: Golden Retriever Recommends It
review/text: I have a neighbor who insists that, evolutionally speaking, dogs were "meant to eat meat," and that this dry dog food just can't be good for our Golden.  I suppose by meat, be means "red meat," because Newman's Own Organics has Chicken, Chicken Meal, and Chicken Fat, to go along with all those vegetables and grains that he disdains.  Our vet recommends this kind of dog food (although not specifically Newman's), because of its reduced fat.  Golden Retrievers, and many other breeders, can gain weight pretty easily if you don't watch it, and dog food that reduces fat and calories is preferred by many ("California Naturals" is another good one).<br /><br />OK, so the dog doesn't approach this with nearly the enthusiasm as the beef jerky, steak strips, and who-knows-what-else the neighbor feeds her when we're away (and I do think some treats are nice sometimes), but our dog no longer has a weight problem.  It also helps if you believe in the benefits of organic (pesticide-free) food, both for health and nutritional reasons, and if you like to support the Newman's Own brand, which donates its profits--millions of dollars over the years form their growing line of foods.  Above all, don't believe the dog food commercials, ask your vet what he or she recommends for your beloved dog.<br /><br />Complete List of Ingredients, and Nutritional Information (from newmansownorganic.com, click on pet food).<br /><br />Organic Barley, Organic Rice, Organic Milo, Organic Oats, Chicken, Organic Ground Flax Seed , Chicken Meal, Organic Brown Rice, Chicken Fat (Naturally Stabilized with Mixed Tocopherols, Citric Acid and Rosemary), Organic Carrots, Organic Potatoes, Calcium Phosphate, Sea Salt, Potassium Chloride, Kelp, Parsley, Dehydrated Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dehydrated Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Product, Dehydrated Bifidobacterium Thermophilum Fermentation Product, Dehydrated Bifidobacterium Longum Fermentation Product, Dehydrated Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Zinc Amino Acid Complex (Source of Chelated Zinc), Choline Chloride, Iron Amino Acid Complex (Source of Chelated Iron), Vitamin E Supplement, Manganese Amino Acid Complex (Source of Chelated Manganese), Copper Amino Acid Complex (Source of Chelated Copper), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin A Acetate, Calcium Ascorbate, Niacin, Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Riboflavin, Folic Acid, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Hydrochloride, Biotin, Cobalt Proteinate (Source of Chelated Cobalt), Potassium Iodide, Menadione Dimethylpyrimidinol Bisulfite (Source of Vitamin K Activity), Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein................18.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat........................8.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber.....................5.5% (max)<br />Moisture........................10.0% (max)

Finally a vet tech told me I will see substantial improvement using a dental treat daily.  This I can do.  My dog loves Dentastix and we have seen the tartar begin to disappear.  I was going to give her a treat anyway.  Might as well give her one that does her teeth at the same time.

review/summary: Tippy the Pampered Poodle Approves!
review/text: Tippy is a 6 pound toy poodle that my son rescued.  She is so adorable and so picky! She loves treats but goes extra CRAZY over these.  She sees one and goes nuts!  (She spins around in circles and jumps about 2 feet in the air to give you a high-five. -- I wish I could do that.)<br /><br />Of course, Pedigree is a trusted name in doggie foods.  They have a smell to them that I guess smells good to a dog.  There are 32 sticks; each is 5 1/2 inches long and about 3/4 inch diagonally point to point of the "x" formation you see on the front.  They are firm, but soft enough to break off a piece for a little dog like her (so "large" dog on the package probably does not matter.  I just buy the big ones and break off a little 1 inch piece for her once in a while.) The package does say not suitable for dogs under 10kg or 22 lbs, but that is in the feeding guide where it says 1 treat per dog per day.  The package is also a zip-lock plastic bag, which is handy.<br /><br />The package says the stix are clinically proven to reduce up to 80% tartar buildup. clinically proven to reduce plaque buildup, and the patented x-shape design helps clean down to the gumline.

review/text: These large dentastix have been great for our 90 pound golden retriever/ collie mix.  He loves the taste and his teeth are being protected at the same time.  I give him one every morning and it has made a noticeable difference on the tartar build up.  Comparing this brand to more expensive brands (like greenies), I find this to be much, much cheaper yet still a great product.  I would definitely recommend.

review/text: First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.
