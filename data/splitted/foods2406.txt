review/text: These cookies are absolutely delicious.  Bought a tin for Christmas treats at home, gave a few small plates away to the neighbors, and still had plenty left for my husband and I.  Was glad to see they are still in stock.  I'm  going to order another tin for Valentines Day treats.  (Any excuse will due to have some more of these  wonderful tasting cookies in the house.)

review/text: Purchased these expensive cookies on December 12th based on the LIE that they would be shipped in 4 to 5 days.  THE LIARS shipped the cookies on December 22nd UPS ground.  This product is a rip off and sold by FRAUDS.  DO NOT WASTE your time and energy dealing with such FRAUDS, go to a local store and buy, like we ended up doing anyways.  What a WASTE OF MONEY.  I will be back in to post another review about how BAD the cookies taste when I do get them.  You can look for that around New Years.

review/summary: Best Salt/Spice Combo
review/text: This is indeed the best salt/spice combo I've ever found. Our family uses it in just about every dish. The combination of sea salt and garlic compliments just about every food we prepare. As the label says, it is "Great on chicken, steak, burgers, fish, pasta, soups, eggs and vegetables." It also rocks in soups, dips, some salads and sauces too. The convenience of having these two indispensable spices in one package saves time in the long run as well. The plastic mill is easy to use; just give it a few shakes, remove the cap and grind away. Ours lasts us up to six months. If you live in a humid climate like I do, the contents can start to stick a little, but I find a few sharp taps on the counter and some vigorous shaking loosens things right up.<br /><br />Salt and garlic lovers, look no further!

review/summary: Packaging is very misleading
review/text: This review is about the 8-pack Nonni's biscotti.  These biscotti taste quite good, but are pricey.  I thought the price was acceptable, however, because I could see there was room for at least 10 biscotti of the size shown in the front window of the box.  I was very disappointed, therefore, to find that 1/5 of the package width is taken up with empty plastic, and there were actually only 8 biscotti.  I wrote to Nonni's to complain and was told they were re-designing their packaging.  The new packaging is even worse: now, on the back side of the package, you can see parts of 2 biscotti, and it looks like there is room for 12 or even 14 biscotti of that size in the package, but again, a significant fraction of the box is empty filler.  The count is not listed on the front of the package; you have to read the fine print of the nutrition information label to find that a serving is 1 biscotti and there are only 8 servings in the package.  On the Nonni's website, the nutrition information label associated with the 8-count box has a blank "Servings Per Container".

review/summary: Excellent Paper Towel
review/text: It's hard to beat Bounty in terms of quality and utility.  We have tried many different kinds of paper towels, including those with cloth threads and the cheap generic brands.  The more expensive paper towels do not offer enough advantages in terms of absorbency or strength to justify their price.  Use a rag instead.  For general utility at a modest price, Bounty is the best.<br /><br />It is generally less expensive to purchase Bounty in a discount store.  However, if you live in a remote location far from a discount store, or just do not like going shopping, what more fun could you have than to receive a package of 30 rolls of Bounty paper towels in the mail, just in time to wipe up that spill in the kitchen.

review/text: I wish I paid attention to the nutrition label before I bought this soup.  It tastes too sweet for a tomato soup and you realize why when you look at the sugar content.  Actually, since I normally drink the whole can (technically two serving), I get the sugar equivalent of a regular soft drink each time.<br /><br />Other than that, taste is fine and being organic is a plus.  This might be a 4-5 star soup for somebody who likes sweet soup and doesn't care for extra sugar intake.

It may be 'expensive' but if I'm going to buy something, I want the best I can afford.<br /><br />We buy locally at Target or Whole Foods so I know it's more expensive than Amazon, but at a can or two per week, its not that bad.

review/summary: They Eat It
review/text: Not that my cats are fussy eaters...much...but they are.  They will only eat pate style wet cat  food. Normally I buy Friskies Pate, but I thought that the girls needed a change. And I'm glad I did.  I have 4 older cats and almost every time they get their wet food at least two of them vomit up what they have eaten (not all the time but often enough). I asked my vet about the Friskies and she had no problems with me serving it.<br /><br />But I finally said I have to get them to try something else, cleaning up the vomit was getting to me.  So we decided to try something a little more costly...yes this is  more expensive than most cat foods, but I could tell the difference in it as soon as I opened it. Frankly it smells yummy enough that I was tempted!<br /><br /> Ordering it via Amazon this way makes it much cheaper than getting it at the grocery store and since gas has gone sky high I don't have to worry about that.  I can easily stock up and not have to worry about running out, nor do I have to worry about lugging bags and bags of cat food up stairs every week, along with my other heavy groceries..<br /><br />The happy part?  They don't vomit it up; UNLESS they are overly hungry and eat too quickly!

review/summary: My picky eater Phat Boy LOVES this cat food
review/text: My precious young cat "Phat Boy Cuddlecuss" is a VERY picky eater and he has a very sensitive stomach which he takes medication for. He won't eat Science Diet, Blue, Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and just about any other expensive canned cat food there is. My vet even prescribed Science Diet ID for Sensitive Gastrointestinal and he ate that for about a week and then he'd never touch it again.<br /><br />As soon as I pull these Whiska's open he comes running. So far he likes all the flavors he's tried so far- Filet Mignon, Rost. Chicken, Tender Turkey and the 2 Tuna varieties. When you open these they have a lot of meat juices which looks just like meat juices that you'd have from cooking a steak and letting it rest correctly.<br /><br />Usually, you can find these at Wal-Mart for .54 and other stores at .69 each. Whiska's usually has some great coupons for B1G1 if you go to their website. So, unless you just want the ease of having them delivered, you can find a better deal for these than they are listed here.<br /><br />Overall, these are great cat food for my picky eater with a sensitive stomach. For my 5 cats one of these split up lasts only through one feeding, but, I like knowing that they are always fresh. I'd recommend as this is the ONLY canned food that my Phat Boy Cuddlecuss will eat.

review/text: At age sixty-seven I felt the clock running down. It was now or never. I wanted to try different eating habits, based in part on Mark Sisson's model of Paleo nutrition, and in part on my own self-experiments. Fish eggs were a part of my approach: Make every single bite count. Hence, give the heave-ho to addictive junk, such as ice-cream, the most addictive of all. My recent blood lipid profile shows that this approach is very effective. TOTAL cholesterol levels 209, LDL cholesterol levels 113, HDL cholesterol levels 79, Ratio Total Cholesterol to HDL 2.65, Triglicerides 85, VLDL 17, Glucose 83, ALT 22, AST 32.<br /><br />Another welcome fact was that the shipper added more caviar to the order on account of the delay in shipping. Of course he did'nt __HAVE TO__ but did, which is nice, and I am very grateful for it. The caviar tins was packed very well with freezer bags. The caviar was very fresh and very enjoyable. By the way...if you are a man and want to be "more of a man" I am talking about romance...try some caviar...food of the sex gods.

Takes a few more beans to brew a strong cup, but it is decaf, some I have tried seem to have flavor added, this has the smell and appearance of the real thing.

review/summary: As tasty and decadent as a chocolate cake
review/text: I love these carrot cakes. I order them here as well as straight from their website. It has this awesome glaze that reminds me of chocolate. It is fresh. Feel free to warm it in the oven.<br />The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of the 5 is the texture...it is very crumbly. It is a hit or miss for me to cut a slice without it falling apart. Now, this could be me not using the right utensils.<br /><br />Other than that: Taste, Freshness, Customer Service, Product Delivery - all 5 stars!

review/summary: Excellent value
review/text: I am an "expert" in dulce de leche as I was dipping my fingers in a dulce de leche jar before I could handle a spoon, born and raised in Buenos Aires I grew up with Gandara as the best, we used to get it on our way to Mar del Plata.<br />That been said to establish my "credentials" and been opinions on taste so personal, I believe this is a good value for my money, I use it as a spread on toasts with my breakfast and as a "sweet treat" by the spoon when my wife does not look at me in the evening after dinner.<br />The taste is not outstanding nor the texture, BUT, at a couple of dollars a can, I do not think twice about using it, the more polished, tasty brands at anywhere 7 to 12 dollars the same amount is to me abusive, I like to eat it without thinking how much each spoon, but each one its own.<br />If you want to add dulce the leche to your daily "sweet" choices, this is as good as it gets, if you are looking for "gourmet"  more sophisticated sweet, you will likely be disappointed.<br />PS: after opening the can I transfer the content into a glass jar with a tight lid and of course keep in the refrigerator.<br />TIP:keeping refrigerated makes it a little hard to spread on soft surfaces like cakes,crepes<br />  etc, "a touch" of microwave is the solution,SECONDS NOT MINUTES.

review/summary: Chilean Dulce de Leche (manjar), excellent!!!!
review/text: This product is wonderful! If anybody wants good Nestle products buy anything made in Chile, the quality and flavour is so much more excellent than those made in Guatemala, Mexico, etc. This Dulce de Leche is not "caramel" just made from sugar, but made from milk just like the homemade one. I use it for spreading on pastries, cakes,on bread with butter, to eat with apples, but specially in "crepes", with a little powder sugar sprinkled on top!!! Try it!!! I make tons of this because my children will eat and eat them!! I buy cases of 6 and even sometimes give one as a gift to dear friends. I absolutely recomend this product.

You can use it on pancakes like in Argentina or on top of bananas, fruits, cakes, cookies, cheesecakes, Ice cream or like me.. just put it in the refrigerator or freezer grab a spoon full and slowly enjoy it as if it was a lolly pop.<br /><br />If you like to cook or bake desserts...this product will make you a STAR, so you can show off and keep the secret. EXCELLENT and this brand is pretty good and much more affordable than most other.

I could find plenty of the ordinary sweetened condensed milk, but not the caramalized version and I had no intention of making my own by boiling cans of the plain for hours on end.<br /><br />I really didn't want to buy 6 cans, but after using the first one in the cheesecake, I'll be looking for other recipes to use the remaining five.  This stuff was so tasty straight out of the can; there have to many uses for it.  My only problem is that it could be habit-forming (and this from a chocoholic)--and it is NOT health food!

review/summary: Could not find this elsewhere
review/text: After a trip to Ireland where I had Banoffee pie in a pub, I have served it twice as a special desert.  I used this dulce de leche for the last pie - and it was great!  It is thick enough to not ooze all over the place.  In fact, it is too thick to pour, and spreading it was making a mess.  So I warmed the can in hot tap water for a few minutes, spooned it into a plastic food bag, cut off a corner, and squeezed it like a pastry bag.<br /><br />I have just now ordered a second six-pack.

review/summary: OK and affordable
review/text: Being from Argentina, I started looking for dulce de leche all over the place a couple of months after moving to the US (I was suffering from withdrawal!). This product got me through the worst of it.<br /><br />Now, the advantage of this dulce de leche is obvious: it's much much cheaper than anything else you can find (especially online). As for flavor, it's just decent, i.e. it does fine in cakes or pastries, but doesn't give me the mouthgasm it should when I eat it with a spoon. It has more or less the right taste, it's just not very refined (it feels flat and blunt and overly sweet compared to premium brands such as La Salamandra or San Ignacio). Also, compared to those it hardens much more when refrigerated, so you'll need to warm it up before spreading it.<br /><br />For me the choice largely depends on what the alternatives are, since other brands are overpriced online. (I later found La Salamandra at $7 per pound and other good brands at $6 to $5 per pound offline in my area, which is reasonable for me).

Such a good flavor and so full of nutrition.  It is more costly than other brands of oatmeal, but, oh, so much better.  I have given friends boxes to try and everyone asks where they can get some.  Six boxes at a time may seem like a lot, but they have good code dates and disappear quickly.

I worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat, unless it's made with soybean oil or lists trans fat.  I list this as one of my "healthy snacks."  And since I'm over 40, size 4, with no health problems - I must be on the right track of what "healthy" is. :)<br /><br />One customer said hers were "greasy."  Maybe hers were in the heat, and the butter got hot?  I'm now placing my third order for these. They're worth it!

review/text: I was thrilled to find a good decaf coffee for our family to enjoy. We tend to like Starbucks and the darker, flavorful blends. However, ground Starbucks decaf is so expensive on Amazon that we started to look for an alternative. Tried Ecojava, Seattle's Best and Douwe Egberts. Seattle's Best was terrific but also quite pricey and not always available. Jeremiah's Pick is a family pleaser and with the subscribe and save program, I get 3 bags for the price of 1.8 - 2 bags of Starbucks. No sacrifice on flavor either! Gentle enough on stomachs to where I haven't seen any issues. :-)

review/summary: Don't be afraid of decaf... at least not this one.
review/text: As a long time (heavy) coffee drinker the switch to decaf (nevermind the reasons) was tough, but the worst part was the almost complete lack of quality options. Sure there's the swill level decaf (Folgers, Maxwell House, etc.) but what does a coffee lover do when cafeine is no longer an option? One choice might be SBC's Twilight Decaf, which is actually a pretty pleasant coffee that brews a rich, smoky but not burnt flavor. Some folks swear by Starbuck's Decaf Verona which I do not like as much as SBC.<br /><br />Then this came along...<br /><br />I've had other Jeremiah's Pick coffees... my wife still drinks the real stuff... and found them to be well crafted. But this French Roast really hits the mark with me. It's roasted well and carries a full deep flavor. Better yet the price is lower than many of the alternatives. I liked this so much I now get it on subscription.

review/summary: Emergency pacification.
review/text: When you're caught off guard by a surprise kid visit and have no time but to rush to the closest convenience store, you may be fortunate enough to find some of these elaborate candy-toys (1 part candy, 9 parts toy) on the candy shelf.  It's an exorbitant price to pay for candy, but because of the toy the kids are usually satisfied with a small amount of the deleterious stuff.  Moreover, the Helicopter was instantly declared an effective "fan" by my 4-year-old granddaughter.  Additionally, it's a great photographer's distraction tool for getting candid photos with an otherwise uncooperative subject.  Finally, it comes with batteries.  (It was even working a full 2 days after I'd given it to the appreciative recipient.)

review/summary: Healthy and well-liked
review/text: My cat recently was diagnosed with diabetes, and so I had to stop giving him his treats. I found these online, and the vet thinks they are wonderful for him. They are all meat - absolutely nothing else. They can be fed (freeze)dried as is, or can be run under water, which turns them into a beautiful piece of meat! My cat loves them, and I am happy that I can give him treats that he not only enjoys, but also begs for!

review/summary: My Favorite K-Cup!
review/text: I absolutely love this hot cocoa! Our office purchased a Keurig brewer about a year ago, and while the brewer is fancy and very nice, I never had an opportunity to use it until now. You see, I'm not a coffee drinker at all. Coffee makes me jittery all day and I feel like my bones and veins are vibrating. Not what I need when I work with high schoolers all day! This hot chocolate k-cup is a perfect treat for me, especially now that the mornings in Southern California are a little cooler and crisper. The chocolate flavor is well balanced, not too rich and definitely not too "pasty". I hate it when the powder mixes have leave the residue in the bottom of the cup. I usually make my hot chocolate with milk when I use powder, but with this k-cup, water is just fine. I definitely plan on buying more all year!

review/summary: Tastes like plastic, waste of money
review/text: These cups are not worth the minor convenience they provide.  The hot chocolate tastes like plastic... I can only assume it's a result of hot water hitting the plastic of the cup.  (Maybe the coffee ones don't give off this foul taste because of the filter inside?  I don't know.)  I can't even finish using the cups in the intended way; rather, I have taken to peeling off the foil, dumping the mix into my mug, and running a cycle of just water through the Keurig.  Nearly as simple, without the nasty taste.  I won't be buying these again.  I'll stick to using the normal packets and running aforementioned cycle of just water.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.

review/text: My go to hot summer drink is homemade iced cappucino.  I make espresso in my espresso maker, pour it in equal parts with whole milk over a glass filled with ice cubes.  No need for sugar.  Equal streams of milk and espresso, mingling in the glass.  No caffeine needed after my morning mug, so this works just right.

I thought I'd try PB2 with chocolate anyway and I'm so glad I did!  Eating a serving or two of PB2 with chocolate satisfies my sweet craving without breaking my calorie bank!  Sometimes, when I want to splurge, I spread some PB2 with chocolate on a graham cracker, spread some marshmallow fluff on another and sandwich them together! YUM!

To the people who say this doesn't taste like peanut butter, I DISAGREE! It tastes exactly like crushed peanuts, the only different thing is the texture.

review/text: This is fantastic. If it's really 85% less calorie and fat, I will eat it with a spoon with no reservations. Being constantly on some type of diet, it is a real find. It tastes a lot like peanut butter with chocolate mixed together. I used it first with Yonanas mixer and it worked out rather well with bananas and berries (very little berries, or otherwise the taste clashes)I've bought Peanut butter powder too so I can't figure out which one I like better, they are kind of similar, but both yummy. One little critics I have is the packaging. I had trouble opening it, so in the end I had to cut it. Now it sits open and I would rather have it tight closed. Any ideas? (except zip lock bag)? Next time I think I will buy it in a jar. And I will buy it again.

review/text: This is a pretty solid alternative to peanut butter. If the instructions on the label are followed, the peanut butter ends up a little more liquid-y than one might expect, but that is easily remedied by adjusting the amount of water. This works well for sandwiches, and is an awful lot less messy than trying to add proper peanut butter to a smoothie. I've not yet tried using it in baking, but it seems like it would be satisfactory, so long as the amount of water is reduced when making the paste.
