review/summary: Vegan breakfast staple! Kids love it too!
review/text: I've been eating Fantastic Foods Tofu Scrambler mix for over 15 years now. I loved it as a teenager, a single adult and now as a parent with vegan children. At one point in time Fantastic Foods discontinued the item and we were so disappointed! But so glad they brought it back! I've noticed the price increase over the years on the 2 pk box's sold at retail locations jump from just under $2 to now a shocking $3.49 at Whole Foods Market. I'm happy to see the subscribe and save program offers an amazing price on the case of 12 boxes! Will continue to eat Tofu Scrambler mix for many more years.

review/summary: Healthy Breakfast Substitute for Eggs
review/text: I used to love eggs for breakfast. But with high cholesterol, I had to cut back my intake of eggs. This Tofu Scrambler is the perfect substitute. Mash the tofu (firm tofu advised), add a bit of liquid (from the tofu, if desired), put some oil (2 tbs Olive Oil recommended) in the pan, and add the mash tofu and the tofu scrambler, stir and mix in the pan while cooking it. You can add some non dairy cheese. When the tofu is ready, I put it on a plate and sprinkle some non-diary shredded cheese and microwave it for 30 seconds. Presto! A delicious, nutritious breakfast and healthy substitute for egg dishes. One can add smart bacon made from soy to round out the dish.

We often include produce we have on hand such as zucchini, carrots, bell peppers, tomatoes etc. in the mix. It works well with everything we've tried. A true comfort food and so easy to prepare!

review/summary: Not too bad (but not the best)
review/text: I have nephews who were raised vegan but I wasn't, and I'm not gonna lie - even after thirty years of vegetarian living I still have a hankering after a burger or a breakfast plate of sausage and eggs.<br /><br />I've had enough experience with this sort of craving to know that simply gritting my teeth and wishing I were a "better person" is sooner or later going to result in a disgusting visit to McDonalds and two months of regret.<br /><br />So instead of breaking, I bend. Tofu Scrambler is one of my crutches - not a truly healthy product, but SO much healthier than the alternative.<br /><br />This is not my favorite brand of scrambler, but it isn't bad if properly prepared. I strongly recommend that you mix the scrambler with your tofu at least an hour before trying to cook it. The results are much better. I also recommend the firmest tofu you can lay your hands on - manipulating tofu in a frying pan will likely result in nothing but an indistinguishable paste otherwise. Also, don't fiddle with it too much. Lay the stuff down in generous skillet of hot oil, let it cook for a few minutes more than you think it should, carefully flip it ONCE, overcook it again, and plate it. Don't mess with it too much or it will fall apart.

review/text: This is a pricey product, so understand - very light, very lovely - no taste.  But, great for the light coat on a salad or seasoned up for dipping.  Definitely not for cooking and will not be to your liking if that is that fruity EVOO taste/aroma we are used to.  As I write this, I'm thinking how well it might work in homemade skin creams and hair balms...

review/summary: Can't always believe what your READ!!
review/text: After reading the mostly negative reviews I was skeptical about purchasing this product.<br /><br />  "Taste like pennies", "Potting soil", "Over priced", "Murky Water".<br />Okay, whatever.<br />Here is what I actually thought of the product.<br /><br />After taking out a bottle, I looked for the "murky, potting soil" in the color. What I seen is a coffee or flat coke color. I don't see anything that turn my stomach, so to speak.<br /><br />I wanted to try one, so I put one in freezer to get a quick cold one{I also tried one warm, but I will get to that in a minute}. After about 15 min. I mustered up the courage to take a sip{was afraid of the penny taste}.  I was PLEASANTLY surprised to not have the lingering taste of ole Abe. I have tried both warm and chilled & it did taste the same.  Water is BEST drank chilled!!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This taste like spring water, not like money or any other metals. There is little to NO after taste to this.  There is NO scent.<br />Personally, I HATE drinking regular water tap or bottled water. This water, to me, quenches my thirst and tastes pretty good.<br /><br />All I can say is this, try it and form your own opinion{I would try a bottle, before buying a case}.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I DID NOT give 5 stars is because I do believe the price is high.<br /><br />That being said, I DO GIVE "blk." FIVE STARS!!!!<br /><br />My statement is MY personal opinion.  :)

review/summary: Tastes fine; not sure it's benefitting me well enough to justify the price
review/text: First of all, this doesn't taste any different to me than any other bottled water I've tried, and I would challenge any of the other reviewers to a blind taste test.  You can't tell the difference unless you have the taste buds of Joel Robuchon.<br /><br />That being said, I'm unsure if the benefits of the "fulvic minerals" are really worth the high price of this beverage.  Some quick Google research reveals that fulvic compounds can benefit both plants and animals by making certain cellular membranes more permeable, thus supposedly getting rid of toxins more quickly.  But who knows if this is a significant health benefit.<br /><br />Neat to try, since it does look like swamp water but tastes just like normal water.  But I'm not going to be buying any more until they cut the price closer to normal bottled water prices.

They bought a case, tried 1 bottle and were trying to get rid of the rest of the remaining bottles because they thought it was disgusting.<br /><br />I agree, disgusting. Metallic after-taste. What a waste of money and I imagine once authentic scientists test the stuff, they'll figure out it's not healthy and detoxifying as advertised. Beware of vague "I lost weight" claims also.<br /><br />Snake oil, circa 2012. BLEECCCHHH water.

review/text: Did anyone realize that this so-called beneficial water costs WAY MORE then gasoline? It cost $23.04 a gallon for this water..! What was I thinking when I bought and tried it? I just got caught up on the RHWNJ hype and lost my mind and money in the meantime. We complain about the $4.00+ a gallon high gas prices but some of us bought into this horrible BLK water hype. Fortunately I only bought one to try. BTW..it's horrible and nasty tasting. Save your money and use regular tap water or regular bottled water, your wallet will be much happier.

I have never changed his food from IAMS but as he is getting older his vomiting issues are becoming more and more frequent.<br />I decided with the wonderful 5 star rating that IAMS proactive hairball formula has, perhaps others should know that it does not work for every cat, certainly hasn't worked for mine, he eats this exclusively and vomits hairballs frequently, even with occasional use of cat laxative.  My cat seems to like it, and he is otherwise healthy, so still recommend it as a great cat food.

review/summary: My cat likes it - for now.
review/text: My cat was initially eating the regular/original Iam's dry food when she was a stray. Now that she's been adopted by me and lives indoors I decided to get her the "hairball" version since she has long hair and sheds a lot. Yes, I brush her every day, and just ordered her another brush and a comb...:-)<br /><br /> Can't say how effective it is since I only received the bag of food yesterday, but I can say that the cat likes it (so far) at least as well as she did the regular version.<br /><br />My cat is not a piggy eater. She eats only what she needs or wants, and then walks away. She seems to prefer the Iam's dry food to canned food as she will return to her bowl of dry Iams frequently thoughout the day to eat a little bit at a time. Yet she quickly tires of the canned food ( 3 brands and several flavors so far), so I only give her a small amount twice a day in a separate bowl so as not to make the dry food soggy.<br /><br />My cat tires of almost everything quickly - not just food. She'll seem to love something, and then suddenly she loses all interest. She'll have a favorite sleeping place for about a week, then finds another one. So far, Iams dry food is the one thing she will eat every day so far, and it's been over a month since I first saw her and started feeding her.<br /><br />I told the vet what I'm feeding the cat, and she said the Iam's food is good for her.

I tried the Blue Java and was very impressed with the quality and complexity of the coffee.  This and Blue Bottle Coffee are the beans I use for my drip at home.  My fuel!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Really great tasting sweet diet green tea with a slight citrus flavor, not overwhelming but very refreshing. I live where we cannot get Snapple (some sort of contractual competition thing), so these single serves are great for me! Just ordered the lemon version, and I expect them to be just as good. Free shipping is awesome, and I recieved the boxes very quickly. Please note that this green tea does contain caffiene, which not all green teas do. We are trying to drink less sodas and more water in my house, so this is a great way to help in our efforts without adding alot of extra calories or "junk".

review/summary: holy cheapness!
review/text: I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn't sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.  There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price, you are getting 16 containers.  I personally wasn't sure if I was getting a great price or paying slightly  more then if I went to the supermarket.  I like these gerber containers of baby food.  It's easier to get the food out, they do make some organic varieties, and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars.  If you only use half the lid snaps back on easy like a desposible food container.

review/summary: to go to for baby constipation
review/text: These prunes saved so many of my baby's uncomfortable constipation days when he started on solids. The puree seems to be easier to consume than prune juice and we used to give it to our baby with yogurt. It soon became his favorite food and eased his symptoms.  I highly recommend this product to parents who are having a hard time with their babies' constipation.

review/text: As the espresso roast blend is the one Starbucks stores use to base their drinks on including cappuccinos, frappuccinos and all other creations that customers demand on a daily basis.<br />This coffee is addictive and has a heady aroma and its caramelly sweetness comes through cup after cup and it is the perfect blend for a new coffee drinker to try. It is worth every penny and Starbucks "wouldn't pull a shot without it."<br />I even brew it straight up in my Bunn coffeepot for a nice rich pot of java that makes my morning a little more bearable.

review/text: Some reviewers claim not to like the taste or smell of gunpowder green tea. To each his own. It should be noted that preparing green tea does require more care than other teas. Never boil the water in an aluminum kettle, or steep the tea in an aluminum container. This ruins the taste of the brew. It is also important to let the water cool before pouring it onto the tea leaves. Once the water has boiled let it cool for 2-3 minutes, and then steep the tea for 2-3 minutes...no more. I have found Temple Of Heaven Gunpowder to be a superior and delicious green tea.

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: I just brewed my first batch and this is by far the best green tea I've tried.  My family will have to live with less this batch because my first sample cup quickly turned into 3 big cups!  Yummmmmmmm.<br /><br />Don't know what some of the other folks here are talking about when they say it smells/tastes bad.  Smells just like some of the better-quality green tea in teabags, but stronger, sweeter and much richer.  Taste is smoother, no bitterness, much fuller, and surprisingly long-lasting.  I'm no tea connoisseur, I just know what I like and this one is awesome.<br /><br />A little research on the web helped.  The general consensus seems to be that 160-180 degree water is the best, brewed about 2 minutes.  I don't have a thermometer or anything fancy so I brought the water just to boiling and waited 5 minutes before using.  Brewed 2 minutes then poured through a strainer into a pitcher.<br /><br />If you're willing to go through a bit of extra trouble, you can use the same leaves up to 3 times.  A little goes a long way.  I used about 2 rounded tablespoons, brewed 3 times, and got more than a full pitcher of nice strong tea.  I like my tea strong, and it looks like 2 level tablespoons would still do the job nicely.  Use less for something milder.

review/summary: Excellent tasting Chinese green tea
review/text: I've been experimenting on how much gunpowder green tea to use, and I think I have the amount (to my desired taste). I use one rounded teaspoon per 8-ounce water, with water heated to 175F (80-seconds high on 1000w microwave oven). Brew-time is 90 seconds.  I find myself drinking 6 to 8 cups tea a day -- this is enjoyable tea.<br /><br />This is Chinese green tea, not Japanese sencha, so it has the brown-green color of good Chinese tea from restaurants or from good-quality tea bags.  Quality is excellent -- no twigs or stems and does not leave that much dreg. Temple Heaven brews a fuller more robust tea than Twining's green tea, that's for sure. Temple of Heaven tea - I use the same leaves twice and I get the same robust full taste, no bitterness.<br /><br />[Notes: The bottom of the can has the production- and expiration-date.  For a variation, heat 20 ounces water to 175F.  Then in an infuser, put one bag dynasty Jasmine tea and 1-1/2 rounded teaspoons gunpowder green tea. Brew for 90 to 120 seconds.]

I give them as gifts with a french press. this tea goes a long, long way.. 2 tablespoons makes 1 gallon..  No Joke !<br />I put 4 tablespoonds in a french press, fill with hot water ( never boiling ) and let stand 5 mins. the tea as it unrolls  almost fills my 32 oz. press. it makes 2 gallons at one time. I add lemon and sweet n low...<br /><br />It has the same color as Arizona tea by the gallon but, not the 3 to 4 dollar price tag. My friends marvel at the taste and are shocked at the price ( $0.15 per Gallon ).. shop around ... french press' can be found at Goodwill from  2 to 6 dollars new !!! Most of them were Bodum's ! When the power goes out a french press will make coffee as well as tea!! People turn up their nose at them and most have No clue on how necessary they are to have in every home!!

review/text: I am a fan of gunpowder tea and have been for years. The flavor is about what I would expect from a gunpowder tea. The problem with this product is that the pellets were either broken or made up of leaf shreds instead of whole leaves and seem to lack the density I'm used to. Part of this may be that the packaging is a thin cardboard box and not a tin. I don't know if this is normal for the brand as it is my first purchase and probably my last. I'll try other new (to me) gunpowder tea marketers or go back to some of my tried and true brands.

However, it is the best green tea I've ever had, except possibly for Orchestral (which I can't get anywhere), and it's perfect with a little honey or sugar. You won't be disappointed, and it is very affordable. A little less than a tablespoon will make you several cups of tea.  I keep the leftover leaves in a pyrex cup in the refrigerator.  Never use tap water for your tea.

review/text: I bought this tea at an Asian market here in town. the box looks the same but the tea was horrible. It doesn't look like little green balls of tea leaves, it looks almost black. No tight little balls, the leaves expanded a little bit when in the water, there are tons of stems just thrown in there.  It looks like shredded little leaves and stems. The tea turned out yellowish brown. I can stand anything just about anything so this was drinkable, but the quality was terrible. I don't know if this is how the brand always comes or if there was a problem with mine.

review/text: I have been drinking green tea for years, and love not only the taste but the smell too.  When I opened up the box of this tea I thought I was standing over an old ash tray!

Exotic product aside, the plain old Lipton green tea bags from the grocery store are far better!

review/summary: Viva Italia Hybrid Tomato Seeds - Lycopersicon Esculentum - 0.2 Grams - Approx 70 Gardening Seeds - Vegetable Garden Seed
review/text: I purchased these Viva Italian Tomato seeds from Amazon.  I planted a little over half (38 seeds to be exact) one seed in each Jiffy peat pellet and then placed them in one of two old Aquariums I use to germinate seeds, I added water, turned the Aquarium light on and closed the lid.  (Old aquariums are great to use to germinate seeds as it provides a controlled environment and the light provides just enough heat to properly germinate seeds, if it gets too moist just open the lid and allow the moisture to evaporate.) Of the seeds 37 germinated, and are thriving now about 2 1/2 inches tall.  I am very pleased with these seeds and the hardiness of the seedlings.  I highly recommend these seed to others; it is a great cost savings to grow your own seedling instead of purchasing them from a nursery.

review/summary: Delicious Pumpkin Pie Mix!
review/text: This is delicious, but I wish they would use Stevia instead of NutraSweet. I used half water and half milk instead of 4 cups of skim milk and mixed in a blender instead of mixer (add milk first). After 1 to 2 hours in the refrigerator it was set and ready to eat.<br /><br />It works well as a pudding if you don't have (or don't want) a crust.<br /><br />After the last review, I was a little concerned that I wouldn't like it. I suppose, if you like your pumpkin pie really sweet, you'll be disappointed. I like the taste of the pumpkin more than a sweet taste so I was very pleased.<br /><br />__________<br /><br />Ingredients: Whey protein concentrate, modified corn starch, pumpkin solids, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, sodium alginate, spices, calcium sulfate, sodium phosphate, aspartame*, natural and artificial flavors.<br /><br />Caramel color, FD&C Yellow #6.<br /><br />Contains milk ingredient<br />*Phenylketonurics: contains Phenylalanine<br />__________

I love the flavor of it so much and putting it on a blank canvas such as rice really allows you to enjoy it's true deliciousness! Rice + a sprinkle of nanami togarashi + a sprinkle of soy = AMAZING!! Not too spicy (although I do enjoy spice) and even loved by my four year old! I went through the little bottles so often I invested in the large bag :-)

review/text: Re: Caffe Appassionato Sumatra, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)"<br /><br />This has got to be the worst Sumatra coffee I've ever tasted, and possibly the worst coffee to ever come out of my coffee maker.<br /><br />I was glad to see Sumatra coffee available on Amazon and that you could "subscribe" to get it regularly too.  Having learned to drink & enjoy coffee during an extended stay in the Netherlands and for almost 15 years now having been a fan of the world's best coffee, Douwe Egberts<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TU98E">Douwe Egberts Ground Coffee - Medium Roast (8.8 Ounce) by igourmet.com</a> I'm picky and 100% arabica is important.<br /><br /> Although the web page says it's 100% arabica, this is very hard to believe when you see the package and smell it. The labelling on the package mentions nothing about containing arabica beans.<br /><br />I hardly ever write reviews on Amazon, but this is just sooo bad. It's shocking. Despite repeated brewing at different strengths and different machines, different filters, etc. nothing works.<br /><br />It's just bad coffee.<br /><br />Bitter.<br /><br />Acidic.<br /><br />Yeccch.<br /><br />Sumatra coffee and the arabica bean are supposed to cut down on the acidity and bitterness, but this is some of the most acidic and bitter coffee I've tasted.<br /><br />Who knows maybe I got a bad batch, but Amazon's policy is "no returns allowed."  So I guess the remaining 2 pounds will go down the disposal.

review/text: My 2 years old son loves peach and pear Froose juice and I like what this company puts in their products, so we gave this gummy a try.  It tastes pretty good and my son can't seem to get enough of them.  As others says, it is true, each of the packages is small.  Froose gummy is much healthier than other gummy snacks out there but it does stick to your teeth a little.  Probably that is because they make it soft for the young kids to chew easily.  Just don't expect the texture of the Haribo gummy bear, which by the way my 2 years old can chew down without problem already.

review/summary: Really? Quality Dog Food by Mail??
review/text: Never thought I'd take advantage of my Amazon Prime membership by having my dog's food delivered to my doorstep. What can I say? It sure works for me! The bag arrives on time and in great condition.<br />  Let me preface this review by saying that I have never worked for or been associated in any way with the manufacturer or the distributor of this product. I am simply a discerning but thrifty dog owner.<br />  OK, down to brass tacks...ProPac High Performance Dog Food is worth every penny down to the last piece of kibble. My Golden is nine and a half years old and has been allergic her entire life to ALL the non-allergenic premium dog foods out there...with the exception of Propac, which is entirely made, from start to finish, in the US (and was never part of the melamine-laced dog food scandal several years ago that prematurely ended many dogs lives). Propac doesn't contain any of those dubious-quality ingredients you always find on pet food labels that are lumped under the catch-all term: by-products.<br />  With Propac, what you see on the label is what you get. No substitutions. Period. Chicken meal and fat, ground corn, flax seed, beet pulp, yeast culture and vitamin/mineral supplements. The ONLY preservative is vitamin E. Since my pooch isn't a 'working dog', she eats a fraction of whats recommended on the label. One cup twice a day maintains her svelte 75 lb figure. This dog food is a rare find nowadays: a reliable, quality product with the right price for my wallet.<br />  The best part? My dog(and every other canine fussy-eater I know who's wisely made the switch)goes absolutely WILD for this dog food. That NEVER happened with other premium brands...and these dogs have tried every one! The folks at Wells obviously know what they're doing, because this stuff stays fresh and palatable, from the first bowl to the last from every 33 lb bag.<br />  EVERYONE who touches my Golden is blown away by her incredibly soft, gleaming coat. Several weeks after my friends switched their four-legged family members to Propac, they discovered their dog's coats were likewise transformed from dull and dry to soft, luxurious and gleaming as well. No more flaky doggy-dandruff either! This is not my first dog and she surely won't be my last. I am very pleased to have discovered Propac High Performance and I will always feed my future dogs this quality product.

Never soggy or mushy. The flavor is great and they work perfectly in any dish/recipe. I have not noticed any difference in these noodles over the years, they have been consistently perfect. The price here at Amazon is better than local grocery stores. They arrived fresh and carefully packaged - no broken or crushed noodles. Definitely a staple in our house and highly recommended.

The packaging for 5 Gum is sleek and well-designed, and I love that both the React gum and the wrapper are black. Unfortunately, the flavor is like very strong, very fruity cough syrup and leaves a lingering aftertaste. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be licorice or what (not that I don't like licorice, I do, but not in this gum >_&lt;) I find 5 gum to be hit or miss. A few of the flavors work, and the ones that don't are either mediocre (like the cinnamon) or just strange, like this one.

review/summary: Amazing! 3 Cheers for Greenies Pill Pockets
review/text: These Pill Pockets are a total god-send. I have two cats, one of which has to be 'pilled' twice daily. This has meant a horrible process starting with her being wrapped up in a blanket. Now, thank heavens, we no longer have to go through that procedure. I simply pop her tablet into a Pill Pocket and she eats it up. My other cat is beyond fussy: she won't even touch fresh chicken, salmon, cream ... none of the normal cat 'treats' we humans offer. However, she actually BEGS for the Pill Pockets, which I now give her minus any medication as a treat. I recommend that anyone with a cat or dog keeps a packet of these handy. And if your pet is super fussy, they just might like these as treats. In fact, I'm so happy with them, I have already placed another, larger order. The only 'complaint' I have is that they only come in two flavors.

review/text: I have a very picky cat that will only eat one brand of wet food, and does not like ANY cat treats.  I bought these with some skepticism as to whether she would eat them at all.  She loves them!  They are a soft consistency so they can be molded around the pill, and she has no idea it's in there.  The package says it will also work for liquid medicines.  To be honest, I think that would be a little difficult since the opening is very small, but with enough manipulation, I suppose you could make it work for liquid medicines too.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.

It would have saved me and the cat much grief getting his pills down.<br /><br />Jill (my current 19 year old) needs thyroid and pregnesone twice a day.  With the pill pockets, I put them into the pocket, and drop them into her wet food.  She eats the pockets like they're just part of her food, medication and all.

review/summary: The cat thinks he's getting a special treat
review/text: The cat thinks his pills are treats made especially for him.  No more fighting or finding the pills on the floor.  Our old, mostly toothless, cat needs three pills a day and pill pockets make this easy.  Greenies pill pockets are soft so you can shape them around the pill.  Since "The Squeak" is a toothless old man, he does best with 1/2 a pill pocket around the pill.  Since they are totally soft, you can divide and shape them as you want.  If you needed more around the pill to fool a really insistent pill-rejector, you could easily mash two pill pockets together.  These cost $9.35/bag at our local pet supply shop.  Ridiculous.  Mail order is the only way to go for these.  We see no deterioration over the time it takes us to use up a six-bag supply.

review/summary: Great product,  but came in terrible condition
review/text: Fabulous product, my cat comes begging for her "treat" when it's pill time. The package looked fine, but the pill pockets inside the bag were crushed, smushed, and crumbled. Got them from Entirely Pets.

review/text: When my cat started having seizures last spring, the vet put him on phenobarbital tablets daily. If you've ever tried giving a cat a pill you know how difficult, time consuming, and disheartening this can be. I was NOT looking forward to a daily ritual of mutual torture for myself and my cat, so the vet recommended these. They have literally saved me (and my cat) HOURS of stress! You simply place the pill inside the pocket, form it into a ball, and feed it to your cat. My cat is finicky, but he LOVES these!
