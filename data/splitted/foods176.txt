review/summary: Four Roses Single Barrel is an extraordinary voyage. Among the very finest bourbons.
review/text: Four Roses distillery is currently producing some of the best and most exciting bourbons in America, which may be news to you because that's a relatively recent development. Four Roses was a venerable 19th century brand and a top seller in the US until mid-century when then current owner Seagrams decided to export the good stuff to Europe and Asia and debase the brand by only selling low end blends in the US. That's how it was for almost 50 years. It wasn't until 1995 when master distiller Jim Rutledge came (and ownership changed a couple of times) that the brand became something good again. And not just good; extraordinary.<br /><br />Four Roses makes a range of special limited releases as well as their standing specialties. Like a lot of high end bourbon distillers, they also make a single barrel version that varies from cask to cask. But Four Roses takes it a monumental level further by actually varying the recipe used to produce the bourbon - with startling different results. The ten different recipes Four Roses uses are described as followed on their web site:<br />From the Four Roses web site: "Four Roses is the only Bourbon distillery that combines five proprietary yeast strains with two separate mashbills to produce 10 distinct and handcrafted Bourbon recipes, each with its own unique character, spiciness and rich fruity flavors."<br />...<br />"What the letter designations mean for the 10 recipes:<br /><br />O = Designates produced at the Four Roses Distillery in Lawrenceburg, KY.<br />E = The mashbill that is 75% corn, 20% rye, 5% malted barley.<br />B = The mashbill that is 60% corn, 35% rye, 5% malted barley.<br />S = Designates straight whiskey distillation.<br />V/K/O/Q/F = Yeast strain used to create flavor characteristics.<br /><br />And here are the 10 recipes - along with the descriptions of flavor (and some have listings of the releases that featured that recipe:<br /><br />OBSV - Delicate Fruit, Spicy, Creamy - Four Roses Single Barrel - 100, The Mariage Collection 2008 Release, Limited Edition 2010 Barrel Strength Bourbon<br />OBSK - Rich in Spiciness, Full Body - Small Batch, 120th Anniversary<br />OBSO - Slightly Fruity, Spicy, Medium Body - Four Roses Small Batch<br />OBSQ - Floral (Rose Petal), Spicy, Medium Body - Limited Edition 2011 Barrel Strength<br />OBSF - Mint, Fruity, Spicy, Full Body<br />OESV - Delicate Fruit, Fresh, Creamy<br />OESK - Spicy, Full Body - Four Roses Small Batch, The Mariage Collection 2008 Release<br />OESO - Fruity (Red Berries), Medium Body - 40th Anniversary Barrel Strength Bourbon, Four Roses Small Batch<br />OESQ - Floral, Banana, Fresh, Medium Body - 2009 Limited Edition Barrel Strength Bourbon<br />OESF - Mint, Fruity, Full Body<br />....<br /><br />In this review I'm tasting a single barrel bottle from barrel 22-1B, warehouse BN, bottled at 53.6% using recipe OBSQ.<br /><br />In the glass it's orangy copper new penny amber colored. The nose is sweet with honey, clover flower and the tang of grape noble rot (rancio in the cognac world). With more time more classicly bourbon notes of toffee and leather creep in<br /><br />First entry is sugar beets with a rush of vinous rancio, white raisins, sherry notes. Mouth feel is silky with good but not thick syrup factor. Spicy around edge of tongue - 107.2 proof showing up. Herbal notes proliferate in the transition to the finish: cilantro and parsley... Maybe some ivy. As the glow fades the oak tannins join the medicinal herbal edge of bitterness and the honey and the sherry-cognac rancio ends up feeling almost dry. This is a sophisticated and elegant flavor profile that feels almost more like a wood aged European eau de vie than a Kentucky bourbon but inhaling as the long finish fades brings up echoes of burnt sugar, leather and tobacco conjured out the fading viney and herbal flavors so I know this is Kentucky Straight bourbon whiskey. Just bourbon of a higher and more refined sort.<br /><br />This bourbon is so good, so different, so unique, I can't wait to try other single barrel expressions. I'll be looking out for them.

review/text: ****<br />This Kava Stress Relief Tea from Yogi Tea is for anxiety relief. It's an unusual tea, slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. The bad news is that I can't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea, although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. Still, it's a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however, I even tried four bags once, but still didn't notice a relaxing effect. I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway, so this is something to be aware of. Your experience of the tea may be different.<br /><br />Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are: kava root extract, carob pod, Indian sarsaparilla root, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, stevia leaf, barley malt, natural hazelnut flavor, natural cinnamon flavor, and natural licorice flavor. Amazingly, I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness.<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, "Your breath is the voice of your soul" and "Your head must bow to your heart".<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. "Kava-kava," native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night's sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of "relaxed unconcern" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax."<br /><br />In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, "Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment."<br /><br />Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.<br /><br />I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn't really work for me. Still, it is a wonderful and recommended tea, and may work for you!<br /><br />UPDATE: R. and Benjamin say in the comments that it is important to use hot but not boiling water as the boiling water may kill the part of the kava that helps one be relaxed. Please see my comment section for more information. Thanks to R. and Benjamin for their comments.<br />****

review/summary: Best Tea IMHO
review/text: So I've had my fair share of green and black teas. I received this certain tea as a present from a good friend. I cannot tell you how amazing this tea is.<br />It's got two things going for it: It tastes awesome and is pleasant to consume.<br />Taste is a big deal. This tea tastes amazing and there is just a burst of amazing spices and flavours that come out of this tea.<br />Downing something is not healthy. If you're consuming something for everything but taste then you're doing it wrong. I enjoy this tea because it goes down nice and smooth and leaves a very pleasant after taste. As one reviewer said, it leaves a nasty after taste. I would not agree. I believe it to be a very relaxing and just overall awesome after taste.<br /><br />If you have some kind of stress disorder this is probably not the tea you want. Now I'm no tea whizz but I don't really think that getting this tea for it's "relaxing effects" would be the way to go. I get it because this was a delicious tea and I'm sitting down with a cup as I type. I really do love this tea and if you're looking for something that just tastes awesome and you want to sit down and chill out with, this is the tea to go with.

review/summary: The Stevia...
review/text: I tried this tea because I am an insomniac, and wanted something to help put me to sleep. Unfortunately, I can barely palette this tea because of its wretched last note and after-taste of Stevia. I have never tasted Stevia before, but after reading the other reviews I instantly knew that was the issue. It goes into my throat and just tastes disgustingly sweet. Not in a good way, either.<br /><br />I don't usually put sugar or milk in any of my tea-- I am one of those people who drinks strong black chais straight up. So this is a complete killer for me. If you like super sweet teas, this may be for you, but I don't understand why they would put a sweetener in their tea. If they're going to do that, perhaps they should make a separate version without the Stevia.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing this again, and I continue my hunt for very strong sleepytime teas that aren't sweet, fruity, or minty.

review/summary: Worked around the metallic taste
review/text: I tried the Yogi Kava Stress Relief tea after being a user of Valerian root in my herbal tea for a while a year or so ago and having some success with that but wanting to try something different - I was finding myself in a situation where on most days I needed to get up at one consistent time but then one day of the week I needed to get up three hours earlier, thus causing a great amount of upheaval in my sleep schedule the night before and then after that early morning.<br /><br />As some earlier reviewers have noted, there is a strong, almost metallic note to this tea. I have tried Stevia as a sweetener previously and had not particularly cared for it, but that did not seem to constitute the entire "note" that I was sensing and not finding pleasing here, so some of it must be the herb itself. However, this taste is not any more displeasing than Valerian is to my palate when I compare them.<br /><br />I steep two of the teabags for approximately 7-8 minutes with the water almost a boil when I add it to the tea (the instructions said that the tea could be steeped for as long as 10 minutes). I add just a splash of cream and a generous tablespoon of clover honey to mine, and within twenty minutes I feel the effects. Some have noted that they do not feel any differently - I can say that I do, but I should mention to be fair that I am a mere five feet two inches and barely clock in at above one hundred pounds.  Still, I would say that this is to its credit - it wouldn't put me to sleep if I used one teabag for test anxiety, which I foresee using it for in the very near future. Instead of knocking you out, it simply stops your mind from racing relentlessly, or at least that has been my experience.

review/text: This tea tastes pleasant for your first 2 or 3 sips. Then it starts tasting pretty foul. I hate, hate, hate how they put Stevia into it. If I want my tea sweeter, allow me to put my own sweetener in it. Not only do they assume how sweet you want your tea, but they use Stevia which leaves an AWFUL after-taste as well as giving anything that contains it a weird, not yummy, sweet taste. I prefer my tea unsweetened as it is, but if I do choose to sweeten anything I drink, I use conventional sugars that don't taste terrible.<br /><br />It does give a bit of a relaxing feel, but the Stevia really ruins it. I wish I could just take it out!

review/text: I work 12 hour days and lived on coffee and Gatorade .... Until I tried VitaminWater Essential.  It has replaced forever my other cold beverages.  Soda and other soft drinks were just too sicky-sweet to drink all day long. I found the Essential orange flavor just right. It has a long way to go to replace my coffee (hehehe), but I do recommend it to anyone.<br />PS: I've tried many of their other flavors - they don't do it for me. Essential is my favorite.

You'll be hearing the snap, crackle pop of your childhood.<br /><br />An extra bonus is this cereal tastes chocolatey good while providing some healthy nutrition. Use low-fat milk to stay healthy or go decadent and enjoy your bowl of cereal with a bit of half-and-half. When using half-and-half the cereal will almost taste like milk chocolate.<br /><br />Yum! Yum! Good!<br /><br />Recommend.

review/summary: THE BEST CEREAL ...BUT
review/text: I've always loved this cereal ever since I was a little kid ,I'm originally from Mexico, of course back there is called "Choco Krispis" but is the same stuff. I've purchased 2 packages of 4 boxes each about two weeks ago ,the first boxes were great and I have no complaints ..but when I opened the second 4 boxes the cereal was either over baked or under baked ,because it had some really hard cereal pieces and when chewing it felt like I was eating hard candy with milk ,I thought that maybe it was just one box that it was like that but no ,I checked all 4 boxes and they were all the same ,not what I expected at all,I'm disappointed at Amazon for not having a higher product quality check and offering defective boxes like that and since I can't return groceries ..makes it a very frustrating experience ,that's why I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars ,the cereal itself is my favorite ..it has the greatest chocolate flavor and a unique taste that in my opinion has no match ,this is a great product indeed ,though I would not recommend you to purchase it from Amazon ,better buy it at your local grocer to avoid frustrations.

review/summary: Best instant oatmeal ever
review/text: This is IMHO the best instant oatmeal ever. The problem is only one grocery in my area carries this brand and they are erratic in stocking the flavors I like (Apples 'n Cinnamon and Baked Apple). Consequently, I have to order it on line. The only draw back to online ordering is price; it cost me more than 100% more to order on line than to purchase in the store ($0.99 in store vs $2.15 per serving on line). And to make matters worse, Amazon doesn't stock it all the time. Right now I have to sign up to be notified when it will be available again. So, I end up having to go to other suppliers on line to find this product.<br /><br />However, this is still the best instant oatmeal in the world and I will pursue it to the ends of the earth!!!!

review/summary: Excellent, tart concentrated fruit juices
review/text: Excellent, tart concentrated fruit juices  4*<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the Da Frut concentrates on several counts.<br /><br />First is convenience, they can be kept on the shelf (instead of the freezer) until opened.<br /><br />Second, cost: locally, the passion fruit is the most expensive at about $3.50 / bottle -- but that mixes up to "at least" a gallon.  Other flavors run about $2, plus or minus, and make either a gallon or half gallon.<br /><br />Most important, they are unsweetened, leaving it to the customer to provide any extra sugar desired.  This is, of course, crucial for those trying to control their sugar intake, simply as calory control or because of diabetes, hyperactivity or other conditions.  But also it allows one to avoid the oversweetness of so many bottled juices on grocery store shelves, either due to the sugary apple / grape juice base or even added sweeteners.  If you choose to try any of the Da Fruta juices, I'd suggest you start with no added sugar and gradually add a few spoonfuls at a time (to that gallon or half gallon, not per serving!) until you reach your comfort zone.  I've been leaning toward the little-if-any sugar end of the spectrum lately, and find the result very refreshing and thirst quenching.  Of the two products I have in hand at the moment, the passion fruit has 2 g of sugars per serving (19 servings per container), and the cashew has 3 g of sugars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't have freshly squeezed juices to compare these concentrates with, nor even any other equivalent products (such as bottled whole or frozen concentrate).  They are nothing like the heavily sweetened canned "nectars" that are available in some groceries.  Considered on their own, they are flavorful, tart and refreshing, and allow you to mix to the strength and sweetness desired.

review/summary: New favorite from Annie Chun
review/text: I'm totally hooked on Annie Chun's Soup Bowls.  Far and away the best "instant" soup on the market, I find myself frequently craving the soft noodles and intense flavors found only in Annie Chun's soups.  I have tried all of the varieties, and the new Vietnamese Pho soup has shot to the top of my favorites list.  Very savory broth, you will definitely recognize the flavor if you've enjoyed real pho in a Vietnamese noodle house.  This is not a spicy soup--if you prefer it with a kick, I'd suggest investing in a bottle of Sriracha sauce.  Obviously, one of the major selling points of Annie Chun's soup bowls is the convenience factor.  Nevertheless, this soup makes me want to grab some fresh cilantro and bean sprouts and have an authentic pho experience at home!<br /><br />Since everyone's tastes differ, as a matter of reference, my other favorite Annie Chun's Soup flavors are the Tom Yum, the Kimchi (although it's in the upper range of spicy that I can handle), and the Miso.

review/text: I have no idea if this tastes like the real thing (I'm going to guess no), but it is very tasty.  It's easy to make and is filling.  Most instant noodles are either too bland or too spicey for me, but this has a perfectly seasoned broth.  The noodles are firm without being too tough like some of the Annie Chun soup bowls.  I really liked the huge pieces of green onion in it as well.  Good product and my new favorite flavor.<br /><br />Huge downside?  1940mg of sodium per bowl, which is more sodium then you need in day never mind one meal.  Ouch.  The bowl has 2 servings and rounds out at 440 calories.  Not something you want to eat very often.  I really want to buy them again until I read the label.  It's too bad, but it's not something I'll eat again.

It's definitely a step up from cup o noodle or ramen noodle packs, but still lacks something that'd you'd get from just making the dish yourself (I think the freeze dried vegetables don't have as much flavor, and the noodles aren't as good as fresh noodles).<br /><br />If you like instant soups, ramen noodles, or any of that stuff, I strongly recommend checking this out, you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I ordered this in spite of a negative experience I'd had with the Kung Pao Bowl. I'm glad I did. The texture of these noodles is much better, lighter and yet hearty enough to quench my appetite.<br /><br />When you open this up, you unpack the soft noodles, pour hot water over them, and let them soften a wee bit in that hot water. Then you drain the water, add new hot water and the contents of both seasoning/topping packets, then nuke the bowl for a couple of minutes.<br /><br />What you end up with is a nice bowl of soup, chockablock with noodles, sliced scallions and bok choy, and a light beefy flavor with just a hint of sweetness. I'd like it to be spicier, but that's just me. I'm big on spice and ginger and would have made this nose-clearingly intense if it were up to me! :-)<br /><br />Anyway, this one is a keeper. I will try other Annie Chun soups, since I now know I love her steamed rice and her pho soup.

review/summary: The Best Instant Noodle Meals You Can Buy!
review/text: Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that "crunch" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)

review/summary: Hardly pho, but not bad with a lot of work
review/text: I knew it was a pipe dream to think this product would be 'good' pho, but as an avid pho lover, I had to try it. The verdict? It doesn't really taste like Pho, but it's pretty good WITH some work.<br /><br />Eating this stuff right out of the box is a sure letdown for any person who desires something that actually tastes like Pho. I adore two things about Annie Chun noodle bowls, and that's the dehydrated vegetables and noodles. The veges rehydrate and look/taste like somewhat fresh veges, which is a feat on its own. The noodles are thick and chewy, which I enjoy. However... they just don't belong in pho. The noodles are totally uncharacteristic of real pho, and the veges are missing some important flavors (namely cilantro). On top of all that, the sauce to make the broth really tastes nothing like pho broth. I searched and searched for that cinnamon and star anise that you generally taste in real pho, and it's just not there.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's pretty easy to soup this up (pun fully intended). To get this to taste like a halfway decent bowl of pho like I'm used to, I add a few things. First and foremost, a hefty amount of sriracha sauce (I like my pho's broth to be a rich red, very spicy, but delicious). I also take some steak and slice it very thinly, layer it on the bottom of the bowl, and pour the boiling water over it and allow it to sit for 3-4 mins to get a nice med-rare cut of meat in there. While that's sitting, I dice up a good amount of cilantro and toss that in, along with a good handful of bean sprouts. Once that's all in, I put in a pinch of sugar (the sauce has a sour aftertaste if you don't), and then I eat. Sounds like a lot of work, but it takes me about 15 minutes to make a very filling bowl of "pho". It still isn't quite there as the broth is missing some complex flavors, but it's actually not bad. I would give it 4-4.5 stars after said additions are done.

review/summary: I'd rather have Nissin Cup Noodles
review/text: I'm no "pho" expert, but I've eaten a lot (I really mean a lot) of Vietnamese, Japanese, and Chinese noodles in my lifetime.  And I wasn't really expecting authentic Vietnamese Pho noodles with this item, but it wasn't even remotely close to resembling that or any other Asian noodles.  I guess it's a matter of individual taste and preference with these things.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste good either.  Not a lot of flavor, and what little flavor it did have I wouldn't describe as Vietnamese (or even Asian for that matter).<br /><br />I've also read a few reviews describing the portions as big, but it definitely was not.  Nissin's Cup Noodles taste better, are more filling, and a whole lot cheaper (but probably more unhealthy too).

review/text: I like the ANNIE CHUN'S VIETNAMESE PHO SOUP BOWL but it has a sour taste. I'm not sure what "Pho" should taste like but I've heard that it was really good Vietnamese soup.<br /><br />The other "Annie Chun" noodle soups that I've tried were pretty good so I decided to try this one for variety.<br /><br />They're easy to make, just add hot water and put in microwave, and the noodles are not dehydrated and dried like other "instant noodle" soups.<br /><br />The soup broth has a tangy flavor to it and it really smells good when you open the soup base package up. Try it cause they're great for a snack or lunch.

review/summary: The pho taste is there
review/text: It tastes like a milder version of the classic pho. The meaty smell is there for the broth. I would strongly suggest you to add hot sauce if you enjoy spicy food. Also, bean sprouts are a must add as well. The noodles were good, however, they could have been thinner, for a more authentic experience, but I do understand that it probably makes it harder to package/reheat. Anyways, overall, it is quite enjoyable after you get through the initial weird smell that comes out of the microwave, thanks to the above mentioned beef smell. I would buy this again.

review/text: I enjoyed this soup. Yes we would all like fresh Pho soup. If you are in the area that we live you will not find a Vietnamese restaurant for 100 miles. I made the soup and added fresh bean sprouts, fresh cilantro, fresh green onions and strips of cooked steak. This is a basic soup for you to add things to it....not to expect when you open it strips of steak are going to appear from the box. I recommend this soup as a starter to a great soup by adding fresh ingredients. Fresh things never let you down.

review/text: The idea is great.  I am a big fan of soup so being able to make a quick hot bowl very fast is great.  The packaging could not be better.  The noodles are not dehydrated like you find in most other quick soups.  They are soft and neatly contained in a seperate bag inside the bowl.  There are also separate small bags for the liquid flavoring and dehydrated vegetables.  This is a high quality product but for my personal tastes, it was simply too bland and delicate.  I did not enjoy this soup but will definitely try the other flavors.  The Korean kimchi had much more flavor and thicker noodles.

review/text: Bein an avid Pho indulger I had to try Annie Chun's version. I'm in the middle of no where, no local Pho restaurants here.<br /><br />Being freeze dried and not fresh I have to say it came a little close to the smell and taste of authentic pho. It was however missing the thin strips of steak, all the veggies, and of course the fresh noodles. It definitely quenched my desire for Pho. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. It's a good substitute, but would never truly be the real deal. I say go for it!

review/text: Compared to pho I've had at restaurants, Annie Chun's doesn't hold up. I'm not even going to bother. But compared to other instant noodle soups, Annie Chun's is light years ahead.<br /><br />The noodles are soft and moist in the package - not fried and dried. The sauce is liquid and just oily enough. And there is a healthy packet of dehydrated veggies. The instructions do involve giving the noodles a soak and then draining. This can be a hassle where the best you can manage at work is to heat a mug of water in the microwave. I'm going to have to drain the noodles in the bathroom. Yech... But the extra step will be worth it. And unlike other instant cups of soup, I actually feel satiated after eating - not just buzzed from the sodium!<br /><br />I'll definitely be getting more of these!

I definitely prefer Annie Chun's Soup Bowls to the greasy and overly salted take out around my college campus. However, other than it being better than the other choices I have, it's not that traditional and the tastes are a bit too strong for my liking.

review/text: The best thing about this pho bowl is the soup base.  It comes out of the package looking like a reduced beef stock - dark brown, thicker than soy sauce, and with fine particles of beef.  It's not chock full of MSG either so you don't get thirsty from it.  The noodles are mediocre.  They have a decent texture, but they're slightly sour and they make the soup sour too.  It's not enough to turn me off from this overall.<br /><br />Preparation is standard for Annie Chun bowls.  Loosen the noodles with hot water, drain, add fresh water and the seasonings, and nuke for 1 min 30 secs.

I, like another reviewer, prefer to take it up a notch with spice, and thought possibly I'd  be able to taste ginger or other mentioned spices in Annie's description of the soup bowl, but I could not. Nonetheless I would recommend and purchase it again, it was certainly tasty and even similar to restaurant Pho Soup I have eaten from a Vietnamese Restaurant. Added bonuses are the soup comes with an eco-friendly bowl and Annie uses all natural and organic ingredients.

review/summary: Quality Product, Not Suited For My Taste Buds
review/text: I've been eating Annie's Mac n' Cheese (not the whole wheat type) since 1994.  Amazon offers a excellent price (around $1.50 per box for certified organic, whoa!) and if I'm going to commit upfront to 12 boxes of mac and cheese, I figured I try to be a little healthier and get the whole wheat type.<br /><br />It is a quality product but it isn't suited to my taste buds.  I am surprised because I prefer brown rice and wild rice to white rice and generally enjoy whole wheat products.  But to this eater, the whole wheat shells were too heavy and chewy.  The watery white cheddar sauce enhanced the pasta's rougher texture and blandness.  (The white cheddar sauce is like an alfredo, and less creamy than Annie's regular cheddar.)  My friends love this stuff, but I think it's an acquired tasted.  If I had known what I know now, I'd have stuck with the enriched white (yet stripped of it's nutrients) shells or at least gone with the regular cheddar sauce.<br /><br />*Update*<br />While still not a full-on fan, I enjoying this product more now that:<br /><br />1.  Tastes much better when cooked 10-11 minutes at sea-level (the box recommends 8-10), the texture is less rough and gummy and is more noodle-y.<br /><br />2.  Adding fresh herbs with the cheese sauce.  It gives a depth to the flavor.  My favorite herb to add (so far) is cilantro (add about 1/3 cup chopped after mixing in the cheese sauce).  Other enjoyable variations were adding 2/3 cup of Italian parsley or 1/8 cup fresh dill leaves.

review/summary: A healthier choice -- and our kids love it
review/text: We've been struggling to move our kids from processed foods to healthier alternatives over the last couple of years, and Annie's whole-wheat macaroni and cheese has been a big element of our success in this campaign... They love the taste and we feel good about the nutritional value, the quality of the food, and the relative "social conscience" that the company espouses.<br /><br />By the way: it really is tasty stuff.  I try not to eat a lot of carbs these days, but I always steal a few bites when I make them lunch.  The creamy-cheese sauce is more reminiscent of a good, light alfredo than of the nasty, gluey, neon-orange stuff you get from the big brands, and whole wheat macaroni is mildly flavored (and therefore and easier transition for kids and processed-wheat addicts).

I prepared it as per the instructions and the sauce was runny and quite flavorless.  After one bite my son wouldn't eat any more and after I had a bite too, I couldn't blame him because it was just nasty.  I don't have any problems eating whole wheat pasta and neither does my son, but we couldn't eat this.  I am a firm believer that food can be both healthy and delicious at the same time.  This may be healthy but it is not tasty which means to me that it is not worth eating.  Try the Hodgson Mills whole wheat macaroni and cheese instead.  It is so much better.

Make it with a side of veggies (broccoli, sweet peas or a carrot). This works perfect for dinner as none of the kids are hungry before bed, something that was always a struggle. They really do like it. Whenever I make it there is never any left.<br />I do add the optional butter (real butter (unsalted)) to the mix as it adds a better smoothness to the cheese and a nice flavor kick. It is highly recommended that the cheese sauce is made separately. Cook the pasta an extra 2-4 minutes than normal, pre-melt the butter and warm the liquid in the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute (I make it in a batch of 2-3 depending on if the bring over friends). Then add the cheese packs 1 by 1 and mix with a whisk, until smooth. Since I do add butter I reduce the recommended milk by the same amount, otherwise it would be thin.<br />I cannot stress the importance of pre-making the cheese mixture, it makes a huge difference in texture, thickness and flavor (I guess it has to rest a bit before adding to noodles.

review/text: How do you write a review about mac and cheese?  If you are going to eat out of a box, go with Annie's.  I usually use yogurt or sour cream or thicken the sauce with some fresh cheese.  I put broccoli with it too.

review/text: Love the taste of Annie's organic Mac & Cheese. Plus it's a great source of fiber and is certified organic, making it a better alternative to Kraft and conventional brands. Serve it up with some steamed broccoli or a toss salad and you've got a nutrish and delish meal in a jiffy.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: My toddler son loves this mac and cheese.  My husband and I enjoy it too.  The whole wheat shells don't have an overwhelming wheat flavor and the cheese is mild.  I followed the directions on the box and it was perfect, not runny or gummy at all.  I will definitely purchase this again.

review/summary: Our favorite whole wheat mac 'n cheese!
review/text: My kids and I have tried several brands of whole wheat macaroni and cheese, and this is definitely our favorite.  You certainly can taste that it's whole grain, but we've gotten used to it and think it's quite tasty.  As a mom, I like that the cheese isn't florescent orange and is quite easy to clean up as a result.  A yummy, "healthy" mac 'n cheese delivered by your UPS guy at a great Amazon subscribe & save price...what more can you ask for?!

review/summary: Not bad, but a little disappointing.
review/text: I'm a big fan of Annie's Shells and White Cheddar (the purple box), so I figured I'd try this to see if it was as good. It's ok, but the whole grain pasta is very whole-grainy. It doesn't quite cook the same, the texture difference is very noticeable and the sauce doesn't seem to blend with it as well.

review/summary: there are better options out there
review/text: I've bought many Annie's products, including another type of mac & cheese, so I was expecting to like this item as well.  I eat whole grain pasta all the time and love it.  With this product, I think it was more the cheese sauce than the pasta that turned me off.  I found it watery and didn't think there was enough of it, although I'm not sure if having more of something I didn't really like would be an improvement.<br /><br />I'll stick to other kinds of mac & cheese and skip this in the future.

review/summary: THIS STUFF TASTES GREAT & IT'S CERTIFIED ORGANIC TOO !!!!!
review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: THIS REALLY MADE ME INTO A BELIEVER IN 'CERTIFIED ORGANIC' PRODUCTS<br /><br />Everything that one could want in a boxed 'Macaroni & Cheese' meal is in this excellent product from 'Annie's Homegrown'. Its ingredients are 'Certified Organic', with real cheese and whole wheat pasta. The rusult is a very healthy fast-food that tastes significantly better, creamier, richer and more satisfying than its processed counterpart and WITHOUT COSTING THAT MUCH MORE!<br /><br />I had never heard of this product until I received a sample of it in the mail several months ago. Now, I exclusively consume only this 'Annie's' brand Mac & Cheese, and essentially refuse the other major brands which do contain artificial ingredients. I have tried many of the different varieties that Annie's offers and have been universally satisfied thusfar.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY BUT I DO BUY AND EAT THIS STUFF]

review/summary: Best Thai Dipping Sauce
review/text: I bought this while I was in the US visiting my parents.  Thai Sweet Chili in general is my favourite type of dipping sauce.  And when I saw this on amazon, with garlic in it (my favourite cooking ingredient), I thought I'd give it a try.  What a lucky find!  This is amazing!  I use it on everything from egg rolls to prawns to chips.  And despite the fact that garlic is my favourite cooking ingredient, I've often come across dishes or condiments where the taste of garlic is too over powering (you can have to much of a good thing).  But they've gotten the balance just right here.  I'll be ordering up several more for family and friends when I'm next in the US!

review/summary: My all time favorite chili sauce
review/text: This sauce may seem a little expensive, but it goes a long way and it is absolutely delicious. Hot but not painful, with so much flavor and it's sweet but not too sweet. The garlic is there but not overly dominant. Awesome on fresh salad rolls, anything with chicken in it, great as an ingredient in peanut sauce,fried fish, etc., etc.

review/summary: Awesome Produce
review/text: My husband brought this home from Whole Foods.  I thought it was frippery, but it is the most delicious thing.  As a classical Chinese medicine practitioner, I only use this as a medicine (it's made from red chili peppers and garlic, which means it has very strong energetic properties), but wow what a medicine!  I use it to help chase out a cold or flu, and it works beautifully.  Better still, it's addictively delicious!  I don't dip anything in it, I just eat a 1/4 teaspoonful right off the spoon.  And I keep wanting another 1/4 teaspoonful!  YUM!!!!!!  Also, a single jar lasts forever.

review/text: Thai Chili Roasted Garlic by Wild Tymes is the best. I take an 8oz block of cream cheese and spread about 3 tablespoons of the Thai Chili on top and serve with Triscuit crackers. It has been very popular at my home parties. Plus the cream cheese cuts down on the spicy heat.

review/summary: Be careful
review/text: Are your cats getting sick? Mine were vomiting and I finally traced it back to the salmon cat food.  But it's not the salmon, it's the dye they put in the salmon. Some cats simply can't tolerate it.  Three of my seven were that way.  If you see this happening, there's a pretty good chance that your cat has an intolerance to the dye as well.
