review/summary: Best Gum
review/text: This is my favorite gum.  I suffered terribly from aspartame poisoning and it was good to find a gum that I could still chew.  Beware consumers - aspartame is in almost all gum - gum does not need to be sugar free to contain aspartame.  If you want to have good gum and still be healthy - this is a great gum.

review/summary: Gum that's good for you!
review/text: Our dentist recommended that we chew this gum 3 times a day after each meal because the xylitol kills the bacteria that causes cavities. It's tasty though it doesn't hold it's flavor for a long time - not a big deal. I would definitely recommend.

review/summary: Loses flavor too fast
review/text: I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Spearmint is among my least favorite flavors, beating out only peppermint. It loses its flavor within two minutes. That's not an exaggeration - you get literally two minutes of chewing pleasure. The main reason I prefer it to peppermint is that at least the spearmint goes tasteless, while the peppermint turns bitter.<br /><br />On the bright side, the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. At least I can chew this without having intestinal problems, which makes it worth two stars despite the lack of flavor.

review/summary: Healthy gum, but loses flavor fast!!!
review/text: I just recently bought this gum to help my dental grow stronger and healthier.  Now for pros and cons to my point on this product.<br /><br />Pros<br />Gum with only Xylitol as sweetener.<br />I do like Spearmint taste.<br /><br />Cons<br />The flavor is week, sometimes I have to just chew on two pieces or more to help increase flavor.<br /><br />Overall There is some flavor of it, but it isn't strong enough.  I am glad it's not to strong.  So this product gets decent 3 stars for health but lose 2 stars for lack of flavor lasting.  So I well buy different brand of xylitol spearmint gum, but however I will buy the Spry peppermint gum since I do like peppermint gum and people don't seem to have flavor lacking of product.<br /><br />Thank u for reading this review.

review/summary: One of the best products, ever
review/text: I did not appreciate the damage sugar left on teeth could do until I got cavaties as an adult. I chewed regular gum through high school and had to stop because of the pain. I also had terrible breath, which only spurred my chewing habit.<br /><br />I am so glad I discovered Xylitol,<br />and especially as found in Spry. I am a student and can't afford dentist visits so I've taken my dental care into my own hands. I now brush more often and longer, and floss as well, but these aren't activities practical to perform when eating lunch away from home, so I use Spry for any occasion where a toothbrush isn't convenient.<br /><br />For the past 7 years,<br />I have used this gum to clean my teeth after eating and anytime oral bacteria begins to proliferate. A few years back I stopped using it and I began noticing pain again, and discovered cavaties had cropped back up, so I returned to the regimen. This gum has actually stopped the growth of my cavaties (read up on Xylitol -- it does Not act like regular sugar). So naturally, I am in love with the product. I imagine I will continue to rely on it until I graduate and can afford a decent filling.<br /><br />What's not so fun:<br />No this is not regular gum, so don't expect it to be. If you're looking for long-lasting, flavorful chewiness, then you may be disappointed. And when the gum starts to go soft in your mouth, be ready to spit -- when it starts to break down, it gets down to business. Be ready if you're in public; swallowing it can leave a burn in your stomach. But you get used to what it feels like and just make sure to get rid of it before too long.<br /><br />Anything it lacks as a gum is compensated for more than 1000 fold by the health benefits for your teeth and mouth alone.<br /><br />I pack my bulk purchased Spry in little bags/containers of my own; it feels appropriately more personal considering how personal I find the product to be.<br /><br />At $.05 per piece, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />--Alexis<br /><br />I like all the flavors but the fruit is a little too frooty, like kid's gum.

I don't care if it looks whiter when I take it out of the container because they added the titanium dioxide.  I dont want something like that in there.  Looked up titanium dioxide on wiki and it doesnt look like a desirable ingredient.<br /><br />Could of been a great product.  Too bad.<br /><br />The use of food colorants bedevils me.  Why add crap like that to foods.  Let them stand on their own color merits.

review/summary: It tastes good
review/text: I've used this, mixed with a splash of heavy cream, to flavor my coffee for the last couple of weeks. I've tried all kinds of syrups and extracts, but this is the only hazelnut flavor that has been as tasty as the CoffeeMate Hazelnut creamer.<br /><br />My only problem is that there's no list of ingredients anywhere on the label...or on the Amazon page...or on the company's website. The main reason I'm trying to get away from CoffeeMate is because of all the artificial ingredients, so without knowing what this stuff is made of, I personally have little reason to continue buying it. And it ain't cheap.<br /><br />If you don't care about artificial ingredients or high prices, I definitely recommend this stuff.

So we can and do use it in ice coffee, and we can now make our own flavored water with out having to pay the overly high price.

review/text: Seriously, I just made these cookies and this is the BEST mix I've used since going GF...and I've tried a lot of mixes. I came to amazon directly after trying the first batch in order to see if I could subscribe to this product and to write a review about how amazing these cookies are. I want to devote an entire cabinet in my kitchen to house this mix so I am never without it. These cookies actually spread out as they bake with only a little pat before heading into the oven - usually you have to mold the dough into the 'cookie shape' before you bake.<br /><br />One thing - the package says they should bake in about 12 minutes - mine were perfect at 8 minutes, not sure if this is across the board but just a heads up. I hope this company comes out with many more products - they are currently number 1 in my book.

review/text: Blackcurrant products all seem to be imported, in this case from France.  The price is reasonable for an import.  The term "Jelly" is a bit misleading in this case because it spreads more like jam.  Refrigeration is recommended after opening.  It has an expiration date on the side of the lid that is hard to read.  The product is mainly blackcurrant juice and sugar.<br /><br />Blackcurrants are high in antioxidents, are said to reduce the effects of arthritis, and have a yet-to-be-determined anti-cancer quality (presently being tested).

review/summary: Even my husband likes it
review/text: Husband wanted to start drinking green tea.  No not the lipton kind.  Found some expensive brands locally (at a tea store and at a farmer's market) and purchased to try them.  So glad I looked on Amazon.  Those other teas (also available on internet) go for $7+++on up for 2 ounces while this 8oz Boston Tea is 4x as much for only 2x $$.  Not trying to "cheap out", just evaluating a new tea we want to drink and actually will drink & not stay in the cabinet.  Needed to stay decaf.  We liked this brand of tea just as much as the others.  In fact, served it to my husband before we ran out of the other more expensive teas, so he did not know the $$ details and he thought it was just as good if not better.  Would definately buy again and will purchase any other green/decaf this vendor may have available on Amazon.  P.S.  we weighed the contents of the package & it was more than 8oz.  I point this out because not all the other teas (3 different packages of the two ounces) did not weigh 2ounces, in fact only 1 of them did while the others were closer to 1.5 ounces even though packages stated 2 ounces.

review/summary: SPICED Green Tea
review/text: The title of the tea on the Amazon page hints at the fact it is spiced, but it is far more explicit on the bag. Anyway, it wasn't what I was looking for but I haven't taken any stars off for my mistake. My problem is that I really can't taste any of the green tea in this tea, though there is plenty of it in the bag. Its an okay flavored tea that might grow on me the more I drink it, but for now I'm a bit disappointed.<br /><br />----<br /><br />After drinking this tea every now and again since I originally wrote the review, I'm pretty sure it has caffeine in it, so that sort of defeats the purpose. With that in mind, I've dropped the score of this tea from 3 stars to 2.

review/text: I tried these at a festival in Austin.  The BBQ flavored are fantastic (cheddar cheese were v. good too), but they are not in all the stores yet.  I've been eating the plain black bean chips and the pinto chips which are both good with dips and salsas, but the flavored chips are great right out of the bag.  Hope they are on the store shelves (& Amazon) soon.<br /><br />Who would believe a healthy chip that tastes great?

review/summary: Not Awesome
review/text: I don't know how this stacks up against the Keurig brand drawer but I would hope for the price difference that it is a little more sturdy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- We have a B70 and it barely fits on this from front to back.<br />- The whole drawer unit itself does not lay flat with the machine on straight, so I turned the machine diagonally so that it would not wobble.<br />- The drawer does not open smoothly at all, it is very rough and is probably scraping paint off the bottom of the drawer. I'm hoping after it has been used a million times this will improve.<br />- If you try pushing the thing on the counter the little white rubber feet come out. I'm glad I did it before I lifted the machine onto it because I would not have been happy to dump my new coffee toy over.<br />- I feel like it could be a lot sturdier since it is meant to hold a $100+ coffee maker on it.<br /><br />There are a couple pros though, that earned the 3 stars:<br />- It does hold 36 k cups. I read reviews on other products that don't actually hold the number of cups that it claims. At least this one really does.<br />- The black color matches the machine nicely.<br />- It gets those bulky boxes of k cups off of the counter. I still have partial boxes to stow somewhere (since I wanted more than 2 varieties in the drawer) but at least I don't have to keep them handy.<br /><br />All in all I would not buy it again and still might return it. It was cheaper than the other drawers I was finding but I feel like I got what I paid for. Sometimes it's worth a few more dollars to get something a little better.

review/text: I had several of the carousel type K-cup holders. When I saw this, I knew I could get rid of those and make more room on my counter. This item does just that.

review/text: The frame of this is what holds the weight, and holds it nicely.  The rest is slightly flimsy.  The sides actually are kinda plasticy, and the top is a thin sheet metal.  That aside, with my Keurig Platinum it works just fine and it opens without any catching.<br />While putting in the k-cups, I find that alternating upside-down & top-side-up helps fit more into the track.

review/text: I like this drawer, it is well constructed, nothing is flimsy on this product. It's lightweight and easy to move around. My coffee maker fits on the top of it and if water spills on this drawer, its easy enough to wipe off. I bought this in addition to the 3-drawer stack (also sold by Nifty) and it holds all my k-cups. I tend to order in bulk and had a problem storing all those k-cups and of course rotating them with my teas and cocoas in my standing k-cup holder. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their k-cups in reach and don't have a lot of counter space.

review/summary: Does the job but cheaply made
review/text: So I read the reviews before and saw ths issue of the hieght of my counter and my Keurig vs adding this drawer. I measured it out and there was going to be enough room to actually allow my Keurig to function. However, once I recieved it, I realized I have to slide it out every time to make a cup of coffe. The drawer is oddly measured because my K-Cups fit inside with about half an inch of slack on each row. So when I do slide my Keurig out, the cups slide. Also, the rubberized "feet" underneath got caught on my granite countertop and I've already lost one. Since it was lopsided and not condusive to holding my $200 coffee pot, I just removed the rest of them. Now I have to try to pick up the thing to move it out or it'll scratch the counters. Honestly I might have to just give up on this and settle for something else!

review/summary: Perfect for us
review/text: This was the perfect K-cup storage option for us.  We live in a very small apartment with a galley kitchen and almost no counter space.  I had tried various ways to have the K-cups easily accessible and at the time of this purchase, we had them in bins on top of the refrigerator which wasn't that convenient.<br /><br />We have the Breville Keurig and it fits perfectly on the drawer.<br /><br />I'd say there are only two downsides.  The first is that the drawer has little rubber feet that rest on the counter top.  If the drawer moves at all, the rubber feet tend to pop out and the only way to get them back in is to take the Keurig off of the drawer - not an easy feat.<br /><br />The other is less of a downside for the product, but something to keep in mind.  Our Keurig sat underneath our cabinets.  When we put it on top of the drawer, there was not enough clearance to open the top.  We had to move the entire machine forward so that we were able to actually open the top and put the k-cups in.  Again, not an issue with the product, but if space is a limitation, you should make sure you will still have enough clearance to use the machine.

review/summary: Works perfectly!  Another slide-out solution.
review/text: I just got the 36 cup drawer, and it works perfectly.  My full size Keurig fits on top with room to spare.  The drawer works smoothly.<br /><br />However, as others have said, there is not enough room to open the Keurig to put a K Cup inside, when pushed back under the cabinet.  The drawer has 4 non-slip "feet" on the bottom, that grip the counter.  Some have suggested putting a thin cutting mat under it, so it is easy to pull out.<br /><br />I decided to try something else.  I got 3/4 inch self-stick felt pads (the kind used under furniture to protect scratching the floor).  These work really well.  Now the whole thing slides out easily, and then back under counter to save space.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PB11NY">Waxman 4718595N 3/4-Inch Self-Stick Round Felt Pads, Oatmeal</a>

review/summary: Nifty 36 coffee pod drawer
review/text: Okay, okay , everyone has said it all....... Well not really.  It works perfect for what it does. It holds the PODS!  It also makes the coffee maker closer to the cabinet so you can't open the coffee maker under the cabinet....  Here is the fix.......  Buy a 18x24 flexable cutting board and stick it under it.  You can slide the entire unit in and out any time you need to make coffee.  You can also use the cutting board for cutting a lime or something else.  I use it all the time in my wet bar in the basement for parties and everyone said oh how ingenous.  You can cut the cutting board to any size and it works perfectly. The cutting boards are available here on Amazon.  I couldn't find them anywhere in the kitchen stores locally. I'm so happy with drawer now that I have this fix.  No more worries about trying to pull the Keurig maker out with the drawer under it and having the little rubber feet falling off the drawer.  Nuff said...  Works like a charm and the wife loves it too!!!  LOL

review/summary: Great space-saver.
review/text: I bought this product to go with a Keurig coffee maker for my husband for Christmas.  We have limited counter space, so this was the perfect solution for keeping the K-cups close at hand.  It is well made - there is NO issue that this drawer cannot hold the weight of the machine.  The only thing to consider is the space between your counter and cabinets.  Once the machine is placed on top of the drawer, you may not be able to open the machine the whole way.  In my kitchen, it's just enough to put the K-cups in and out although it will not open the full way.  That's something that you should consider when determining if this product will work for you.  We love it.

review/summary: You can fit 42!
review/text: This thing is a god-sent. It practically takes 0 extra room since it fits under the Keurig. Same footprint. It's also reasonably priced. There are other brands that make this same exact drawer and charge a lot more.<br />A lot of people may say... why spend the extra money when you can just keep the K cups in the boxes they are purchased in. Well, if you only buy a few different types of K cups, that may be true. But if you are like me, and have multiple upon multiple varieties, it is nice to have a bit of each in this drawer and not have a zillion boxes cluttering up my valuable counterspace.<br /><br />I think my only con to this is that the drawers are not smooth sliding drawers. Sometimes you have to shimmy the drawer a bit. But that holds true for those 'other' pricer versions as well.<br /><br />Also... you can actualy fit more than 36 in this drawer. I can fit 42. If you alternate between storing each K cup top side up and bottom side up in each row... you can fit 1 extra cup in each row. However, I don't think all of the rows are exactly the same size. One of the rows is a bit snug.

review/text: I bought my wife a Kuerig (sp?) coffee maker for her birthday and she told me to purchase this K cup drawer or else! Glad she "suggested" I purchase this along with the coffee maker, as it sure beats trying to find a place to store the K cups. It is solidly built out of steel and functions as advertised. It does not sag under the weight of the coffee maker and the drawer slides easily, it does not stick or hang up. If you own a K cup coffee maker buy this, as you will not regret the purchase, and you can take that to the bank.

review/text: Absolutely fantastic. I don't like clutter and this storage drawer takes up just a little more space than that Keurig. Does raise the height of the coffee pot So keep that in mind if you're putting it under a cabinet. I did And I only had to pull the pot away from the wall about 3 inches. I even bought a second for a friend

review/summary: Measure Carefully!
review/text: Overall, I am very happy with this drawer.  It is nice and sturdy, and fits under the full-size Keurig machine with no signs of buckling, etc. from the weight of the machine.  There is enough room left over on the top of the drawer for me to put the sugar canister beside the Keurig.<br /><br />I was really hoping to clear up some counter space with this, by having the k-cups stored beneath the Keurig, instead of in a rack beside it.  In the end, however, I wasn't really able to save any counter space, because there is now a lot of wasted space behind the Keurig/drawer.  In order to be able to open and close the Keurig k-cup compartment on the machine with it sitting on the drawer, I had to pull the drawer and Keurig machine closer to the front edge of my counter, so that the k-cup compartment opens in front of the overhead cabinets, because it was hitting the bottom of the cabinet and wouldn't open enough to get a k-cup in there with the drawer pushed back against the wall!  Unfortunately, I have overhead cabinets over all my counters, so there is no way around this for me.  If your Keurig sits on an island counter, or other surface without a low-hanging overhead cabinet, this probably wouldn't be a problem for you... but to be safe, I'd measure how much clearance you have above your machine (with the k-cup compartment open) and subtract about 3.5 inches from that space for the drawer.

review/summary: Coffee K-Cup Drawer
review/text: This drawer holds 36 K-CUPS, and you can set the brewer right on top of the drawer. The outside measurements are 13-1/4 WIDE AND 12-1/2 LONG. It is black in color and has screen mesh inside of the drawer. The mesh on the bottom is not to strong,so don't push to hard, or it will bend, and the drawer won't slide.<br /><br />I give this drawer medium stars.  Jim in Ohio

review/summary: Outstanding & Practical
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UC0GIU">Nifty 36 Coffee Pod Single Drawer</a> This little drawer perfectly organizes my K-Cups. The Keurig Machine sits on top of it, and there is even room on the side to keep my sweeteners handy. The drawer slides open easily and makes choosing a k-cup easy. I'm thinking of getting another one because I have way more than 36 k-cups at any one time.<br /><br />Height is not an issue for me, although if I were to get an additional drawer I might have difficulty opening the cabinet, since the Keurig sits in front of the cabinet, not underneath it. With just the one drawer, there is enough clearance to open that cabinet door.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this drawer as a space saving way to organize all those k-cups.

review/summary: Perfect organizer for our K-cups
review/text: We buy our k-cups in bulk, and it was becoming a pain to run into the pantry every time I just wanted a cup of coffee!  This little number fits under the k-cup machine and cuts down my runs to pantry to just once or twice a week to refill the drawer.  Perfect!<br /><br />One thing (more of a warning than a criticism): when I bought it, I measured the height of the keurig and the height of the drawer to make sure that it would fit under my kitchen cabinets.  I forgot to account for the space the keurig needs to flip open!  Luckily for us, it fits nicely under our traditional coffee machine.  Otherwise, it would be useless to us.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that it won't be perfect for everyone, depending on the layout of your kitchen, etc.  But, for us, it's one of our favorite purchases.

review/text: I don't understand why they couldn't have made this a little taller to allow for the drawer to glide .  It's a nice looking product, holds more k cups if you put every other one upside down, and the coffeemaker fits perfectly on top.  So why doesn't the drawer slide in and out easily? We will use it anyway, but are disappointed.

review/summary: I adore the Nifty 36 Coffee Pod Single Drawer
review/text: I have a Keurig K-Cup Home Brewer and it fits with space to spare on this 36 pod drawer that I received for Christmas. On one side I leave my K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter kit out and on the other side I have a small tea cup filled with 5 different flavored liquid creamers and personally I don't feel it's crowded.<br />I do like the little "lip" on the base it is nice for catching little spills like when you are adding water to your machine.<br />I was concerned as well with the metal catching my counter tops, so I placed a drawer liner underneath it and that worked like a charm.<br />With it being metal, I have to say I personally like the durability of it. We have multiple coffee, tea, coco drinkers in our home and we use the drawer daily. During the month of December we could feel the metal on metal, but over time and now in March it's smooth and there was no noticeable loss of color.<br />I adore it, it is space efficient and very "jazzy" looking.

review/text: I'm thrilled that I went with this style of display. The coffee is hidden but so conveniently located and doesn't take up additional space on your counter. My only tip, it does raise your coffee pot up, so if you have low cupboards,the combination of this and your pot, won't fit under the cupboard.

review/summary: These hold K-cups just like they're supposed to
review/text: I really love this product. I ordered it because I have very little counter space and I was going to place this under my coffee pot. I have the Mr. Coffee Keurig pot and it's only an 8oz option coffee pot (unless you do a smaller amount of water) so it's not a large pot. It didn't even cover the whole top of this drawer so I had room next to it. I've solved this by placing some coffee enhancers (like powdered creamers and other powdered flavorings) next to the coffee machine. They fit very easily right there.<br /><br />I noticed that someone had said they could fit extra k-cups into their drawer by alternating one up and one down. I found this annoying as I couldn't see what all the flavors of coffee were being stored in the drawer. I could only fit one extra k-cup per line in the drawer anyway so I didn't find this needed or unnecessary.<br /><br />So if I enjoy it so much, why knock it down by one star?<br /><br />I noticed that the drawer is bent just slightly. It's a sturdy drawer, but it's not as sturdy as it could be it seems, the wire bent in slightly more one one side than the other. It would be nice if it had been made out of slightly stronger metal that didn't bend as easily.
