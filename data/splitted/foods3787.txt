review/summary: Not Strips---Pieces Ready for Recipes
review/text: This is a fairly large bag of Wakame---a good price for the amount. The product is not strips, but is small individual dehydrated pieces ready for rehydration. No cutting or chopping required unless you want smaller pieces. When rehydrated, it turns nice and green with the typical rehydrated Wakame texture. This is a quality product.

review/summary: WHERE has this been all my life?
review/text: Let me get something straight, right from the get go. FOR ME, after experimenting, BY FAR the best way to get this ready for consumption, is to add CHICKEN BROTH and NOT WATER. Find a container large enough for 3 cups of dried kelp and a full 32 oz container of chicken broth, put the dried kelp in first, and pour the broth on top, (I let it soak in the fridge over night). I initially tried simply plumping it up with water, as one reviewer recommended. Suffice it to say it was like trying to eat the Pacific Ocean, as that is precisely what it tasted like. By soaking in the chicken broth, it is not only palatable, but down right tasty. Thus far, I've only used it as a (sublime) soup base, but the possibilities are seemingly endless. What are you waiting for? Take the plunge! It will have you smiling like the proverbial Cheshire cat :)

review/summary: Exactly what I wanted only more of it than expected
review/text: I love seaweed; it's low calorie, high fiber, and highly nutritious.  Wakame tastes great and I really didn't have a clue how much 35 ounces really was until I got this.  Be prepared that one ounce is a lot of seaweed once it rehydrates.  I add this to miso soup, rice, and I even just eat it by itself.  You can also eat it dry, but I can't since I'm on a low sodium diet.  For anyone else on a low-sodium diet be aware that if you boil a good amount of water, remove from heat and add the seaweed, most of the salt ends up in the water and not the seaweed.

review/text: I never thought I would like seaweed, but it rehydrates into green leaves like spinach, has a subtle ocean smell, and tastes surprisingly good. The best news is how good it is for the body. I steam it along with brown rice and either use it as a side or put it in soup. Great product.

review/summary: Excellen Buy
review/text: My first venture into purchasing freeze-dried Wakame, I have been very pleased with this product. I bought it primarily for making Miso soup. It is certainly good enough for other uses as well. Hydrated, this turns into nicely sized, pretty green, squarish pieces. The taste is excellent and it is not at all salty. After hydrating it, I just give it a quick rinse and voila - ready to be added to my miso! This is an enormous bag and should last quite a while. I would definitely but this again.

review/text: I like wakame, and it is super good-for-you. I make a simple soup. 35-ounces doesn't seem like much, but it fills more than a gallon jar. It doesn't weigh much. I've had it for almost two months now, and I have some in my soup almost every night. I just put some water, rice, meat, spices, wakame and veggies in the microwave and cook it up. Wakame expands in water. It's a dark green after it's cooked up. Of course, it is seaweed, and looks like it.....

review/summary: Finely chopped little bits, NOT whole leaf wakame
review/text: I tried to look up information about this product on the Emerald Cove website before I ordered this wakame, but did not succeed in finding what I needed.  I am used to fairly large leaves of wakame in my miso soup.  This wakame is TINY BITS in the package.  It would be helpful if the seller defined "Ready-to-use" and posted this information since Emerald Cove has not.  I ordered this because I did not want wakame from the NE Japanese coast where, before the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the world's best macrobiotic quality wakame was harvested.<br /><br />I spoke with Great Eastern Sun who has the Emerald Cove brand.  They assured me that this wakame is 1st quality and that they have tested for heavy metals and pollutants, as it comes from a large bay off the coast of north-eastern China.  The tiny bits swelled up to perfect bite-size pieces after putting them in boiling water.<br /><br />In addition to grabbing heavy metals in the body, wakame prevents hyaluronic acid in the skin from breaking down so fast.  This acid keeps skin youthful.

review/summary: Sea vegetable
review/text: Wakame is a pleasant, mild, slightly salty, tasting sea vegetable.  It helps to maintain an alkaline balance in the body, and is an excellent source of iodine. However, when I ordered the Emerald Cove brand of wakame, I wasn't aware that their product is imported from China. Since I have concerns about the quality and processing of food products from China, I recommend ordering wakame from an importer who obtains it from another country. Five stars for high quality wakame.  Zero stars for food products imported from China.

review/summary: Favorite Fish Tacos!!
review/text: After being introduced to fish tacos in California, I was determined to duplicate the recipe at home. I had tried a number of variations with different seasonings and types of fish. I decided to give this seasoning a try and it is now a family favorite!  It has a lighter flavor than regular taco seasonings, with more of an emphasis on herbal/citrus notes (which I emphasize with lots of fresh lime juice).  I tend to use tilapia most often, but it also works well with catfish, salmon, and trout. Enjoy!

review/text: This 100% pure organic sweet potato puree is slightly tart, so it can be used in many recipes--like sweet potato pie or casseroles--without adding lemon juice.<br /><br />For a fast side dish, dip a couple of tablespoons of puree straight from the can, stir in a little of your favorite sweetener and spice and serve.<br /><br />Cover tightly before refrigerating the leftovers--air causes the puree to discolor.<br /><br />Overall it's a tasty and very handy way to add a nutritious super vegetable to your meals, plus it works great in classic sweet potato recipes.

review/summary: Different than I expected
review/text: I purchased this product for two reasons.  First, that the product is organic.  Second, that sweet potatoes were out of season.  So, for those reasons, this is a great product.  However, I felt the puree was really liquidy.  I assumed it would be more like pumpkin puree.  Having a soft, solid texture.  Also, it has a little twang after-taste.  I felt the butternut squash puree had a similar after-taste.  I was not familar with this type of puree product.  I had always used Libby's canned pumpkin puree or homemade puree.  So, it is possible it was simply my expections due to product comparison.  It did make excellent sweet potato pies, but I was not happy with the other recipes.

review/summary: Brand is otherwise great, but Amazon sent me a batch with Black Mold
review/text: I buy this brand from a local store in bulk.  I was trying to save myself some time and hassle by buying it through Amazon (about same price either way as my local store).  But after this shipment (and a totally separate different food item shipped from Amazon *on the same order* that also had health/quality issues), I cannot recommend buying this from Amazon.<br /><br />I was sent the case pack, wrapped in heavy plastic which was packaged neatly in a cardboard box.  When I pulled out the plastic-wrapped case, it was extremely obvious that these cans had burst... and had done so some time ago b/c an enormous amount of black mold had grown inside the plastic wrap.  Why this wasn't caught by their people, I don't know.  (I'm on "prime"; so, I get my shipments in 2 days or less...not enough time to have the mold grow that much.)<br /><br />Anyway, I did open the plastic surrounding the case of cans to inspect further.  I found that at least 4 cans had burst, and, of course, the stench was horrible.  I tossed the entire batch in the garbage.  There was no way I was chancing my family's health on this one.<br /><br />NOTE: (1) This item was fulfilled by Amazon, not a different seller.  (2) The boxes in which these were shipped was not damaged, not even a small dent.  (3) The cans were not dented, either.  This case was not damaged during shipment.  Whatever caused the cans to burst appears to be the result of an error during "Farmer's Market" manufacturing.  Furthermore, my assertion is that Amazon's people should have noticed the obvious black mold.<br /><br />[Edited to add: Initially (and after talking briefly with a doctor/scientist about these cans), I was given the impression that the burst cans were a result of botulism.  The scientist is the one who used that term with me b/c it had not occurred to me prior to the conversation.  Alarmed, I used the term in my original review w/o referencing the aforementioned conversation.  I have since removed the term.  Regardless, black mold is toxic (more so than green molds), and this experience was health and safety issue.]<br /><br />I will say that Amazon did give me my money back without a major hassle.<br /><br />In my experience WRT household/grocery items, it appears that Amazon gets good pricing from companies for stuff that doesn't meet that company's upper level quality control standards.  Besides all the great books, toys, electronics and more, I order several household items from Amazon.  Most of the items in this "household/grocery" category aren't edible/food items. I do notice minor differences in quality on these other household items.  For the most part, I can overlook them.  But on food?  No way.<br /><br />(To be clear: Other items such as books, electronics, toys have usually been just fine.)<br /><br />To sum up, when I say "tread warily" I'm suggesting that you just be careful and pay closer attention than you otherwise would when you order this (and perhaps other food items) from Amazon.<br /><br />Your experience may vary, and I hope it does.

Being a fan of shakable drink mixes like this, a fan of lemonade in general, and the low price of $0.50 for a box of twelve, I figured what the heck?<br /><br />The bouquet is lightly lemon with notes of lilac. The initial flavor is semi-sweet and lacks any bitterness or acidity. It then bursts into a delightfully playful tartness which gracefully fades within a few seconds. The mouth feel is completely clean. Little to no aftertaste.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, inexpensive lemonade-style drink mix from Turkey which quenches thirst with pizazz! Definitely buying another box.

review/summary: A Real Kick.....Order In Multiple Units
review/text: This Cajun blackened seasoning is one of my latest additions in a long line of Barry Farm products I have used.  Being an avid hiker from way back has me packing away a lot of these dried seasonings and such for delicious one pot meals over an open fire.  This Cajun blend is definitely a cut above the usual beef or Italian seasonings in its intensity.  It really has a bite to it that very well could be a little much for some people. I like it for it is so different than much of what else I have as to seasonings, but I definitely have to be in the mood for it.  A Cajun stew made over an open fire will either have you all fired up for a 12 mile hike, or lay you out starry eyed, so beware. : ) I suggest that if you like or are familiar with Cajun seasonings you use this sparingly at first nonetheless.  For it is most definitely a saucier, more robust blend than anything you will find in the spice aisle of your local market. Worth a try for the heartier among us for sure...<br /><br />About the only thing I have against this and many other Barry Farm products is the relentless high shipping.  A few of the more familiar or main stream products come with free shipping when bundled. However many like this blend come with a shipping cost far to expensive for just one pouch. Like all other Barry Farm products, I suggest you either order a 2 or more at a time, or bundle it with other Bary Farm products to make the shipping worth it.  It doesn't go up much at all with multiple units.  As for this Cajun blend, it is very spicy and flavorful and I recommend it.  Sometimes...: )

That isn't white chocolate. It's "coating" or some other product marketed as WC. Toss that stuff in the bin and treat yourself and guests to this real white chocolate. Used in WC/Peanut butter ganache truffle, truffle dip, dipped strawberry gelee candies and cake balls. All awesome!

review/summary: Bad Service
review/text: The order took 29 days to get to Hawaii.  When it finally got here, it was packed in a flimsy box. The boc itself had grease all over it. When I opened, there was no packing material and everyone of the 8 bags was open from the bottom.  The chips were all over the box and they were stale because of the open bag and the time it took to ship. This is not a reflection of the chips which are normally great but don't order them from here.

review/summary: No better Salmon seasoning on the market.
review/text: I found this by accident at Costco.  They no longer carry it but I am hooked.  I saw it for sale in Ketchikan AK a few weeks ago.  Ketchikan is the self proclaimed salmon capitol of the world.  Whenever my wife chooses her special meals, it includes salmon with this rub on it.  There is nothing that comes close.  No oil just put the rub on and put it on the grill.  I like to start it on indirect heat and finish it over the heat.

review/text: This is a great product, in the past I was able to purchase this rub from my local grocer and I have always enjoyed it on my salmon, but lately I was unable to find it on the shelves, after trying many other rubs, that just didn't measure up, and being dissapointed in the flavor, I went to trusty ol' Amazon.com and viola! there it was for purchase, needless to say I was very happy to find it, and aslo to find it in a larger size, which actually saved a little money.  All in all I was a happy camper to finally locate my favorite salmon rub, I highly recommend it.

review/text: My local gourmet grocery USED to carry this product - which is how I got hooked.  My parents also love this rub - it's super consistent - skin the salmon, brush with butter and add the rub - grill and eat.  I ordered the 16 oz tub for my dad as a Christmas gift - it was probably his favorite thing I got for him.  If you've not tried it before, buy the smaller tub - but my guess is you'll be back for the 16oz!

review/text: Tortuga Caribbean Banana Rum Cake is moist and delicious, but I like my rum cakes to be soaked in the liqueur.  I didn't expect this cake to have as much rum as I'd like, but I'd hoped there would be more than there is.  There is a light rum flavor, and the banana taste comes through beautifully, though.  As I said, it's a very moist cake, and really does taste great.  I'm glad I gave it a try.

review/text: My family and I received a Tortuga chocolate rum cake as a gift several months ago, and it was delicious.  Very rich, great texture, a real treat.  After that good experience, I sent my brother a banana rum cake for Christmas.  He said it was amazing and he and his family and friends really enjoyed it.  SO...  I just bought one for myself.  Have also tried the regular golden rum cake and was delighted with it, as well.  Tortuga rum cakes make very nice gifts for any occasion.

review/summary: Higher Quality Brand Name Rum Cake.
review/text: I purchased 2 flavors of Tortuga Rum cake in the same order, this one and Key Lime. By far this one was the better of the two. The banana and rum combination works very well together with neither flavor over powering the other. I found myself coming back for more and more pieces. I also was very impressed with the quality of the vacuum sealed packaging, which was a step up from other cakes I have ordered. I am going to order more Rum cakes, this and another flavor. The only drawback that I can inject would be that I can see how others feel these cakes should have had a little more rum to it, but at the same time it would also needs a little more banana to rebalance it. But at the same time you have to factor in that this is a brand name rum cake and not those original Caribbean Restaurant rum cakes. You want one of those then I suggest you fly down to the Bahamas, Jamaica, Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico to get the Original Restaurant Rum cake. If you have not made up your mind which flavor to start off with, I think you really cannot go wrong with this one.

review/text: The soda siphon works like a charm. I like seltzer water and club soda, but I can't find seltzer or club soda less than 99� per liter. I can buy cola all day long for 68� per 2-Liter. Without the color, flavor and sweeteners that just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />PRO: I can add a single-serving packet of powdered drink mix for a flavored seltzer. I put the mix into a couple of ounces of water in the bottom of a bottle, and then just discharge the seltzer made with very cold plain water into the bottle.<br />PRO: It's super easy to use, maintain, clean, and store.<br />PRO: I can make 1 Liter for less than 10�.<br /><br />CON: There are no instructions except the mechanical type of "insert this, screw that in". Nothing about the dangers of using 12 gram or 16 gram chargers. Excessive pressures are very dangerous.<br />CON: The CO� goes into the water as the instructions say it will, but the "peppy fizz" is minimal. It would probably be ok for making bar drinks, but it's not an acceptable replacement for soda.<br /><br />All-in-all it's good, easy and convenient, but it's not for making drinking soda.

They are very easy to keep in my pocket for long periods of time, which is difficult to find if you are also looking to give your dog something both healthy and tasty. They smell strongly enough that my dog will work for them, but not so strongly that I notice the smell.  They also don't leave too many crumbs in my pocket. The treats are already small, but I use a serrated knife to cut them in half for my small breed puppy.

review/summary: One of the best dog treats around
review/text: I lover Liver Biscotti.  Well - not really love I suppose and it's not like I eat it myself! I used to sell this stuff over ten years ago and I had a rapidly growing online pet business.  I met the owner at a pet product show in Chicago and he was so enthusiastic about his product that I had to try some.  Now - my dog was my "product tester".  It was love at first bite! Our dog would sit, roll over, speak, beg - every trick he had in his bag of tricks just for a cube of Liver Biscotti!  I wasn't the largest retailer of the product, but I sold a lot and never had a complaint.  Even after I sold the business, I would purchase Liver Biscotti for our dog because he loved it so much!<br /><br />There are two sizes now.  The small bite size is most definately for small, even tiny, dogs.  The cubes are barely 3/16" on each side.  The original Liver Biscotti cubes are larger, about 3/8 in size and I would advise that they are more suitable for a dog over 8-10 lbs.  Biscotti, just like human biscotti, is dry and crunchy.  If you're looking for a moist treat, try something else. These are great trainign treats because you can keep them in a pouch on a belt and they won't stick together or mold.  However, if you leave them together too long with much movement, they may crumble somewhat.<br /><br />I believe the newer bags are a slight improvement over the original paper bags.  I didn't really ave a problem with the origina bag, but I suspect that the newer bag (since it has a "zip lock" will remain fresher longer.  Not every dog loves this stuff, but a lot of them do.  Try a bag and if it works for you, I've seen an option (here on Amazon) by some sellers to go on a monthly order basis.  I'm not sure that would work for me, but it might for some.  Good luck!

Biscotti, to me, brings to mind the kind a human would get in a grocery store. These are the tiniest bits of crumbs I have ever seen! I expected to be able to use these as training treats for my 58-lb English bulldog...he leaves crumbs bigger than this behind when he eats a biscuit! These are too small, also for my 20lb French bulldogs! The dogs seem to love them, but just be aware of the size of the individual pieces. I am posting a picture as well.

After placing the entire box in the fridge and opening up one of the packages I found that the Reese's Minis had all melted into one big clump (so much for a bite sized snack). I was planning on giving these out at a meeting and now am stuck with a pack of 16 melted candies. I gave it an overall 2 because the candy itself is probably still good but Amazon should take into account that some of the candy that gets shipped during the summer COULD MELT. I am usually pleased with the overall packaging of Amazon products, but WILL NOT be ordering food from them anytime soon. I WOULD ADVISE ALL PERSONS INTERESTED IN THIS PRODUCT TO NOT ORDER IT DURING THE SUMMER, unless you want a giant melted down mess of a product. :(

review/text: I added the photo on this page. I'm from Miami originally and miss the paella we used to get cheap there, in the 70's. But who can afford to buy saffron, it's the most expensive spice in the world. And the few local restaurants here in Denver, that serve paella, get about $20 a plate for this dish! Then one day, I was searching around and found this product. 5 saffron packets. So we get 5 lbs of chicken thighs at Walmart, cheap, and add rice, a tablespoon of cumin, onion and garlic to taste, perhaps a beer of your preference, as part of the water for the rice, and some shrimp ( and/or other sea food of your choice ) about 20 minutes from the end of the cook cycle. Absolutely delicious!

review/summary: Bitter Tea
review/text: I had high hopes for this tea when I placed my order, however after a month it is still dissapointing. It seeems no matter what amount of time I brew this tea for, or vary the amount of tea I am using it is very bitter. Using sugar or honey does not help the situation. I have purchased Davidson's tea before, and have been very happy with the quality of tea. I think perhaps I got a bad batch. In the future I will only purchase tea that has been well reviewed by others.

review/summary: Decent Value for Great Rice
review/text: I really like Jasmine rice but locally it is usually cost prohibitive OR comes in huge quantities. This is a happy medium and delivered right to my door. It's a welcome change to the rice selections at the grocery store. For those the use rice as a gravy vehicle, this is too good for that, any old rice will do.

review/text: I was happily surprised how good the rice turned out: didn't stick and had a decent firmness.  We use Zojirushi rice maker, gold standard as far as I am concerned.  And the rice turne out perfectly with 1:1 rice to water ratio.  To get the clean, no sticky rice aspect,you do need to rinse the rice out three times with cold water!  A trick of my family.  No more heckling to the super market, as a solid rice eater, I am suitably impressed.

review/summary: Amazing Rice! Bug problem...
review/text: This rice is the best rice I've ever had and its a shame I never tried anything other than American rice for so long. Perfect rice just like out of the best resturants every single time with my cheap rice cooker. I would rate this 5 stars but the rice sometimes comes with a bug problem... I've ordered dozens of bags in the past year from amazon and about 25% of the bags have tiny dead bugs in them.<br /><br />Apparently its quite common for bugs to be in rice, though I had never seen any until buying this brand. They are harmless though and float to the top as soon as you add water so you can scoop the 5-6 out and cook as you normally would. But if you dont want to do that be prepared to throw away a quarter of the bags you buy.

review/summary: This rice is nice!
review/text: Funny reviewing something so basic, but this jasmine rice is great! The bags are a good size, last quite a while. I use this rice in my cheapie rice cooker and it turns out perfect. I don't bother rinsing it beforehand because 1. I'm lazy and 2. always seem to end up wasting rice because it falls into the sink! Because I don't rinse it, it sticks a little but the best way to avoid that I've found is to let the rice sit in the cooker for a few minutes after the timer goes off. I think the steam from the pot loosens whatever is stuck to the bottom. :)<br /><br />Anyway yes - basic, but delicious rice. We recently ran out of it and had to resort to using that plain, long grain white rice from the store. Blegh. Much much much prefer this jasmine rice! Recommended! :)

review/summary: Awesome jasmine rice
review/text: I wanted to get some rice.  Just plain rice.  Not parboiled, not "enriched", just rice.  Well, try walking into your local market and finding that.  Anything that was just plain rice was ridiculously expensive.  I like to support our local co-op, but I also can't afford to pay what they charge for organic rice - at least on a regular basis.<br /><br />My first choice for rice would usually be basmati or jasmine.  This rice is just what it says it is - fragrant, plain jasmine rice.  My wife and I love it, my kids love it, so that's all that matters.  We have a small rice cooker and it's a no-brainer.  Turns our perfect every time.

review/text: Wow, what a fantastic rice.  No need to go back to anything else.  As foodies who cook at home alot, but always in a hurry with three kids, this is just to simply wonderful. We prepare this rice using a basic rice steamer (1 cup rice to 2 cups water or stock -- No seasoning needed!)<br /><br />This rice is amazingly aromatic; sensual and heady.  The texture is soft, not mush or too sticky.  You will want to fluff it, nuzzle it and just sigh with pleasure.  It even keeps well in the frig and reheats nicely.  I never thought rice would excite me, but, I am in love.  This rice is so easy to prepare.  If you don't have a rice steamer yet, buy one. For something that seems so boring to add to a meal, all I can say is "Awesome!"

What a deal at Amazon!  My son prepares a wide variety of rice dishes on a regular basis, so I shared one of the two 5-pound bags of Jasmine rice with him.  I followed the directions on the bag and the rice was light, fluffy, and had a delicious flavor.  I store it in the original bag in a plastic storage bin.  It was packaged well and arrived two days after I placed my order.  Thanks again Amazon!

I owe my fat ass to these chocolate chips, along with the inability to have any sort of portion control when I have a bag in the house.  The store I go to tends to sell out of these frequently, apparently others need to maintain their enormous ass size too, that, and others probably appreciate these tasty little chips. So it would be great to be able to order these by case from Amazon.  Though if you try them you might not want to have them in bulk in your home.....

review/text: This is the only yeast-free and gluten-free bread I have found. It can't really be compared to regular bread, but that being said, it is not too bad when it is toasted. You have to turn the toaster up pretty high to get it to brown, but it makes decent toast and toasted sandwiches. I have come to actually like this bread after complaining about it initially. And I feel so much better from avoiding gluten that I know I will have no problem eating this bread from now on.<br /><br />I like the Brown Rice Loaf better than the White Rice. And there's a bonus, the bread is vacuum-sealed and can sit on the shelf for months (You'll need to refrigerate it after opening).<br /><br />If you are desperate for bread that has no yeast or gluten, I would recommend you try this. If you can have yeast, there are better breads out there (such as Pamela's Wheat-Free Bread Mix).

review/text: To make real bread, one needs yeast and gluten.  As a baker, I tried this bread on a whim.  It is completely different than the bread I bake or even the garbage that passes as bread in a grocery store.  However, if you cannot digest gluten or yeast, this bread is much better than any one could make at home.  If one toasts the bread (really toast it to a deep golden color) it is a great vehicle for other flavors and has a nice texture in a sandwich.  I cannot stress the importance of toasting enough.  Cold and alone, it is bland and dryer than dry, but it has real potential with a little heat, Vegenaise and fresh tomato and basil.

review/summary: Great Toasted! But still dry..
review/text: Can I just say, first, that if you haven't tried yeast-free bread yet (and you have gluten or wheat allergies/intolerance) you really should... about a week after eating this I felt SO much better physically (and I'm not "classically" allergic to yeast or anything).  So it's worth a try just for that.<br />  As for the taste, I LOVE almost anything really toasted, so this bread is pretty good for that.  But, as with most gluten free breads (except for one brand that I can't remember the name of right now.. but it starts with a "U" I believe..), this bread is HORRIBLE untoasted.  So don't plan on eating it with a sandwhich or anything (untoasted) because you will, like, choke.  As long as you have a glass of something nearby, you will like this bread.<br />  And so far, Amazon has been the cheapest way to buy it (in bulk, anyway), and health food stores sell it for like $6 a loaf (since it's yeast-free, it seems to be a little more).<br /><br />So Long story short... if you eat gluten-free, it's worth a shot...but if you're not used to gluten-free breads in general, don't start with this one)<br /><br />Hope this helped!

review/text: It is a good product! I am so happy I found the bread without gluten, wheat, corn, yest, milk and sugar in it - it is hard to find. It tastes good when toasted.

review/summary: best to eat after toasting
review/text: This is a bread that might take getting used to at first because, as a previous reviewer remarked, it's not the same as "regular" breads, but I've found it really has the best texture and taste when lightly toasted.  I don't recommend trying it without toasting it, as the consistency is doughy and the taste bland, but it does taste and feel much better after it's toasted lightly.  If you toast it to a dark level, it'll have that "burned" taste.  It's a good product for those on restricted diets because it allows you to enjoy a sandwich again!
