review/summary: Crumbly soft deliciousness
review/text: My family has a history of celiac disease and right now my condition is very mild, although I prefer to stay clear of all wheat and glutton that I can.  When I bought this mix I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was thrilled with how they turned out.<br /><br />The first tray came out about three minutes after it should have, but the cookies were still soft, golden, and crumbly.<br /><br />If you feed these to people who don't know that they're made with rice and potato flour, then they'd never know the difference.  The only mark that these are not wheat cookies is a slight tang in the taste.  It's minute and goes away after a while, but it's definitely there.  Most would probably just take it as something to do with the vanilla extract, probably.<br /><br />Seriously, these are totally worth trying out.

review/summary: Great Chips!  Poor Packaging!
review/text: I really love these chips and have a tendency to buy in bulk.  Best for time, effort and the cost is typically better.  So, I purchased 12 bags!  Well, I open the box just recently and grabbed one bad only to realize that the seem on the back side of the bag was not sealed.  I took out another bag and realized that the 2nd bags seal was not sealed properly.  We have a quality issue that I have not addressed with the retailer or manufacturer.  I will do so this week!

review/text: I don't have a coffee maker at home, so I rely on instant coffee to get my weekend coffee fix.  The trouble I had with instant in a jar was that the coffee seemed to get stale and oxidize over time.  These single packs are very good quality coffee and are individually sealed so they stay fresh.  I also bring a few packs with me when I travel so I don't have to use the suspicious in-room coffee makers in my hotel room.  Rich flavor, good strength, and always fresh.  Good purchase.

review/text: This is an excellent way to add flavor to anything you would usually use regular mayo for.  This is gluten free, sugar free, and no fillers or thickeners.  Adds just a touch of lemon tartness to tuna salad, deviled eggs, and even grilled salmon. Not a replacement for mayo; more of an enhancer.<br /><br />Was so excited to find this on Amazon.  It is always out at our local market.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o gluten, sugar, filler, and thickener free<br />o wonderful flavor<br />o smooth and creamy - just like regular mayo<br />o excellent for anyone on the SCD (Specific Carbohydrate Diet)<br /><br />Cons:<br />o it is always sold out!<br /><br />Overall - my family loves Lemonaise.

review/summary: Waaaay Cheaper at Whole Foods (Crazy, Right?)
review/text: First off, this is a STELLAR product. Just opening the box and taking a whiff of the tea makes your eyes roll to the back of your head. And the taste of it is...pretty amazing. I get mad sugar cravings after meals and this usually does the trick to suppress them.<br />But the price here really throws me off. One box for $5.99 PLUS shipping is an extraordinary ripoff. I got a box at Whole Foods last night for $2.49. At WHOLE FOODS. If some vendor is marking this up more than double than at the Markup Emporium that is Whole Foods, something is wrong.<br />So, please shop around! This is a product that is definitely worth the little extra effort of finding a better deal.

review/text: I admit, I was a little reluctant to try a tea flavored like sugar cookies. Would it just taste like sweetened water? But everyone was raving about it, so I figured I had to try. And it ended up being SO delicious! I'm having a hard time describing it except to say it tastes just like sugar cookies. And you know how you get those sweet cravings after dinner? This tea could seriously stop those.<br /><br />You need to try this! The price may seem a little crazy with shipping, but it's definitely worth it. This stuff is really hard to find in stores (trust me, I've been trying for 2 years!) and the Internet may be your only option.<br /><br />It will put you in the holiday spirit :)

review/summary: So Delicious that you'll want more than one mugful of this tea!
review/text: This tea is very tasty and has a wonderful, velvety texture in your mouth.  I am not sure how Celestial Seasonings accomplished this, but they have created buttery softness and wonderful sweetness in this enticing and aromatic caffeine free holiday tea.  Pair this with turbinado sugar and you have a delicious and soothing hot beverage.  I found this for $2.49 after the holidays at my local health food store.  Now I will have to stock up on more.  There are three other teas in the holiday selections - Nutcracker Sweet (with caffeine), Sugar Plum and Gingerbread Sweet (both caffeine-free herbal teas) and Candy Cane Lane - caffeine free green tea with other flavors.<br />Nutcracker Sweet is a flavorful mix of black tea, vanilla and other spices.  It has a little bite as compared with this flavor - most likely from the addition of black tea.  I have yet to try to the three other flavors.

Maybe I'm just desperate for a cookie, but this tea tastes like the "real thing."

I did not like it all and ended up taking it back to the store where I bought it. Luckily Wegmans let me return it. I also only paid $1.99 for a box. If you are used to drinking vanilla tea then this will not compare. It has a wierd flavor to me and even smell. I tried one bag with just water and another with cream and sugar and still hated it. Regarding the price I can not believe it costs this much on Amazon. I suggest checking your local stores at Christmas time and stocking up if you like it. Wegmans in upstate NY has it and it is only October.

I wasn't quite sure about this tea in the store, it sounded weird to have tea that tastes like cookies.  As soon as I opened the box the scent was amazing, just like sugar cookies.  After having my first cup with a touch of cream and a teaspoon of sugar, I was hooked, this is the best most unusual tea I had ever had.  In the first couple days I craved it all day long and had like 3 cups a day.  I highly recommend this tea, if you can't find it locally then it's worth the splurge to buy it online.

Taking them off a life-time of dry food (little did we know how bad it was for their health) was not easy at first, but with Merrick, they both love the turkey and the chicken. The obese one has lost weight and looks great. He went from 24lbs and is now down to 18.4lbs. The skinny one has maintained his weight.

review/summary: The ONLY non-nonsense commercial cat food on the market !
review/text: I've been doing some research on best cat food, and apparently cats as obligate carnivores fair much better on eating exclusively meat. And, since they don't usually have a strong drive to drink, even though they need plenty of water, they also fair much better on eating exclusively canned food.<br /><br />So, going through a variety of food, I've noticed that even the so called "grain-free" food, contains BS ingredients like "cranberry" or "carrots". So, really, whom do they try to appeal, the cat or their gullible owner who thinks that if eating veggies is good for people, they must be also good for cats. Plus, even "grain-free" diet contain broth and liver. The cats may like it better than just plain meat, but it's not best for them. The best meat for cats is pure, bland meat.<br /><br />So while may be inferior to raw diet (though much more convenient), Merick Before Grain, is the best canned food I could find for my cats. Since it (1) has no grains (2) has no BS marketing ingredients (i.e. fruits & veggies) (3) Contains just meat, not meat by-product, liver or broth.<br /><br />So, do my cats love it? Nope. Did they it initially ate it? Nope. But with some patience, and some creativity (like mixing with other food) they start eating it. Reluctantly. Do they love it now? Nope. Do they eat it. Yes: slowly and reluctantly. So here's another benefit of this food (4) Cats (at least mine) don't choke themselves until vomit eating it. They eat it slowly over a period of stretched time. Like overnight. And that's good for them: to eat slowly over a stretched period of time (since that's how they eat in nature).<br /><br />Most people are running back and forth, worrying if their cats hasn't finished their canned food within an hour. But people need not worry leaving cooked canned meat for many hours, since cats often eat decomposing carcasses in nature and are ok, they will be certainly ok eating canned meat that was left there for a while. Healthy cats have strong stomachs with an acidity so high that it destroys most food-poisoning bacteria.<br /><br />I do give my cats some variety, like Wellness Grain-Free canned food which they love(even though it has some BS ingredients, liver & broth). But this food remains their  staple diet.<br /><br />Now, a note of caution: even though there are 6 varieties of this food, I recommend only three of them to be fed on regular basis: 1 Chicken, 4 Turkey & 5 Quail. On occasional basis 2 Salmon & 3 Tuna are ok, but fish may trigger allergies in cats, and fish was not in regular diet of cats' ancestors. For that matter I would be cautious with 6 Beef as well, since cats haven't evolved to pray on Cows, and I don't think the red meat is very healthy for them.

review/summary: Tasty Juice
review/text: I've been buying this juice concentrate for months now (at the supermarket) and I love it. The price here is a little more than what I would pay at the grocery store, so I've decided to keep buying it this way. I just had to say something about the poorly-researched negative comments here.<br /><br />Pasteurization is not "nuking". It has nothing to do with radiation; it's just a heating process. The juice is heated before being sealed in the can to kill any microbes that may be present. Many food items that can be stored at room temperature before opening have been pasteurized.<br /><br />Since you add your own water to this concentrate, the quality of your water determines the quality of the juice. If you have heavy water or a detectable amount of chlorination (like in city water), it's probably not a great idea to make juice mix with it. It isn't going to taste right.<br /><br />Additionally, since you mix it yourself, you determine the concentration (sweetness) of the juice. I typically dilute the juice to 64oz of water instead of the recommended 48oz. For one of the other two flavors, there's a one-star review that complains about the sweetness level of this concentrate. I cannot begin to describe how wrong this is. Maybe the reviewer drank the concentrate directly out of the can.

Afterall, this is 100% juice.<br /><br />So what's in this stuff?: NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS - FLAVORS OR SUGAR ADDED!<br /><br />Apple Juice, Grape Juice, Raspberry Juice (Water, Juice Concentrates) Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Citric Acid. It is the combination of juices in this blend that makes this taste like a treat. For children and adults too, who like the sweet taste of soda pop or sweetened punches, this product represents a much healthier and palatable alternative.<br /><br />For providing this excellent, anti-oxidant rich alternative, as a compromise between healthy beverages and sugar sweetened drinks, I feel that "Juicy Juice Fruit Berry" has easily earned a five star rating.<br /><br />Now if only there were a way to decrease the amounts of natural sugars without affecting the taste?!<br /><br />WHAT IS THE "JUICY JUICE" BRAND?:<br /><br />Libby's "Juicy Juice Fruit Berry, 46 fl oz" is part of a larger family of 100% juice products that has taken aim at the huge market share that Coke and Pepsi have carved out for themselves. Their target market is the youth of America. That, more than anything else, makes this and other Libby's products important. I first became aware of this targeting when I was watching the PBS program "Arthur" with my youngest child (who is named Arthur). At the end of the show there was a message from Libby's that said, "Juicy Juice Is Proud To Support Arthur". Since then I have regularly supported their 100% juice products, although I drink more of them than our Arthur does. Surprisingly, most "Juicy Juice" products are significantly less expensive than "Ocean Spray" and "Northland" juices, though I still buy some of those varieties as well.<br /><br />THE INEVITABLE COMPROMISE:<br /><br />Though many critics and health advocates have pointed out that fruit juices are naturally high in sugar and after processing, including pasteurization, lose many of their healthful properties, they still represent a healthful alternative to soda for children. Surprisingly this seems to be a controversial statement, but 100% juice [with a little Vitamin C added] does help to engender healthful eating habits which begin with the choice of beverage. It is also a good source of potassium and is an excellent thirst quencher.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that all of these juices taste very palatable to kids, probably because they are blended to taste sweet without any added sugar. Of course, it would be better to make your own juice, avoid pasteurization [made in a very clean environment], and include the natural vitamins, minerals and pulp, but who really has time. What's more, do you really think a child would drink such a homemade healthy brew? In the meantime, there is "Juicy Juice" and our children will most probably drink that thereby avoiding soda.<br /><br />LOOKING FOR MORE INFO?:<br /><br />To find out more about this product, see their website at "juicyjuice" on the world wide web.

review/text: .....SUBTITLE:  READ THE E N T I R E....DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY OF ANYTHING<br />  YOU BUY!<br /><br />JUICY JUICE has a reputation for being 100% juice.  Always!  No additives, preservatives....and even no extra sweeteners!  It is<br />also often regarded as a children's beverage -- and to me, that<br />means the manufacturers have taken EXTRA care that the product is<br />as good as can be.  After all, no manufacturer wants to be accused<br />of giving health problems, (now or in the future), or even out-<br />right poisoning, children!  To me, a product specifically made for<br />children, (and/or usually associated with children's eating or<br />drinking it), is often, (but not always), an inexpensive way to get<br />gourmet -- or almost gourmet -- quality food at a good price.<br /><br />I've had Juicey Juice before...and enjoyed it immensely.  But -- the<br />Juicy Juice I have heretofore imbibed was the "real McCoy", (no, no<br />-- NOT the Chief Medical Officer of the original Star Ship 'Enter-<br />prise' -- but 'real McCoy" as in the "genuine article".  THAT Juicey<br />Juice, (forget which flavour), came in a large BOTTLE, and had to be<br />REFRIGERATED.  But wow....did it taste good!  : ),<br /><br />Yet, any bottled juice contains a LOT of water.  So -- why not buy the<br />concentrate, and add your OWN water?  It should cost less this way --<br />why spend money on water you can get out of a tap for, (almost) free?<br />(Excluding the ubiquitous water tax, in most instances.)  As I<br />trust only my own, home-made distilled water, buying the concentrated<br />Juicey Juice seemed to make sense two ways -- if not three.  (1. I<br />used my own home-distilled water, 2.) Ounce for ounce, re-constituted<br />concentrate HAS to cost less than juice in big bottles and 3.)  It left<br />more room in my refrigerator....AND on my shelf.<br /><br />For this is not the usual FROZEN concentrate, you see.  It is "un-frozen<br />concentrate."  That doesn't need to take up valuable space in the<br />freezer -- or even the refrigerator, at least till it is opened. On top<br />of all this, it is all-natural Juicey Juice.  How could I resist THIS<br />bargain?  How could I miss with it?<br /><br />Well -- as soon as I opened up a can, (admittedly fitted with a very<br />convenient flip-top), diluted it as per instructions, and tasted it --<br />I KNEW I had "missed".  And missed Big-Time.  The flavour was absolutely<br />AWFUL!  It tasted as if MEDICINE, on top of the WORST-tasting of CHEMICALS, including a LARGE dollop of MACHINE OIL!  I definitely believe it could send many crewmen TO Dr. McCoy's sickbay on Star Trek.  It surely made ME feel sick!  I was also shocked and saddened.  In oomplete disbelief, I looked at the ingredient label again.  It said:<br /><br />  Apple Juice Concentrate<br />  Water<br />  Grape Juice Concentrate<br />  Natural Flavors<br />  Raspberry Juice Concentrate<br />  Ascorbic Acid, (Vitamin C)<br />  Citric Acid<br /><br />Nope -- nothing wrong with the ingredients.  No motor oil, either. The<br />ingredients -- they were all natural, as always advertised.  And this is a juice usually served to CHILDREN!  Cofusion<br />mixed with great disappointment filled my mind.  I began to wonder<br />about the poisons I have heard that occur naturally.  Poisoned mush-<br />rooms, perhaps?  But no mushroom of any sort was listed amongst the<br />ingredients.....<br /><br />Were my taste-buds going into pre-mature old age, perhaps?  SOMETHING<br />has to go first, according to the popular view.  NOBODY reaches 90<br />without SOME loss of faculties -- or almost nobody, anyway, so most people suppose. I guess I've been lucky in meeting mostly youthfully<br />-minded and spirited 90+ year-olds in my life. But not everyone is that way, even I must admit.  But YIKES....I'm nowhere NEAR 90. (yet, anyway.)<br />I sighed.  Better my taste-buds go first, than my eyes, or my legs...<br /><br />I tried drinking it straight.  Then, more diluted than was called for.  Ulgh, and double ulgh.  Then with the proper 3 cans of water to one can of Juicy Juice dilution.  Ulgh!  No matter how I tried to make it, the flavor didn't improve.  At all.... ):<br /><br />Still disbelieving, I looked again, this time VERY CAREFULLY at the label.  And I noticed something written there I hadn't noticed before.<br />T H I S....P R O D U C T....I S....P A S T E U R I Z E D..( ! )  Not even written in small lettering -- but this notice WAS below all the other information on the label....<br /><br />Pasteurized!  In common slang, "nuked". I suppose, being a NON-FROZEN<br />ooncentrate, SOMETHING had to be done to the Juicey Juice to keep it fresh.  I've heard that Vitamin E makes a dandy preservative -- but it probably is MUCH more expensive than nuking -- excuse me, pasteurizing! -- the Juicey Juice.  I mean, pasteurization really doesn't harm the juice, as far as health considerations go.  But -- it DOES make the juice taste like motor oil -- and USED motor oil at that!<br /><br />So, I guess I'll go back to either regular bottled juice, (including bottled Juicey Juice), or FROZEN concenrate.  (As much as admire the tv series ALIEN NATION, with Tenctonese aliens who drink sour milk, eat newspapers, and adore cooking all kinds of bugs -- this unfrozen Juicy Juice concentrate is NOT to my (Human) taste.  Sorry.  Then again -- I wonder if even a fictional Tenctonese, (and former slave), could stomache this stuff either.  Motor oil is NOT something evem the Tenctonese imbibed on the show.......<br /><br />I wish the taste of Juicy Juice Non-Frozen concentrate could be changed.<br />But I doubt whether even a pound of sugar in each 11.5 ounce can could help.  (Before buying this, I was disappointed to see an extra .5 ounce had been eliminated from the usual 12 ounce can.  But after drinking the stuff, I was immeasurably grateful it had been taken off!<br /><br />I knew I could not throw it out.  I had paid money for it, and I was not brought up to be wasteful.<br /><br />Yes, I knew I had bought this....this ....stuff...and the taste was....well, on a score of<br />1-10, it was about a 3...so I knew I could, and would, finish all 12<br />bottles of concentrate, for I was not brought up to waste things.<br />However......no one was telling me I had to drink them quickly.  Pain<br />is sometimes better when it's spread out.  Maybe....I could stretch<br />this stuff out, drinking a few ounces a week, to lessen the pain of<br />drinking it all at once?  Maybe drinking it while watching my favourite cable channel -- the SyFy channel -- would lessen the blow....?  No, I suddenly thought -- drinking this horrible-tasting liquid whilst watching the SyFy channel, of all things, was definitely NOT a good idea.  Maybe....I could take it better watching a comedy?  A musical?  Or better yet, a musical comedy?  Then, THE perfect time to drink this this...juice...came to me.  The time when I felt not worse, not scared -- but at my best.  The day AFTER I file my income taxes!  And maybe on my birthday, and the 4th of July....when my happiness could, perahps, overwhelm the complete awfulness of the taste of this...this...stuff. Maybe I could pass it off on some friends, during a Halloween party?  No -- I like and value my friends to pass THIS stuff onto them.  Hmmm....maybe as a "gift", should I ever need to give one, to my ex-brother-in-law?  (This guy once told me: "You are 6 years younger than I am, and I'll never forgive you for it", amongst other choice morsels.  He has always had a chip on his shoulder as big as the Grand Canyon.)  Hmmm...maybe not. If I give him THIS, that chip on his shoulder may get as big as a crater on the moon!...<br /><br />It's amazing how GOOD regular, bottled Juicy Juice can taste -- and how totally awful this unfrozen concentrate is.  But at least I know the reason WHY now.  The old poem has it WRONG: "Their's was not to reason why, their's was just to drink....er, do....or die."  I looked at the can, and I now KNOW why it tastes so BAD.  (The information about this concentrate being pasteurized is also on the Amazon description of it,<br />but it is NOT highlighted, so it's easy to pass by.)<br /><br />Well, live and learn.  Hey.............I've got it!  Instead of executing criminals, they should have to drink this stuff, at every meal, for a year.  I don't think every criminal will beg for the death penalty after this....but many surely will!

review/summary: Hands down best popcorn you can get outside of a theater
review/text: I often wonder if I am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn.  Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy.  Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet.  Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.<br /><br />Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi-plex (though I really like target popcorn too).  You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers.<br /><br />Each pack contains 5 pouches of product. Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty). For those that like additional butter, you can add it after popping.  While I cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded, it does do a good job of filling up my 32-cup Tupperware Thatsa bowl.  Thatsalotta popcorn.<br /><br />The unit cost is $1.66 per pouch, which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn, but you just cannot compare the quality and taste (and when compared to theater popcorn, it is a fraction of the cost). Orville Redenbacher has nothing on Wabash!

review/text: Great popcorn!  I'm a repeat buyer too.  One pack makes just a teeny bit more than my Whirly Pop can hold with the lid closed.  The kernels pop big and have a great flavor.  The hulls are farely tame for big kernels. My only suggestion for Wabash Valley Farms would be to boost the butter flavor just a smidge.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but popcorn popped on the stove top is so much better than microwaved.

review/summary: This is as close to movie theater (or disneyland) popcorn as you can make at home!
review/text: I have ordered this product twice.  The box contains 5 packets inside, and each packet contains the liquid oil, the flavored salt, and the popcorn kernels.  Easy to make and surprisingly good, far better than any microwave popcorn and I have tried many brands.  You can make this in a large cooking pot with a lid.  They suggest you use something called a "Whirly Pop Popper" but its not necessary to buy that.  I have a gas stove, so so I set the heat to medium, pour in just the the oil first, let it heat a few minutes, then I drop in the salt and kernels.  Cover and gently shake a few times during popping and enjoy.  My family agrees this is the real deal.

review/summary: An Excellent and Healthy Choice for Anyone's Diet
review/text: A quality product from Bio-familia, a Swedish company that developed "Bircherm&uuml;esli" a product so popular and successful that made the name Muesli famous all over the world.<br /><br />If you need a high fiber and protein snack option for your diet, this is absolutely a very good product. You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of six this comes at a good value. The fact that this cereal is low-fat makes a good product even better if you are trying to lose some weight or wanting to keep in shape.<br /><br />Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 6-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.<br /><br />Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape game<br /><br />My own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:<br /><br />- "Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.<br />- "The ABS Diet", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.<br />- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).<br />- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).<br />- "Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.<br /><br />If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.<br /><br />I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.<br /><br />Get this 6-pack of Low-fat Muesli to help your 6-pack ABS.

I usually have one cup cereal, one cup light or nonfat milk, and sliced fruit. It makes a terrific breakfast or lunch. I've ordered the six-pack many times and still enjoy the flavor of this cereal. Highly recommended.

review/summary: 4 Grams of Fiber
review/text: I love the fruit and nuts!  Honestly, they taste like they are freshly roasted.  And they are generously provided in each serving.<br /><br />I subscribe to this cereal and receive an added 15% discount.  Love that!<br /><br />Most cereal in this category delivers 5 grams of fiber, and I prefer 6-8 grams.  That's why I rate it 4-stars.  I increase my daily Metamusel intake by a couple of grams to compensate!<br /><br />I sprinkle some ground flax seed to top it off, this adds a touch more fiber too.<br /><br />Very chewy and a serving is rated at 2/3 cup, so this is a verry dense cereal.  I soak it in soymilk for 10-15 minutes before eating, makes it a bit easier to chew.

review/summary: Familia Low Fat Museli
review/text: Have been eating this breakfast cereal for several years and think it's excellent.  It's not particularly sweet and has great crunch that holds up to the milk down to the last mouthful and it doesn't feel twiggy.  I also think it's good value per ounce compared to the usual grocery aisle cereals which are horribly overpriced.

review/text: Lentils have one of THE lowest Glycemic Indexes of any food and are SO good for you.  I was happy to find this product and have set it up on automatic delivery for once a month.  We eat a lot of soups and stews and it is easy to add a bag of these lentils that don't have to cook nearly as long as regular lentils and they add so much to the dish.  I have been telling my friends about them as I haven't seen them at the grocery stores.  Fine product.

review/summary: Not generic cornflakes- healthy gluten free crunch-
review/text: Please note: These are not your generic store brand cornflakes. They are high in fiber (from psyllium) and low in salt for those who care. With only a "hint of golden syrup" from cane sugar, the flavor may seem bland to many people, but I find it to be a nice departure from the overly sweet and/or high sodium cereals on the market. Nutritional breakdown for 1 cup (50 grams!- note most servings are 30g) calories: 190, 2g of fat; sodium: 3%! dietary fiber 20% (5g) protein 3g; iron 15%. These are sturdy little flakes, like tiny little clam shells and hold up well in liquid. I would definitely recommend and for those who want to spice it up- add some bananas/dried fruits and yogurt or other dairy/non-dairy beverage- great start to the day!

Order it from Amazon or a reputable seller and you will be satisfied. In comparison to other tablets, this has a higher concentration of ACV, you can definitely smell it when you open the bottle.

review/summary: Nothing helps my IBS faster or more effectively!
review/text: It is unfortunate that the previous reviewer seems to have misunderstood that this tea is for medicinal purposes. If you suffer from IBS, this is the fastest and best way to get relief from bloating or painful gas. It is true that it is not the tastiest of teas, but I am personally not a fan of fennel anyway.  However, when I am in pain from my IBS, I will gladly (even gratefully) drink this tea.  It has been a serious blessing to me and an absolute staple in my kitchen/medicine cabinet.  I used to suffer for hours with no relief from any other product/medicines, but this (as well as the Peppermint Tummy Tea that I drink many times a day, which is VERY yummy, by the way) has really changed my life dramatically.  Thank you Heather VanVorous!!!

review/summary: Best Salsa I've ever tasted
review/text: I started buying this salsa about 2 years ago on a whim. It was a little more expensive then I would normally buy, but after the first bite I knew why. This salsa has a heavier texture than most and pairs well with a thicker chip. It's not spicy, but it does have a full flavor. Occasionally I noticed an extra kick of vinegar, but this varied bottle to bottle. My only problem is that I am now hooked, but many of the supermarkets around me stopped carrying it. If you find some and want to splurge a little this is a great way to do it. My only warning is that it's hard to go back to other salsa's afterward.

review/summary: Superb quality flax seeds
review/text: I bought this item based on health reasons, reviews of the product here and all the great information on the internet about the benefits of adding flax seeds to my daily diet.  I also bought a mini coffee grinder just for this product.  At first I tried to chew it, ugh... it takes a lot of hard work, I felt like a cow chewing cud and the flavor is extremely, uh... earthy.  So instead I ground it up in my new coffee grinder and added it to yogurt, YUM... the earthy flavor is gone and a nutty wholesomeness is added to my yogurt.  I add it to everything and it makes a great addition to my healthy diet.  The seeds look fresh, clean and healthy.  They almost looked too perfect with a nice shiny shell.  The freshly ground meal smells very clean and definitely has a nice nutty bite.  There is about more or less a year on the expiration date on the package that I received.  I would recommend this specific product to anyone who wants to add a bit of health to their daily diet.  I'll more likely than not be ordering more of this stuff in the near future at the rate that I've been chowing down on it.

review/summary: Awesome once you get the mixture right!
review/text: I disagree totally with the above posters but knew what I was looking for from the start. I discovered a circle k with this drink in a granita machine and loved it so much I was there everyday. Their machine broke down about 3 weeks later and 2 months later it's still not fixed. Of course in the days of Internet, ask and ye shall receive! You do have to mess around with the amount since a gallon at a time is obviously not often needed but once you have your 'recipe' down it tastes great and the energy boost is better then any canned energy drink I have tried. I am assuming it must be my own body's need for b vitamins though. Different energy drinks seem to affect each person variously.

All I wanted was a Tang Energy Drink Mix. I've been experimenting to discover the right portions for a water bottle, no luck. So I really can't speak to the Energy Boost, B Vitamins OR Caffeine, BUT I can speak to the weak lemonade flavor described by the other reviewer...he's right!<br /><br />I was expecting Tang with an energy kick.

review/summary: Elixir of the Gods!
review/text: I discovered Tang Energy on a road trip to Charlotte, North Carolina to see Flogging Molly.  Me and my fellow travelers stopped at a convenience store to both use the restroom and ask for directions and stumbled upon a Granita Machine with the Tang logo on it.  What drew us to the beverage was the B vitamins and the Caffeine content.  Little did I know that I was going to be starting what could arguably become an addiction.<br /><br />Every one of us filled a 32 oz cup of this wonderful product and went on our way.<br /><br />Let me just say this, yes, this is the energy drink mix for making frozen slushy drinks, but it is perfectly acceptable as a straight up energy drink.  Unlike people who bought this and made their own own mixtures, I went to the local discount store, bought a 2.5 gallon dispenser to put in the fridge and I mix it two gallons at a time.  You don't need a granita machine and you don't need to drink it frozen.<br /><br />The mix is easy.  1 gallon + 1 pouch = ecstasy.<br /><br />True to the advertisement, each 8oz of Tang Energy Drink mix has 60gm of Caffeine as well as a dose of B Vitamins that really do a great job of packing a megaton of energy content into a great tasting brew of pure heaven.  A single 8oz serving DOUBLES the caffeine content of a can of soda, a cup of coffee and many energy drinks on the market that taste like medicine.  This is tang, but it's better than Tang.  I drink regular tang on a regular basis and this is sweeter, has more of an orange creme-cicle taste to it and it has the added benefit of supercharging your system.  The drink has NONE of the normal medicinal taste that energy drinks have.  They don't have the sweet-followed-by-bitter aftertaste.  I take a gulp of this and there is NO CLUE that what you are drinking is loaded with caffeine or B Vitamins.  I cannot stress this enough...  You have no idea what you are drinking is an 'energy drink' until you've had too much and your heart is racing.<br /><br />The closest I've come to finding a product this good is the fellow Crystal Light Energy line made by Kraft (the same company that makes this masterpiece).  They have they same energy giving caffeine and vitamin content, but lack the sugar and sweeteners.<br /><br />DO NOT buy this unless you intend to make a gallon (it actually ends up being almost 1.25 gallons after mixing) and drink it religiously.  THIS has replaces $3 a pop energy drinks and about 6 cans of soda a day in my life and for that alone it gets 5 stars.

review/text: Was trying to order Tang orange drink but costs, with shipping, were higher than previous order.  So, I ordered this product thinking it was just packaged differently.  My error! No picture or description was available.  Not the same Tang powdered drink I was familiar with.  More like a weak lemonade if you use only a scoop or two.  Need to use at least three teaspoons of powder to get any kind of taste.  Product okay, especially if heated up in the microwave.  Product would probably be okay if you need to make a large volume of beverage -- but you have to use a lot of product to get any taste.  Will not order this particular product again.

review/summary: Lovely Lemon Ginger Green Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: The vendor of this tea, Online Indian Grocery, gives excellent customer service with fast shipping and items arriving in great shape and exactly as described.  This seller does not actually manufacture the tea itself.  On my first order of this tea, the ginger flavor was not very strong.  On the second order, however, the tea tasted more strongly of ginger.

review/summary: Didn't know what to expect but I liked it
review/text: Saw this item on Martha Stewart and decided to try it.  It's unusual but I love the texture.  Like cavier, without the salty taste.  It does get stuck in my teeth though.  I've only eaten it for breakfast so far.  A little of the raw grains makes a LOT.  And you need a strainer or cheese cloth to rinse it -- the grains are so small they go right through a colander.

review/summary: Trying a gluten Free diet: this works and it also offers folate and potassium, too
review/text: For digestive reasons, I decided to try a gluten free diet: not so easy and Eden offers a lot of gluten free products.  This grain was very easy to cook, and to make it more flavorful I added chopped shiitake mushrooms (great for the immune system) and pucini stock cube with low sodium chicken stock.  Even my husband liked it (not easy getting everyone in the family to try new and healthy products).<br /><br />The grain may not open up after cooking for 20 minutes, but I found it very soft.  So dont over cook to get the 'open' grain look like that on the package.<br /><br />The price that is offered on Amanzon is fantastic compared with our local health food store.  Once I finish the pack, I will order from here.

review/summary: A much better alternative to rice that's for sure!
review/text: I try to eat healthy, but it is hard to eat both healthy and cheaply at the same time. I've been looking into ordering Quinoa for years, hopefully the world is finally learning that this is the new super-food, and thankfully I can now finally order it at reasonable prices fairly easily too, so I gave this bag a try. The red because it tastes better according to the critics, and well quite frankly, everything I have read about it is true. It tastes like nuts, is a little crunchy, and the seeds pop when you cook it turning into little snail looking bead sprouts. It is a lot smaller than I expected, but slightly more than doubles in size when you cook it. It was a lot easier to cook than rice which clumps together too easily. Because of the nutty taste I can even eat Quinoa as is, nothing added, something I would never do with rice, and Quinoa because of the high nutrient content makes a completely healthy meal all by itself! Heads up though, WASH IT SEVERAL TIMES IF IT SAYS WASH ON THE BAG. It is not like rice that you wash just to get rid of the dusty powder. If you don't wash Quinoa well before you eat it, then it will taste very acidic like putting a penny in your mouth at first. I really like this stuff and will eat it all until it's gone.

review/text: We have become enamored with quinoa, with red quinoa being our favorite!  Of course it seems to be very pricey and hard to find too.  On a whim I checked out Amazon and found several options.  Eden had the best price and reviews and we are thrilled with their product.  Signed up for the subscription which makes it a little cheaper too.  Red quinoa is delicious as a side dish or as a cold salad with all your leftovers mixed in...nice and nutty and crunchy.  A perfect healthy food and it cooks beautifully in a rice cooker too!

review/summary: Easy to prepare and tasty
review/text: This is my first experience buying and eating quinoa.  I bought both red and white types, but decided to eat the red type first because it looked so cool.<br />I read that quinoa had to be washed till it no longer frothed to prevent a bitter taste.  The Eden organic quinoa had instructions on how to rinse and prepare it. It had no dust in it and the first rinse did not froth at all. I rinsed it till I no longer saw any little stems which needed more than the five rinses recommended.<br />I cooked it in my rice cooker and it turned out great.  I like the flavor very much and plan to continue my subscription to receive the Eden Organic Red Quinoa through the year.

review/text: When I couldn't find the red quinoa at Trader Joe's, I asked the clerk.  I looked at her in horror when she told me it was "a seasonal item and should be back in 6 to 9 months".  What!?  There was no way I could wait.  We eat this stuff with everything.  It has fully replaced rice in our household, so I use it in soups, with stir fry, etc.  But it's also good as a salad topping or (if you prepare it with broth) just plain.  Extremely tasty and good for you and the price for 4 boxes here is the same as for 1.5 boxes at Kroger.

review/summary: Best Price on a Delicious and Healthy Food
review/text: My family began eating quinoa<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO60JQ">Eden Quinoa, Organic Imported, 16-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)</a> after seeing it on the Food Network and then looking up all the healthy benefits. It has a good protein profile and is a good tasting alternative to rice. It is my opinion to stay with the Eden brand because it is organic and also because of the proper way it is cleaned. You cook it like rice. It has a similar taste that easily takes on the flavor of whatever other food you pair it with. Look it up on the web and read about it and then plan to add it to your meals. Children (as well as grown-ups) will love it for breakfast with a little milk, sugar or honey, and banana or apple sauce added. Much better way to send them off to school. The white quinoa is best for this. Also, for many dishes (you need to just experiment) you will want to try the red quinoa<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002133Z56">EDEN� Red Quinoa, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 4)</a>...very good! We have searched the web and Amazon has the best price.

review/text: This is a good quality, flavorful quinoa but you can get other brands out there that are better, cheaper, and pre-washed.  Eden's quinoa is some of the most expensive out there and it doesn't come pre-washed, which is a surprise.  I feel as if this company is cutting more and more corners as it grows larger, but that's another issue.  As for the price, you can't beat Amazon.  This item costs between 9-10 at my local whole foods per pack and it's the only store that sells it.

However, you should definitely watch the price of this item.

review/text: I've never had quinoa but I've read and heard enough about it to finally give in and order some.  This is a lot cheaper than what you would find at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's and it's delicious (not to mention great for you).  If you're just getting into Quinoa just search for some recipes on Google - try the quinoa and black bean recipe, it's awesome.<br /><br />As far as the product goes, it's very neatly packaged and prewashed, so you don't need to rinse it.  The pouches are easy to open and close and that's good because you probably won't use all 16 ounces in one sitting.  The red qunioa looks great in salads, with cereal, or on it's own!

We bought some when this was on sale at Amazon, and I couldn't be happier.  It makes a delicious nutty rice-like dish that can be a side to any meal or even the base of a meat-free meal (we try to go meat-free once a week).<br /><br />Any way, my wife and I were instantly hooked, and even the kids eat it without complaint.  My son calls it 'Bob the Builder dirt' (the grains are quite small and that's an accurate description of the color) and eats plate fulls of the stuff.

review/summary: Uncommonly good quinoa
review/text: Quinoa is a fantastic grain in general - high in protein, magnesium and folate, versatile in recipes, absorbs flavor. The downside is most quinoa is usually bitter enough to need butter or broth to be palateable.<br /><br />Usually I drown my quinoa in a clear sauce (made from corn starch) with veggies - seasoned either with parsley, oregano and basil or honey, ginger and molasses or wheat-free tamari.<br /><br />I was really surprised by Eden Red Quinoa. It doesn't have that bitter taste, just a pleasant and subtle nuttiness, almost reminiscient of pearled barley. Same wonderful texture - quinoa being a soft grain at the bite with a slight crunch at the end. It sticks well with most other foods, so mixes in nicely with beef or turkey in sloppy joes.

review/text: I love this grain!  I didn't know what to expect and didn't want to spend upwards of 30 dollars for bob's (This has since got up in price, so buy Bob's if you want), so I settled for this.  I'm glad I did.  It's really quite tasty and good in a variety of things.  I've had it in soups, in a black bean salad , in primavera, and just plain.  All very tasty.  I'm trying to each more grains and cut out white flour and rice and this is fantastic substitute.  I like it a lot more than brown rice as well.  It's chewy like brown rice, but has a much better flavor.  It's also completely fool proof.  I don't think even the worst of cooks could screw this up, unlike rice which is a bit harder for some to cook.<br /><br />The only issue I have is even with my fine mesh strainer, I still lose some of the grain.  I've read you have to rise it very well, so it's a bit of a pain to do.  Still, try this.  You'll definitely like it.  A little goes a long way too, so while the price might seem high in reality it's not really.

review/text: This is a tasty red quinoa, but I didn't read the description close enough to note that this quinoa is not pre-washed.  The directions on the package state to wash in cold water several times before cooking.  Part of what I love about quinoa is that it is a whole grain that can be completely cooked in 15 minutes from package to plate.  Being required to thoroughly wash the grain before cooking just add another speedbump in the preparation of a quick, healthy meal.

Amazon's price is much better than where I was buying my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002133Z56">Eden Organic Red Quinoa, Whole Grain, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 4)</a>.  I just love the way I feel after eating quinoa - that may be because of the balanced protein and other super nutrients!  I love the red more than the white and don't care for the black but many may not be able to tell the difference.<br /><br />Sometimes it seems that companies give Amazon their old expired stuff but if you order directly from them you get fresh or maybe it is something about the heat in the Amazon warehouse or double transport or whatever.  In this case, I ordered two 4-packs and they sprouted so that means they are live and well and nutritious and not rancid!<br /><br />My favorite recipe for this is soak 1/2 cup quinoa overnight, then drain and rinse.  In a chef pan, sautee one chopped onion, 4oz mushrooms chopped, and two cloves of garlic (chopped) in your favorite oil.  When slightly brown, add the rinsed drained quinoa, equal amount of water (quinoa will have expanded to more than 1/2cup) and a little veg/chicken stock, a handful of fresh herbs of your choice (if on a budget, you could use parsley), and himilayan salt.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for 15 minutes.  Taste test to make sure it is the texture and flavor you want, serve and enjoy!

review/text: Improving the nutritional value of my diet, tentatively tried quinoa as a replacement for rice which I love, and maybe noodles... this brand or maybe the grain in general is delicious.. a light crunchiness with a little bit of chewy. sweet, but barely registering. I've boiled it plain, had it with soy sauce, and today cooked it in beef broth, with chives and chicken breast.. so yummy.<br /><br />I have faithfully washed it three times before boiling, as recommended.  these grains are tiny so you'll need a tight mesh to rinse them in (i've used a flour sifter)
