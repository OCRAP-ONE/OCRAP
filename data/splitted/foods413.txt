review/summary: Very pleased with purchase
review/text: The pork hocks were a nice cut of meat and had a firm texture, nothing like the garbage that you get from most local grocery stores in California. The Polish Sausage was spicy but not hot and had good flavor. The sizes of the jars in this sample pack are of the same average size as what is sold locally at my location. I will definitely be buying the larger jars of the same items though.

review/summary: I love this tea!
review/text: First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

review/text: I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best. I use honey and sugar to sweeten and down the hatch it goes! Expect some, um, gastrointestinal responses the next day. Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I don't. Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to 'work'...and sometimes it won't!!

review/text: though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did

Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.

review/summary: Tastes like sweaty gym socks
review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

review/summary: Subtle and unforgettable.
review/text: At first I found it suspect that this butter was unusually pale and did not have the deep yellow carotene content of other pasture-based (as opposed to grain-based) butters. But then I tasted it and all hesitations were put to rest. It is mild yet not bland, rich and creamy yet not cloying, and has a fullness that is both satisfying and addicting. I usually like to sprinkle a little Fleur de Sel or coarse sea salt over unsalted butter, but didn't even consider it with this; it would have interfered with its luscious, subtle taste. We made this package last as long as we could and were sorry to see it go.

review/text: I got this case of licorice as a gift for my boyfriend who LOVES Hickory Harvest and he was so stoked when he opened the box. However my only negative about this order was that I had to postpone giving this gift for 3 occasions. I initially tried to order for our anniversary in the fall of 2011 and they were out of stock then. SO a few months later I tried to order again for Christmas but they were out then also. Finally I was able to order them in mid January and give them as a little Valentines day gift. So I am really happy I was able to eventually get this product but waiting 6 months and multiple failed orders for licorice is a bit silly. Agh, the crazy things people will do for live. HA! I suppose When I was finally able to order this box I should have gotten a few extras.  :)

review/text: I love my coffee, I'm a puertorrican that grew up with a coffee factory down the street from my house. I like my coffee string, dark and rich. While I was pregnant I could not have my coffee but when my daughter was born I looked for a decaf that I could get the greatness of coffee but decaf while breast feeding. -no caffeine/to litte caffeine while breast feeding- I tried many decaf nd they all failed. This is the best decaf I have tried, even a decaf espresso at Starbucks does not hold a candle to this decaf. It's bold, rich and it's amazing. I was impressed how the taste is the same as non-decaf espresso. If you love coffee like I do and you have to give it up for some reason this is your coffee. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do :). P.S. I was one of those people that said decaf coffee was blasphemy ;)

review/text: Like my title said, this is the best coffee you can ever buy,  but there is a hitch. Before you spend 17 dollars online for a can of coffee, go to your local store. I bought this coffee for 17 bucks and then went to a store where they had it priced at 11.99. Bummer! Especially for a person of such limited budget as I. All in all, you can't fail with Illy, but check your Bloom or Trader Joe's first!

review/text: I've been enjoying Illy medium roast at home but was looking to cut back on the caffeine.  I ordered the decaf, but it's really bitter.  I've made it a couple of times now, and it's always the same result.  I'm using the same process as with the non-decaf - which comes out beautifully each time.  If anyone has ideas, or can tell me I just got a bad batch (which, at this price is frustrating), that would help.  I would really like to incorporate some decaf into my espresso drinking, especially in the evening.

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: I wish I could give this coffee a positive review, as Papua New Guinea coffee is not always easy to find. But this was not very good. Three separate bags shipped in the order. The roast of all of them was very uneven and much too light, although I know that is matter of personal taste. But an even roast is a minimum requirement. As the result, there was no consistency from pot to pot. A cup might be very good one day and bitter the next. So I shan't buy this again.

review/text: I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites.  They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special.  The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on.  Some chips seem to have minimal flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most.  Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes.  I wish that these chips had more than just a "hint" of lime.

review/summary: Split Pea Soup with a nice bit of peppery heat
review/text: We had this for lunch for two days and both of us loved it.  After living in New Orleans for years we appreciated the peppery flavor.  Tasted like it had been cooked with a real smoked ham hock.  A lot better than the one my wonderful Mother used to make.  Will buy it again for sure.

review/summary: This is not split pea soup.
review/text: I love split pea soup, and normally I make it from scratch, but it can take an hour or more. When I saw that this product cooked in a mere 10 minutes, I was pretty excited. I figured it was probably composed of cooked and freeze-dried peas that basically just needed to be reconstituted, and of course some kind of seasoning. I didn't read the ingredients on the bag, though, until I got home. Oops.<br /><br />Reading the list of ingredients, I was immediately skeptical. The first thing listed was modified corn starch. Corn starch?! Split peas create a thick enough soup, I can't imagine why they needed corn starch, let alone why they had to use more corn starch, by weight, than actual PEAS. I went ahead and prepared it anyway, figuring it would surely at least be edible.<br /><br />Well, it was edible. It was pretty salty, but I could live with that. It was the texture I just couldn't take. This soup has the mouthfeel of a soup thickened with corn starch (surprise, surprise)--like egg drop soup at a chinese restaurant. Which is fine for egg drop soup, but I found it utterly impossible to reconcile with my conception of split pea soup. Any peas were few and far between, floating in the viscous starchy liquid alongside a few sad rehydrated carrots. Just... gross. I finished one bowl and dumped the rest down the garbage disposal.

review/text: If, like me, you want to buy Melissa's pine nuts, described as being from Italy, because you have had experience with "pine nut mouth" - where you get a bitter, metallic taste everytime you eat or drink anything for about 2 weeks after consuming pine nuts from China -- beware.

review/summary: Pine nut syndrome?
review/text: I wouldn't have believed it, but in Googling for a cause of the recently acquired bitter aftertaste I've been experiencing, I found an article about pine nuts causing this, and it's even being called a syndrome, which can occur a few days after consumption.  One writer suggested the culprit is pine nuts from China, which these are.  I hope the taste will be gone by Christmas, after which I hope to try making pesto again with Italian pine nuts, or see if I can find some grown closer to home.  I suppose this could be some form of allergy, but just in case, I thought other pesto enthusiasts would like to know.

review/summary: Great All Around Snack (or Meal)
review/text: These make a great all around snack (or Meal if you are hustling) for adults or children. I order them on Subscribe and Save so that there are always some in the house. Then, I always have something fairly wholesome in the cupboard if I do not feel like cooking a meal or if snack time is upon me. Is IS a SUGAR FILLED treat with two of the pastries (one package) costing you 400 or so calories. But if you keep that in perspective and balance it with good meals plus make sure you brush after eating, then it is a quite satisfactory way to enjoy oneself. I have found it to be the best all around thing that I can have on hand to munch on. Indeed, I also keep wholesome bars in the house and other things of good quality, but when I need a Sugar Loaded Splurge, this is the one I reach or time and again. Since I have these delivered, it costs me no time in the grocery store, and there is no hassle in getting to my house. These arrive on my doorstep at preset times and make my life easier all around. Whether you get these just for the Sugar Splurge, or whether you decide that they are an all time necessity, I think that you will find that they fit in to the modern day lifestle without being a McDonald's type load of calories. Fast Food from the pantry. I have been very satisfied with the taste and with the delivery of the product. I hope you will enjoy them also. Perhaps, they will also save you from having to hustle to the store to buy them, courtesy of Amazon.

review/summary: A great snack for chocolate lovers
review/text: I'm a chocolate lover, but didn't like the filling in chocolate Pop Tarts when I tried them, many years ago. A few years ago, however, a friend gave me a box (he knows I love chocolate), and I was surprised at how good they are now. I still like the cinnamon ones, but the chocolate Pop Tarts have become my favorite.<br /><br />A word of caution: do not leave your toaster unattended while in use, no matter what's in it. I had put two Pop Tarts into my toaster, and left the kitchen to put a glass of water by my computer while they heated. By the time I got back to the kitchen, there were flames shooting out of the top of my toaster. The Pop Tarts were on fire! It seems that a piece of at least one of the Tarts had broken off as they heated, and got stuck as the trays (or whatever the metal pieces the Tarts sit on are called) tried to lift up at the end of the cycle, so the heating elements stayed on, heating the Tarts enough to set them aflame. Fortunately, I always put my toaster where it's not under anything flammable when I use it, so all I lost was my toaster and two Pop Tarts, but I think it's important for everyone to be aware that something like this can happen so they can take proper precautions.<br /><br />Since I no longer have a toaster, I use my microwave oven to heat the Tarts.  If you want to try this, put them in icing side down to prevent the bottoms from getting soggy.  I heat them for thirty seconds on high, but microwave ovens vary, so it'll take a little trial and error for you to find out what works best in your oven.

review/summary: An Awesome Twist on a Thanksgiving Favorite!
review/text: I ... like so many others who observe Thanksgiving, think that the holiday simply isn't complete without a slice of pumpkin pie.  And while it is one of the healthier desserts out there (well, I like to think it is, anyway, because of the pumpkin), it is still not at all what I'd consider healthy or low fat or low calorie.<br /><br />But ... this is the perfect alternative to those who feel guilty after indulging in a slice of pumpkin pie.  THIS is pumpkin pie without the guilt!  It has the flavor of Matcha in it (of course), but also the sweet, delicious, rich and savory taste of pumpkin, a touch of cinnamon, and the buttery taste of pastry in there.  So yummy!<br /><br />I recommend trying this one as a latte.  I used a 1:1 ratio here, using 1 part hot water to 1 part warmed milk.  This helped bring out the creaminess of the pumpkin pie, and also brought out the pastry notes as I had a hard time tasting them without the milk.<br /><br />Scrumptious!

For this first tasting I prepared the matcha with just hot water (then added a little sugar later). I got almost no froth when whisking this one, which has to be an effect of the flavoring somehow. It smelled very clovey when prepared, that really is the dominant aroma.<br /><br />The flavor of the matcha when prepared straight is pretty subtle, but improved when sugar is added. When is really shines, however, is in latte form.  The thing about pumpkin pie is that it's creamy and sweet, so adding more creamy and sweet elements really brings out the pumpkin pie flavor. I will definitely really enjoy drinking it this way this fall.

review/summary: Pumpkin goodness
review/text: So frothed up on its own (no additions) it was quite spicy. Well, not spicy hot but tasted a lot like spices! The pumpkin was definitely in the smell though, so I knew it was a pumpkin tea and not just a spice tea!<br /><br />Of course, what's a pumpkin pie matcha without a latte? This is where the tea did SHINE! I frothed up the matcha with a bit of brown sugar then added about � cup warm water. I then heated up the rest of my Vanilla Almond milk, added it and topped the cup with a healthy helping of whipped cream - oh mama! The brown sugar brought out the sweet pumpkin flavour - I could even taste a bit of crust! I love when that happens.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this tea as a hot latte on a crisp fall day in your cutest flannel and plaid scarf. You can add in some friends to share, or be like me and keep it all to yourself.

review/summary: Okay, better than "eh."
review/text: Maybe I don't have as rich a pallet as the others that have reviewed this tea, but it did nothing for me. It was very bland on the pumpkin side. Just matcha to me. I added some cream and sugar, and ended up having to add a lot for me to get it down. For me, if I'm adding more than three spoonfuls of sweetener, the tea is just too bland for me.<br /><br />I was actually really excited for this tea. I expected something really rich and decadent and a "kick in the mouth" kind of flavor. I had high expectations when I opened it, it smelled really delicious and I was excited, but I ended up just pouring my cup out and setting my packet up on the self. Maybe I was making it wrong? Maybe I added two much water...<br /><br />Well, I'll be trying again until it runs out, but I wouldn't buy it again. I wish they had a smaller trial size that wasn't twenty dollars...<br /><br />EDIT: I gave it two stars at first, but I'm raising it to four. Four and a half if I could. I was making it wrong and with a good shifting of the powder and a good shifting of the tea it's self, plus some sugar and cream, the tea is quite, dare I say it, "delicious." Even decadent. Now that I know how to make it correctly, I'd certainly buy another, larger portion. So just be careful of the directions, unlike yours truly.

review/summary: Smooth pumpkin pie without the calories!
review/text: Ok, I have to start by saying that I love Thanksgiving!  That is because I love that you can get so many pumpkin things at this time of year.  For one month I get to indulge on pumpkin flavored everything!  Then I have 11 long months of waiting for companies to bring out the pumpkin again!  And let me tell you, I overload myself so much on pumpkin that I'm ready for it to end.  That only lasts about a month before I'm craving pumpkin things again.  SO, that is why I just HAD To order the Pumpkin Pie Matcha from Red Leaf.  I'm hoping that they'll keep this flavor around and not just have it available in the fall.<br />I really wasn't quite sure how I wanted to prepare this the first time.  I opened this matcha and got a cloud full of heavenly pumpkin spices.  I put it into a tin to keep it fresh but I doubt that it'll stay there for very long.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I decided to prepare this matcha as a latte with warm milk.  I heated up 10oz of milk on the stove and then used my frother to create foam.  I then added the matcha and whisked the latte....finishing off with another round with the frother.  This matcha was very smooth.  I think the milk really complimented it well and made it taste just like a pumpkin pie!  This was so good that I don't think I want to prepare it any other way.  I think it needs the milk to take it to the next level.  To get your own tasty Pumpkin Pie Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]

review/summary: Warm and rich and pumpkin-y
review/text: It's pumpkin. It has to be good. Alone, sort of shot-style, it's spicy, not like hot-spicy but like pumpkin spice spice-y. I stir it into hot milk and then it's creamy and pumpkin-y. Overall it's hella better than green tea and hella healthier if what they're telling me is true. Absolutely rivals the pumpkin spice latte in my opinion due to the fact that it is creamier, lower calorie, and much healthier. I've tried two of the other matchas (the berry and the caramel) and this one is better than both to me, however I am a sucker for pumpkin and just finished a big container of roasted salted pepitas from Lowes Foods in three days. When I make it, I pour about a quarter cup of milk into a mug and heat it in the microwave for about twenty seconds, and then whisk a half teaspoon of the matcha powder into it with a fork. Then I fill the mug the rest of the way up with milk and add about a half teaspoon of sugar (naughty, I know, considering plain green adds no calories or sugar to my diet) and then heat it up. It's very warm and cozy but different from a cocoa and healthier than cocoa, which is a good switch for me because I really go for my cocoa in the wintertime.<br /><br />Here's the stuff. It's worth a shot. At the worst you get some hot rich anti-oxidants. But it's really good. It's pumpkin, how could it be bad.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: A Fabulous Frothy Dessert-Pumpkin Pie Matcha
review/text: I had some excitement at my mailbox yesterday when I found my package from Red Leaf tea and I knew my  Pumpkin Pie matcha had arrived. There was a bit of fall in the air and I love pumpkin pie, so I had high expectations.  I opened the packet and immediately knew I was going to like it, since the scent was delicious. I decided to make a chilled latte, so I mixed a teaspoon of the matcha with 2 oz hot water and whisked it until it had some froth. I then put it in a shaker with 15 oz unsweetened almond milk, a splash of cream, and some sweetener. Added a few ice cubes, and Wow, fantastic!! Pumpkin pie without so many calories. I am amazed at how well it captures the real thing. A fabulous frothy dessert.

review/summary: A delicious pumpkin treat!
review/text: It's fall, and you know what that means .. TRY ALL THE PUMPKIN THINGS! In all serious, I'm not a pumpkin fanatic, but I do enjoy indulging in the various pumpkin related offerings this season, especially pumpkin pie.<br /><br />When I first opened the package the smell was AMAZING! It didn't taste artificial at all and instantly evoked memories of Thanksgiving dinner for me.<br /><br />I knew this had to be enjoyed hot, so I brought out the gear. I whisked it up, added some milk, and took a sip. And man oh man, is this delicious. The pumpkin pie flavors really pop, especially the cinnamon. I think the spices are a little more pronounced than the actual pumpkin flavor, but it's a delicious and yummy treat.  I even added sweetener to kick it up a notch and it certainly did.<br /><br />All in all, a fantastic desert  and a lot less guilt after having this than a regular pumpkin pie.

review/summary: Spicy tasty pumpkin pie tea!
review/text: Out of the package, this matcha smells strongly like spicy whole cloves with a bit of sweetness.<br /><br />Prepared as a traditional hot matcha, (1/2tsp of matcha powder whisked with 175f water) the spices are very present over top a pumpkiny mellowness. Slightly sweet in flavor as well. I'd call this more of a "Spicy Pumpkin Matcha" than pumpkin pie. I did not detect any bitterness in this matcha. Overall not bad if you are in the mood for spicy fall flavors.<br /><br />Now, this is where Red Leaf's matchas shine - in latte form! I'm doing a iced latte as it is too hot in SoCal right now. I used soymilk, ice, pumpkin pie matcha and a bit of sweetener shaked up in a blender bottle. The result: very amazing flavoring! I can taste the pumpkin pie spice more as a whole, with a bite of spicy cloves and ginger that linger in my mouth after drinking. The pumpkin is present and my brain is making me almost sense the smushy texture of the pie as a I drink this latte. The green tea is in the background and tasty.

review/summary: My oh my, pumpkin pie!
review/text: My first hot matcha in God knows how long. Summer just doesn't lend itself to hot drinks, I'm more likely to just my matcha with cold water and blend vigoriously. But this one was just crying out to be made hot...so I'm taking it to work with me today (all I ever do anymore is work). Well after a day straight from hell, this tea was sorely needed. After yet another patient called in to yell at whoever was unfortunate enough to answer the phone (aka me), I decided to take a break. I found a quiet corner and curled up with Hunger Games and this beauty of tea.<br /><br />It tastes exactly as advertised! I really did feel like I was drinking a hot cup of pumpkin pie...yum. So much yum. I'm not the biggest pumpkin pie fan, but it's grown on me in recent years. But I am a huge fan of pumpkin lattes, at least I was, so this is definitely going to be mixed with soy milk next time. And cheesecake matcha. And french vanilla matcha. The possibilities are endless! This has made me eager for Thanksgiving and my signature pumpkin pound cake. I wonder how that would taste with a matcha icing...

It is JUST like a warm slice of pumpkin pie. Of course, the flavoring doesn't overshadow the nice, grassy matcha at all. They compliment each other perfectly, heavy dense pumpkin and light summery frothy matcha. This is best as a hot latte with a bit of sugar, such a nice treat.

review/summary: My new Fall beverage staple!
review/text: With the start of September I have been craving autumnal flavors, especially pumpkin.  Upon opening the package, pumpkin pie flavoring filled my nose.  It was AMAZING!  It smelled exactly like a spiced pumpkin pie was sitting in my kitchen.<br /><br />I immediately made this into a cold latte based on the delicious smell alone.  Two ounces of warmed water blended with the pumpkin pie matcha, a smidge of sugar and a healthy 6 ounces of icy-cold milk later, I found myself speechless!  After downing the entire cup in record time, I must admit I really want another one!  This is Fall in a cup!<br /><br />In this particular flavor - pumpkin pie - the spices are rich!  Cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg - they all mingle with the pumpkin without overpowering it.  It sort of reminds me of the Starbucks Pumpkin Pie coffee lattes I used to look forward to around this time of year.  I loved them so much I'd try recreating them at home.  Well now, I don't have to!  There's a much healthier version right here without the added sugar.<br /><br />This will not last me very long.

review/summary: Really Delicous Unsweetened Green Tea
review/text: This green tea has a very natural flavor.  The taste of green tea is present without all of the sugar and sugar substitutes that are added to most other bottled teas.  Because it is unsweetened,  it only has a very slight sweetness and the aftertaste is very mild.  I've tried quite of few teas in my time, and it is not an easy task to find a good unsweetened green tea.  This is definitely it.<br /><br />The only true unsweetened green tea that rivals this one is the powder mix version (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PICJTS">All Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!</a>) which I only keep in my cupboard because of the better price when purchased as a mix, and I drink a lot of tea!  If you enjoy your tea absolutely pure, without any sweeteners, flavorings, or additives of any kind I cannot recommend anything else but these two products.

review/summary: Made in Thailand! Not the original!
review/text: I have been receiving this product for almost a year as a subscribe and save deal. Up until a few months ago Amazon sent the real, original thing. This is unfortunately no longer the case! If you order this you will get Ito En Oi Ocha, yes...but it's made in Thailand and comes in a really weak, pathetic bottle. Ito En HAS NOT changed their suppliers or changed their factory locations completely to Thailand. They still manufacture this product in Japan. Amazon has simply decided to buy the cheaper Thai version of the product, likely due to the strength of the Yen...but I would still gladly pay more to get the original thing...<br /><br />As far as the flavor goes, the Thai version tastes a different, likely due to the taste difference of Thai water vs. Japanese water. You cannot tell if it is VERY cold...but if it is above fridge temperature you can definitely taste (*and even smell!*) a difference.<br /><br />Amazon's image for the product is WRONG. That is not the product you will receive.<br /><br />Unless you have no other options to get this product DO NOT BUY IT until Amazon understands that sourcing "Japanese" green tea from Thailand is wrong and an insult to their customers.

review/summary: The original Oi Ocha sold in Japan
review/text: Nothing against the prior reviewer who does not believe this is the original Oi Ocha, but I must say though...as a repeat buyer both of these 16.9 oz. bottles from Amazon as well as 2 liter imports straight from Japan, the two are identical. Every now and then I feel like having the stronger Oi Ocha Koi Aji (not sold by Amazon as of the time of this review), so I'm familiar with it as well. I've uploaded three photos, comparing the packaging, as well as closeups of exactly 1.0 fl. oz. of each. (The prior reviewer's pic has ice, no listed amount, and appears to be far darker than the Koi Aji he believes it is.) Hopefully, this will help folks decide for themselves...as for me, I'll just keep on drinking my favorite beverage.<br /><br />On to the actual review...for informational purposes, most of the bottled "green tea" sold in the US is nothing like real green tea. It's essentially tea-flavored kool-aid, with ingredients that have no business being there. Do not expect Oi Ocha to taste anything like these beverages and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Mellow and ever-so-slightly nutty, Oi Ocha's flavor is delicate, subtle, and amazingly refreshing. Drink it as cold as possible, and store unused portions in the refrigerator after opening. (Left out and oxidized, it turns dark and the taste goes bad. I have a theory that this is what the prior reviewer may have inadvertently done.) It doesn't have a single calorie, and contains 120% of your daily value of vitamin C per serving, but I don't drink it because it happens to be healthy...I drink it because it tastes so very, very good. Oi Ocha is the best.

review/summary: Great Tasting Tea
review/text: When I first arrived in Osaka, I already had green tea, so I went on a quest to find a quality green tea in a bottle. That's when I discovered Itoen bottled teas. I love Itoen products because they offer a variety of unsweetened Asian teas like Mugi cha (barley tea), Jasmine tea, and Oolong, Lemongrass, and mint teas. I like all of them but Oi Ocha is my favorite. Yes, its easier to brew tea at home but in Osaka, I was always busy and running around so I wanted something that was good that I could pick up at any vending machine or convinence store.<br />Oi Ocha goes well with quick snack foods like Onigiri (rice balls) with sour plum inside or butaman (pork filled buns with Cantonese barbaqued pork inside aka Nikuman outside of the Kansai area.)<br />I am so glad that amazon is offering a 12-pack to buy. I usually take it with me to work because I drink tea and bottled water more than anything else. I used to drink Coke but the excessive sugar puts on the weight. I never had a problem with weight gain from tea drinking.<br />If you're looking for a quality bottled green tea, then try this one. Its great as an everyday green tea without any sugar.<br />Its has no calories or added colors or flavors either.<br />It gets me going in the morning better than coffee.<br />I hate bottled teas from Lipton, Snapple, and Arizona.

review/summary: I'm hooked!
review/text: I've always loved tea in general and prefer to drink tea over most other things.  My story starts last year when I vacationed in Hawaii.  I stayed at my buddies house and we made a trip to Costco.  One of the items that he picked up was a case of Ito En Green Tea in a can, yes I said can.  Being that it is always hot in Hawaii I was excited about trying this drink.<br /><br />We left the tea in his fridge over night and the next morning I opened my first can.  It was surprisingly good.  I would say it has a medium bodied taste that is very, very smooth.  The colder it is, the better.  I liked it so much, that's all I drank on my 2 week vacation.  I actually drank so much, I had to keep going back to Costco to buy more.<br /><br />Anyway, I come back to California and the first thing I do is go to Costco hoping they have this tea.  Sadly, they don't carry any non-sweetened teas in the store.  It became painfully obvious how much soda, juice and sweetened drinks everyone drinks around here.  Since I am a huge Amazon user, I searched and found this version of the tea in a bottle.  No cans to be found on Amazon.  I was worried it might not taste as good, but ordered the case anyway.<br /><br />To my relief, the plastic bottled version tastes just about as good as the can version.  I've always preferred aluminum cans over plastic bottles, but I'll take what I can get.  If the can version is a 10, then the plastic bottled version is a 9.5.  I would say it has a very slight bitterness to it in the bottle.<br /><br />Bottom line is, this is some really good tea and it's healthy for you.  If you want an alternative to sodas, I would definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Delicious - Love it!
review/text: Why oh why drink sugar-laden sodas or even aspartame-filled diet drinks when you can drink something that's tastey and natural as well as good for you? That's what this stuff is - good green tea in a bottle that is ready-to-drink. It's absolutely great when cold. (The taste is nutty and mild.) Best of all, it has ZERO calories. But to be honest, I don't drink this because of the lack of calories. I drink it because it tastes GOOD. Buy some and see why it's getting very popular - even among those who aren't dieting.

review/summary: Ito En Oi Ocha Oishii!
review/text: This unsweetened Japanese green tea is delicious and calorie free!  It is very refreshing, has a very slight sweetness and a very mild bitterness in the aftertaste.<br /><br />Aside from the flavor of the tea, I really like the packaging of this item.  Specifically, the mouthpiece is made from a thicker plastic than the rest of the bottle, which I find has an excellent mouth feel.<br /><br />A couple comments to clarify/update other users reviews:<br /><br />*One poster noted that the product they received was made in Thailand.  I received a shipment June 27, 2012 and the product was, in fact, made in Japan.<br /><br />*Another poster suggested that this product tea can be purchased more inexpensively at Ito En's website.  However, the 24 pack sells at Ito En for $36 plus a UPS Ground shipping cost (to Los Angeles) of $11.25, for a total price of $1.97 per bottle.  In contrast, ordering here on Amazon, assuming you have ordered through Subscribe & Save and are using Amazon Prime (both of which are essential if you are a regular Amazon shopper) costs $19.92 for 12 bottles, for a per bottle cost of $1.66, a savings of $7.44 on 24 bottles.  The shipping cost may vary if you live in a different locale, and you may not have Amazon Prime, so the cost could be different for you, but assuming that you are using the cost-saving methods set forth above and your Ito En shipping cost is similar, Amazon is the way to go.

review/summary: I live in Japan and got hooked on this tea
review/text: I live in Japan (with the military) and we have fallen in love with this tea.  It is in all the convenience stores, vending machines and grocery stores over here for about $1.20 or so.  We were recently discussing how we could survive when we go back to the U.S. and don't have our green tea.  I am absolutely ECSTATIC to see that Amazon carries it!  Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: Refreshing and healthy
review/text: I love this product. It's so subtle, that at first I didn't recognize any flavor. I think the American palette is so used to sweetener in everything, that it is harder to discern what foods or beverages taste like in their natural state. However, once I sipped slowly, Ito En's delicate and light quality was bliss for my taste-buds.<br /><br />It just feels good to know you aren't ingesting sugar, in any of its unhealthy forms, either through high fructose corn syrup, GMO sugar beets, or even fruit juice sweetened drinks that are high on the glycemic index.<br /><br />This tea is what it says on the label: tea! Yum.<br /><br />I even went ahead and placed a case on a monthly auto-order to save on shipping and price. My only regret is that I can only buy enough to have a bottle every-other day. I may go through withdrawal symptoms on those days when I can't drink my Ito En!!!!

review/summary: Delicious, Refreshing & Real
review/text: If you like the taste of green tea without all of the sugar and sugar substitutes that are added to most bottled teas these days, try this one.  After many trips to Japan, we fell in love with bottled green tea and were disappointed when we tried to find something similar in our local stores.  A friend suggested this one and we have been addicted since our first order.

review/summary: the best mass-market iced green tea
review/text: I've tried all the bottled iced teas available, and this is the one I like best.  No sugar/sweeteners.  No floral/fruit flavors. Just perfectly brewed green (sencha?) tea taste.  Perfect for a hot, humid day in Seattle.  Or any day you need a cool drink.
