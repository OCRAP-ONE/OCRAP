review/summary: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
review/text: These are not as pictured on the box. They are not full of creamy white filling. The filling is dark and very thin, no where near the edge of the cookie. The maple smell and flavor is very light. No real maple taste either. I bought these after the Dollar Tree quit selling the REAL original Manning's Cookie Shop Maple Leaf Creme Cookies. These are about like the cheap knockoffs that Interbake Foods produces and sold for a short time at the D.T. These were packaged excellent. Processing was very slow. 8 days for processing, 2 for shipping. ALSO had attempted fraud problems with my c.c. after this order. I would not recommend this product or the related companies (Dare foods,Foodservice Direct) to anyone.

review/text: We discovered Dare Maple Cookies in Canada and ordered a case when we returned to Michigan.  The cookies were great, even though several boxes were less than fresh and crisp (they were soft).  Another problem was that many of the cookies in each box (all the cookies in some boxes) arrived crushed.  Packaging needs to be addressed.

review/summary: Good product, over priced
review/text: These are truly delightful cookies, but happily they are not addictive because this manufacturer (family owned or not) is pricing themselves right out of existence. In 2005, one could find them for less than $17/12 pack. In June of 2010, I bought them from Amazon for about $32 for a 12 pack. Now (Sept 2010) they are listed here at essentially $60 for the 12 pack. Almost a 4x increase in price in 5 years and doubling in a few months is beyond the pale. They've become a caviar that I will live without.<br /><br />9/10/2010 - to be fair to the company, the huge delta on price is because Amazon no longer carries this item but it is now through a seller. I discovered a local supermarket will provide them at $32.50 for 12. Dare Co is not culpable.

review/summary: Cookie and cream separation
review/text: My only complaint is that the cookies I ordered on June 19, 2010 are separated from the cream.  I love the taste, but I have to piece together the cookie with the cream in order to eat it.  One side of the cream is attached to a cookie and the other side is not.  I shouldn't have to piece the cookie together in order to eat it.  This may have been the result of a bad batch of cookies, or perhaps occurred during shipping--in any case, I am reluctant to re-order them.

review/summary: Lousiest chips you can ever have
review/text: My favorite flavor of chips happens to be Jalapeno. I have sampled dozens of different brands of Jalapeno flavored chips. This was my first time trying out this brand, and I can tell you that these were the worst jalapeno flavored chips I have ever tasted in my life. They smelled and tasted of stale oil and there was not even the slightest taste of jalapeno in the chips, whatsoever. They were excessively salty and greasy. Needless to say that I dumped the entire bag in the garbage bin after the first handful. Oh, by the way the one-star rating is only because it is not possible to write a review without selecting at least one star. They don't deserve any.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Living with Celiac Disease can be tricky when I'm away from home, but at home it's not so bad.  I was never a big fan of bread or other baked goods - I seem to have instinctively avoided them my whole life.  But I do love spaghetti and I really missed it.  I discovered Pastariso about twelve years ago in my favorite health food store  and used to buy it for my son.  It was so good, I could serve it to the whole family without complaint from anyone.  When I was recently diagnosed with Celiac myself, I couldn't find it in any of the stores in my area.  I am so glad I found it on Amazon.  Pastariso is just as good as I remember.  It is delicious with even the mildest-tasting sauce or even just garlic butter.  And it even has a lower glycemic index than wheat spaghetti and is more nutritious.  You just can't beat that.  By the way, I got free shipping by buying two cases (that's only twelve packages in total), so it ended up costing much less than anything I could find in my local stores.

review/text: Up front, I will say that this tea type is one that you'll will either like a lot or not at all. I would suggest that you try it in a small quantity. This tea has a very deep flavor. Dry, in the package, it smells for all the world like BBQ sauce. Brewed; it still retains a smoky aroma. The tea benefits from sugar. It is a very robust, very exotic, deep-tasting tea that could replace coffee as a wake-up beverage.

I was able to purchase it once at the store then they quit carring it. So I found it here on Amazon.

review/summary: Favorite Breakfast of a Lazy Cook
review/text: I love a healthy nutritious breakfast but hate spending any time on preparation.  I was delighted to find McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, Quick and Easy since I prefer steel cut to rolled oats.<br /><br />I have this every morning (I posted a picture of the nutritional label) and prepare 3/8 of a cup of oatmeal with 3/4 cup of water in the microwave for 5 minutes but at 40% power to prevent over boiling.  It gives me a really good consistency and I add Splenda, lots of cinnamon and canned pumpkin puree along with whatever fresh fruit I have around.  It's delicious and for just over 300 calories, prepared this way, I have a breakfast that doesn't play havoc with my blood sugar and keeps me satisfied till lunch.<br /><br />I will admit that my little dog stands in line for her fair share of a couple of spoonfuls in her dish.  She loves it and I think it is a nutritious way to start her day too.

review/summary: Quite good oats
review/text: This is a very good oatmeal.  I normally eat steel cut oats and noticed these have a quicker cooking time than the original style oats.  My wife picked this up for me, and after trying it, I can attest that it does cook quickly.  It has a little different texture than regular steel cut oats, which are crunchier and nuttier.  These are cut a little finer than the regular steel cuts, which would probably account for the quicker cooking time.<br /><br />For the consumer who has previously tried steel cut oats and Scottish oatmeal, the texture of these oats are in between the two.  They're not cut quite as fine as Scottish oats, but they're definitely cut finer than regular steel cuts.<br /><br />Overall, these are definitely worth a try.  I would still prefer the crunchier texture of regular steel cut oats, but these are definitely worth giving a try, especially if you don't want to have a long cooking time.

review/summary: Best oatmeal ever
review/text: I love this oatmeal, and eat it daily with hot pure maple syrup and whole milk.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because if one cooks it according to instructions, it cooks to the pan.  My successful proportions are 1 cup of water to 1/3 cup oats - bring water to boil, add oats, turn to lowest heat (should still bubble) and cook uncovered for 7 minutes.  I use a stainless steel pot on top of the stove.  I would suggest to anyone not familiar with this oatmeal and just trying it to eat it for breakfast daily for 45 days and see if you begin to notice a dramatic positive change in your system after the first 30 days.  That is what I did, and it made me decide that this would be my breakfast indefinitely.

review/text: Trying to watch blood sugar and this is one of the good carbs that is a slow burn instead of grits in the morning.  I ignored oatmeal my entire life because I am not into sweets for breakfast.  Then someone suggested I fix this "savory" instead of sweet.  So after cooking, I add a little healthy olive oil margarine, a little salt and break up a Morningstar Spicy Veggie Sausage patty into it.  Just fabulous!

review/text: I had tried several other McCann's Irish Oatmeal products and decided to go healthy and order the 6-pack of the Canisters.  Pretty good but didn't seem to be quite the consistency and flavor I remember enjoying from the boxed Quick Oats or the Long cooking variety.  I'll hang in there and keep cooking it.

review/summary: Lifetime healthy breakfast
review/text: I first heard about this cereal 3 years ago and have eaten it EVERY morning since then! A delicious, filling but not bloated breakfast that gets me started every day. I take a little more than a third of a cup and place  it in a DEEP dish rectangular microwave safe bowl with about three quarters cup of water for 6 minutes and 10 seconds. Make sure the bowl you place it in is DEEP or it will bubble over and cause a mess. My bowl is over 3.5 inches deep. You will get to experiment with how much oatmeal you want to eat and how much water is right to mix with it but it will come out great for sure! As soon as it is out of the microwave I mix some sugar free hazelnut creamer and stir it up and I am ready for a great breakfast. I will sometimes mix in blueberries or raisins but this oatmeal is the best I have ever eaten and will have this the rest of my life;..it is THAT good!! Enjoy

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious
review/text: Steel cut oats are a great slow carb - even better for you than microwave or quick oats. And this 5 minute variety by McCann is a good compromise between their 3 minute quick oats and the 30 minute traditional slow cook oats.  Easy to make.  I use water, not milk.  Just heat your water, add your oats, stir occasionally for 5 minutes, and you're done.  You can even cook more than you need and microwave the leftovers.  Add some wheat germ for extra deliciousness and fiber.  And maybe some fresh cut strawberries.  If you need sweetener, honey and cinnamon are tasty additions.  I ordered a six-pack of canisters online through Amazon, because I have not been able to find these at grocery stores in my area.  These are a great value on Amazon.

review/text: Fundamentally different from the Quaker-type oats you're probably used to (at least, if you're an American). More nutritious, better-tasting, yet no more trouble to make than 'Quaker instant' or other 'instant' hot breakfast cereals. Get some genuine maple syrup to sweeten it (Amazon sells it) - it goes well with this product. Add a bit of butter, cream, and some fruit.

review/text: You have to know that this is not the traditional, instant oatmeal. If you buy this and are expecting Quaker oats, don't purchase. That said, if you want a natural, wholesome oatmeal, this is what you should buy. The six-pack is a better deal than buying a single container at the grocery. It is rather bland on its own but I suggest adding some dried fruit, jam, or sugar and cinnamon. This oatmeal is very good and a great way to start my day!

The first try using the instructions resulted in big overflow, despite being in a very large bowl.  After a few trys I found one and a half minutes at 60% power stir and repeat works reasonably well.  It is pretty flavorless, so I throw in some cinnamon to add some flavor.

review/summary: Different from old fashion oats, but still good!
review/text: I've been having oatmeal for breakfast for years. Since my cholesterol is not excitingly high, I take oatmeal only on most weekdays, and have heartier breakfast on weekends. After reading some great reviews about Steel Cut oatmeal, I decided to give McCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, Quick & Easy, a try.<br /><br />Well it sure is different from the old fashioned rolled oats. It's quicker to cook (claim to take only 5 min). However, since I don't want to spend time watching oatmeal on the stove or microwave, I cook the McCANN's Quick & Easy version the same way I cook the old fashion oatmeal: in the previous night, add oatmeal and hot water to a pot, bring to a boil, them turn the stove off and cover the pot. The next morning reheat it in a bowl in the microwave for 2 min. This way it's quick, and it never boils over. The Steel Cut oat has finer but crunchier texture than the old fashioned rolled oats. It also tastes nuttier. Some people prefer the steel cut. I actually prefer the old fashion because it is gummier and mix better with some sweet addition such as fruits and jam. But since I usually just add maple syrup for a quick breakfast, the steel cut irish oatmeal is almost just as good. After all, one needs some change when having the same oat 200 days a year.

review/summary: stick to Quaker-style I guess
review/text: I REALLY love oatmeal, not the creamy style, but al dente, nutty, crunchy style.  Based on all the reviews, I was sure I'd love the McCann's.  I experimented with the McCann's today, and I have to say that I don't like them at all.  Regardless of proportions or how I cooked them, they seemed to my taste to be gritty (they are chopped really fine) and not very flavorful.  Sad to say, Amazon won't accept returns of Grocery products.<br />I much prefer the WalMart generic Old Fashioned oats, measured 1 to 1 with water, and cooked quickly until the water is gone.  Let them stand (covered) for 5 minutes and there it is:-)

review/summary: Really Zesty Blend.....
review/text: I have some of this Tones Garlic and Pepper Blend in the house that I bought elsewhere online.  I am a self confessed garlic fiend, and I use it in just about everything its possible too.  I also have some regular granulated garlic in the house as well.  I decided to try this when I came across it at the spice place that I was shopping at.  This blend is very zesty, spicy, and remains garlicky even with all the other ingredients.  It's really good, and frankly its the best I have tried in a garlic blend of any kind.  If you like garlic like I do, it's my opinion that you will like this alternative on occasion.  Just remember to use it a little more sparingly than your regular garlic powder.  With the added pepper and other spices, its got a definite punch.  And one last thing, this goes for a couple of dollars cheaper at the spice place online I picked it up at.  However order two or more canisters at once and you get free shipping with Amazon at the time of this writing.  The best deal around considering that.  Recommended for the garlic lovers in your family, who want a little extra punch...  PS:  One more thing I feel I should mention about this blend.  It has a much heavier dose of salt in it than any regular garlic powder, or garlic pepper spice I have used in my opinion.  Tasty as it is, it should be used sparingly, or not at all by those concerned about sodium in their diet.  It's part of what makes the blend so delicious, but not so good for you either...

review/summary: A Welcome Addition to My Pantry.
review/text: I found an interesting product at my local Costco Warehouse store. It's cans of Kirkland Signature premium chunk chicken breast packed in water. The individual cans are 12.5 ounces and the entire packet is six cans. I couldn't resist. I like to have things like this in the pantry because they can yield almost instant meals without the need to run to the market. Today, for example, I made up a batch of chicken with rice soup using a can of this chicken along with the seasoned water packing, some cut up baby carrots, celery and a brown/wild rice mixture plus a few spices from the kitchen cabinet. The whole thing was done in an hour and made up a delicious meal. So easy. Tasted great. Economical, too.<br /><br />This is excellent chicken and will lend itself to all kinds of dishes. It's tender and tasty and has a nice chunky appearance. It comes with a little starter recipe book and improvisations are welcome and easy. It's an excellent addition to my pantry.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Awesome Lollipops
review/text: These are hard candy lollipops that are so yummy you just can't stop eating them. The flavor is very similar to actual cotton candy. I have ordered the variety pack as well, and those are also just as good. A few may come broken, but that is almost impossible to prevent due to the fact that they are being shipped. I still eat the broken ones, i just open them up and put them in a bowl, they are still good. They stay in the wrapper even if they break, so they are still clean. 12 bucks for 48 lollipops is a really fair price, so I don't think it's that big of a deal if a few come broken. I have ordered them about 3 or 4 times, and there's usually only about 5 or 6 that come broken. I have never seen them in any of the stores I shop at either. It's hard to find just good old fashion candy. They ship very fast and come in the manufacture box, with bubble wrap around it, in an Amazon box. I can't imagine there is much more they could do to prevent breakage anyway. I would recommend them for sure, you won't regret it.

review/summary: Cotton Candy Pops
review/text: These are yet another great sucker from Charms.<br /><br />I'd never had these before, (I usually pound down Blow Pops) and decided to give them a shot to keep some variety in my diet. I eat a lot of candy to deal with medication-induced nausea, and nothing beats it down faster, (and I do mean nothing) than very sweet candy. The sweeter the better.<br /><br />How do these taste? They are definitely cotton candyish. I say "ish" because they aren't exactly like it, but are close enough that you can taste it in there. The flavor is like a mix of the pink and blue flavors, so the blend makes it seem a little off from what the real candy tastes like. But they are for sure a good flavored pop. They also have very little aftertaste.<br /><br />Since these are a flat sucker you will get a few that are broken in most boxes. It's kind of an expected issue with any hard flat candy. They could probably prevent any breakage by bubble wrapping them individually, but then they would cost $5.00 each.<br /><br />After reading the one-star review on these I decided to mention that these are NOT actual cotton candy on a stick. (See picture I posted.) I know it seems that this should be obvious to any rational adult or thinking child, but...  apparently it's not as obvious as one would think. If these were actual cotton candy they would last about one microsecond after hitting the tongue. SO be glad they are a hard candy.<br /><br />Overall a five star treat.

review/text: These worked well for our Spiderman themed goodie bags (pink/light blue ~ red/dark blue). And guess what--they are not tiny lollipops: 1.75"L x 1.5"W, and about 1/4" thick! They taste sweet, not fruity. About 8 came cracked. The kids liked them. xo Mrs Land

review/text: I ordered these because I needed a flat sucker to put a round sticker on for a shower favor. I had no idea what they tasted like but they turned to be really good actually! I recieved exactly 4 broken suckers in the whole pack of 48. I didn't think that was bad at all for such a fragile product!

review/text: There is nothing fluffy about this product but the box appears to have a picture on the top that seems to advertise that way.  These are hard candy lollipops!  I had wanted cotton candy fluffy lollipops.  They also arrived with about 12 broken or cracked of the 48 in the box and likely came that way from the manufacturer.  Fortunately I only needed 33 for a classroom .. but I would never order these again.

review/text: Red Tea Leaf's Espresso Matcha is amazing!<br /><br />This product has helped with the joint inflammation in my hands.  I was told I had arthritis and that it would probably get worse.  After my own research, I found that an anti-inflammatory diet could help.  Matcha Green Tea was mentioned by several sources. Red Tea Leaf teas are excellent and their customer service is fast and friendly.  I had tried several different brands, but Red Tea Leaf's variety of favors that they mix with the Matcha was what drew me to this company.<br /><br />I chose Espresso Matcha because I am a coffee drinker, but wanted to drink several glasses of Matcha Green Tea a day and knew I would have to forgo my coffee to drink this much (and I love coffee).  There is a subtle flavor of espresso mixed with the Matcha green tea.<br /><br />During a workout when a bar bell completely slipped out of my hand because I lost my grip, I decided I had to try something.  I stopped drinking coffee `cold turkey' as soon as my Espresso Matcha from Red Tea Leaf order arrived and never once got a headache.<br /><br />My favorite summer time way to drink this tea is to mix 1 heaping scoop of Matcha green tea into my 20 oz. water bottle the night before, then refrigerate so I `m ready to go in the morning (I make 3 of these each night when I `m packing my lunch).  Just make sure to shake it before you drink it, the Matcha tea settles to the bottom.  Within two weeks, the ache-y feeling in my hands every morning almost completely disappeared!  I am able to grip jars to open them without pain.  During my workouts, I focus completely on form and only later realize, I never thought once about my hands!  They do not hurt... at all!<br /><br />As for my diet, I ate very `clean' before I started drinking Matcha tea from Red Tea Leaf and I love scientific research (I know, nerdy), so drinking 3 heaping scoops of Matcha tea a day was the only change that I made.  I consistently drink 60-80 oz of water now, but even before when I tried drinking this much water to flush out my system my hands still hurt.  It was not until I added the Match green tea from Red Tea leaf that I noticed an improvement in my hand.<br /><br />I am so happy with this product!  Thank you Red Tea Leaf!

You can brew it for a long time and it doesn't get bitter like some teas.  It is delicious. I add a couple splenda packets and some hot milk and I'm set.  It's very, very good.<br />Like some of the other reviewers, I have a hard time finding it at my local grocery stores. I go through a box a week so buying in bulk doesn't seem to be a big deal.<br />I find that it's good iced too.

review/summary: Not impressed by this tea
review/text: I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.

The caffiene-free Stash is a step above the rest for two reasons - better taste and no need to worry about drinking it several hours before bed time.  Best way to get the flavor from any bagged black tea is to microwave a cup of water for 2.5 minutes and immediately "throw" the tea in it from a distance.

My kids love it, my guests love it, and I love it!  Everytime I serve it, everyone wants to know where to get it and how I made it.  Even non-tea drinkers get hooked on it.  It is wonderful cold or hot, and has a lighter spice flavor than most Chai teas, but they added a touch of vanilla instead.  This tea really is one that you can enjoy everyday.  It really is worth a try.

review/summary: Elegant white tea AND raspberry . . . so very good!
review/text: After trying to find a green tea that I could actually drink and enjoy, I found white tea. It has all the health giving benefits of green tea -- maybe even more -- and it's so very enjoyable! Of all the white teas I have tried, this is my absolute favorite. The white tea is smooth: it has none of the bitterness or sharp taste of green tea, and the addition of raspberry is a brilliant touch. To enhance the raspberry flavor, try adding a little sweetener -- your choice. Drinking a cup of this tea is like giving yourself a present. Thanks Stash, you really do create world-class teas.<br /><br />P.S. Remember NOT to boil the water for this tea: it's far too delicate for boiling water. Instead, use water just under the boiling point and only brew for no more than 4 minutes -- it does make a difference.

review/text: This is my favorite tea ever, I drink it daily iced. It has a nutty rich flavor almost like a coffee. I used to drink Celestial Seasonings Dessert Teas but as usual another company has discontinued the products. I originally ordered a cse of this from Stash last year and was hooked and hopefully they won't take it off the market. It seems like all that's out there is fruit flavored teas, which I don;t like, so if you like a rich bakery flavor tea, this one is it.
