review/text: If you're like me and prefer to mix your own soda drinks, the MUCH reduced sugar and much better flavor of a custom mixed soda will have you never look back at coke or pepsi.<br /><br />The monin blackberry syrup was top notch, with full flavor of blackberry. Lots of other syrups will contain two or more other fruits to pad out the bottle that ruin the taste.<br /><br />A jigger of this and some fresh, fiercely bubbling seltzer is a<br />wonderful treat. This is also great on pancakes! Try a bottle you won't regret it.

review/text: I originally bought one regular cornuts pack and one Chili Picante to try. That did it.  I no longer like the regular cornuts because the Chile Picante is excellent. So now I only by the Chile Picante flavor. I know that Amazon sells a bigger pack, but this stuff is so addicting that I'm going to eat a whole bag regardless of the size of the bag.  For that reason, I'll stick to the small bags so my family doesn't have an intervention for me and send me to cornuts rehab.

review/text: We use a lot of capers when cooking and on salads, so we bought this larger pack instead of a bunch of the little 4 oz jars.  When they got here, one of the three jars was broken and the package was barely holding together and smelled strongly of vinegar.  Amazon was great and quickly refunded a third of the cost.  My only complaint (besides the packaging of course) is that the quality wasn't quite as good as what I can normally find in the store.

review/text: First off, I think what Honest Kitchen is doing is great.<br />But, I think they have some more work to do on the cat food.<br />The cats were just not interested.<br /><br />So far, I have tried it three different times. (The box has a generous amount of food.)<br />I've made it thick, thinner and even tried adding it with a packet of their regular food.<br />As long as this was in their dish, they were on food strike.<br /><br />I could see this being good for outdoor cats, but our indoor ones totally turned their<br />backs on it.  Their favorite flavor is chicken, and I had hopes they would love it, but<br />they just don't.<br /><br />I have to give a lower star on this one.  I even tried to give away the rest, and no one<br />wanted it.  I ended up tossing it out - it was wasted.

review/summary: Instant vomit
review/text: My cats were SO excited about the smell of this food, but eating it made them vomit instantly. I understand that you need to introduce new foods very carefully and gradually, so it wasn't because I switched them over cold turkey. Even when they were getting only a dollop mixed with their typical food, the vomiting persisted with both cats. THK has worked well for our dog, but if it won't stay down for more than 5 minutes, something is definitely wrong with the cat formula.

review/summary: GREAT FOOD!  Cats just take longer to adjust than dogs
review/text: This is the most healthy food you can buy, in my humble opinion.  Many other products and kibbles get your cat addicted through artificial flavor enhancers.  (Think of your teens exchanging 'Ranch Doritos' for Apple Chips. It takes time for their taste buds to adjust.)<br /><br />When you get your cat off the flavor enhancers they will eat this.  Just give it time and put out a little of this food every day.  Maybe even drizzle this on the kibble!  Experiment and eventually your cat can eat healthy!  Most cats won't even touch real chicken or fish because they are so addicted to the kibble.  It is a fact that dry kibble dehydrates your cat.  Cats on dry kibble eventually have problems with kidney disease, so soft wet food is always best (albeit, not always the easiest to get your cat to munch!)

review/summary: Some Corrections
review/text: For those saying it doesn't pass the taste test....<br /><br />Try sprinkling parmesan cheese or fortiflora on top. Many cats take time to transition to a raw diet because it's not as stinky as commercially made food. Sort of like how children prefer sugar cereal to something healthy like oatmeal. With time and patience any cat can be won over.<br /><br />About the taurine content....<br /><br />If you go to the honest kitchen website, you can take a look at the nutritional values. This product does contain an adequate amount of taurine.

review/summary: Very good tea
review/text: I wanted to leave a review for this product so that, hopefully, they will continue to sell it. I used to purchase only Yogi Ginger Tea, but their teas have either changed formula or have gotten inconsistent, and now almost everything they produce in this line tastes like licorice. I have been looking for a substitute, and this tea is actually quite good. The blend is perfect, and I can taste Ginger instead of licorice! (Thankfully, their tea omits this ingredient.)<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this tea. The only drawback is its expense. It is a bit pricey. Perhaps they will consider lowering the price a bit if it becomes popular here.

review/text: The only reason I have given this review two stars is because I adore Whitman's chocolates. They are absolutely delicious. However, the reason I did not put more stars is because this is a rip-off. If you are going to buy Whitman's Sampler box, you might as well go to their website and purchase it there because they sell the 24-Ounce box for $19.99 and the 40-Ounce box for $29.99. So essentially, the grotesque mistake I made in buying from this awful seller, is that I paid for a 40-Ounce box and will be receiving a 20-Ounce. I am sorely disappointed, and disgusted. I wish I had gone on their website beforehand. Shame on the seller, shame on you.

review/summary: Whitman's Chocolate
review/text: I purchased a 24 oz. box of Whitman's Chocolates on sale for $9.00 at a popular and well known national drug store chain.<br /><br />Although the use best before freshness date stamp was conveniently missing on the side of the box, it did contain the words 'BEST BEFORE'.  Nonetheless, the chocolates were very fresh and desirable in appearance.<br /><br />The box is made of high quality cardboard covered with sturdy brightly colored yellow paper.  The interior contains sectional trays that house each chocolate in a dark chocolate paper cup.<br /><br />This was an impulse purchase because I was being a bit nostalgic about the brightly colored yellow box with the signature Whitman's Sampler design.<br /><br />These chocolates simply do not taste good.  There was not one piece of chocolate in the box that was pleasant to consume.  This is the 12th time I have had this happen, but childhood memories keep me coming back--not anymore.<br /><br />I am dissappointed that the chocolates are no longer of the same high quality they once were when I was a child.<br /><br />The box notes that the chocolates contain nuts (almonds, pecans, cashews, peanuts, and walnuts), but the nuts were so crushed that they were unrecognizable both by sight and taste.<br /><br />The chocolates contain a great deal of salt (salt, sodium bensoate, sodium metabisufite, and potassium sorbate)--truth in labeling.<br /><br />They also contain a large number of artificial sugars and ingredients, e.g., sorbital, vanillin articial flavor, preservatives, FD & C red #40, sulfur dioxide,gum arabic, and mono and diglycerides, etc.<br /><br />Do not waste your money.  Buy a brand that contains less than 50 ingredients. I rate these chocolates 0/5 for consumption, flavor, and taste.  I rate these chocolates 5/5 for packaging, appearance, and appeal.  Perhaps the manufacturers may want to consider spending less on packaging and more on the actual product.

review/text: I bought the 40 oz. or 2.8 lb. box at K-Mart for about $32 and change, with tax, here in New York. That comes to approximately $13 a pound!<br /><br />The thickness of the box gives the buyer the impression that it has two layers deep. It is only two layers across. They actually had the cheek to offer the buyer a thick box and stick in cardboard filler on the bottom half of it to create the illusion there was two layers.<br /><br />I am never buying this particular Whitman Sampler again, and I would recommend you do a very thorough price comparison, before you do as well.<br /><br />The chocolate is good, hence two stars, but the box was downright deceptive. So a big Bronx cheer for Whitman!

They looked gross, so they ended up NOT being served to guests as a light dessert. Some tasted stale even though they were (barely) in date. The lemon flavor is quite unnatural and the pieces of hard lemon candy baked into these "shortbreads" contributed to this very unnatural flavor. Not a plesant experience and I actually ended up tossing them after tasting the first few boxes. The fact that the shortbreads were broken--very few were whole cookies--added to the disappointment of this purchase. I can't recommend them for these reasons and won't purchase again.

review/text: I absolutely love these shortbread cookies.  Unfortunately my store is out of them and doesn't know if they'll get them back in stock.  They are plain shortbread...not flavored.  I would order the butterscotch if I knew the nutrition count was the same.  Could someone give me the nutrition count on the flavored ones?<br /><br />The plain ones are:  76 cal,  2.5 fat,  5 carbs,  less than 1 protein,  0 fiber.  Serving size 3 to 4 cookies.<br /><br />On weight watchers these are only 1 point a serving.<br /><br />Thank You,  Eileen

review/text: If you're looking for something to serve at your next afternoon tea, you've just found it! These cookies are premium key-lime pie in finger-food form. The texture is light and slightly crunchy, with a moderately sweet and somewhat tart key-lime flavor. They're truly sinful and addictive. For this reason, buy these only if you intend to share, lest you'll find yourself devouring the entire box in one place.

review/text: We really like buying holistic dog food that's good for our little rescue dog (found wandering a parking lot! Who KNOWS what he was eating up to that point??) that's not crazy expensive like some of the other organic/holistic dog foods can be. This one was an ok price at PetSmart, but we were only able to buy it at PetSmart (not any of the other local pet stores). I searched Amazon and the price was $1.15 LESS per pound AND qualified for free shipping with my Prime Membership - SUPER nice for a 15lb bag of dog food. I can't stress how much I love this food for my dog, and how easy and inexpensive Amazon has made it to get good quality food for our dog!

review/summary: Our Picky Eater EATS!!
review/text: Our adopted dog is nearing 12 years of age.  In the nine years we've had her she has never been a hearty eater. When her vet suggested she move from adult food to senior food I began a comprehensive search for a high quality, healthy and digestible food.  By comparing labels it didn't take long to rule out many so-called "healthy," and/or "vet recommended" foods.  Blue Buffalo was the obvious choice. We bought a small bag and began adding it to her soon to be former food.  She promptly began picking out the Blue Buffalo bits and scarfing them down to the exclusion of the other food! We upped the ratio to 50-50 and within 10 days she was eating Blue Buffalo exclusively. I feel confident and secure our beloved dog is eating the most nutritionally balanced and healthy food available. As a bonus I've given up going to the store to lug the bag into the cart, lug it out of the cart into the car and again, lug it into the house.  Why keep up that routine when Amazon delivers it to my door?!?!

review/text: I recently purchased three orgeats available here on Amazon: Ferrara, Monin, and Teisseire. I tested each orgeat in a variety of cocktails, and Monin was the best choice in every test. It has a rich almond flavor that stands up well even when mixed with a number of ingredients in a cocktail, and gives drinks a smooth depth. Unlike Ferrara--which was my second choice--Monin's product has no preservatives and comes in a glass rather than plastic bottle, both plusses in my book. I highly recommend this orgeat.

review/text: I love Steaz Zero Calorie drinks, and while my favorite is the Steaz Zero Blueberry Pomegranate in glass bottles (= best taste), when it comes to cans and energy drink, I've got to say the Steaz Zero Cal Berry might be the next best thing.<br />What I like about it is that it gives me great energy while keeping everything very natural. Caffeine doesn't have much effect on me, however the guarana really does the job, giving me a huge energy boost for a long time with no crash afterward. And the zero calories is pretty "sweet" too.<br />Further, there's no "adaptation". (Regular energy drink drinkers will notice that after a while you need to drink more and more in order to have the same energy boost. Not the case with Steaz.)<br /><br />As for the taste -- it could be better, but it's definitely not bad. (Unless you drink it warm - I definitely do not recommend that. You want it cool and fresh.)

review/summary: Steaz Zero Calorie
review/text: I know some people complain about the flavor, and I can't lie, I didn't think I was going to be able to even drink one can. But, like most energy drinks, once you get over the initial "this doesn't taste like something that should go in my stomach," it's pretty decent. It keeps me awake and that's also what I need them for. I'm already done with a 4 pack (been 2 days) and I'm actually excited to open my next one!

review/summary: Steaz lo-cal energy is horrible
review/text: Steaz regular energy drink is quite tasty and I enjoy it.  Steaz had an ingenious idea of coming out with a reduced calorie energy drink which had approximately half the calories of their regular energy drink, just made with less sugar.  I was a regular purchaser of the old formulation of Steaz' diet beverage.  They decided to  cancel the reduced calorie version and started making a zero calorie one, which is this product.  I do not like it at all.  It has a terrible aftertaste.  This one also has the sweetener erythritol, which I believe contributes to the foul taste, in combination with stevia.  I would seriously suggest re-thinking the purchase of this beverage if you haven't tried one can.  Sorry Steaz.  You should have kept your old diet energy drink instead of replacing it with this one.  People have taste buds.  Zero stars for this zero calorie drink.

review/summary: Amazing Energy Drink With No Taurine and Zero Calories
review/text: Being a paralegal, my work requires me to stay long hours inside the office. I need the much needed energy to finish the necessary documents required the following business day. I have long benefited from Gene Eden Vir 101 as my supplement. It has helped me with my very stressful profession but it is often out of stock due to its known efficacy.<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant in trying this product because I fear the possible alcohol content. But my friend to informed me that it is completely free from this ingredient and it has been certified organic; so I had a taste of steaz energy drink berry flavor and instantly liked its sweet tingling flavor.  I am soon running out of this product and is a little bit disappointed because I soon realized Amazon does not ship it in my country yet. I do hope it can be shipped soon.<br /><br />Thanks so much steaz!

review/text: I buy them by the case because they are completely free of artificial stuff AND sugar which is very hard to find in an energy drink.  I think they taste fine - not as good as a milkshake - but not much different from plain red bull to me.  The energy boost is mild a long-lasting.

review/summary: Healthiest Energy Drink
review/text: I accidentally ordered the diet berry instead of the normal. Angry at myself, I checked the nutrition label to see how much bad fake sugar I'd be having. To my surprise, there were no artificial sweeteners at all! It looks like diet berry just means less sugar, good!<br /><br />So the taste wasn't too great. You have to like tea a little bit, and be okay with the lack of sugar. The carbonation is definitely helpful.<br /><br />The energy is pretty good, you can feel it immediately. It's nothing like the really intense energy drinks, but it's still there. You also don't have to worry about any crashes or bad chemicals like other drinks.<br /><br />It's my favorite energy drink now, I'm going to get non-diet next to compare.

review/summary: Don't be fooled by the picture
review/text: I love the Diet Berry Energy Drink for all the reasons mentioned here. However, please note that the "diet" Berry Energy Drink is no longer available at all and anyone who orders the product pictured here won't get it.<br /><br />Much to my dismay, Steaz decided to eliminate the "diet" version and replace it with a "zero" calorie drink.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, Whole Foods folks told me Steaz just made a packaging change, so thinking it was the original "diet" version, I bought 4 cartons. Not wanting to lug them back to the store when I found out that the "zero" version was not the usual "diet" version in a new can, and hoping that maybe the "zero" version was acquired taste, I drank all 16 cans. Ugh. Awful stuff. I'll never buy another "zero" version.<br /><br />I was delighted to see the "diet" version available on this site and odered some. I've just returned it because what was shipped was the "zero" version, not the "diet" version. I thought maybe someone in a warehouse just packed the box wrong, but after time on the phone with the supplier and emails with Steaz, it turns out that the "diet" version won't be available at all.<br /><br />Someone needs to update the photo on this site.

review/summary: not for everyone
review/text: i don't want to discount all the positive reviews here, but i have to say that this energy simply does not work for everyone.<br /><br />i drank a lot of target-brand archer farms energy drinks which worked moderately well for me, but i wanted to try this because it was organic and presumably healthier than energy drinks with taurine and artificial colorings.<br /><br />i bought a four pack from whole foods with high expectations.  man i was disappointed.  first of all, the diet version tastes very much like carbonated water with that unique (somewhat unpleasant) "energy-drink" after-taste.  there is absolutely no flavor at all.  some people might like it, and i might have even put up with it had the actual drink worked, but i still can't get used to the watery taste.<br /><br />the first time i tried a can, i was really tired and had hoped that this would give me the boost i needed to finish my papers.  not only did it not have any effect, it helped me doze off into a nice two hour nap right after drinking the entire can in a couple minutes.  there goes my productivity.<br /><br />i really wanted to like this product, so i tried the rest of the cans in the pack, hoping that the first one was just a dud and that the others would be better. nope. no effect, nothing.  out of curiosity, i tried drinking one when i wasn't tired at all just to test out its effects, and IT ACTUALLY MADE ME SLEEPIER.  that's right, this alleged "energy" drink might as well be filled with serotonin because that's what it felt like for me.<br /><br />needless to say, there is not a single redeeming quality about this drink (for me, anyways).  the taste sucks.  the efficacy sucks.  the price sucks (considering the first two factors).  the packaging is nice though.  maybe you could dec out your room in these trendy looking cans to get a healthy, hipster-ish atmosphere going.  but at $2 a pop, you might be better off sticking to monochromatic prints of random skies, forests, and other places you've never been.<br /><br />bottom line, THIS DRINK SUCKS.

review/text: I was very disapointed at first. I followed all instructions, but nothing ever appeared. Consequently, I put it away. In May, I decided to give it one more try. I added the rest of the soil and planted all of the remaining seeds. Eventually, plants started poking through the dirt. Only 9 seeds have germinated and are continuing to grow, but I am enjoying watching them. If they live, I will eventually transplant them into a larger terrarium (already have plans drawn for it).

All instructions were followed and the toy was placed in an ideal place, still, nothing.  I would buy the seeds yourself and let your little one help plant them without the use of the dome. Simply use sandwich bags and an elastic band to create small greenhouses.<br /> A WASTE OF MONEY!

review/text: I'm not a big fan of flatbread but I have been on a diet and decided to give this a try. I have to say, wow. I've been topping them and using it as a snack in place of lunch. The other guy that works in my office, who isn't dieting, tried them and was impressed by the taste but I finally had to tell him to back off. He started ripping through them so I think that pretty much explains how well the product tastes. The flavor can support itself as a standalone snack but again, I top them and just love it.

review/text: I have been using this product for about a month now for my dogs. It was recommended to me by a friend to help ease my dog's digestive troubles and ear problems. I give one teaspoon of coconut oil to 10 Lbs of body weight and it has done wonders for my dogs (warning if you use any type of coconut oil, start adding it slowly and over a long period of time otherwise the dog will have diarrea). my dog's digestive problems have gone away completly, her coat is so soft and shiny and her ear problems have gone away. I noticed a big improvement in her ears using the coconut oil as a digestive supplement but I also swab a small amount in her ears every week-it is anti fungal and anti bacterial. She used to have chronic ear infections and her ears are perfect now. Also the coconut oil helped to take away the "doggie" odor from her skin. I highly recommend this product. It shipped quickly, it has a great price and is very easy to use.

The light botanical blend is the perfect balance between juice and sparkling water.  There is no added sugar.  It's all natural.  The Blackberry Chamomile, also called "Relax", is the ultimate beverage for maintaining good hydration and a healthy balance without consuming lots of added sugar and artificial ingredients.  I used to drink chamomile tea before going to bed to unwind and help naturally ensure a good night of sleep.  Now, I drink a can of this solixir.  I've found it is more effective than chamomile tea and I enjoy drinking it more.  Also check out the Pomegranate Ginger "Restore" and the Orange Mate "Awaken" for a well-rounded selection of functional, healthy beverages.
