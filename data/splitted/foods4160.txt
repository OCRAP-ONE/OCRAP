I use this in so many recipes from stir fry, to sauces, to meats, it is just very versatile!  Share one with a friend, they will be hooked too!

review/text: I love this product. I originally bought it to put in dipping oil for bread (like Macaroni Grill). But I have since sprinkled it on everything like salad, cous cous, vegetables etc. I also bread chicken with these and panko bread crumbs. They have a good little crunch and hold up well to moisture. The flavor is subtle not over powering garlic. They are light enough that they actually stick to food instead of falling to the bottom and being wasted. Love them. With a six pack I end up just sending home a jar with friends.

review/text: All in all this is an excellent product.<br />I've only been using it for a short time but not only are my cats trimmer, but they also seem noticeably more energetic. I've also noticed that the shedding is getter quite a bit better, which is wonderful! When you own two cats, the cat hair problem can get a little bad.<br />It did take them a few days to get used to the food. This is probably because just like my kids they prefer junk food!<br />But if you take it slow and mix the old food with the new for a while, they will adjust without having an upset stomach and getting to upset about the dietary change. And even though it's a little more expensive than the Purina that I was previously feeding them all of the benefits in my opinion outweigh the cost.

review/text: I purchased this for beer making. I read the other reviewer's warning but this was the cheapest barley I could find online. The closest place that sales barley is 100 miles away.<br /><br />These are guesses. I'd say only 5% sprouted the 3/4 the length of the actual barley grain. 75% sprouted but didn't make it past 1/4 the length of the grain. The rest didn't do a thing.<br /><br />There goes $40 down the drain. Barley is normally priced at about $12 for a 50 pound bag.

The Duck Strips are chewy and not smelly, so I don't have to wash my hands each time I handle them and I can keep a few in my pocket for an unexpected reward.  Of course, all the dogs love them, too. I highly recommend both of these treats for their quality.  If you love your dogs, these are the treats for them, not wheat-based biscuits.

review/summary: Doggie Crack!
review/text: I love the Plato line of products as they allow me to just mindlessly pick from the line and know that I am feeding something good to my dog(s). As for "Smart Dog Snacks" with Ginkgo Biloba and DHA...I'd better watch out, because my dogs love these treats so much that the treats just may make them smart enough to figure out how to open the "treat cabinet" take the container down and unscrew the lid to help themselves!<br /><br />While the treats themselves look like beef jerky, they are made with all natural, organic ingredients. The dogs don't care what's in these treats, they just know they love them. As I am typing this they are both sitting at attention, staring at me and whimpering while trying to do the Jedi Mind Trick of "you want to give us more Smart Dog Snacks, pick up your hand from that keyboard and reach in the container and hand us more. Do it. Do it now."<br /><br />There's so much junk out there and plenty of junk food that claims to be natural (just like people food) but this stuff is the real deal. Much like the food that I feed to the humans in the family, I know what each of the ingredients are and love that the first two ingredients are duck and brown rice. There aren't cost cutting fillers in these treats; it's a straight up high quality product. As an aside, I've bought from the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet many times, and I am always impressed with the products they carry. Just as I know that I can trust the Plato brand, I know that if a product is being carried by The Whole Healthy Pet, then it is a high quality product and I feel like a good parent getting it for my dogs.

review/summary: Plato duck "cookies"
review/text: My dog underwent allergy testing a month ago to determine why he's was so itchy and losing hair.  He's now having allergy shots and the vet recommended we limit his diet to duck and potato for now.<br /><br />I bought duck and potato biscuits at the pet store but there was nothing on the package that stated where this product was made; although my dog liked them, I was bothered that a smoke flavoring was obviously used.  Then I found duck jerky at the pet shop but it is made in China.  The store clerk said none of the customers had complained about it and my dog seems OK with them but I decided to look around<br /><br />I was relieved to find these duck treats as they are made in the U.S.  They arrived yesterday and as soon as I opened the bag, my dog was right there.  His eyes light up when he sees the blue bag and I call these his duck cookies.  My only wish is that these didn't have salt.<br /><br />Just wanted to alert people planning to order these - the first time I ordered these, I bought four bags and all of the bags were fine - however, the second time, I bought two bags and I just noticed that there were a number of strips in the bottom of the second bag that are covered in mold - I had to chuck the moldy ones in the trash (with my dog watching wide-eyed) - so I'm glad this is now available through the subscribe and save program - I hope ordering one bag at a time will avoid the risk of this happening again

These arrived today and my 3 dogs sniffed them suspiciously.  I broke them in half for them and they decided to give them a try.  They seemed to like them...they are different then I thought they would be.  They are almost the texture of a soft granola bar and not like jerky at all.  They are about 2" by .5" and the  contents of the bag were not crumbly like some have described.  All in all, I think these will work to replace the  jerky and since they are made and packaged in the US, I feel better about giving them treats.... Oh, and the  cost is pretty good too...

review/text: I've tried all three (and yes, the Salmon is fishy smelling and a bit greasy) and the dogs love them all. It is hard to find dog treats worth buying that are made in the USA that don't cost a fortune. These are reasonable. Don't be fooled by companies that are based in the US but the actual manufacture is in a country not to be named. I also will buy treats made in Canada. I think most pet stores, including ones like Petsmart and Petco are charging way too much for DOG TREATS. I found mine at a human health food store (Fruitful Yield) and was surprised at the cost. Now I see I can order all three from Amazon, shipped for a comparable price. Just wish I could order items in the US and have them shipped from Amazon to say England or Australia. Would love to easily send these to my friends' dogs.

review/summary: very good value for organic treats-good for your pupper
review/text: These are very inexpensive at this site because they are usually twice the price in all the typical pet stores you usually go to.  They are an awesome deal for organic.  I try to feed my dog only organic food and treats as close to all organic as I can.  I had a dog that was very young, 2 1/2, and he died from cancer and ever since then, I have been very cautious of what I feed my dog now.  Organic does make the difference and these treats are low in calories so they are a good treat to give your dog if you are trying to control his weight.  You don't have to feel guility giving him/her these treats, they are small and as I mentioned low calorie.  I would reccomend these to any dog owner and I have also purchased the chicken, duck and salmon treats made by Plato, all good choices.  The Salmon ones are very very stinky though, beware of those, good for your dog though, lots of Omega 3's in them.

review/summary: My Chihuahuas HATE This Product
review/text: My two Chihuahuas loved "Cadet Gourmet Pet Treats Duck Breast Fillets", the 32-Ounce package I had been buying at Costco.  However, I discovered it was made in China and feared this product could make them sick or cause death.  So I started searching for a company in the USA that made dog jerky treats.  I found Plato Natural Duck Strips and ordered a bag.  This product does not look like or smell like duck jerky strips.  My Chihuahuas sniffed it and just walked away.  It doesn't even smell like duck.  Rather, it smells somewhat fishy.  A waste of my money!

review/summary: These are duck chunks not strips
review/text: My darling dog can only eat duck snacks, she is allergic to everything else. I had ordered Plato duck strips before and they are excellent. (Seriously, is there anything a dog won't eat?) But these are CHUNKS, thus the FOUR stars instead of five. They are about 2 inches long and an inch wide, preformed snacks. The Plato strips I bought before were duck strips, not preformed. Of course she loved these but they are covered in a bit of "duck dust" for lack of a better term, so I didn't like to handle them as well as strips. Shipping was quick. The packaging says that these are made in America, important to me. If I am going to pay premium prices for dog snacks, I don't want to kill her with Chinese products! If you asked her, she would give them FIVE stars, because they smell "duckier".

review/summary: Paws Up for these Pricey Treats!
review/text: These are expensive (I would guess the 24 oz pkg contains maybe 20 sticks), but you can cut or break them in half (harder to break smaller pieces off) to make them last longer.  They're a huge hit with our two big guys - have to admit I was shocked at how quickly our big dog consumed one when we first opened the package!  I like varying protein source, so they split one each morning along with a mix of other snacks - it's a real treat for them, and Made in USA is a BIG plus for me as "Mom."

review/text: I got these from my local pet store, where they carry quality items (made in USA, no grain fillers, etc.).  I brought my pooch in one day for his regular food and the shop owner gave the pooch two of these.  Needless to say, I am a sucker for my pooch so of course I bought them.  After my dog had one of his legs amputated due to bone cancer, I switched from the common store brands to higher quality items like this.  I have noticed a marked improvement in my dog's overall recovery.  Even if your dog isn't suffering any kind of terminal illness, I recommend that you consider these sticks.

It is unquestionably the best coffee we have ever made at home. And with a small addition of Irish Creme syrup (another Christmas present), it was simply quite wonderful.

review/summary: Best commercial coffee, ever
review/text: I found Carte Noire in France in 1993 and started bringing packages back with me three or four times each year.  What captured my attention so firmly?  What makes this coffee so great?<br /><br />It is unusual simply because: (1) It is 100% Arabica; (2) It is 100% Colombian.  (3) It is roasted by the French.  There is only one other coffee with this particular rare pedigree, and it is good, but not quite as good as Carte Noire.  Amazon's ad terminology calls this an after dinner coffee.  I disagree with them.  We have always used it exclusively in the morning, as do the Europeans who value its rich taste.<br /><br />This coffee is bold but not overpowering.  It avoids giving you a thin or a bitter coffee taste.  One package of 250 grams (very finely ground) will last for exactly five days when brewed in a 12-cup pot.  My coffee philosophy is this:  If you're going to drink coffee, buy and drink the best one you can find anywhere.  This is it.  I wouldn't lie about something this important.

review/text: My wife and I found this coffee in France during a "coffee buying spree".  We bought a little of everything and enjoyed them through out the year.  One of the more inexpensive brands (in France) is Carte Noire.  It might be common coffee in France, but to us it was the absolute best.  We order several each year.  I'm the hit with my fellow adults when I bring it to a Boy Scout camp out. My fellow adults even pout when I run out.<br /><br />This is some great stuff and the seller does a nice job in shipping it.  Be aware that sometimes it is out of stock, so you might join us and order a few and stock it up in the freezer.

review/text: My love of Happy Cola is not the slightest bit healthy.  In fact, if you look at the nutrition facts for Happy Cola (not recommended), Happy Cola is not the slightest bit healthy.  I'm pretty sure each individual delicious chewy cola is like 290 calories.  When you finish the bag, you better plug in P90, or you are totally f'd.  These delicious cola-flavored chewables are not for amateurs.  I'm pretty sure they should be left for 12-year-olds with unlimited metabolism, but I've always had a rebellious side.<br /><br />This is my favorite item in the Haribo product line.  That hint of cola-flavor (is it Pepsi or Coke?  I'll never know) is exactly what I need in my life.  When you need a change-up I recommend going crazy with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVT06K">Haribo Gummi Candy, Fizzy Cola, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> which is a totally different experience.<br /><br />In other news, if you do Subscribe and Save at around $1.00/bag, you are saving at least $0.29 per unit versus purchasing at over-priced New York City bodegas.  I love per-unit savings almost as much as I love calling in sick and playing golf.  What, no one else does that?<br /><br />5 stars, easy.

review/summary: Not as gummi as other brands
review/text: I love gummi coke bottles and prefer them over choclate.  I have always got mine in bulk from a store called Henry's which recently stopped selling them.  So I tried the Haribo and was very disappointed in the several bags I have tried.  The candy was stiff and actually required severe chewing to the point that my jaw got tired.  The taste was there it just was not as soft as other brands and there was no way you could pull a bottle apart with your hands like other brands I have tried.

review/summary: A simple pleasure that belongs on any office desk, Happy-Cola Gummi Candy!
review/text: These bottle shaped candies are clear at the top and dark brown at the bottom. They are rather chewy, you can give them a generous bite unlike your standard gummy bear that is soft when chewed, falling to pieces in your mouth. While not exactly like a Coke, the candy does have that distinctive kick. I guess I just like the sensation of chewing up my cola rather than drinking it.<br /><br />Product Testing<br />In the interest of science, I threw several candies at coworkers, doors, walls, old computer cases, monitors, desks and nerdy programming books in attempt to break them. They did not. Gummi colas do exhibit strange bouncing properties when placed on spinning CD-ROM's. The slightly sticky surface gives them enough traction to fly at an alarming speed. Research was abruptly stopped when I discovered my manager does not approve of food testing without prior FDA approval.<br /><br />Gummi Candy Characteristics<br />Bought 6/2008, my bag has an expiration date of 5/2009. While this bag will not last that long in my sugar craving hands, I think this is an amazing amount of time for a product made of the following ingredients: Corn syrup, Sugar, Gelatin, Dextrose, Citric Acid, Caramel Syrup, Starch, Artificial and Natural Flavors, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Carnauba Wax, Beeswax Coating<br /><br />Each bag has about 30 pieces of gummy coke pleasure tipping the scales at 5 ounces or 142 grams. 10 pieces register as follows on the ole nutrition scale: Calories 150, Total Fat 0G, Sodium 0G, Carbohydrate 34G, Protein 3G<br /><br />This product is Gluten free and Casein free. A diet without these products eliminates the intake of naturally-occurring proteins: gluten(wheat and barley) and casein(in milk). Among others, the Autism Research Institute recommend the diet as a treatment for autism and similar conditions.

review/summary: Amazing Soda!
review/text: I met my wife in Peru in early February of 2007. I was searching for a soda (I've never been a fan of Coke or Pepsi) and Inca Kola looked a lot like Mountain Dew. It's not a thing like Mountain Dew. It's far sweeter, and far more delicious. In about a week I'd probably drank 3-4 gallons of it while I was in Peru. Very very very few places in the states offer Inca Kola though, and this is a very good price for it. It arrived in excellent condition and very thoughtfully packed from this seller, not only would I heartily recommend Inca Kola, I'd also recommend Mexigrocer!

review/summary: Better than Coca Cola
review/text: The Inca Kola is better than Coca Cola for sure. At least in Peru, since I was born there, I had been drinking it all my life and we all Peruvians know the difference between both sodas. Inca Kola seems to keep you happier than Coke. So for regular occasions drink Coke but for the special occasions Inka Kola is the answer. That's why now even Amazon sells it here. Whow! looks pretty demanding by now.

review/summary: Unique, worth trying at least once
review/text: This is a unique soda pop, I'm not quite sure I've had one like it before.  For the record I've never been to anywhere in Latin America, just the States and Canada.  Anyway, it is very much worth trying at least once.  Some people describe the flavor in reviews as like bubble gum, I'd say that close but there's something else there too.  For something as "simple" as soda pop the flavor is very subtle.  It is VERY sweet though, not sure if my bottle uses sugar or corn syrup (the ingrediants on the bottle I got says either High Frutose Corn Syrup or Sucrose was used) but regardless, it is very sweet, probably up to the level of Jolt way back when they still used cane sugar if not more.  It's not something I'd want every day, I'd grow tired of it, but that is probably true of almost anything.  But it is a nice unique treat to try, and despite the price and shipping (It was packed very well as an aside, and shipped quickly so I don't think the shipping was overpriced considering that) I know I'll order it again when the mood hits to have this.

review/text: I consider it one of the best soft drinks I have ever had. In Peru, this is often referred to a kids drink. Tourists seem to gravitate towards it. It is extremely sweet and has a distinct bubblegum flavor with a hint of banana in my opinion.<br /><br />As far as the product received from the shipper (MexGrocer), I'm pleased. It was packaged extremely well. As expected it had some loss of carbonation as it traveled a considerable distance. Still great stuff.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon and MexGrocer!

review/text: I used it in a Moqueca which is a Brazilian Fish Stew, and it was very delicious. The problem I had was with the bottle top. The recipe called for 1/4 c of the oil. Unfortunately, I was unable to remove the plastic top which does not unscrew.  It just has a flip top cap with a single hole in it and ended up just shaking it by drops into the measuring cup which was messy and a hassle.

review/text: I was nervous buying this at first because the description was a bit vague with a bad picture, but when I received the box I discovered HUGE pieces of all natural papaya which are not at all like the store bought kind.  It comes in a plastic bag in a box about the size of a shoe box.  This is pure dried papaya and it's a bit leathery, very colorful and flavorful almost like apricots, whereas the stuff you get in stores is more like candy, added sugar and SO2, and has a lot of water weight.  Highly Recommended!  I am uploading a picture.

review/summary: Try a Box Before Buying a Case - a review of BTN's Mac & Cheese
review/text: I like organic. We do organic milk and meat, and vegetables when we can afford the latter. My children like macaroni and cheese - not my homemade casserole, of course (lol), but out of a box. (Reasons for this preference are unknown.)<br /><br />In any case, you would think organic *Back to Nature Macaroni & Cheese* would be popular at our house but it's not. Simple put, my children won't eat it.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because of the lack of chemicals that the cheese sauce comes out a little grainy. Or maybe I just made it wrong, but my testy tikes won't gobble this down like non-organic, over-processed wheat Kraft Mac.<br /><br />Two Stars. Maybe I just had a bad box. Or maybe I just didn't make it right that day, but my two (boy and girl) would not eat this macaroni and cheese product. If you are going to try it (products do get IMPROVED every day) then my advice would be to buy ONE box and try it; and not a case.

review/text: I am a huge fan of organic foods and have experimented for years on how to get my children to eat things that are better for them. That said, this pasta is as good as any other on the market, but you can make it wonderful just by adding two simple ingredients. After I take the pasta out of the pan to drain it, I add about a tablespoon of light margarine (any soft butter-type spread will work) and about 3 tablespoons of fat free sour cream (you may also use plain yogurt). I whisk the cheese powder into this mixture and then add the pasta back to the mix. My kids finish an entire box EVERY time. Try it!

review/summary: Organic Buyers Beware
review/text: Don't buy this if you think you're buying organic macaroni and cheese.  I guess I'm more than shocked about how this is fraudulently advertised on Amazon.com.  In its product features, it says: "Made with organic cheddar cheese."  This is blatantly false.  When you receive the Mac and Cheese, it's packaged in a neat little "Back to Nature" box announcing its support of the Nature Conservancy on the back of the box giving it the veneer of being "natural."  However, if you read the ingredients, not even the cheddar cheese is organic.  There is no organic certifier to be found, either.<br /><br />Now, this actually breaks the National Organic Program standards and should be investigated by the Agriculture Department.  This changes my whole view of Kraft -- not that it was especially good before.  But apparently, this company buys into the "greenwashing" effort to try to cash in on the good organic name without actually supporting the type of food system we expect when we buy organic.

review/summary: A tasty Kraft product
review/text: My children are extremely picky eaters, and they like this product quite a bit. I've eaten some as well in a pinch, and while the salt is off the charts, it is tasty.<br /><br />Regarding their truth in advertising: every box of macaroni & cheese in the case we bought contains an envelope of Kraft "white cheese sauce". Which is a bit deceiving considering the "1960 in the back of a small health food store in Pasadena" story they are telling in the product description, and the advertisement of 'real natural' cheddar cheese on the box.<br /><br />If it's a Kraft product, why not disclose this before we've opened the box? What does Kraft have to hide?
