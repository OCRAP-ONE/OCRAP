review/summary: Amazingly good
review/text: This is one of the few foods that is not only healthy for you but tastes absolutely amazing! This cereal is so good we could eat the whole box in one sitting. Unfortunately we cannot afford to do this too often as the cereal is a bit pricey.<br /><br />What we like most about this cereal is how it tastes nutty and sweet without being cloyingly sweet.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/text: I got a sample box of these in the mail a couple of weeks ago and ate them then next morning.  They were even better than I could have imagined!  They were not to hard, but did not get soggy in the milk, either.  They are just the right size for a bite and don't irritate the roof of my mouth like a lot of similar cereals will.  They also had just the right balance of sweetness without tasting sugary nor being bland.  Overall, I was very pleased and will definitely consider buying these in the future.

review/text: Why does Quaker find the need to put BHT (a preservative) in their near wholesome and nutritionally sound cereals? Other companies, Kashi, do not add preservatives.  Also, some other companies use Vitamin E as a preservative, which is more wholesome, as preservatives go.  Just a thought, thanks!

review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares are my son's and my favorite cereal so I was very excited to find it so inexpensive per box on Amazon, but when they arrived, the boxes were so small!  Only 16oz!  That made me unhappy and I thought they may have cost too much.  But then I went to the Wal-Mart and found the boxes there are only 16oz now, but still the same price.  So the Amazon price is good, but Quaker is making the product smaller.

review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares are small squares of crunchy oatmeal with just a hint of brown sugar to make it lightly sweet. I really love the crunch in this cereal. I cannot stand soggy cereal and the crunch really holds up to the end of the bowl. One serving has 3 grams of fiber so this is a great breakfast to start the morning off with. Healthy enough so I should eat it and tasty enough so I want to eat it. Great breakfast choice!

review/summary: What about Golden Maple
review/text: How come Golden Maple gets no love from anyone? Most grocery stores only carry brown sugar and cinnamon, with very few carrying limited number of Golden Maple flavor. In my opinion, Golden Maple is the best; I might even venture to say that it is the only good flavor of oatmeal squares. If I have a choice between brown sugar, cinnamon, or nothing at all, I almost always choose nothing at all. Please Amazon, stock some golden maple!!!!<br /><br />p.s. I gave this a 4-star rating because brown sugar isn't that great. However, golden maple is da bomb!

review/text: I love Oat Squares, I'll eat them every day.  It's the only cold cereal I've found that keeps me full, tastes good, and isn't loaded with sugar.  Which is why they get my 5-star review.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this price is horrible.  Even with the subscribe and save, they're $1.16 more a pound than from Walmart.  I failed to realize the boxes in Walmart were much larger (20-something ounces), and sell for $3.38.  That's $2.25/lb.<br /><br />Edit: thanks to the lovely economy, the boxes at Walmart are now the the one pound boxes, but still cost the same.  So with subscribe and save, you'll be saving about 45 cents a box.

review/text: I was skeptical at first because they looked like a smaller sized version of the Frosted Mini Wheats which was unbearable but they turned out pretty good and addicting. They taste like a cross between graham cracker and unsalted chex with a grainier mouthfeel. It tastes earthy with a hint of sweetness. I like it with or without milk, of course with milk is better.<br /><br />It's about 220 (?) calories per serving (1 cup), so it's about twice as many calories compared to my other favorite: Special K. Good thing it's very filling so I can usually settle for just half a cup with a cup of milk.

review/summary: Great, healthy cereal.
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares is a great, healthy cereal both in the bowl and from the box as a snack. I go through so many boxes that I look for the best price. The local Kroger sells regularly at $4.48 per 16oz box.  Amazon, if you subscribe to a set, continuing shipment schedule goes for $2.88 per 16oz box.  I found Walmart has the best price at $2.39 per 16 oz.. packed in 24 oz boxes.. They sell out fast so I watch their website and order several 6 box (24oz) cases when they are available and the shipment is only 97 cents per case, which I included in the in the $2.39 pricing... I think this cereal is a big part of my bringing my cholesterol in line..without medication.

The tube keeps well in the fridge and I'm able to use as much or as little as I need, without any waste or mess.  It's now my go-to choice whenever I cook with chipotle peppers.

review/summary: Spike enhances just about everything
review/text: Spike is a seasoned salt that is great for cooking just about any kind of vegetable.  As vegetarians, we rely on Spike to provide the complex flavoring that carnivores obtain by adding meat without the time consuming process of cooking stocks.  We have used Spike for 30 years and now buy it in 5 lb. bulk, which lasts us over a year.  We decant it into a smaller shaker.  Spike keeps its flavor very well and we see no difference when switching from a year-old to a new batch.

review/summary: More of a short-lived breath mint than gum
review/text: I tried several different flavors of Mentos gum, but was rather disappointed by the overall product.<br /><br />First of all, the good points.  The gum comes in a hard, durable container, which is easy to carry around in one's pants pocket, and also facilitates dispensing.  Additionally, I like the initial texture of the gum, as it has a hard exterior shell and a soft chewy interior core, which immediately releases a burst of flavoring.  Lastly, the texture and consistency of the gum is maintained throughout the mastication process.<br /><br />Now, the bad part.  The biggest drawback is that the flavor only lasts at most a few minutes, necessitating me to eat several pieces at once in order to maintain any semblance of lasting mint flavor.  Compared to other rival brands such as Dentyne or Eclipse, this is unacceptable.  I'm not interested in chewing a piece of bland plastic after just 2-3 minutes.  Some have also commented that the hard container makes too much noise in one's pants pockets when walking around.<br /><br />In summary, the Mentos are best used as an ephemeral breath mint, rather than a long-lasting gum.

review/summary: I LOVE this gum!
review/text: My dentist recommended I chew Mentos gum because the main ingredient is Xylitol and that it breaks down the bacteria that causes cavaties.  Right there, I was sold.  I'm a lifelong avid gum chewer and to have a dentist actually RECOMMEND I chew a certain brand was like music to my ears!  I like that it's got the crunchy shell and then the inside is soft - and stays soft!  I think the flavor lasts a decent amount of time - but I like to chew and usually have a piece long after the flavor is gone.  I highly recommend this gum - my favorite is the spearmint flavor, but I've enjoyed all of the mint flavors.  I haven't tried the fruity flavors because Xylitol isn't the main ingredient - dentist says it MUST be the main ingredient for it to work properly.  :)

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.

I think it works well as a marinade also.  Enjoy.

review/text: I'll admit: being married to cousinpaco can't be the easiest thing in the world -- among other things, the frequent, top-secret ninja missions take me away from home for long intervals.<br /><br />Still, marriage is a two-way street, and ol' cousinpaco has had to compromise here and there, believe you me.<br /><br />For instance, when it comes to Ginger Ale, I'm a die-hard Canada Dry man. "Take off, eh" is my motto. But cousinpaco's better half grew up drinking Vernors. Since she's the one who handles the grocery shopping, guess what's waiting for me in the fridge when I return from infiltrating secret bases to sabotage weather-dominating machines and such? Yep -- Vernors. Nothing against Vernors, of course...except that, to my palate, Vernors tastes like cough medicine.<br /><br />I know, I know -- I could get off my keister and buy my own soft-drinks. But when you're fighting a never-ending battle against morons who (for example) seek to conquer the world by building giant robotic dinosaurs, the last thing you want to do on weekends is wait in the grocery line behind some old lady who has thirty items in the Express Lane...and probably wants to pay with a check.<br /><br />So, that means I drink Vernors. It's the price of marriage, I s'pose.<br /><br />Thankfully, we both agree that toilet paper should pull from the top of the roll, not underneath. That would have been a deal-breaker.

The 100% is more worth the price, but you don't need to spend quite so much for comparably great coffee..  Still recommended, Kona coffee is a great product (buy the 100% instead for 40% more).

review/text: my cats told me this stuff is delicious. and i almost lost a couple of fingers while feeding them so this opinion was confirmed. Also, my dad's cat, a notoriously picky eater, will not eat anything but kitty fast food and this stuff. Sure it's expensive, but it ain't fast food-only the good stuff in here and my cats and their vet appreciate it.

review/summary: Giant Pez "Joe Cool" Snoopy
review/text: It's giant pez Snoopy.  Dispenses Pez candy rolls.  Neat!  It's suppose to play a song when you open it but the batteries were dead in the one I got, even though it has a paper tab to pull.  Comes with 2x(3 pack of fruity pez candy), so you don't get 1.7 pounds of candy, the whole box+snoopy probably weighs 1.7 lbs. Why call it 1.7 lbs ? It tastes ???? I wonder if it's suppose to be like that?

review/summary: We ALWAYS buy this oatmeal
review/text: It seems a little crazy to buy oatmeal in bulk, but we go through one container of this oatmeal a week.  It has a much better consistency than traditional "quick-cooking" oatmeal, and is a nice compromise over the steel-cut oatmeal because it cooks in only five minutes (as opposed to twenty).

review/summary: The best oatmeal!
review/text: I was so happy to find this on Amazon. It makes a wonderfully-textured and flavorful oatmeal (I'm not a fan of mushy/slimey style oatmeal). Since I don't like to 'stir frequently,' my preparation technique is a bit different: bring water to boil in a deep pot<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000E2PO7">Norpro KRONA 8 Cup Multi Pot with Straining Lid</a> , throw in oats, stir, then turn off heat but leave pot on the stove and let sit 10-15 minutes (longer cooking time, but all passive).  I like to mix in chia seeds, chopped/broken raw nuts (walnuts or pecans), dried fruit (raisins, blueberries or a superfruit blend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0YC">Navitas Naturals Trail Power Organic Goji, Mulberry And Incan Golden Berry Trail Mix, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>, some cinnamon or pumpkin-pie spice and/or nutmeg, sweetening with a touch of maple syrup or agave, and adding some non-dairy milk if it needs it. I've also made 'banana bread' oatmeal by stiring in a ripe mashed banana (with walnuts, raisins, and all three spices) and 'pumpkin-pie' oatmeal (stirring in mashed cooked yams and pumpkin-pie spice). YUM!

review/summary: Great deal, great oatmeal
review/text: I paid $4.99 at my local health food store for one 18.5 oz container of this oatmeal.  That would be $60. for 12 containers.  I am thrilled to find 12 for $35. on Amazon and ordered them.  This is delicious oatmeal, and I like to make it with coconut, dried cherries, candied ginger, slivered almonds on top and warm rice milk.  Really good.

review/summary: Great Tasting Healthy Cereal!
review/text: I've been looking for a cereal without sugar of any kind which is very hard to find first of all. I also wanted it to be gluten & lactose free while being a excellent source of fiber which this is. It's made up of chia seeds & also has hemp & buckwheat seeds in it. I've read that Chia seeds have five times more calcium than milk & more Omega 3 than flax or salmon. There's 6 grams of protein in just 2 tablespoons which is considered a serving size since when you add liquid, it bulks up and can be eaten cold or hot. I use almond milk and a little stevia in mine & it's quite filling. I probably sound like an advertisement but I just saw that its offered now on Amazon and since I've been so happy w/this product, I wanted to be the first to leave a review. I notice this company also offers other chia cereals w/different flavorings but I haven't tried since they have small amts of sweetener added.

review/summary: Super Yummy!
review/text: I love this stuff! Delicious whole grain, easy to fix. I make it in the microwave. I don't think it has any microwave instructions, but I'm prone to burning rice type stuff on the stove. I use twice as much water as pilaf mix, bring to a boil on high. Place glass lid on corningware. Heat on medium heat until all the water is absorbed. Add more water if you want it softer. Times vary according to volume, natch, but usually 10 minute bursts work: 10 minutes high, 10 minutes at 70% or whatever, another 10 minutes at 70%. I like to let it sit covered between the last two ten minutes and after. As long as it's hot and covered it will absorb water. Can't wait to try it in a pressure cooker to get the cook times down, but thus far, I let it cook while I'm making a curry or something else.<br /><br />Love it! Delicious as is, or add a dollop of butter and garlic and spices.

review/text: Kashi makes some fine things, but this "7 Grain Whole Pilaf" is in my opion their best. It is very versatile and easy to prepare, and can even be cooked in a rice cooker.  It's great plain as a hot cereal, makes a wonderful pilaf, and a delicious salad. It also makes a great base for vegetable patties or loaf. Just about any dish using a grain base works well. I could make a different dish everyday with it and never tire of it!

review/summary: Best Rice/Pasta Equivalent
review/text: This product is my favorite  substitution for rice and pasta, and couscous.  Yes, it sounds extraordinarily "healthy"  (and it is!)  but it is also quite tasty and goes with  all the same things you would put rice in: soup, casseroles, red-sauced dishes, cold or room-temperature Mediterranean salads, in place of Quinoa, and Wheat-berries.  The other unknown and un-advertised feature is that it is a wonderful, painless "Colon stimulator", If you catch my drift.  Wonderful, huge, and satisfying  'presentations', if you will!<br />I order it here because I no longer live in the City, where it is liberally available in local supermarket.  This, indeed, was a happy find.<br /><br />JTC,<br /><br />Somonauk, IL

review/summary: Unexpected combination is FANTASTIC!
review/text: Faerie's Finest Vanilla Sea Salt was a recent birthday gift.  Since I opened it (the version I have came in a refillable grinder) I have been grinding Vanilla Sea Salt on everything.<br /><br />As one is grinding the salt, the smell of vanilla drifts up and is quite soothing and intriguing.  The flavor, once incorporated into food, is very mild.  It is not a "dessert"-y vanilla flavor, due to the sea salt, but when sampled in a bowl of hearty turkish chicken-lemon-egg-rice soup the vanilla smoothed out the lemon flavor a bit- made it almost silky and buttery rather than tart (I put in a little too much lemon this go around)... I had filet mignon and sprinkled a little of the vanilla sea salt on the filet and I think that vanilla sea salt was made for this purpose... Absolute perfection!<br /><br />Fantastic blend, fantastic packaging.  I'm one happy salt fanatic!
