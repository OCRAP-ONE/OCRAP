review/text: We used to have two pomeranians - Autumn and Teddie.  Ever since we lost Teddie last summer, Autumn became very depressed and wouldn't eat.  We tried so many different brands including home-cooked, he would only ate a couple times and wouldn't touch it anymore.  He lost so much weight and got us so worried.  But that all changed when we found Organix and that's the only brand Autumn will eat.  Now he can't wait until I feed him every morning.  The cost Amazon offered is less expenisve than other retailers and you can't beat free shipping!!  Please continue carrying it!!

review/summary: Great food, but consider the costs.
review/text: I have an old, soppy Saint Bernard who's missing a bunch of her teeth.  And don't start nagging me about doggy dental care!  I adopted her from a rescue organization & the damage had already been done when we got her.  Anyway, we started supplementing her dry kibble with this canned food; and although she really likes it & the consistency is great for her toothlessness, the price increases EVERY TIME we order have left me seeking other options.<br /><br />After weighing out all the costs, it's actually cheaper to buy ground beef in bulk & boil it up for her, and mix it up with some brown rice and/or eggs.  I don't know if this diet is "healthier" for her, but she isn't gaining any extra weight & her coat looks fantastic.  And I have peace of mind in knowing ~exactly~ what she's eating.  She's almost 10 & probably doesn't have a whole lot of time left with us, and she seems to prefer the hamburger/brown rice/egg concoction to the canned food.  And my budget likes having a couple of extra dollars a week, too.<br /><br />I really do think it's a great food.  Just make sure you do your own cost calculations to find the best value for your already-stretched dollar.

review/summary: Quality premium dog food.
review/text: My sister told me about Organix brand dog food.  After reading the ingredients I began buying it for my dogs.  I only feed them premium dog foods like Organix and Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers' Soul.  They contain real meat products and no fillers.  Organix takes this a step further with organic food in the ingredients.  The price is a bit higher, but it's worth it to have healthy pets!  My last dog died of cancer, and after a lot of research, I believe that high-quality pet food ingredients without fillers are the best plan for healthier pets!

I'm reticent to feed the food<br />from the dented cans, so end up throwing them away.  Any<br />savings I gained ordering from Amazon were lost in<br />the cans I had to dispose of.  Other than that, my dog<br />loves this food and does very well on it.  I may just<br />have to resort to sourcing it locally.

I have two 70 pound Goldendoodles, one with bilateral hip dysplasia.  I have fed them various food over the past five years and none seem to agree with them more than this Castor & Pollux.  One of my dogs has terrible gastric problems with gurgling and passing gas and he hasn't experienced any of that eating this food.  I'm glad to be able to get it on Amazon. Saves me a lot of money compared to the pet store where I was buying it.

As soon as I gave him a little canned (a small amount mixed with his other food) he started vomiting white foamy stuff the following morning.  I ended up giving a can to a friend and her dog had horrible breath (from his stomach--does not have bad teeth). I didn't give the rest away, will throw it away. I emailed the company twice and they couldn't  bother to respond in about two weeks. Apparently they don't stand by their products. Now I don't trust any of their products even though my dog does fine on the dry formula.

review/summary: not a wonderful price to say
review/text: Please, tell me loyal amazon readers and customers- this is a curious question of mine.  Who in their right mind, or rather, what kind of person would spend 10 dollars for an 8-pack of hot dog buns?  Because when one factors in shipping and handling, that's the ridiculous current price.  Is it people that don't have a grocery store in their town (LOL!) so they have to rely on online shopping?  Maybe people in other countries looking for American food (which is a hilarious thought considering how terrible and junky the food sold here in the states is).  Maybe some people can't actually drive either because they're physically unable to or simply don't have their license, so they can't travel around in search of Wonder hot dog buns.  I'm speechless right now.  There has to be a reason for the high dollar food prices here on amazon.

The sausage is absolutely delicious and I will be ordering more soon as family and friends are making my stash of 25lbs of sausage disappear quickly.<br /><br />A note to outdoorsman, I ordered the kit the evening I harvested a deer and it was shipped the next day getting to me in plenty of time before I had to be concerned with having to freeze the meat, which is very convenient because you can then make a large batch and freeze some for later in the year without having to freeze the meat twice.

review/text: A person should completely ignore the price here.  To be truthful, if you use coupons and watch for sales, you can get these much cheaper. This review is not about the price, it is about the product.<br /><br />I love these things and they are one of my favorite snack foods and I am seldom without a box of them open.  I love the flavor and eating a few handfuls with a nice crisp apple and a glass of tea is yammers.<br /><br />I want to say though that not only are these delicious, they are also very filling.  This at one time in my life was very important.  Yes, there was a time when I was absolutely flat broke; like as in I was not sure where my next meal was coming from.  Let me tell you that a box of these things and a glass of water can take you far.  It fills an empty belly quite well and if you have every had an empty stomach and were truly hungry, you will know that it is not a pleasant experience.<br /><br />There were many days that these things were the only thing I had to eat and they saw me trough.  Times are better now; a lot better, but I still have a special place in my heart for these little chips.  You would think that I would be sick of them after all that; not so, I still like the things.

Maybe it's an attempt to simulate more cheese flavor, but put it back to what it was.

review/summary: Reduced-Unhappiness Cheez-Its
review/text: First of all, Cheez-Its are better than Nips because they aren't covered with that gross powder.<br /><br />Second, Reduced Fat Cheez-Its are better than Cheez-Its because they have a smokey, woodsy taste, like standing outside in autumn when someone far away is burning leaves. I try now to imagine the taste of Reduced Fat Cheez-Its, and I feel my hands sitting warm in the pockets of my wool coat, arriving at my grandmother's house in South Carolina for Thanksgiving dinner. The sun sets earlier now; in fact, the sun seems always to be setting this time of year, even at midday. Yellow-orange light reflects softly off everything. I know that inside the house, my grandmother is stirring mashed potatoes on the stove. She doesn't know that I've arrived yet. When I walk through the front door, there will be happiness in her eyes, sincere happiness at seeing me. A kind of happiness that, here in New York in my late twenties, feels so distant. People here are just not that happy to see anyone - certainly not me.<br /><br />Third, regular Cheez-Its and Better Cheddars are too buttery for my taste. They taste sort of greasy.

review/summary: Healthy and great tasting!
review/text: This review is less about the cereal and more about the option of buying from Amazon for one of two reasons:<br /><br />1) If you've never had it, you're probably not going to buy a 4-pack.  More likely, you'll go to your local market and buy one box.<br /><br />2) If you have had it and you're looking at this item, you're trying to decide if you want to buy a 4-pack.<br /><br />I have a 4-pack delivered every month via "Subscribe & Save" and here's why:<br /><br />My local groceries carry the smaller 12oz boxes for about $3-$3.50, the 16.7 oz box is usually about $5-$5.50.  Bear in mind, this item is a 4-pack of 16.7 oz boxes.<br /><br />The subscribe & save option from Amazon takes 15% off (did I also mention no shipping, no commitment) which lowers the $20 price tag to more like $17 for four boxes, or $4.25 per box- that's almost a dollar off what my grocery charges!<br /><br />So, I get the cereal I love, delivered to my door regularly and automatically, for almost a dollar less than what I'd have to pay if I drove to the store.  It doesn't take a college education to know that's a deal!

review/text: My mother lives in Colorado and is on a very fixed low income. If I send her money she won't use it so I have found I can help her by buying her groceries off Amazon and having them sent directly to her house and this enables me to be able to help her. THANK YOU Amazon for having products like this on your site. I hope you continue to work with companies and make this affordable to have groceries shipped this way and also to save us the hassels of going to the grocery store when we can have it delivered to our house for about the same cost as going to the grocery store.

review/summary: I Lost 6 pounds in 2 weeks!
review/text: I was just two pounds shy of my Weight Watchers goal when I fell off the weight loss wagon and gained four additional pounds.  Life was busy, and I wanted a fuss-free way to lose those last pounds before swimsuit season.  Since I enjoy Special K products, I thought I'd put the Special K 2-Week Weight Loss Challenge to the test.  I ate Special K cereal for two meals, snacked on fruits and veggies (instead of the recommend Special K snack products) and made healthy dinner choices.  I didn't expect to lose 6 pounds as advertised, since my weight loss had slowed from months of dieting and I was near my goal weight.  To my surprise, I lost 6 pounds and have finally reached my goal weight!<br /><br />ABOUT THE DIET:<br /><br />It's convenient and doesn't require much planning.  However, it could get a little boring in the long run.  It could also be difficult to meet daily nutritional requirements.  Also, rapid weight loss could be difficult to maintain in the long run.  If you've been dieting and just can't lose those last few pounds, or if you need to lose a few pounds fast for a big event, give Special K a try.<br /><br />ABOUT THE CEREAL:<br /><br />One can usually find a box of Special K in my kitchen cabinet.  Most often, it is the Red Berries variety.  I enjoy the Fruit and Yogurt flavor, as well, but the serving size is 1/4 cup less.  The original flavor is also nice from time to time, but the Chocolatey Delight is just not a good idea, in my opinion.  But back to the Red Berries.  The cereal consists of the usual Special K flakes with dehydrated strawberries.  Once I pour on my Silk Light soy milk, the berries plump up to add lots of real strawberry flavor.  There are generous amounts of berries and the flakes stay crispy in milk.  All in all, this is an excellent cereal that I highly recommend.

review/summary: The Pros and Cons
review/text: Kellogg's Special K Cereal, Red Berries, 16.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4), is a delicious cereal.  Since Kellogg is number one  -- the number one producer of convenience food in the world --we know Kellogg will give us what we want while ignoring the things that do not matter to us.<br /><br />What do we want?<br />(1) Flavor.  Those real freeze dried strawberries are so delicious that we are tempted to eat them dry out of the box and leave the cereal.  The cereal tastes good too.  It is sweet, and there is malt flavoring that we love.<br />(2) Nutrition.  With 110 calories per cup, we can measure out a cup and use it for diet food.  It has vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, B vitamins, and minerals.<br />(3) Grain.  There are crispy rice and wheat flakes.<br /><br />What does not matter to us? (Or does it?)<br />(1) Sugar.  The cereal is loaded with it, but if we did not have it in the cereal, many of us would spoon in a generous application. The second ingredient is sugar.  Is that cane or corn?  Also listed in the ingredients is high fructose corn syrup.<br />(2) Nutrition.  It is hard to stop with one cup full because we are used to feeling full.  A cup of light cereal takes us through the motion of eating slowly . . . that's a plus . . . but does not satisfy the way whole grain cereal does.  About the added nutrition:  some of us don't need all of what it gives us, or maybe we really do prefer to take them in pill form so we know we exactly what we are getting.  Many of us take in more iron than is considered healthy for our specific needs.  What your physician will tell you about this issue may be surprising.<br />(3) Grain. If we are allergic to wheat, we need to pay attention to the label.  Also there is corn in the form of fructose.  What we are getting is highly refined grain products when whole grain would be better for our health by providing fiber.<br /><br />With the price out of the range of what we usually spend on breakfast foods, I don't find it a good value.

review/text: While I understand people getting upset over the price increase, the low rate is to reflect the quality of the product not the cost increase by Amazon or their vendors. I actually use the subscribe option  to save money but cancel or put on hold after a few days, I never leave any order to be sent automaticatedly since I will risk the chance of having to pay more, we need to be responsible buyers. Amazon is a business and knows that they will make money on those not paying attention, PEOPLE that is what life had become so get over and on with it. I do prefer the 3 boxes since 4 was to much for us and still buy it when it goes down in price.

review/summary: My favorite breakfast cereal ...
review/text: This stuff is wonderful if you're on Weight Watchers:  a 1-cup serving is only 2 pts, Add 2/3 C skim milk, and we're talking a total of 3 pts for a very filling and delicious breakfast.  I've tried most of the Special K flavors, and this one is by far the best.  The freeze-dried strawberries have a wonderful almost-fresh strawberry flavor, too.<br /><br />Most of my diet (I'd say 90%) is unprocessed, consisting of meals I make "from scratch," using fresh ingredients from the produce and meat/fish aisles.  I also make my own breads, biscuits, etc.  I'm very much aware of the controversy surrounding high fructose corn syrup, the negative impact it can have especially on dieters, and I try to avoid it.  That said, and given my overall diet, I don't have a problem with consuming a small amount of HFCS occasionally for breakfast.  It would be lovely if Kelloggs didn't use HFCS, but they do -- it's fairly low on the list of ingredients (just ahead of salt), but it's there.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'm losing weight, keeping it off, and I feel great.  If you're concerned about HFCS, you may decide this isn't for you.

review/summary: Good price (w/ S&S); crunchy flakes&low fat. 16.7oz is all cereal & f.dried strwberries. But a little too sweet...
review/text: Guys: Although this doesn't pack the vitamin/mineral punch that Total has, this is a tasty, low fat cereal at a good price. Although it IS a processed food (processed rice, added sugar etc.), I like that it's not just  strawberry "flavored" bits or heavy yogurty-covered raisins and such.......it's real freeze-dried strawberries (ok, they're not fresh, but that's not a problem for me...I LOVE dried fruit in my cereal).  It's also a convenient way to get real strawberry taste in my cereal and it stays fresh.  It's one of my go to cereals out there. The only negative is that it's a tiny bit too sweet for me (it looks like they spray a very light sugar coating on the flakes, not like frosted flakes, but still not needed for my taste).<br /><br />It may not beat the sale price of boxed cereal at Costco or a discount supermarket outside NYC, but compared to typical boxed cereal prices in NYC, $3.39 per 16.7 oz box is a very good price (most brand cereal in a non-discount supermarkets here cost about $5.99/box, and they are rarely above 14 oz per box).

review/summary: Great tasting but there's a reason for it!
review/text: This is a delicious cereal.  The flakes are crunchy and sweet (does not taste overly sugarly) and the freeze-dried strawberries are a perfect match to the flakes.<br /><br />PROS -<br />1. Tasty<br /><br />CONS -<br />1. As other reviewers have noted, there is a large percentage of sugar and high fructose corn syrup in this cereal.  The fact that is has high fructose corn syrup makes this a 4-star review for me.  I mean, c'mon Kellogg's!?  A product that is considered for dieting containing high fructose corn syrup!?  Oh, well....that's what makes it taste good...<br /><br />TIP ON COST<br />Some reviewers have expressed concerns about the cost of buying it on Amazon.  When buying groceries, one should really look at the unit cost or in this case, cost per ounce.  Many supermarkets will list the cost per ounce somewhere on the price tag that you can use for reference when doing cost comparisons.<br /><br />For this product, Amazon has TWO prices.<br />1. The first price is $20.81 (as of 1/8/10) which equates to $0.31/oz - typical retail price at most grocery stores.  (My local Von's price currently is $0.30/oz.)<br />2. The second price is $17.69 (as of 1/8/10) which equates to $0.27/oz - a more competitive price but not the best price.  You get this price if you do the Subscribe and Save which gives you a 15% discount if you sign up for delivery on regular intervals.  I use Subscribe and Save for many groceries through Amazon because I cannot get a better deal elsewhere.<br /><br />If you can find this cereal less than $0.27/oz elsewhere, definitely nab it!  Especially if you're a coupon fanatic!<br /><br />Overall, the price is not too bad on Amazon especially if you're someone who likes the convenience of having some of your groceries delivered.  If not, find those coupons and wait for the sales at your local grocery store and you'll make out much better!

review/summary: Good Bargain..!!
review/text: I love to eat breakfast and I'm a cereal lover from way back! My kids would rather have oatmeal or granola bars, but give me a good ol' bowl of cereal with milk and I'm good to go! I could eat cereal for every meal and not get tired of it, so I try a lot of different kinds. My latest love fest is with Kellogg's Special K Red Berries cereal.<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K promotes itself as being good for part of a weight loss program. The back of the box says that if you eat a serving of this cereal with skim milk, fruit and coffee that you'll have a meal that has less than 250 calories (although I don't know why you would want to add more fruit when you already have strawberries)! It's also fast free and cholesterol free. That's not why I bought it though. I bought it because it looked good on the box and I love strawberries.<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K Red Berries cereal is made with crunchy rice and wheat flakes and has dried strawberries in it. Yummy - I love strawberries! Never before have I had a cereal with freeze dried fruit in it where the fruit actually tastes real and fresh. When I first saw the shriveled strawberries in my bowl the first time I ate this cereal, I was not eager to put them in my mouth. But then I poured the milk in the bowl and the strawberries actually plumped up and almost looked like I had freshly sliced them! Then I took a big bite and wow, the strawberry taste was awesome! The cereal is just sweet enough to not be like a kid cereal but still enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. And there are a ton of strawberries in the box - enough to where I always get at least one strawberry with every bite of cereal.<br /><br />Now let's move on to the flakes. They are a good size but not so big that they are hard to eat. Some cereals make their flakes too big for my liking but this one is just right. Plus the flakes stay crunchy until the last bite is gone from the bowl, unlike some of the other flakes made by Kellogg's and other brands.<br /><br />So for now, Kellogg's Special K Red Berries is my top choice for cereal every morning ... until I burn myself out on it and then I'll switch to something else for a while!

review/summary: The berries are gross
review/text: I like Special K, so I figured I'd give Special K Red Berries a shot. Huge mistake. The consistency of the berries after they've been in milk for just a minute or so is disgusting. They get slimy and disintegrate. I won't try these again. I had hoped it would be similar to Newman's Own berries cereal, but I was wrong. The berries in Newman's Own held up just fine. Kellogg's has something to learn from Newman's Own.

review/summary: fairly goood ceral, somewhat high price compared to local stores
review/text: howdy y'all,<br /><br />the current price works out to $3.50 per box. that is a tad higher than local shops, but it is acceptable [when combined with free shipping] in exchange for the convenience.<br /><br />as for the cereal itself, i enjoy it. [*grin*] it aint _wonderful_ but it is enjoyable. i agree that the sugar content is a tad high. sometimes i add some freeze dried bananas to it and that helps a good deal.<br /><br />rated a THREE cuz it is as expected, nothing more and nothing less.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee

review/summary: Fantasic Food To Keep Goals
review/text: The packaging for the Special K cereal is fantastic. You get your boxes in a nice tightly sealed plastic bound set. They are in air packaging and in a box that isn't too big nor too small.<br /><br />The Special K is a great cereal to fill the hole and for a snack. With it's limited calories you don't feel like you're depriving yourself, rather than indulging in a really good cereal , a really good food. I sprinkle about a half teaspoon of sugar over it just to cut the tart of the strawberries. It fills you up and is better than a normal corn flake type cereal.

review/summary: good cereal at great price
review/text: If you're buying bulk cereal, I imagine you've already tried and like cereal. I like it, though I find the berries have a tendency to shift downward so you might want to shake it to redistribute them before you open the box the first time.<br /><br />My local groceries all charge $4-$5/box for this size cereal so the Amazon option is especially nice when you include the subscribe-and-save so you get it in a couple days, at a substantial discount, and save a trip to the store.<br /><br />Since you get 4 individual boxes, the unopened ones last long enough not to get stale so buying in bulk makes sense even for me as a single person.<br /><br />The nutrition is nothing special compared to other sweetened flake cereal so the other reviews talking about it being good for health seem to be reaching quite a bit. Exercise is good for health. This cereal won't hurt, but there are other cereals with more fiber, or you can eat fresh fruits for breakfast instead.

review/text: Like most of you I have been dieting off & on for years.<br />I finally found something that doesn't leave me hungry!<br />I lost 12 pounds in 2 weeks by using this cereal w/ Special K Protein Mix & Mega Tea Green Tea pills. I found this combo better than the "Hollywood Diet" which left me starving.<br />What I do: Cereal in the morning, tea pill with regular water, walk 1 mile (1/2 mile each way regular pace- not brisk) drink regular water, go to my boring desk job sipping Protein Mix water, sensible lunch with water or juice, tea pill with water, sipping Protein Mix water, eat whatever I want for dinner- even take out & dessert once a week. I don't count calories or eat bland foods :) 1 bowl of cereal, 2 Protein Mix packets, 2 Green Tea pills every day. Good luck all.

review/summary: Unacceptable ingredients
review/text: I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason:<br />Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels.  There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers.

review/summary: There are Better Breakfast Options Out There
review/text: I don't dislike Special K, and I don't dislike their Red Berries cereal. You will not however see me purchasing this item for my household again. As far a health-wise, it doesn't win big in my book. It is essentially just processed rice, sugar and wheat with freeze dried strawberries. Just a bunch of empty calories that don't provide much of any nutritional value. Almost all the vitamin and minerals are artificially added. Also they added fiber isolate to boost the fiber value, but realize that studies have started to show that these processed fiber adds don't act in the body like natural fiber. Really the healthiest part is probably the freeze dried strawberries, but in my opinion they taste terrible in comparison to fresh strawberries which would take a total of 1 minute to prep and add to your bowl. I do want to restate that the taste isn't bad, but there are much better tasting cereals out there. In all fairness my normal cereal the I will eat on occasion is Frosted Mini Wheats, but some people my find them to grainy or not sweet enough.

I think the change in vendor to some third party, Action Packeaged, has caused this change.  Something is obviously broken.

review/summary: Warning, Contains High Fructose Corn Syrup
review/text: This was my favorite cereal for years...until I read the label.  I guess I took for granted the ingredients because of the commercials and advertising of it as such a healthy cereal and even promoted it as a diet plan to lose weight.  I hope the manufacturers realize how many people discontinued purchasing this great product after educating themselves on the dangers of high fructose corn syrup.  They need to reconfigure their ingredients list to actually make something that won't be eventually blacklisted for being harmful to unsuspecting consumers.

review/summary: Essential for making Chocolate Whoopie Pies
review/text: I've been using Marshmallow Fluff for many years and especially like using it in icing recipes. Sure you can just eat it straight from the bottle by the tablespoon which I've been guilty of doing on occassion. I hear people put it on toast but what I really think it was made for was to make Whoopie Pies.<br /><br />Two baby-sitters taught me to make a similar recipe when I was 8 years old and I have never forgotten it. Black cocoa is used to darken the cake. King Arthur flour from the Baker's Catalogue is essential to the flavor and texture. The not-too-sweet cake develops more flavor and is balanced by the rich icing.<br /><br />CHOCOLATE WHOOPIE PIES<br /><br />Chocolate Cake<br /><br />  1/2 cup Hershey's or Van Leer Dutch-process cocoa<br />  1 tablespoon Dutch-process black cocoa<br />  1 cup fat-free milk, warmed to 130<br />  1 cup low-fat buttermilk<br />  1/2 cup corn oil<br />  2 large eggs<br />  1 cup golden brown sugar<br />  1 cup dark brown sugar<br />  1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br />  3 1/2 cups King Arthur all-purpose flour<br />  2 teaspoons baking soda<br />  1/2 teaspoon salt<br /><br />Vanilla Frosting<br /><br />  1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened<br />  3 cups confectioners' sugar<br />  3 tablespoons half-and-half<br />  1/2 teaspoon colorless double-strength vanilla<br />  1 cup Marshmallow Fluff<br /><br />1.  Preheat the oven to 350 .<br /><br />2.  Cake batter: In a large bowl, use a mixer on low speed to<br />  beat cocoa, black cocoa and milk. Beat in the buttermilk, oil,<br />  eggs, golden brown sugar, dark brown sugar and vanilla.<br />  Measure the flour, baking soda and salt into a sifter. Sift over<br />  the batter, then beat batter on low for 2 minutes.<br /><br />3.  Cover baking sheets with baking parchment. Use a 1/4 cup<br />  measuring cup and spatula to scoop up batter and drop it onto<br />  a baking sheet. If the batter won't stay in place add up to 1/2<br />  cup more flour to make a thick batter which holds its shape<br />  when dropped onto the baking parchment and only spreads to<br />  a 4-inch diameter round. I don't advise premeasuring onto the<br />  parchment. Just measure and bake for the best results.<br /><br />4.  Swirl batter with spatula to make a round pie. You will fill<br />  three baking sheets at about six rounds a sheet. In between<br />  scooping the batter, set the measuring cup in a 1/2 cup size<br />  measuring cup to keep things from getting messy.<br /><br />5.  Bake in a preheated oven for 10 minutes. Cakes are done<br />  when tops bounce back when pressed. Cool completely.<br /><br />6.  Frosting: In a deep medium bowl, beat butter and sugar on<br />  low speed. Beat in the half-and-half and vanilla, then<br />  Marshmallow Fluff. Continue beating frosting for<br />  one to two minutes or until fluffy.<br /><br />7.  Spread frosting on cakes, then sandwich together and pile on a<br />  large plate. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar in a sifter.<br /><br />  Hint: For a kid's birthday party, make miniature pies by<br />  using tablespoonfuls of batter. Pies may be made days ahead<br />  and frozen. Set them out on the counter to thaw and then frost<br />  before serving. To quick thaw, watch carefully in microwave.<br /><br />  Makes 9 or more whoopie pies<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, who loves to bake

review/summary: Fluff MMMMMM!
review/text: I first tried this on a trip to Mass in 1999. I can't get enought of it. I use to be able to find it in WA state but haven't for sometime now. Brought 3 jars back with me from my recent trip to VA and only have one left and have only been back a month. I love the fluffernutters they are so good. I really like them with chunky honey roasted peanut butter. My 4 year old still wants his with jelly. They are so good any way you can get them. I just wish I could find someone to sell Fluff by the case.

review/summary: Good product BAD PRICE
review/text: It is absolutely ridiculous that AMAZON charges $6 for this.  Any grocery store or Walmart has it for between $1 and $2 for a single box of this with 8 flavor packets inside. What's worse, is that the Latin Products is not a good vendor and has poor customer service. Enough people have had issues with getting partial orders or packaging that is not factory sealed. For example, you may get product that was from bulk that they have hand packaged with twist ties. There are several different listings for this product with the Latin Products as the vendor. Even the super saver shipping one says it in the product description. IMO, steer clear of them and get this at your local grocery or goya.com. Even with shipping it beats this price by a wide margin.<br /><br />The product itself is VERY GOOD!! I've been using different varieties of Sazon as long as I can remember. When I tasted this, I stopped using all the other kinds and just stuck with this. I love it for seasoning just about everything; it is so versatile. Popcorn, meats (fried, baked, grilled, etc.), vegetables, fish, potatoes, gravy...I really do use this a lot!! So delicious!!

review/summary: How do they keep doing it?
review/text: I love crystal light! I haven't had a flavor yet that I didn't enjoy. I started drinking crystal light this year when my dentist recommended that I cut out drink with lots of sugar. Which was hard because all I drink is lemonade, but when he told me to try this I had NO IDEA how amazing it would be.<br /><br />To me there is NO difference between this product and the many products that contain sugar. It's easy to make, its 5 calories, its sugar free, and it taste great. What more can you ask for?

review/summary: Surprisingly not disgusting
review/text: I usually hate diet drinks.  I have tried many, including several diet lemonade drinks.  The diet Minute Made is OK, but still isn't quite right.<br /><br />But after being satisfied with Crystal Light's Appletini, I finally gave in and tried the lemonade.  Not bad at all.  I guess that other diet lemonade drinks might overload themselves with the fake sugar.  This stuff has a medium-strength real lemon taste and just enough sweetener to balance out the lemon without giving it the classic nasty fake sugar aftertaste.

review/summary: A fresh tangy taste that you will enjoy!
review/text: I love lemonade but cannot have the sugar.  Crystal Light Lemonade has only 5 calories per serving and brings fresh tangy taste to your water.  This is an excellent low calorie drink with no caffeine that my family enjoys.<br /><br />Each canister contains 6 pouches that will make a total of 12 quarts of lemonade.  It is fast to make and is great over ice or chilled in your refrigerator.  Break the habit of soft drinks and cut down on the sugar and carbonated beverages.  This is less expensive and tastes great.<br /><br />My family recommends it!
