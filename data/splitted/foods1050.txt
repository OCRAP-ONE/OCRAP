review/summary: Granddaughters love them as much as I do
review/text: Just this summer I bought some Necco's and shared them with my Granddaughters while they were visiting.  They'd never had them before and instantly loved them.  Now I know I'll have to have some on hand when they come back to visit again.  These wafers have a taste all their own and hasn't changed since I was a child.  I still don't like the black (licorice) ones.  So, if you loved these as a child you'll still love them.  Please, share them with your grandchildren so they can enjoy them with you.

review/summary: Disappointed!
review/text: A couple of people commented that this candy is the same ORIGINAL product as the ones many of us remember from our childhood. It is NOT! I just received mine, and was expecting the same delightful taste from my childhood in the late 40's...I'm extremely disappointed! The colors are faded, and there is virtually no flavor at all! The packaging reads "original", which I find to be false advertising. This is NOT the original Necco wafers that I grew up with, or that I ate just a couple of years ago. Very sad indeed!

review/text: Delicious as always, these packs are missing the orange, green, and purple wafers described above.  I was really disappointed - it's in the photo, now that I look at it, but I didn't notice it when I ordered. I suppose that's why the price is so good compared to what you can get off the Necco website directly.<br /><br />Anyway, they're still delicious, arrived in pristine form, but just so you know what you're ordering! :)

review/summary: Not the best candy I've ever had...
review/text: I have loved the original Necco wafers for my entire (nearly 60) years. When I ordered these, I expected the original color, flavor assortment that I remember from years past...but I believe Necco must have changed somewhere along the way.<br />They are paler in color & the flavors are NOT what they used to be.<br />I don't know if this is the fault of the seller, necessarily, so I don't really blame them...but Necco should really decide to stick with one or the other assortment. I have also recently received the original-style wafer (another order, months ago) & they were just fine.<br />What's the deal here? Are they trying to change a classic??<br />As far as shipping, prices, etc., this company is excellent...so in that, at least, there was nothing wrong ~ just that I wish they were not billed as the original Necco wafer; something has changed them...and NOT for the better.

review/summary: Still Great! But be aware..
review/text: The first time I had the "Original" all natural Necco wafers, I was annoyed that they had lost some of the original color and had changed flavor a bit. (Change gives me a rash) So I read the label...carefully. The "All Natural" is just that. Natural colors and flavors. Not chemistry. I am not a confectionery historian, but perhaps these actually are the 1845 original? I have loved Neccos since my dad gave 'em to me as a small child. Those were the more colored ones of course. Nowadays, I frequently hear of different maladies connected to artificial food dyes, from allergies to ADHD, and more. This "All Natural" version of Neccos just might be the best thing ever for those suffering from such problems, and their parents. As for me, I am a person who vaguely remembers the lovely haze of the late '60's and early '70's, so "all natural" has a wonderful and wholesome ring to it. Regarding the debate of  "Bright colors and flavors" vs "All Natural"?  I love 'em both, and devour them with delight! Enjoy!

review/summary: Tastes Just Like the 1950's
review/text: I was paying $1.29 a roll for this candy and it's my "go-to" at night watching TV.  So I ordered a box, which makes it much cheaper by the roll.  My biggest concern was whether or not it would arrive in good condition, or if the wafers would be broken.  The box arrived in perfect condition.  There are destinctly more flavors in these rolls of candy than the ones I was purchasing at the store.  These have the pinks, greens, yellows, grays and whites and taste just like I remember them from many, many years ago.  This is a really good buy.

review/summary: Fresh, tasty, herbal/salt blend
review/text: Herbs de Provence can bring many dishes to life. Baked chicken and root veggies are a good place to start, for those who are not familiar with this herb mix. Then expand the horizons by searching all the wonderful online recipes. Winter is coming; it's time to enhance those savory stews and one-pot dishes --- to take the plain to the extraordinary.<br /><br />I personally like this French gray salt and herb combination because I don't like to overdo it with the herbs. I prefer a more subtle flavor. However, if you prefer more herbal punch, you may want to stick with purchasing the herbs alone, or make your own mix, which is quite easy to do. Otherwise, you will be fighting with the salt.<br /><br />If you need to watch your sodium intake, you need to know that this product is heavy on the salt --- and the crystals are very large, so it is easy to over salt your dish. You will be fine, if you make adjustments for salt required for your particular recipe. This is just something to consider, when ordering this combo product.<br /><br />I can attest to the freshness of this product.  Upon opening the glass jar, the fragrance was very potent and lovely. I also prefer having the herbs in a jar with a twist-on-lid.  This will help maintain freshness.<br /><br />All said, I highly recommend this product, with the reservations mentioned. These concerns are manageable. Just remember that this product is predominately salt, with herbs as the secondary enhancement, but the herbs won't go unnoticed.

review/text: This is a really good No Salt soup BUT because of the beans it will play havoc with your intestinal system. I don't usually get cramping/excessive gas from beans, but this soup gave me all of that so it only gets 4 stars. You can certainly take a gas reliever with this soup to tone down the side effects though, so give it a try. It's filling, nice consistency and really very good for having no salt. I do put in Mrs. Dash No Salt Spicy and some Morton's No Salt substitute to kick it up a notch.

review/summary: Terrible Pistachio nuts
review/text: These pistachio nuts are terrible. They made me so sick that I threw away most of them.<br />I suffered from violent stomach pains after eating them!<br />I thought that perhaps it was a bad bag so after three days of pain finally stopped, I was stupid enough to open a second of the bags thinking it was just the one bag that was bad. Wrong. After eating a dozen nuts the stomach pains returned, just as painful.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THESE NUTS if you don't want to suffer from pains. I didn't seek to return them and get my money back because it was a food product.<br /><br />I have bought pistachios many times from Amazon, but I always bought Keenan Farms In Shell pistachios in Plastic Jars but Amazon was out of stock on these so I thought I would try these in the bag pistachios.<br /><br />How can the same farm produce pistachios so different from each other? Were this whole crop contaminated? Even the feel of the nuts were different between the two. Those in the plastic jars were "softer" while those in the bags were hard and hurt my teeth and gums to chew.<br /><br />Strange, to say the least.

review/text: This flavor is true to its name. They have a good gingerbread taste that is neither too strong nor sweet. The outside has more of a graham-crack consistency than the usual crispy Pop-Tart, but it's actually a nice change. They have a creamy, subtly spicy, white center that compliments the outside. The "printed fun" images are precious and most definitely fun. Whereas the others, like "Sugar Cookies," have different animals and such doing various activities from penguins and igloos to cardinals and bears, these seem to have strictly a gingerbread-man theme with gingerbread men, women, children and families snow-sledding and enjoying other wintery games. Our only complaint was that the box top was unglued. Each pack within seemed fine. None were noticeably open or ripped, but hopefully nothing malicious had occurred before arriving in our home. Each packet seemed to have air in it, which indicated to us, we think and hope, that no holes had been poked into any of them. Other than that, we're very pleased. A bonus is that each packet has a gift tag printed on it in red, with a "To" and a "From," so you can gift them, maybe even as stocking stuffers. These are seasonal, but why wait to enjoy these flavors for only one season a year? Thankfully, Amazon pulls through yet again and makes these yummies available yearround.

The Oregon Gooseberries are the best and the label includes a recipe for the pie.  The Amazon.com price was much lower than the cost in the local supermarket for the same product.  The "use by" date on the can is sufficiently distant that we will have gooseberry pie twice a year for two years and use up the eight cans before they expire (each pie takes two cans of gooseberries).

review/text: When I lived in Washington state I grew my own gooseberries so gooseberry pies were a special treat. Since I've moved to Georgia I've only been able to grow the pink , sweet ones for some reason. Just not the same.  I've never seen them in a store here so I was really excited to see them on Amazon! Great quality.  I use two cans of the gooseberries, 1/2 cup sugar (I like them tart) and minute tapioca for thickener, and a dash of nutmeg. If you've never tasted gooseberry pie it reminds me somewhat of green apple pie except better, of course.

review/text: My order of a case of gooseberries arrived in a short time. I made one pie according to the directions on the inside of the label.  The pie tasted great, nicely sour, but it was somewhat on the runny side.  Next time I shall had some flour to thicken the pie. Also next time I will add some lemon juice to perk up the sourness. While the pie was good, I didn't get the spreading aches up the sides of my jaw.  Hence the gooseberries need a little extra punch from lemon juice.

review/text: I grew up in central Il with tons of gooseberry bushes. I had no idea they didn't just grow everywhere until my husband joined the navy. Canned gooseberries can be a nasty experience. I had pretty much given up on the idea of a good gooseberry pie, short of having to visit my childhood home and steel a bag, until I found the Oregon fruit can of gooseberries. I love their cherries and decided to give the gooseberries a try. They were so good, and my pies are now back to fabulous!

I just heard the news that Osama bin Laden has been located and killed by US Special Forces! Wow. I won't miss him. Congratulations to President Barack Hussein Obama and all those who participated in this successful action!} ... fresh gooseberries. But last winter my wife made a very tasty pie with this very brand of gooseberries in light syrup, essentially following the recipe for a sour cherry pie.<br /><br />Now here's an even better idea: in your favorite recipe combining rhubarb and strawberries -- pie, crisp, tart, or jam -- use gooseberries instead of strawberries! The rhubarb must be fresh! Frozen rhubarb is an abomination. But I think these canned gooseberries will be adequate. If I'm wrong, I'm sure your local homeless shelter will be grateful for even the most mediocre pie or crisp.<br /><br />Add some freshly ground cardamon for an even better taste treat.

review/summary: avoid, unless you like peppery gooseberries
review/text: I bought these last summer. They've sat in my pantry since then - waiting for me to have time to make a pie. About a week ago I finally did. I opened up the can and tasted a couple. My immediate reaction was "gross! Somebody mixed in red pepper with the gooseberries!" I mean the gooseberry flavor was there - but so was the pepper flavor. I buy fresh gooseberries periodically so I know exactly what they should taste like - and this was just completely off. I should have stopped there - but I didn't. I made a pie using the recipe on the label. It turned out completely watery, and the pepper flavor was still there.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer about it. They asked me for the date code on the can. They looked in to it and opened up some cans from about the same time and tested those. They called me back today to essentially say "hah! They taste fine. You're clearly crazy." They then told me if I still had an issue with it I should bring it up with Amazon. Unbelievable.<br /><br />As a proud Oregonian, I am embarrassed to have this shady company using my state's name in their business name. Avoid this company and this product.<br /><br />Now I am again in search of a decent source for canned gooseberries. Canned gooseberries that don't taste like they've had pepper added.

review/text: I pack this for my kids' lunch about once a week. We vary the "boxed pasta" lineup between this and other traditional cheddar mac-and-cheese styles. The alfredo sauce is a nice change, and it pairs well with the addition of broccoli or other vegetables to make it a little healthier. The larger, penne pasta shape is also nice and makes it feel more homemade than elbow pasta or cartoon-character-shaped pasta. I can't find this Annie's style in most of the stores around me, so it's nice to buy in bulk.

review/summary: Not As Good As The Box Leads You To Think
review/text: I ordered this to try to get away from additives in food.  That I was able to accomplish with this, however, this was not nearly as good as the box leads you to think.  If you want a chalky, salty taste, then this is your pasta.  The pasta alone was not so bad, I think it was the cheese sauce.  For one, it is very hard to get all of the clumps to disolve.  Second, DO NOT ADD SALT otherwise you will have a very salty meal.  I made this tonight because I love pasta, especially Alfredo.  It took longer than most foods to cook.  The first bite was horrible.  The second and third was not so bad, but by about the fifth bite, your body is going to shut it off completely.  It leaves a nasty after taste.  I only ate about six bites and have not felt well since.  My stomach feels like the pasta is swelling inside.  Like I said, I love Alfredo, but this is NOT the usual Alfredo I have.  This is a poor imitation.  Maybe if you didn't have to buy in bulk of 6, and could only purchase 2 boxes at a time, it would not be so terrible, but unfortunately, now I have to look at 4 more boxes of it sitting in my pantry that I know I will never eat again.  Good luck to whoever is brave enough to try this stuff.

It tastes okay, not bad in fact, but just wasn't anything to get excited about. I didn't think as the ad here says that it "Closely approximates the taste of real Mocha Java." Just tasted like regular coffee to me. The beans seemed fresh and there is that pleasant coffee aroma when I first opened the bag and when I grind up the beans. But it isn't that kind of beckoning aroma that I love.<br /><br />I tried this Coffee Bean Direct brand out because it was seemed like a really good deal at the time, comparatively speaking with similiar brands.<br /><br />Here is a few I would highly recommend for coffee lovers:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9SN4A">Organic Camano Island Coffee Roasters Sumatra, Medium Roast, Ground, 80-Ounce Bag</a> - also available in whole bean<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012BYIS6">Newman's Own Coffee Cafe Almond Biscotti Ground, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL7GK">Audubon Premium Shade Grown Coffee, Shade Song French Roast, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />So Coffee Bean Direct is okay for it's price range, I'll use it for now - just nothin' to write home about....Laurie

I filled a clamp-lid cannister with beans, and placed the rest in zipper-type freezer bags and thawed them out as needed. This seemed to hold the flavor and freshness in acceptable fashion, as I am not going to use five pounds of coffee beans in an overly-prompt way. I use enough where this quantity lasts me about 6 weeks.

So, it's authentic as far as it goes but...I've been to Thailand 4 times & I think this product is pretty good, but I'm not a purist.  So, I often add some salmon, mushrooms, mixed veggies, or whatever else I happen to have handy.  The sauce is pretty strong so you can add a fair amount of things without demeaning the overall flavor of the dish.  It doesn't take long to make either.  I try to save washing so I use a big pot & a collander, not a frying pan or wok.  This dish is tasty but NOT spicy hot--like many other Thai foods--unless you add your own peppers.  Thai Kitchen makes other flavors too.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Himalayan Dark Pink Salt will keep you in the pink.
review/text: If you're looking for great value and great taste then this product is for you. I was skeptical about artisan salts and sea salts being different than regular salt until I accidentally ordered a case of sea salt from Portugal from our Co-op. Artisan salts and sea salts add flavor and zing to sea food, grilled foods and vegetables. I've never looked back and only use these special kinds of salts on everything. Be advised, though, if you put pink salt on something, it will turn that something slightly pink.<br /><br />Try this salt and then try salt from Hawaii, Portugal, France, prussian blue from Germany, salt from Japan, Mexico, etc ... You will be surprised at the diversity in taste.

review/summary: Culinary secret
review/text: Someone recently gave me a small grinder containing pink Himalayan rock salt crystals.  The difference in the taste it added to food prompted me to do some reading on the differences.  You can do your own reading and I'll just say that it opens up a whole new world of flavors.  When that small grinder neared being empty I set about to find some refill material.  The price of the product from this supplier made me suspicious of it's quality.  Happily though........it's as good as any I've found.  The packaging and shipping were both professional and I am quite pleased with the order and intend to be a repeat customer.

review/text: Very rich pink color to the salt.  Don't buy over priced salt at the gourmet food stores, the color is faint and they mix in sea salt to save money.  Amazing taste and perfect size for a grinder.  You cannot beat the price, trust me, I've looked.

review/text: I really love this salt.  Not a strong taste and it doesn't overwhelm foods.  Just adds a nice, clean flavor.  Also a beautiful color.  Always a conversation starter when I put it on the table.<br /><br />Be advised that the pieces are rather large and the salt itself is "dense" rather than "crumbly" so you will need to have a good quality mill.  Our Oxo mill handles it fine, but I did try a lever-operated mill--no luck.<br /><br />Finally, the 2.2 pound bag (a kilo) costs the same as the two pound bag.  Why would anyone not buy the kilo package?

review/summary: The real deal!
review/text: This is a very good medium-dark roast coffee. I am from New Orleans and I think Community Coffee is world class quality at a decent price. I have tried pretty much most of the high dollar coffees out there (Gevalia, Starbucks etc.) and Community ranks with the best. My personnal favorite is the Evangeline Blend they produce -- but it is more expensive and money is tight right now so Cafe Special is just fine -- better than anything else for anywhere near the price.

review/summary: A great cup of coffee...
review/text: We have tried them all - all of Starbucks and all the others on the market - and while some of them are very good (think Casi Cielo at Starbucks), for all-round availability and good price, the Community Cafe Special is just delicious. It is not advised for those who must have very strong, very robust coffee - it is just a delightful, delicious cup - I don't even have to use any sweetener. I make it in my BUNN drip coffeemaker and I buy it anywhere, including at Amazon. If you've been to a really deluxe hotel with a fine restaurant, this is the coffee you'd get; it doesn't knock you out in strength, but it is a very, very good cup of coffee, whether for your wake-up call or with dessert. This review references the regular, not decaf (if there is a decaf I haven't found it).

review/summary: Cafe Special... AWESOME COFFEE
review/text: I am a huge fan of Community Coffee.  The company often runs specials, they are very responsive to their customers and their product is good.<br /><br />I've tried most of their flavors now and this one is a very good one.  I buy this any time i find it on sale.<br /><br />I've written the company asking for samplers and they sent all kinds.  It was great.  I also love their decaf and 1/2 caf products too.<br /><br />They will email you when there are large storms (like the hurricanes) to let you know there may be a delay in shipping.  Makes sense.<br /><br />I believe all the beans are roasted here in the US.<br /><br />Huge fan of Community Coffee.<br /><br />But, I also realize that not everyone will agree.  What i like, you may not and vice verse.<br /><br />My recommendation... buy 1 bag (it's now sold in local stores where i live) and if you like it, then come back to Amazon for more as the prices here are often the best, unless the company is running a special.

It is almost like all the humidity down in NOLA was infused into the beans.<br /><br />Price per bage- Great<br />Grind Size- Similar to Folger's<br />Taste- Strong nutty flavor with little complexity<br /><br />Overall, the coffee is equivalent to what I would purchase at a truck stop or a diner.

review/text: I usually buy my coffee in the store, but as the prices kept soaring, I thought I'd check for good deals here on Amazon.  I found this coffee, which in addition to being cheap as a subscribe and save, there was also a $3 off coupon available.  All together this made the coffee $3.77 per bag, such a bargain!<br /><br />The cafe special tastes really good.  I brew my coffee ahead of time, then put it in a pitcher in the fridge so I can enjoy iced coffee in the morning.  Other coffees leave a sediment at the bottom of the pitcher, but the Community left no such residue.  I also tried the coffee hot, and it's tasty that way as well.  I will definitely be continuing my subscription!

review/summary: More like Dunkin roast than Starbucks
review/text: I prefer a full body roast of coffee similar to Starbucks HOUSE BLEND or Dark Varietals - NOT PIke Place which I despise. I find Dunkin Donuts way to lightly roased for me. When I was in NOLa, I had coffee at Community and it was a darker roast and full bodied. So I ordered this blend because it said "Medium to dark". When Opened the first bag there was no burst of coffee flavor. I've been making it and drinking it but it tastes like the satandard Dunkin' Donuts we use when it goes on sale for $4.99/bag.<br /><br />So it's not bad, but not special either and unless I catch a darker roast on sale, I'll probably not order it again. The exp date on pkgs is June 2011 and I received it within 3 days of when it was shipped.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"

Of course, the whole "melt in your mouth, not in your hand" thing, a lie.  But a catchy lie.<br /><br />I like the candies but stopped buying them when my son was a year old because he almost choked on one.  Now that he's 19... well, it's time to return to my favorites!  Ok, I could've returned earlier, I'm pretty sure he knows to chew his food now.  M&Ms are a good old standard for the candy bowl!  Hardly worth buying online, unfortunately, considering the shipping charges, but if you can find free shipping or get a deal on that, go for it.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/text: Have to agree with other poster.<br /><br />Although I have enjoyed ginger beers for most of my life, this is the worst one I've encountered.  It has a nice initial "bite", followed by an extremely medicine-y aftertaste leading to an unpleasant finish.<br /><br />I tried more than one to give it a fair trial: with food, by itself, etc.  On the final try, I had just come in from working outdoors on a very hot day, took a big swig and was surprised to discover LARGE PARTICLES in the beverage that seemed to be a cross between tapioca pearls and orange pulp.  (The first three bottles I tried didn't have them.)<br /><br />Needless to say, the rest of the beer went down the sink.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious ... but watch out for the maltitol.
review/text: Although the texture and flavor of this product are fantastic, Smucker's Sugar Free Hot Fudge Topping is loaded with maltitol, an ingredient that turns your intestines into a nuclear holocaust. Seriously, my husband has forbidden me from ever eating this again and I had to throw out the last three jars in the pantry. I wish manufacturers of sugar free products would find another sweetener to use. This stuff's deadly.

review/summary: Excellent and affordable cat dry food
review/text: I have two cats and have fed them Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul about one and half years ago while they were still kittens. I adopt them from local shelter. Last year I switch to Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul since I believe they were adult cat now.<br /><br />I'm picky about what my cats eat. During researching good dry foods for my two cats,EVO was my first pick for my cats, since it's grain free, high protein and low-carb cat food. Unfortunately, both my two kittens did not like EVO dry/wet food at all. I don't remember how many brands I had tried. Then on a local pet supply store, I saw the Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul. The name got me interested, but I have trouble to get the nutrient analysis from the package or the internet. So, I wrote an email through their web site. I got their answer back within few days with a detail nutrient and ingredients analysis excel file. I decide to give it a try, and I'm so happy I try it, since my two cats love it too. They love the taste, it's not by-produce meat,and the ash & magnesium levels are low.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: This stuff is great.  I tried it after doing a bunch of 'net research, looking to improve my cat's nutrition--he's getting older, and his energy was a little low, and his coat getting a little rough.<br /><br />I switched him from the Iams he's been on all his life.  I mixed the two brands together to switch him over gradually, but noticed within a couple of days that he was picking out the Chicken Soup cat food and leaving the Iams behind.<br /><br />His coat is softer and shinier, he's more chipper, and possibly best of all, he's barfing on my carpet much, much less.  Couldn't be happier.

review/summary: Deceptive!
review/text: Amazon lists salmon as the second ingredient. It is not! Would have passed if I had known that! My cat likes it so-so...
