review/summary: Mainstay for anyone with breathing or allergy issues...
review/text: This product is Awesome and Helpful for anyone with asthma and or breathing difficulties. I have dealt with for years and keep coming back to this item; because it seems to work so good with honey -and sometimes a drop or two of fresh lemon.  I add chamomile tea bag with one of these at bed time; and it really works very good for my lungs seem to be eased.  I do notice though that if the product is close to expiring it does not seem to be as effective-and would advise not buying anything near expired when it comes to all-nature products that probably don't have all that many additives or preservatives to begin with.

review/summary: herbal remedy for bronchial distress
review/text: If you are having difficulty breathing due to a viral infection or chronic asthma, this tea is for you.  I keep it on hand all the time in case someone in our family develops a cough.<br /><br />In addition to various Western herbs that support clear breathing, such as Eucalyptus and Pleurisy Root, the tea has the traditional Chinese herbal mixture Bi Yan Pan in it.  This is the magic ingredient that helps clear mucous out of the lungs.<br /><br />I am grateful that Amazon carries the entire Traditional Medicinals line because sometimes it is hard to find Breathe Easy tea in stores.  There are a variety of competitors on the market with other teas that claim to provide relief for breathing difficulties, but Breathe Easy outclasses all others I have tried.  Plus, it has a pleasant flavor from Licorice and Peppermint, especially compared to other herbal teas that have perceptible medical effects.  I highly recommend Breathe Easy tea.

review/text: My husband has asthma. He uses peventative inhalers along with inhalers when an attack occurs. When the attack is severe he will go into the bathroom and turn the shower on hot, to inhale the steam.  Even doing all of this, the attack will continue until I prepare him the Breathe Easy Herbal Tea.  Within minutes after drinking the tea the asthma settles down. I ALWAYS carry a tea bag with me.  I never leave the house to go anywhere without the tea.  IT IS A LIFE SAVER!!!!!<br />Even if you do not have asthma the tea will also help you breathe better with respiratory infections.  Just recently I had the flu for several weeks with much coughing the tea was AWESOME.  A MUST HAVE FOR ANY BREATHING AILMENT.............

review/text: Traditional Medicinals is the best tasting herbal tea out there that I have tried. I have tried the Yogi teas before and did not care for them. I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent. My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy. Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing. I don't know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good, or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better, a sense of calm. I highly recommend the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: Honestly, I'm sure the tea works, don't really know. I have bronchiectasis and chronic asthma, yes... oh joy! So, I bought this, not really having much faith it'll work. But I guess it works, don't really know if it's this tea or my normal routine / slew of $550 a month of medications I take that's helping. But one thing I do know is that, I absolutely dislike the flavor, smell and aftertaste of this tea. It leaves a very odd aspertame (fake, cancerous sugar that used to be used as pesticide) on your tongue when you drink it. It's truly disgusting to me. Lots of good reviews on this tea and for the life of me, I can't figure out why as this tea tastes so nasty to me. To each his own! I guess if it works, it's all worth it.

review/summary: Great tasting and excellent for relieving cough/chest congestion
review/text: We have been using this tea for years for chest congestion and nagging coughs.  The ingredients are gentle and very pleasant tasting and work great to temporarily relieve a cough.<br /><br />As licorice root and fennel are two of its main ingredients, it definitely has a very slight (but not at all overpowering) licorice flavor.  You can also taste slight blends of eucalyptus, peppermint and ginger (which help to settle your stomach as well as relieve other cold symptoms you might be experiencing).<br /><br />Obviously, if any symptoms are very long term, nothing replaces a doctor's care, but this can definitely help with some short term, common cold or flu cough symptoms.<br /><br />Also great for a vocal boost for singers/actors before a performance!

review/summary: Quick, easy, yummy!
review/text: This soup is fantastic! I typically have long days, going from school to work, and I usually can't bring a meal that requires a refrigerator. I find this meal to be a great solution. The cheese tortellini is very enjoyable (though not particularly cheesey in flavor) and the tomato soup part is spectcularly tasty and exactly what you would hope a tomato soup would be! Yes, (shocker!!!) it is soupy... because it is soup! If you're looking for more of a pasta type meal, they also have a great tomato basil penne which still meets my long hours, no frige criteria. But as far as soup goes, you can't do much better. I like to pair it with half a piece of pita, which I break up into small pieces I throw in as I eat it. The two combined make a superb lunch at only 255 calories (180 from the entire cup of soup)!! Be warned if you're watching your sodium; the whole cup is 32% of your daily intake, but as far as soups usually go it isn't that bad! Enjoy!

review/summary: Good sauce, hard to make anything but floppy pasta in a soup like this
review/text: The sauce is really this product's strong suit.  The "tortellini" were just way too soggy and not particularly cheesy.  To be fair, what can you expect out of pasta in one of these ready to eat type meals??  Those poor tortellini have to sit in wet soup until you decide to stick it in the microwave.<br /><br />This would almost make for a better tomato/vegetable soup if not for the tortellini.<br /><br />Still, I'll' give it four stars for that tasty sauce.

review/summary: Don't Believe the Anti-Hype
review/text: I was a bit dismayed to see how low this soup was rated on Amazon after I'd just enjoyed a bowl of it.  Let's go over some of the one-star reviews to address the complaints:<br /><br />1) Some people didn't realize this was soup, or thought somehow it would not be very soup-y.  I suppose if you saw this product in a vacuum you might get confused but on a shelf or web page next to other similarly packaged products it should be very clear this IS in fact SOUP.  It is a light tomato broth with about 6 tortellini in it.<br /><br />2) Some people said the tortellini were rubbery, while others said they are slippery.  Again, I suspect the problem is people who are used to having tortellini in a sauce and not in a soup.  My wife and mother-in-law make a similar soup, homemade from scratch some weekends, and I can assure you there is absolutely nothing strange about how the tortellini in this soup feel or taste.<br /><br />3) Some people complained the tomato broth was "salty" while others said it was "tasteless".  Obviously it can't be both of those things.  Sometimes I get the sense that people just like to complain when something doesn't exactly match their unreasonable expectations.<br /><br />Overall I found this soup, as a lunch, just barely manages to fill me up, which is amazing since it's something like 90 calories.  It also has surprising flavor considering less than 20% of the USDA recommended sodium intake.  For $2/meal that you can bring to work, leave in your desk, doesn't neet to be refrigerated, can be heated in and eaten out of the can, isn't heavily salted, isn't full of empty calories, and yet tastes good and leaves you feeling reasonably full, I don't think you can find a better option.

review/text: The image provided for this item looks really good, doesn't it?<br />Well, forget about it because if you order you will receive something completely different.<br /><br />What you get is a microwavable "bowl" of salty tomato soup with 6 tortellini in it.<br /><br />The product title says nothing about soup, and certainly the image is not soup, but that's what arrives, so be warned.  Funny thing: if you go to Healthy Choice website and enter "Healthy Choice All Natural Cheese Tortellini," you get the same image offered here.<br />Makes me wonder if there really is such a product (and it might be very good). Maybe you only get this awful substitute when you order from Amazon<br /><br />UPDATE.  Amazon corrected the image but the incorrect item title remains.  There is, in fact, a product by Healthy Choice called "Healthy Choice All Natural Cheese Tortellini" and it is a 14oz meal of tortellini and vegetables.  The image matched to this title, and the item you will receive if you order, is tortellini soup and a really poor one because it is just weak tomato soup with only SIX, yes only 6 tortellini.<br /><br />This is a great example of Amazon's increasingly ineffectual management of their site.

review/text: I bought this thinking it would be yummy cheesy goodness on a cold winter's day.  It was not.  It was more soupy than I thought it would be, thinking it would be more pasta like- and the tortellini was absolutely disgusting.  The shells were rubbery with a weird taste (consistency SQUID) and I didn't ever taste any cheese.  If that was supposed to be cheese in there, someone has some explaining to do.  Obviously, I was pretty disappointed.  More so for the rest of the day as well, because I couldn't get the taste of the rubber noodles and fake cheese out of my mouth.  All day I kept thinking about it and it just kept making me feel sick.  I will NEVER buy this product again.

review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These taste SO much better than the mainstream brand. Now that we've been eating these, we've lost any taste for the popular brands. The Lite version, however, is not so nice. AND, they're gluten free so I can feed them to my son with celiac without worry. I'm glad Amazon will be carrying these in bulk because we eat them by the bag!

review/summary: GMO Free --- not like Barbara's and other so called natural brands!
review/text: Well, cheese puffs are not my idea of a health food, but they are delicious, and my family sometimes snacks on these.  The best thing to do if you have a family member addicted to them is to make sure that at least you are not getting GMO's and pesticides. We used to get the Little Bear brand in New York and they tasted fine.  Here in VA I only found the Barbara's Bakery brand at my local natural foods co-op.  They taste fine too but imagine my horror when I found out that Barbara's does not use organic, GMO-free, corn!  The Cornucopia Institute did an expose on "natural cereals" and found GMO's and pesticide residues in many "natural brands."  They also found that often times the better quality USDA certified organic brands were actually cheaper.  See their "Cereal Crimes report".  The same with snacks, stick to Little Bear or another organic brand for your cheese puffs!

review/summary: Excellent healthy alternative snack!
review/text: Most kids love cheese puffs (OK, even I love them!), but the store brands are full of partially hydrogenated oil, monosodium glutamate, and other health horrors! We decided to try these when they were on sale and I'm so glad that we did! With super-saver shipping, it was not only convenient but cheaper than buying the bad stuff in the grocery store! We blew threw a case in no time and had to reorder. The texture is light and crispy, has a good natural cheese flavor, and our fingers were not full of orange gunk after eating them! Keep these on hand for your kids to munch on after school, they will never miss the old junk, and you will feel good knowing that you are serving a healthier snack food.

review/text: You can't make gluten-free cupcakes, doughnuts or beignets without this:  you need it for "loft".  However, with shipping, this price is ridiculous.  This brand is truly gluten-free, and normally, it's much cheaper.<br /><br />It's $5.00 at my local health food store.  (And they're expensive!!)

review/summary: Best Tea you can find
review/text: We (my wife and I) have been to (stayed at) Glenburn Tea Estate and it was there that we discovered the magic of darjeeling tea. The tea featured here is exactly the same as what you can buy at the tea estate. It has a mild flavor (compared to first/second flush) and is not highly colored. It has an amazing taste. The right way for the novice is to boil the water and then once the water is boiled, then add the tea leaves. (Once tea leaves are added, the water should not boil) If amazon has six stars that is what I will give for both the seller and the product.<br /><br /> We have also tasted the first and the second flush which have increase after taste and darker/stronger.<br /><br />A side note for people planning on ecotourism. you should visit the Glenburn Tea Estate ([...]). It was one of the most really romantic places to visit.

review/text: Do you love the taste of licorice? If so, this tea is for you. I used to be able to buy it from retail grocery stores but they no longer carry it. It turns out that buying this online is about half the price of retail, so I win both ways (price & availability). I do not add sugar, milk or anything else to this tea. It is wonderful all by itself. However, just one bit of advice: Do NOT remove the bag after brewing. The tea is so mild, that I leave it in the cup the whole time I am drinking the tea.

review/text: I only tried this tea because it was provided free at my hotel in Oregon. That was a few years ago and I have been drinking this tasty tea ever since. You can add sugar if you want and it's good, but what I really love about this tea is that it is delicious with nothing added. Nothing's needed. Tea bag, hot water, steep, done, drink. Great for travel. Just stash some tea bags in your purse or pocket and if you have access to hot water you can have tea in an instant. I make this tea at work, too. Actually, I drink it all day long and never tire of the fresh berry taste.

review/text: You used to be able to find Stash Licorice at major grocery stores, and I'm baffled as to why it has disappeared from shelves and can only be found online. It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else. Great as an after-dinner/before-bed drink.

review/summary: Licorice lovers and health nuts, this is for you!
review/text: If you love black licorice and and would like something that also has great health benefits, you'll love this tea.  I brew this tea and drink hot, but even when it gets cold, its still great.  I often just add more cold water to it and get a very mild licorice taste that is better than just strait water.  I will do this several times until I just want more of the licorice taste, and brew some more tea.  As to the health benefits, there are many.  Here are just a few: "useful for many ailments including asthma, body odor, bursitis, canker sores, chronic fatigue, depression, colds and flu, coughs, gingivitis and tooth decay, gout, heartburn, HIV, viral infections, fungal infections, ulcers, liver problems, Lyme disease, menopause, psoriasis, shingles, sore throat, tendinitis, tuberculosis, ulcers, yeast infections, prostate enlargement and arthritis."  See [...] and click on the link licorice.  That is where this health info came from, but there is much much more info there on that web site too.  It's said to be very good for flu and colds, which I'm fighting now, and it's so very SOOTHING to my throat!  You'll love this tea.

review/summary: A loyal drinker (!) for years
review/text: Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).  The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.  It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime.  Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either.  I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.

review/text: I love the taste of this tea. It tastes exactly like licorice root and it's very refreshing. I like to make iced tea with it. However, I just read a review someone made on another licorice tea product on amazon, telling their story of licorice toxicity. I'm a fairly paranoid person, so I'm now only going to enjoy this tea about twice a week, instead of everyday like I was doing. I canceled my subscribe & save order because I don't think I can safely use up 6 boxes within the time I selected. I might be overreacting, I probably am, but better safe than sorry.

review/text: I will be honest and say that when a friend suggested I try this tea as I began getting sick last winter, I told her no way because I do not like licorice flavor.  She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?

review/text: This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it. My local grocery is out, so here I am on Amazon, buying more.<br /><br />Note that the primary source of "lemon" appears to be lemongrass. (Ingredients, via the product packaging: "Ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, and citric acid. Contains: Soy." I don't understand "Contains: Soy", but it's not listed on the ingredients... I wonder if this is an allergy alert thing.)<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, the organic version has caffeine and doesn't have any actual lemon in it... I haven't tried that one yet, though. I'm a fan of both green tea and organic products, but I don't want caffeine when I'm sick, so I'll stick with this.

review/summary: Best flavor for Licorice lovers
review/text: I tried Licorice spice at a B and B in Maine and absolutely loved it.  I can't always find it at a kitchen or grocery store so Amazon came to my rescue.  I now purchase a case at a time.  The clove and licorice flavors are wonderful and very soothing.  Very nice to have at Christmas time!

review/summary: Really Great Tea
review/text: A friend introduced me to Licorice Tea many years ago by asking for a cup at a restuarant. When the server stated that the restuarant did not have Licorice tea, she took a packette out of her handbag and asked for a cup of hot water. She had an extra packette for me to try. WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf. I placed my order for the Pack of 6 to save on shipping and should now have sufficient tea bags for several months. Individually, foil wrapped tea bags keeps the flavor fresh.

review/summary: super yummy sweet taste!
review/text: If you aren't familiar with the taste, I can only suggest you try it before you end up with 6 boxes of the stuff.  But if you are a committed lover of this tea, then Amazon's Subscribe and Save is REALLY a great deal!  Definitely not for people who do not like the taste of black licorice.  I personally steep the tea for longer than advised on the package but I like my teas strong (package says 3-5 minutes, I go for 10).  I have turned some of my licorice loving friends onto it - 1 is a diabetic and she LOVES it since it gives a really sweet flavor with NO sugar or carbohydrates.  It is wonderful on a cold evening and won't keep you awake as there is NO caffeine.

review/text: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this tea! I don't even like licorice, my friend encouraged me to taste it, as she was so pleased with it. I did not realize (as the packaging box states) that herbal teas contain no true tea leaves, but are created from an international collection of herbs and spices such as licorice, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise and sarsaparilla. It is a perfect after dinner tea. I live in Michigan and those wintery nights are good for a cup of this caffeine free tea.

review/summary: I like this tea!
review/text: Well, what's to be said other than I really like this Licorice Spice Tea?<br /><br />I cut out sugar and reduced my caffeine intake over the last year or so and this licorice tea is my favorite replacement for a caffeinated hot drink. Because I have a sweet tooth I usually now drink tea and coffee with soy milk to reduce the bitterness. This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor). I have at least one or two cups a day, and even if I was to return to my previous high regime of caffeination I would still include a cup or two of this tea during the day.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of chamomile and this Licorice spice tea does not seem to list that as an ingredient.<br /><br />It seems many people don't like the flavor of licorice, but those that do really like this tea.<br /><br />I've found that the flavor of each batch seems to vary in intensity and the last batch I bought had a less strong taste which simply means it needs to be steeped a little longer.<br /><br />Scratching around for other things to say, my only concern about Stash teas is what appears to be plastic coated aluminum sashes that the teabags are sealed in. That does a great job in terms of sealing in flavor, but I'd rather it wasn't either plastic or aluminum coated. Maybe there's no good alternative.<br /><br />The only other thing is that the latest boxes have changed the design of the semi-circular hole at the bottom of the box and the new design makes it near impossible to easily remove a sachet. You'll be attacking it with the scissors or opening the box lid to get them out.<br /><br />But what really matters is the flavor and this is simply the best!

review/summary: Hands down my favorite tea!
review/text: I've been "addicted" to this tea for years and glad that it has become more widely available.<br /><br />A few weeks ago my cousin and I were discussing our love of tea.  I put forth Licorice Spice as my favorite and she said her all time favorite was, surprisingly enough, a tea made by Aveda - the haircare company - called Comforting Tea.  She lamented that she found it hard to find and described the taste to me.  I immediately told her that she had to try Licorice Spice then.  A few days after my recommendation she emailed me that she had tried the Stash tea and it was EVEN BETTER than the Aveda one!  I so do love making converts!<br /><br />As an added bonus, I've discovered after many nights of letting the tea steep, forgetting about the cup I've made, but not wanting to waste the tea bag - it tastes really good cold too!

When I got it home, I realized it was Stash, and thought, oh, no, here comes the weak tea!<br /><br />Indeed, as with other of their teas, it is weak.  I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea, and it was still pretty weak in flavor.  When I've made hot tea with it, I need two tea bags.<br /><br />The flavor is ok--I love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberry--but it's really just too weak overall.  Will not purchase again.

review/text: Maybe I didn't read the ingredient list thoroughly, because I was not expecting to find SOY in my tea!! What a disappointment! I called Stash to find out if the soy was GMO, and...the woman in customer service guarenteed me the suppliers sell them non-GMO soy. If this is the case, they really should label it as such. I like the flavor though, it's very soothing and gentle on the tummy (hence the three stars). The only way I will order again is if they start labeling the soy as non-GMO, i can't trust the product without a label!<br /><br />PS: after reading ingredient list again, I found NO mention of soy...

review/summary: Try this for Sore Throat or to Wind Down!!!
review/text: First of all, I am a tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea all my 60 years of life and I LOVE tea.  Stash is a wonderful tea and they have a tremendous line of delicious flavors out there right now. Stash chamomile is caffeine free.<br /><br />Now, let me share one of Kathy W's secrets with you. (S-h-h-h-h-h...) Chamomile tea is EXCELLENT for sore throats, scratchy throats, any throat irritation.  I first learned about Chamomile tea from my Greek neighbors. YaYa and PaPu always gave the grandchildren Chamomile tea whenever they got sick.  It not only is very soothing but it somehow soothes throat irritations.  Over the years, I have found that if I get a sore throat, I drink 2 cups of chamomile tea, one behind the other, and my throat STOPS hurting.  If it starts again the next day, I repeat the procedure, and it stops again.<br /><br />I rarely get sick now-a-days, and if I get a bug, it passes through and out real quick, but I have turned many a friend and co-worker on to my little secret.  It works!  Chamomile brews/steeps as a yellow tea and it has a different taste than black tea.  So, if the taste is strange to you initially, you will probably get used to it quickly.  I assure you, it beats the heck out of having a sore throat.  For a sore throat, you can also add honey if you want.  Honey makes it even more smooth and soothing.<br /><br />Some people also like a cup of chamomile tea before bedtime because it is soothing and helps them wind down.<br /><br />So, when you use this for a sore throat, and you realize it helped you or your children, do me a favor.  Look up to heaven and say Thank You to YaYa and PaPu Harjandrou for sharing this special secret with all of us.<br /><br />God Bless you all.<br /><br />(Note: I am not a doctor.)
