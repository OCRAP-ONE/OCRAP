review/summary: Put it in a smoothie
review/text: Yesterday, I was given a sample packet of this hemp protein powder at one of the local health food stores in town.<br />After just now reading all the reviews, I decided to go ahead and make a smoothie in my Vitamix blender with banana,<br />apple, germinated almonds (plumped not sprouted), half a bunch of parsley, half and half mix of coconut milk and<br />water (I don't like ice in my smoothies), and of course the contents of the packet.<br />Well, it tastes just fine to me and the green color doesn't faze me in the least as I often times make fruit or<br />veggie smoothies that have parsley or green veggies as one of the ingredients.<br />I did taste the powder before putting in the blender. Obviously, it is not meant to be eaten straight from the packet.<br />It's not as bad as others say, though. I just wouldn't eat it raw or mixed with water.<br />I will be ordering this product.

review/summary: Great for post-workout recovery.
review/text: I play a lot of tennis in summer and do good amount of lifting when the weather gets colder. Turning 40 I started to notice that my recovery time gets longer, and I often still feel it the next day.  After doing some research on the Internet I decided to try protein + glutamine/creatine powder. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA0XDI">Optimum Nutrition Creatine Glutamine Taurine, Wild Berry, 1.32 Pound (Pack of 2)</a>) It really works. I drink 2 tea spoonful of each mixed with orange or mango (my favorite) juice after workout and always ready for more the next day.<br />It also ensures that I always have enough fiber in my diet.<br />I guess people complaining about taste of hemp protein tried mixing it with water - really bad idea. It's too grainy to stay suspended in water. Use thicker juice or milk.

review/summary: I have made the switch.
review/text: I am not a vegan but a regular weight lifter.  Even my fellow lifters have commented how bigger I have gotten in the last few months.  I use hemp protein powder almost exclusively.  Whey still has its place.  Pre-workout/post-workout I use 15g of hemp in orange juice with an extra 10g of leucine and 5g of glutamine.  It is a "grassy" drink but for me it has NO AFTERTASTE.  For me whey, ONLY tastes good with milk so I use it ONLY as a bedtime protein drink.  It is amazing how well hemp matches with whey (and soy) in the amino acid profile and even though the protein content is less per serving--I get equivalent aminos from 15g of hemp that I do with 26g of whey or soy.  Why don't bodybuilding magazines even have ONE AD for hemp ?

review/summary: good food
review/text: In 2008 I transitioned away from soy after having low testosterone levels. I've been a vegetarian most of my life, and soy had been a staple for me because of the ability to make it taste like almost anything. So, after searching around and trying a variety of different proteins, I found the Nutiva 50% Hemp Protein and was delighted. High protein, good fiber, good fats, and versatile. I sprinkle a serving on my salad or make a thicker dressing. I also like to mash it with juicy fruits like berries. I tried it with spaghetti squash the other day and it was pretty good. I've brought a spinach salad to a potluck with a serving sprinkled over the spinach and tomatoes. Everyone asks what it is, but after they've gone back for seconds. The hardest thing is that it's green, so it doesn't mix well with foods of other colors. So, you're certain to get stares at your green food, but you're probably already used to that if you're looking at hemp protein in the first place. My resistance training progression has been completely positive and my endurance has improved. As a vegan athlete, all I can say is that this stuff is a necessary addition to my diet.

review/summary: Hemp is good for you but remember  -  Don't eat Soy
review/text: I was reading these reviews and I see many people here spend a lot of time selecting their foods.  The one very odd thing is that many people are eating SOY products even though it has been proven over and over again that Soy products or non fermented soy, are very bad for you.  It has been proven that they even cause you to not be able to properly digest other foods you are eating alongside it let alone the fact that soy by itself is actually bad for you in most incantations.<br /><br />Soy ingredients are almost always bad.  TOFU for example is indigestible for the most part.  Did you know there is strong evidence showing that soy leads to Alzheimer's disease.  What a horror to learn this.  It is the GMO created soy by Monsanto that does this and of course they deny it all.  They create poison and companies keep buying it because the government was paid off to put their stamp on it and stamp it they do even though it has been proven that it is poison.  NICE RIGHT?<br /><br />Here Read this great article.  Alzheimer's caused by Soy product<br /><br />Here is a great link<br />[...]<br /><br />Read the link as it explains it best.  Basically pure Soybeans contain tons of protein but unless fermented it is inaccessible to us.  I eat lots of MISO which is soy based and it is excellent for you.  I love 3 year old Miso from South River a US based ancient method maker of Miso and genuine Tamari.<br /><br />So just be very very careful before jumping into any of these products.  I also love HEMP but I know nothing about the feasibility of eating it to get the protein from it.  Does hemp also have properties similar to soy in that the protein is difficult to access easily?  NO seems to be the answer.  Hemp is very safe and is the number one plant based protein.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The list from that link for good sources of protein<br /><br />Quality plant-based proteins include:<br /><br />  * Hemp protein (one of the most complete amino acid profiles of any plant-based protein)<br />  * Yellow pea protein<br />  * Brown rice protein<br />  * Flaxseed (also high in Omega-3s)<br />  * Chlorella (a microscopic, freshwater green algae from Japan - my favourite is Chloressence)<br />  * Almonds, other nuts and seeds (preferably sprouted, since sprouting pre-digests the proteins in seeds, making the amino acids more available to your body)<br />  * Legumes<br />  * Pseudograins (including quinoa and buckwheat)<br /><br />GOOD LUCK

review/summary: I use it daily
review/text: I love Nutiva hemp protein powder. I use it every morning in my green smoothies. It tastes better than most protein powders, but you may wish to add some mint, cacao powder, lime juice or other citrus to mask the green taste if you are not fond of it. It is very mind and pleasant to me, but it doesn't taste like the processed, flavored protein powders some may be used to. I usually have difficulty digesting protein powders, but I don't have any gas, bloating or tummy aches with this product.  The powder is smooth and blends very nicely with no lumps. It's not grainy and doesn't make me gag like many processed protein powders. I love that it's vegan, sustainable, and ethically produced. I subscribed to this product so I never run out. I keep a freezer bag of it in the freezer and a 32 oz mason jar of it in the fridge. It's dry so you don't have to defrost it or anything to use. You can also store at room temperature, but I prefer to keep mine cold. I also use nutiva coconut oil, cacao powder, and hemp seeds on a regular basis. They are all excellent products that I highly recommend.

review/summary: I like the taste of grass. If you don't, don't buy it.
review/text: I'm a vegan athlete and so need to get quality plant protein. I love this product as all it contains is hemp powder--no flavorings or added unnecessary processed ingredients. 1 serving (3tbsp) gives 15 grams of protein. I mix it in my smoothies, put it in my raw energy bars, and even use it in my veggie burgers. The taste is mild and grassy. If you don't like that, don't buy it. It blends well with other ingredients and the taste can disappear, though, if you only use the serving suggestion. I've had no unpleasant side effects since using it, and in fact love how it fills me up for all my workouts.<br />REcommended.

review/summary: Simple hemp protein
review/text: I like this product because it has no additives and literally is just hemp seed in powdered form.  I am training for a marathon and am vegetarian so was looking for additional easy protein sources when I decided to try this.  I found mixing it with chocolate soy or almond milk makes it taste like halwah which is a delicious middle eastern dessert.  Mixing it with plain flavored soy or almond milk isn't the best tasting but it's only a few gulps and then it's over so definitely not a big deal to me.  Will definitely continue buying this.

review/text: I've been buying this for over a year and a half.  In that time left and came back. Can't beat the supersaver price for the amount of protein (15g).  I use four scoops blended in a Vitamix along with a variety of combinations of whatever I have available:  Amazing Grass Green Superfood, kale, apinach, lemon sliver with rind (always with greens), carrots, cucumber, pears, apples, blueberries, bananas, strawberries, chocolate nibs, chia seeds, coconut flakes, flax seeds, ginger, cinnamon, tumeric, etc.  If I have fruits or veges that I know I won't get to before they go bad, I toss them in the freezer and use for shakes.  This has 8 essential amino acids and 15g protein, and is organic (a must for me!).  Quality seems great, and delivery has been perfect.  Thanks!

review/text: I was surprised just how good hemp protein tastes. You wouldn't want to sprinkle it on your ice cream, but as a protein source, it tastes just fine. No blotted or gassy feeling you get when you take whey or soy proteins. Plus, you overall just feel better. Highly recommend this product for anyone looking to increase their protein intake, whether weightlifters or vegetarians.

review/summary: Great/Healthy Alternative to Whey Proteins
review/text: I'm 19 and have been working out for about two years now. When I started I was told I needed to start taking a protein supplement. So like every newbie, I figured GNC was the place to go. I was told to start using the wheybolic protein by the salesman so I did. However, it was becoming too pricey and I was getting headaches regularly. Shortly after, I read in consumer reports that there are various heavy metals found in the mix. I immediately began looking for a healthy and natural alternative. I found Nutiva organic hemp protein and decided to give it a try. It's been six months and I'm hooked. This stuff is great. It's organic (which is always a plus) and it is great for you. I am able to obtain lean protein after each workout and I'll even drink it with my breakfast in the morning to start my day the right way. I mix it with vanilla almond milk or chocolate soy milk and it tastes pretty good. I receive all the benefits of this superfood without sacrificing a whole lot of taste. I highly recommend this for EVERYONE.

review/summary: yay for protein that I'm not allergic to
review/text: Don't attempt to dress it up. Just mix it with juice and down it. Once you get it past your whiney taste buds and delicate throat, your stomach and body will reassure you that it was a good thing to do. During the first few days after a fast, I lived off of a mixture of this hemp protein, spirulina powder and swiss chard juice. It was rough at first, but I felt better every day.<br /><br />My experience of living almost solely on this product for a week (and continuing using it for two weeks afterwards) tells me two things - 1. it's definitely hypoallergenic (otherwise I would have developed respiratory problems, which is my body's universal response to allergens) and 2. it's definitely got protein - because I didn't feel like I was starving (in fact I felt well-fed)<br /><br />Obviously, I'll be ordering this stuff with regular frequency!

review/text: This stuff is great! It's not as bad tasting as everyone says--you just need to be ready for the grainy, green texture it will add to your drinks. I've found that peanut butter pretty much cancels out any bad "odors" the hemp protein might have. This is a great replacement for whey protein, which is over-processed, causes bloating, and is awful for your digestive system. Hemp protein works! Since I'm in college, I don't have a blender, so I use a blender bottle w/ milk, peanut butter, and 4 TBS of this stuff. I already feel less bloated, especially with all the fiber in this stuff ;)

review/summary: An organic alternative to typical protein powders.
review/text: I have been using this protein powder exclusively for the last few months.  I used to buy whey powders, but was looking for an organic alternative that was not too expensive and still got me the extra protein I needed.  This stuff fits the bill and the extra fiber doesn't hurt.  I typically mix it with a half, sometimes a whole, tablespoon of agave sweetener in the morning and with a serving of soy milk before workouts in the afternoon.  After workouts I stick with fat free organic milk as the fiber in the hemp will only slow digestion.  **WARNING**  Drinking this stuff with only water tastes very bad.  At a minimum add a teaspoon or two of sugar.  Oh, and it doesn't seem to mix well with cow's milk but have not had any problems mixing it with soy milk.  Hope this helps.

review/summary: TASTE TERRIBLE mixed with water! However with a banana it is good!
review/text: I was looking for an organic plant based non-soy protein.  I wanted to stay away from soy because 93% is GMO & all contains high levels of pant estrogen which can raise human estrogen; since I am a man I don't like that idea.  I have been taken whey protein for years and now that I am a vegetarian it is 100% necessary to achieve my desired level of protein without a ton of extra calories. I settled on this product because it has a good amount of protein plus omega 3! The omega 3 is a HUGE plus. Initially, I mixed the protein with rice drink and it tasted VERY BAD. I then tried to mix it with water and spinach and it tasted worse. I actually enjoy drinking blended water and spinach.  I then followed some of the others advise and mixed it with a banana and it actually tastes good.  When you first try this product blend it with just water. The next time blend in a banana and you have a real appreciation for it! This will be replacing my whey protein. I am sure I can make this taste wonderful but I want to keep the calories down; so for now it is just a banana. Enjoy!<br /><br />PS Try a little cinnamon!

review/summary: Regarding the taste...
review/text: So I just got my bag in the mail today and mixed 4 tbsp in a glass of cold water. The taste isn't nearly as bad as some reviewers are making it out to be. No, it does not taste like liquid bubble gum. It's a plant-based powder with no additives, it basically tastes similar to tea w/out any sugar except with the consistency of a puree Naked juice drink. I had no problem putting down the glass w/ just water and the Nutiva powder (no fruit, no ice cream, no milk, etc). I guess maybe if you have extremely sensitive taste buds this may be difficult to drink straight up but it was absolutely fine for me. Also, it doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />I would drink this Nutiva straight up with water over most other Whey powders you'd find in a local GNC. This stuff actually tastes "natural" as opposed to like synthetic liquid crud. Oh yeah, and it doesn't clump up at all, it dissolves quite fast in cold water.

review/text: This product arrived today.  I immediately opened it and mixed a drink, using 4 T. of the protein, organic black cherry concentrate, reverse osmosis purified water, and liquid stevia.  It tasted great!  The green color (which bothers some) got disguised by the black cherry juice.  As for the issue of the product "sitting at the bottom" of the glass, sure, it does, but that's not a problem for me.  With my regular sized glass straw, I get protein in every slurp, especially if I stir it first.<br /><br />The above combination is the first of many variations I'm sure I'll use.  (Am thinking of experimenting with iced coffee, this product, and stevia, next.)<br /><br />Considering the nutrition, ease of use, and cost (especially with subscribe and save), the product is a winner.  It adds variation to my supply of protein powder options.

review/summary: Great Quality Product
review/text: This is a very good quality, whole food product that gives me what I want.  I look for a couple of things when buying a protein powder. They must be minimally processed, organic, and they must be 100% vegan-- so no whey protein.<br /><br />This protein fits the bill, and tastes great. I mix it into a green smoothie, and it's always a pleasurable experience!<br /><br />To get a very balanced protein profile that is 100% vegan, mix it with some pea protein.<br /><br />I've been paying around $30 for this product (give or take), so it is reasonably priced as well. Of course, the 15 grams of protein they list on the label, is in three tablespoons, so you will use more of this than some other protein powders.

review/text: OK, so I read many of the reviews about this product before I purchased it.  I am lactose intolerant and can't do soy, so I have been looking for a good protein shake in the morning.  I LOVE THIS.  It tastes great, and it fills me up.  It is easy.  I mix 1 cup almond/coconut milk, a whole banana, 5 ice cubes, and 3 Tbs. of this powder along with a heaping Tbs. of Health Warrior chia seeds.  What a lovely way to start the day for someone who completely eats to live, and would skip breakfast otherwise.

review/summary: Not my favorite but it works
review/text: The green color is a bit weird, and it does have a funny flavor but it works. Taking this product has improved my recovery time and I like that it is vegan. The added fiber is an added bonus. To get the same amount of protein as Soy I have to eat more of it but mixed with almond or hemp milk it is quite drinkable. Some of it is grainy and needs to be mixed well but it does not clump like soy protein and is easy to digest. No added sugar or additives, just protein and fiber. Pretty good mix but you have to be careful what you mix it with. Just mix it according to the directions on the bottle (use almond milk) and you will have no problems. Makes a good after workout snack.

review/text: I started using this hemp protein when I was pregnant as an alternative to soy and whey. As I am not a vegan, do not need to add the protein as a supplement, but want a quick, easy way to add protein for breakfast. I use in breakfast smoothies with organic milk, hemp seeds, organic greek yogurt, fish oil, psyllium fiber and frozen organic berries - amazing, and masks the grass-like taste. Now I can hardly stand the overly-sweetened taste of most whey protein powder.

review/text: I recommend this powder. I have always been taking whey powder and decided to try something new as I found out that most whey protein powders on the market are so processed that they are not only innefective but also cause a bunch of side effects. The taste of the hemp won't be as good as the whey as there is no crap like sucralose (another real bad sweetener) but you get used pretty quick to the nutty flavor of the hemp.

It is quite heavy. But the plastic bag is thin and fragile. My last bag was shipped with other items. It was broken and the powder spilled all over the place. Amazon shipped the replacement with two-day delivery. The service is great. So make sure you check the bag for the leakage. Other than that, this is a great buy.

review/summary: Not Disappointed!
review/text: After reading the 'yuk' reviews, I was concerned it would not be palatable.  I made a shake with the same ingredients I use with vanilla flavored whey protein: start with 1/2 C unsweetened original Living Harvest Hempmilk, 4 TBS Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein, 1 C frozen strawberries (or more as they will thicken the shake), 1/4 small avacado (for healthy fat MUFAs!) It blended up thick and creamy just like the whey protein, and tasted absolutely delicious (a healthy taste, anyway). Some complained about it being gritty, but I didn't notice it as being a negative factor.  It is not that gritty. I was very pleased and this is definately going to replace the whey protein with it, as I am trying to lose weight and thought maybe the dairy is not helping me in that direction.  I'll have to wait and see if it is more effective in weight loss than the whey.  As far as storage, I used three 1 qt mason jars, vacuum sealing two that I won't be using right away and refrigerating all three.  I do make a shake everyday for breakfast after my workouts and it keeps me satisfied for 3-4 hrs.  I will definately be buying this product again! Also, some reviewers complained about the packaging, mine arrived in perfect vacuumed sealed condition.

review/text: I purchased this item after moving to a more vegan based diet.  I say vegan based because I am not strict, but try to significantly limit dairy and meat.  I work out daily and have been looking for ways to get more protein into my diet.  I have liked the Nutiva Hemp a lot.  I mix it into a blended smoothie once or twice per day.  Plain non-sweatened soy milk, banana, frozen strawberries, frozen peaches, frozen blueberries, and 3 tablespoons of the Nutiva.  The smoothie tastes great and goes down very easily.  Nutiva Hemp gives the smoothie a nuttier taste than it would have otherwise but fairly complimentary to the smoothie.  I have tried only once mixing the protein powder into a glass of water and drinking directly... let's just say I recommend sticking to mixing into smoothies.

review/summary: Great Find
review/text: This is a great find for anyone who is searching for a high-protein, easy-to-use, and bulk priced food source.  It is sealed in a vacuum packed bag, but is easily pour-able once you break the seal (no lumps from packaging).  The instructions tell you to use one (of the three pounds) at a time, and freeze the remainder to keep it fresh.  I used baggies to divide up what I froze into smaller units that would work for the speed/way that I consume it.  I bought this increased protein source because it is a fast way to add protein to salads, eggs, oatmeal, cookies, etc.  I have so many food intolerances that I have to be on the watch for ways to bring protein into my diet.  This is excellent for general health benefits, and will "take on" the taste of what it is added to (can be added to either a healthy cookie batter, or an entre such as a stir-fry or salad.  The price was the best I found, and shipping was fast.

When I got it I was excited to try it, directions say to mix 3 tbls with 8 oz milk, but they recommend almond milk.  I opened the tub and was briefly set back by the smell and green color.  But I trucked on anyway.  I mixed it up with my wand mixer, but it didn't fully blend.  It did not dissolve fully, even after extended blending.  Still gritty.  The taste, like the smell was like broccoli.  The drink was like milky broccoli... it was gross.  I would have givent it 1 star, but if you can get past the taste the nutriontal value is very good, just not for me.

review/summary: Good product.  Too bad it doesn't agree with me.
review/text: I ordered the 3-pound bag of Nutiva 50% Protein Hemp Powder at the beginning of July.  I wanted to replace whey protein with hemp protein to cut down on processed foods for bodybuilding.  The quality of the product was superb and fresh.  Taste-wise, it isn't the best tasting powder in the world, but that can easily be fixed by mixing it with almond milk.<br /><br />After drinking my first shake I noticed a lot of gas and bloating -- which is odd given that this product is supposed to have less bloat than whey.  I figured my body was simply adjusting to the extra fiber and kept taking it for the next month.<br /><br />For the second-third weeks, my body was able to tolerate this stuff relatively well.  However, when I reached the 6-7th week, I started getting severe bloating and stomach pains to the point of vomiting.  In addition, I got a slight headache, slight chills and muscle twitching in my ears.  Given this product's reputation, I didn't want to attribute my problems with this product.  I went to the doctor and he gave me a trial of a proton pump inhibitor.  I suspected my GI problems were due to the pre-workout supplement I was taking.  The proton pump inhibitor should allow my digestive system to heal.<br /><br />To rule this product out, I quit taking the hemp and pre-workout supplement for a few days and simply ate more regular food.  I felt better by the weekend.  After those few days, I tried whey protein.  No bloating.  That night, I tried another hemp shake (with almond milk).  One hour after drinking the shake, I got the severe bloating and pain again.. just as bad as before.  I also got the slight headache, chills and ear muscle twitching.  It definitely isn't the almond milk, as I drink almond milk all the time for breakfast.  It also isn't the fiber, as I eat salads full of broccoli all the time.<br /><br />It appears I have an allergic reaction to hemp protein powder.  That is a shame, given all the health benefits of hemp.<br /><br />For now, I will have to stick to whey.

review/summary: All Hype, No Flavor
review/text: If you close your eyes and try really hard, you *might* be able to pick up a feint hint of candy corn flavor in these Oreos. Otherwise, they just taste like overly sweet frosting and cheap cookies. (And let's face it, that's what Oreos basically are.) Despite all the Internet hype, these were a huge let-down. I hope the good people at Nabisco decide not to give these a repeat appearance next fall.<br /><br />It should go without saying, but don't pay the absurd prices resellers are charging for this these. Heck, don't even waste your money if you see at them at Target (the exclusive distributor of this product)... it's just not worth it.

review/summary: High quality decaf tea that sacrifices nothing in the way of flavor .
review/text: As ridiculous as it may sound to you, sweet tea is an important part of the culture of my Southern family.  It's a tradition that spans generations with time honored brewing techniques.  However, caffeine isn't the best friend of growing children - especially those who have been diagnosed as ADHD.  We've been using Luzianne's decaf tea for years in a 50/50 ratio with the regular Luzianne tea bags.  If you're at all familiar with the south you'll know that we tend to take iced tea rather seriously. When I was growing up my mother made iced tea from Lipton tea bags but when I discovered Luzianne tea there was no going back to Lipton!<br /><br />We make our iced tea in this manner:<br /><br />Steep a quart to a quart and a half of water almost to boiling. You don't want to use boiling water as it will singe the tea and create a bitter flavor. As long as the heated water is steaming, it's hot enough. Add 1 family sized (or 2 regular sized bags) of each variety of Luzianne tea (caffeinated and decaffeinated) to the water and allow it to steep all day and come to room temperature. If you're making sweet tea, add a bunch of sugar (this is a personal preference measurement) to the bottom of a gallon sized pitcher, then add about 2 cups of the room temperature (or warm) tea and stir to dissolve all the sugar. At this point, fill the pitcher with ice. Pour the brewed tea on top of the ice and stir gently to combine. Add water as needed to fill your vessel. Your tea will be clear, sweet and refreshing with no bitterness or after-taste. Enjoy!

review/text: I love this brand of tea and use it all summer and winter long when I make ice tea. I have tried Lipton and think that has a stronger taste and is not as smooth as Luzianne tea.

review/summary: "Kitty Crack"
review/text: When I first discovered these treats (Friskies Party Mix Cat Treat Wild West) at the grocery store and brought them home my cats almost lost control. I realize they are only "treats" but I have one cat in particular...This stuff was like an opiate for him; he could eat it 3 times a day and then eat more a few times for in-between snacks. I have been buying them at one of three places-whichever one had it on sale at the time. Then for a period of time the stores caught on and "jacked-up" the prices of the different varities. When I discovered that they were actually cheaper on Amazon than at my grocery store, well.....that saved me a trip to the store. Double win-saved gas and saved time bu not standing in checkout line. I also buy the 4 other varities that Amazon offers as well as The Fancy Feast meals. So now I save lots of time buy ordering most all my cat food from Amazon and my 40lb boxes of kitty litter is also delivered by UPS. I save all the way around; time, gas and my poor aching back (you should have seen the look on the UPS delivery woman's face when she delivered 80 pounds of kitty litter!! Bettter her back than mine. So. Amazon wins all around again by saving me time, money and gasoline. I love them a lot and so do my 5 cats!!! THANKS AMAZON!

review/summary: The best treat for your dog.
review/text: Our local feed shop was unable to get these bagels for a few weeks.  Our dog is so thoroughly addicted to them that he was very disappointed by the lack of his morning treat.  We ordered up a couple of bags and they came from the seller relatively quickly considering there was a holiday weekend involved.  Now our dog has plenty of treats and he's happy.  If you haven't tried these garlic bagel treats you and your dog don't know what you're missing.  For dental health, we have never seen a treat that helped with plaque and tarter.  If our dog goes a week without these bagels we can see the buildup on his teeth.  With regular use, his teeth are as white as can be and utterly free of any tarter or plaque buildup.  For your dog's dental health and enjoyment give Solid Gold Garlic Doggie Bagels a try.

review/text: We tried several formulas. At first we went with Similac Sensitive, which worked well for our baby's gassy tummy. With all the coupons for Similace we found it cheaper but after talking with my pediatrician we finally decided to look at the ingredients on the back of the container. Both Similac and Enfamil list corn syrup as their number one ingredient. Only Gerber Goodstart  has real ingredients and it is the only formula I will trust for my little one.

review/summary: Formula review
review/text: My wife breastfed for 6 months before we had to make the switch to formula.  It was a long painful decision for her especially since she is an RN on postpartum but she decided on Gerber Good Start.  We have used it for 3 months now and our baby has had no issues with it.  My one issue with the formula is it is hard to mix without any clumps, even after shaking and heating up for several minutes.  I hear many complaints about the price but if you factor in tax at the store and the convenience of Amazon I will stick with Amazon.

review/text: Great move for Gerber, more efficient crating design, flashy packaging, less product, higher price.  Too bad for you if your baby is already hooked on Gerber Good Start.<br /><br />At least the instructions have been made clearer.  The old instructions were to use a scoop to make 2 oz of formula, leaving you to guess how much water there was in 2 oz of formula.  Now it clearly says one scoop with 2 oz water.<br /><br />Baby loves the stuff though, never had constipation or obnoxious gas.  It makes her grow!

review/summary: Best for baby's digestive system
review/text: We switched to Gerber Good Start Gentle after trying several other brands of formula.  This was the only brand that did not give her constipation.  It also seemed to fill her up better.  Unfortunately she developed a milk allergy (unrelated to this formula) and we had to switch to her a soy formula.<br />The container is not particularly user friendly.  The foil on top is difficult to remove, especially with a hungry crying baby in the background.  The curves in the container also make it nearly impossible to scoop out the last of the formula.  On the plus side, you don't have to go searching for the scoop and there is a handy place to store the scoop.

review/summary: Gerber *Best* Start
review/text: We've used this since we brought baby home from the hospital 8 months ago (recommended by lactation consultant) and never had any issues with spit-up, gassiness, etc.  Formula in general doesn't smell that great, but this smells less formula-y than others and seems (anecdotally, at least, from other parents) to be tolerated pretty well.  Amazon's pricing is spotty, though.  When normally priced ($21.50), it's fully competitive with your local big box store or drugstore.com, but supply seems to fluctuate a lot, so it's either super-expensive or not available to ship for 4 to 6 weeks.  Minor detail, but I like that the packaging is an all-plastic container that you can recycle when empty (as opposed to the cardboard/tin containers).<br /><br />If you have a food scale already, I'd recommend using it to measure out the formula.  The directions say one scoop (8.9g) per 2 oz, but I found that a full scoop frequently weighs more like 10g.  Not a big deal if you only make 2 oz, but when I make 6 or 8 oz bottles, I prefer having a more accurate measure.<br /><br />And btw, if you use formula frequently, this has been absolutely indispensable for us - it makes life so much easier!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ET94A">Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary</a>

Our guy doesn't seem to get gas too often and he's been progresing good at his checkups.  The only thing about this container I'm not a fan of is when you get to the bottom of the formula, it's hard to get the last little bit in the scoop, and if you want to transfer to the next can, the left-overs can get caught under the lip.  Minor annoyance, but it's really the only thing I can comment on since I can't really speak to the nutritional aspects of the product with authority.

The "tub" containers (23.2 oz) have a slot in the lid in which the scoop secures, which is a nice feature.  In the canister containers, you have to punch out the scoop from within the formula.

review/summary: Smells vanilla-ish ... that's enough to get 5 stars
review/text: I am not sure if other parents ever tried or tasted their babies' formulas ... but I did with mine. I had tried several brands due to my daughter's gassiness. Similac Sensitive worked very well actually, but the reason I switched to Gerber Good Start Gentle was purely for the taste factor since I knew that this Gerber gentle formula is made for babies with gas, fussiness and digestive issues. Other formulas had a kind of raw, ironish, rotten fish smell ... but Gerber Good Start Gentle has a kind of almost sweet Vanilla smell to its formula. The smell didn't make me gag, so that's a winner as I cannot bear for my LO drinking anything nasty. She's now happily enjoying this formula, and having none of the gas issues. And after reading up that this formula has 100% whey protein in it, it makes my decision even wiser. This is a truly a win-win-win situation. Happy tummy, happy baby, happy mommy.

review/summary: This formula saved us!
review/text: My Little One loves Gerber Good Start Gentle. I was unable to breast feed when he was born so we had to go with formula. We started with Similac on the advice of the hospital. Within a week we knew something was up. He would scream and scream all day. We switched to Similac Sensitive (that's what his lactose intolerant cousin was on) thinking lactose intolerance and it only got worse. By 4 weeks old we were told he had colic. I said BS!<br /><br />My husband did some research and found Gerber Gentle. We switched our little one cold turkey at 1 month old and the next day we received his first smiles. It turns out our son has a casein intolerance, confirmed by his pediatrician, and Gerber Gentle is the only one with whey protein ONLY (that isn't soy, most formulas have whey and casein to make up their milk proteins, which is normal). And the added benefit? No corn syrup. We started with Ready to Feed formula until he was 4 months old due to his sensitive tummy. We now use powder and I love it as Gerber doesn't clump too much and it doesn't create a lot of extra bubbles when mixing it up like the Similac did.<br /><br />To each their own, but we love Gerber!

review/text: I started feeding the baby with the formula since he was 3 weeks (lack of my own milk) I tried the enfamil, did not stick with it and moved right to Similac (the blue one) since I got it from the friend, the baby did not have the stool for like 4 days and he was very uncomfortable, also he was spitting too much, tried Similac orange (the sensitive) still no poop.So I added some water and the same time changed to Gerber. Poop came no more then 2 days later w/o any help and he stayed regular- every day almost the same time. The formula has no added sugar like Similac sensitive and I feel like I give him good nutritions and he is definitly gaining weight. I recommend at least to try if you struggle finding the right formula. I believe since the proteins are more broken down (hydrolized) he is digesting it better.

review/summary: The only non-corn syrup formula that worked, but it's cheaper at Target
review/text: Our newborn had a lot of gas issues.  We tried regular Similac and Enfamil and they didn't seem to help his gas.  The other companies made "gentle" formulas because many had corn syrup as the first ingredient.  Gerber gentle does not.<br /><br />Our pediatrician suggested a soy based formula so we tried Gerber Soy.  But that constipated him terribly.  Finally we found Gerber Good Start Gentle.  It seemed to help his gas and also didn't constipate it.  At 8 months old now, he still is taking it without any problems.  We buy the ready to feed formula for on the go convenience (same ingredients as the powdered kind).<br /><br />The only reason that I'm not giving it 4 stars is that I've been buying it religiously on Amazon due to the convenience.  The other day I went to Target and I realized the Amazon price is $4 higher than Target ($3 higher if you use Subscribe and Save).  Too bad, but I guess it's my fault for not comparison shopping.

review/summary: BY FAR THE BEST
review/text: Gerber Good Start was recommended to me by a lactation consultant.  It's by far the best.  No constipation, less gas (the gas that he does have is probably from the bottle not the formula) and it doesn't smell nasty, even when it comes back up, which isn't that often. I highly recommend this product.  It's worth the extra money.  Also, Amazon subscribe and save has the best pricing. I live in a rural community and the nearest store is 30 minutes away.  So for me it's more cost effective to have it delivered to my door.

review/summary: Good formula
review/text: Since I wasn't able to breastfeed, I wanted to give my baby the next best thing: the best formula with the best ingredients. The pediatrician recommended Good Start and the baby likes it. We had started using Enfamil Gentlease because our baby had gas, but I found out that the first ingredient for that product is corn syrup (!!). Gerber Good Start seems to have a much better ingredient list.

review/summary: Gentle on the stomach .. like its name
review/text: We have a 3 1/2 month old baby who is a preemie. He was given pre-made Enfamil in the hospital so we bought the powdered version home once he was discharged. After going through several cans we discovered that the reason our baby would cry and have pain and gas troubles was the formula. So we tried the Gentlease version of Enfamil and while that was better it didnt really solve the problem. After which we tried the Good Start Protect (this used to be Nestle carnation when some of my friends whose kids are now 7 years old had used it) That was a MAJOR improvement but when we tried the GoodStart Gentle we knew we had found what suited the baby best. He still spits up often but has no pain even when he has gas troubles. I would certainly recommend this to try as an option for a baby that is crying and colicy - it did take 7 to 10 days for us to see the effect of the new formula but we were told to expect that much time when changing from one formula to another.

review/summary: Best Formula for my LO
review/text: We originally started with Enfamil newborn and my LO was very fussy and crying for hours on end.  I tried Similac Alimentum, but he didn't like the taste and it mixed horribly. I needed an 'in between' formula.  Good start was recommended by our doctor and it's perfect!  Not hard on his tummy and easier on your wallet than alimentum.  Tastes and smells better too! I use the powder formula for daycare and home- and it mixes well and there are limited bubbles.  I used the tetra packs for for travel.  THEY ARE AMAZING!  I don't have to worry about spoiling milk, mixing, or warming bottles.

review/summary: My baby likes this formula
review/text: I have been a Good Start fan since last year.  Comparatively, I liked their product and my little also agreed with it.  However, I AM NOT HAPPY about Gerber changing the size from a 25 ounce tub to a 23 ounce tub.  Moreover, they have now raised the price too!  Shame on Gerber for this!

review/summary: OVERPRICED
review/text: This new "Packaging" is more expensive than the last plus it's smaller - 23.2 oz vs. the 25 in the old packaging.  Granted it's nice not having to fish around for the scooper, but there's no reason to increase pricing on this.  Target had the 25 oz for $19.99 at one point (maybe try to clear old packaging for new) - now it's at $21.05 still cheaper than what I've seen online - even for amazon- so far...

review/summary: malt ball marbles
review/text: Chocolate covered malt balls were crammed into a cheap plastic bag large enough to to hold about 2/3 of quantity whhich coupled with weather resulyed inton a soggy mess with each package. When i tried them for taste, erxc after prying off a few I found the chocolare cofcering outstanding. The nalt ball centers were something else = more like glass marble. Aktogether I rate these as one big big dissapointment.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: These are fantastic!  No grittiness whatsoever. Great chocolate flavor - taste exactly like you remember a brownie being!  I've made these and shared them with non-gluten free relatives, and they did not have any idea that they were gf.  So nice to get a boxed mix that actually makes a family sized portion!  They come out nice and chewy, and remain that way for at least a day.  I can't vouch for anything longer than that, because I can't keep them around the house any longer!  They disappear VERY quickly!!<br />Thanks Naomi, for another job well done!!!

review/summary: The Best even in comparison to non-gluten free brownies
review/text: If I could get this in bulk I would probably buy them out! I received this for a Christmas present, and I was a little doubtful since trying out several brands of gluten free stuff never tasted good. This will not disappoint! And they are very addictive! I could eat the whole pan, which the mix offer a generous 9x13 size pan.  Very low in fat (surprise especially because of the wonderful taste) and being vegan/vegetarian. Instructions offer up a chewy fudgy like preparation method, or the regular cake like method. I chose to try out the fudgy and omg heaven! Great fudgy chocolaty mouth feel! Definitely hits the spot for chocolate cravings! The only issue I have with it is it is it's a bit sweet, so a little goes a long way.<br /><br />Wish it could be a little cheaper or offered in bulk, but well worth the price all the same! Their website at [...] offers online nutritional info. I provided the ingredients and description below.<br /><br />Better Batter Gluten Free Fudge Brownie Mix was formulated to look, act, and taste just like - frankly, even better than - gluteny Duncan Hines style brownie mix - our mix even makes a generous 9�13 pan. No special methods needed - just add water, oil, and eggs or pureed beans.<br /><br />Ingredients: SUGAR, WHITE RICE FLOUR, CONFECTIONER'S SUGAR (SUCROSE, CORNSTARCH), COCOA, CANOLA OIL, BROWN RICE FLOUR, TAPIOCA STARCH, POTATO STARCH, POTATO FLOUR, SALT, XANTHAN GUM, PECTIN (LEMON DERIVATIVE), SODIUM ACID PYROPHOSPHATE, BAKING SODA, MONOCALCIUM PHOSPHATE MONOHYDRATE<br />Accepted for: VEGETARIAN/VEGAN, OU KOSHER, FEINGOLD I & II

review/text: Delicious sauce.  Its really very good, one of the best Tonkatsu sauces you can get I hear, and I agree, its tastey!<br /><br />however, I bought this for under $4 with tax from the Japanese food store, so this is more then a little over priced.  Great product, plenty of it in the bottle, but bad price.
