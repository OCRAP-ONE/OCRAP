review/text: This syrup is used for my Key Lime Pie martini, which is awesome!  The product is very sweet and sugars up if saved for a long time after it is opened. I wish Monin would make a sugar free version of this flavor, but no luck yet. This particular product is so good you can taste a bit of graham cracker just like the pie.  Highly recommend this product, and if you like, add equal parts vanilla vodka and pineapple juice for an amazing cocktail.

review/text: This is the best seafood/fish seasoning I've found.  Sprinkle it on any kind of seafood or fish for a nicely seasoned flavor - not salty at all - if you want salt, you'll have to add it separately - just really nice herbs.

review/text: OK...I's serious here. If you like Cajun food or even if you don't, you really need all of his seasoning blends in your pantry.  He's now got a special seasoning for just about everything and I've yet to run across one that was not tasty in the extreme.<br /><br />Also, you should order a gallon of his hot sauce.  It's the most flavorful hot sauce I have ever tried and it's not so hot that you can't eat what you put on it.<br /><br />If the US Government operated like he does, we might actually have a good news day once in awhile.

Doesn't fall apart when stirring and will even hold up when refrigerated overnight and reheated and stirred in oven. Also, is great for cold pasta salads. Won't break down and pasta tastes like I remember regular pasta tasting like. I like that I could purchase in bulk since my local grocery store only carries one weird shape I don't like. It's great I can order here on Amazon.  Delivery was prompt and packed nicely.  No broken pasta.

review/text: I live in a sparsely populated state, and due to the low volume of gluten-free products, what is available in our stores costs about double what you pay on Amazon.com.  This Sam Mills Pasta D'Oro is very tasty and I don't think the average person would know it was gluten-free if you didn't tell them.  It also holds it shape very well and doesn't fall apart after it is cooked.  Sam Mills pastas will now become a staple in my cupboards.

review/summary: Retro Soft Drink Is Worth a Few Measured Sips But Oh That Calorie Count!
review/text: A soft drink does seem like a trivial item to review especially since the general category of food and beverages depends more on one's own palate. A friend of mine introduced me to this drink based on his own childhood remembrance in the Midwest. I don't recall it from mine, but once I tasted it, it did take me back to the days when miniature plastic bottles of Hawaiian Fruit Punch stood next to my mother's jell-o mold in the refrigerator.<br /><br />With the appropriate color-clashing, tropical d&eacute;cor on the can, Tahitian Treat is tasty in that fizzy, retro sort of way and is definitely not for the macrobiotic among us, as there are standard, life-shortening ingredients like sodium benzoate and Red #40 pervading the carbonation. And you certainly can't drink it like Diet Coke since it is an astonishing 200 calories a can. But baby boomers should have a stash when they feel like a walk down a sugar-infested memory lane. Be forewarned that Amazon may be the only option to get this soft drink since it is not easily found at stores as specialized as Beverages and More, at least here in Northern California.

But, I just recently opened a box and, after one telltale bite, I was disappointed to find that they now add autolyzed yeast extract, a common favor enhancer that is practically the same as MSG.  I have adverse reactions to both MSG and autolyzed yeast extract. Too bad they ruined this product for me and other MSG-sensitive folks out there.  I wonder why they did it?!

review/text: If you want an easy way to make great tasting brown gravy this is it.  You can make any amount you want, just put three teaspoons of granules in a one cup measuring jug and fill with hot water and stir, stir, stir. It will thicken by itself and be delicious.  Once you get used to it you can make small amounts, say for one person just by judging the amount of granules as you stir hot water in.  I can't say enough good things about Bisto, all my American friends love it too.

review/summary: Bisto Favourite is the BEST brown gravy thickener in the world!
review/text: Bisto is hands down the best! My mother turned me onto it a few years back and now I wouldn't think of using a white thickener (flour, corn starch) for any meat or poultry gravy again!<br /><br />What's so fantastic about Bisto Favourite is that you can make as much gravy as you want even from meats that give you hardly any drippings. Takes no time or effort at all and never ever gets lumps. You can even pour it directly into already cooking gravy. Can't do that with flour! It's foolproof. Gravy made with this always has plenty of great flavor, color and body.<br /><br />I've only tried the favourite and poultry flavors but am curious about the onion one. Personally, I don't like the Bisto for poultry flavor. I use favourite for both meat and poultry gravies. It has a lovely flavor and color that really works with everything. Just cut back on salt when seasoning the meat because the Bisto will add some.<br /><br />What I also love is that I can make a little 'quick' gravy for any leftover food that has no gravy by simply putting a dash of Bisto in the bottom of the plate, pour a little water over it. Place the meat/potatoes/whatever on the plate and microwave. When it's done the granules have melted and incorporated into the water and it is much like natural au jus. I get a nice moist leftover i/o something dry and bland.<br /><br />You'll never fail at gravy-making with Bisto Favourite!

review/summary: Aaaaahhh!! Bisto!! This really does make the best gravy.
review/text: So, ideally we'd all make gravy totally from scratch using only the pan drippings from whatever meat we're cooking, but... sometimes you just don't get that much in the way of pan drippings, and yet you want LOTS of gravy. And sometimes you're cooking, say, sausages (bangers & mash, anyone??) or something else that isn't going to result in juices you can make gravy from, and yet you still require a big jug of gravy to pour over everything. Lucky for all concerned, the marvellous product that is Bisto exists. I'm English (but have lived in the US for the past several years) and am very happy that this product is reasonably easy to obtain over here. My American husband is an enormous fan and starts to get a bit worried if we don't have at least one unopened tub of Bisto in the cupboard, lest he should want bangers & mash or toad in the hole for dinner and find we're unable to make enough gravy to float a small boat to accompany it.<br /><br />Bisto does come in a few different varieties, but these "favourite" granules are the original and work really well as an all-purpose gravy. I prefer to use this version no matter what meat I'm cooking - it works just as well with chicken or turkey as it does with beef or with pork sausages, and it's an essential ingredient in shepherd's pie (lamb), cottage pie (beef), steak "pot" pie (as they call it over here), you can throw a spoonful in the crockpot when making a stew... it's very versatile and adds a lovely rich, deep flavor to all kinds of dishes.<br /><br />When making gravy, you can have a jug of the stuff ready within a couple of minutes if you do it the easy way (boil kettle, pour boiling water over a couple of spoonfuls of Bisto granules, stir quickly) but for REALLY good gravy I prefer to soften some onion and garlic in a little butter (just let it sweat over a low heat in a covered pan) until it caramelises slightly, then dump in the Bisto granules and boiling water, give it a good stir, and you will have some heavenly gravy ready to go. Only takes a few minutes. Even better is if you use the water from boiling vegetables and stir in meat juices from the roasting pan if you have some, but it works just as well without.<br /><br />The downside of this product (if you care about such things) is that it's pretty high on the sodium content and has a few artificial flavorings etc in there. As far as I'm concerned: meh. It tastes great, I'm sparing with the salt just about everywhere else in my diet, and I don't use Bisto in great enough quantities to worry about it.<br /><br />In short: Bisto is a wonderful taste of home, and while I could live without it, I'd really rather not!

review/summary: Mushroomy goodness!
review/text: I have been a fan of the More Than Gourmet product line for many years (I think since right about when they started) and this stock reduction is one of my favorites. Unlike their duck, chicken, veal, lamb and seafood products, this one can be added to almost anything. Soups, stews, sauces, what have you. This will add depth to all of the other More Than Gourmet stocks and glaces.<br /><br />They start with a classic "essence de champignon" (which is a mushroom stock containing sherry, salt, garlic and spices) and then they reduce it to 1/20 of it's volume. Since it is bound with a starch (Tapioca) it will help to add some body to a sauce. It can be used minimally diluted and poured over carrots, fish (really just about anything that would taste good with mushrooms), or added to an existing sauce or dish.<br /><br />I often make my own mayonnaise using safflower oil, egg yolks, Dijon mustard, lemon juice and various seasonings. I usually serve it as an elegant topping for fish or vegetables (it's great on asparagus) but I always thought that it could be better. I now add just a teaspoon of the More than Gourmet Essence De Champignon Gold and I can't believe how much better it is!<br /><br />I am a lifelong carnivore but some members of my family are vegetarians. When I cook for them I substitute this for a veal, chicken or beef demi-glace. I even add it to vegetable stock to give it that extra dimension. Sometimes I buy it in the 16 oz. tub, other times I like the convenience of the small 1.5 oz cups. If you can think of a dish that would would benefit from the hearty, earthy flavor of mushrooms then I recommend that you give this a try.

review/summary: Agave nectar
review/text: This is an excellent alternative to sugar. It tastes better than sugar or any of those artificial sweeteners. This nectar has a low glycemic index which is good news for diabetics. I can't wait to try cooking with this. I use it in coffee, on pancakes, french toast, just about on anything.

review/summary: AWESOME steak seasoning!!
review/text: I LOVE this stuff for grilling steak!! Pat the steak dry and then lightly spray it with bourbon. Sprinkle the seasoning to your taste - I like lots of seasoning, remember you will lose some while grilling. Flip the steak and do the other side. Let it soak while lighting the grill. Just before grilling, lightly brush the steak with melted butter - be careful to not remove the seasoning! Make sure the grill is REALLY hot! Sear the outside and spray it again with a bit of bourbon. Flip the steak and do the other side. Flavor is similar to the Bourbon Street Steak at Applebees. My opinion is mine is a little better . . . It may take you 2-3 times to get it down pat but it is SO worth it!!!

review/summary: Wonderful MisSteak I made.
review/text: I have used Blackened Redfish seasoning for years, but made the mistake of ordering 2 20Oz containers of the wrong stuff, the Blackened STEAK magic. It was $20 and rather than returning it, I decided to try using it. It is the best steak I have had. I like sirloin better than ribeye because it's leaner. I would suggest following the recipe exactly. I use a Coleman stove out doors with a heavy steel French frying pan. Cast iron would work well too. It will smoke up your house unless you have an industrial hood. I never order steak anymore. It's always better at home. I would also recommend letting the steak come up to near room temperature before blackening it.

If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

I used to be frustrated with the length of time it takes to make sweet tea - brewing the tea bags and then having to wait for the brew to chill in my fridge take about half a day. And then you have to drink it in a timely manner so that the tea doesn't lose its freshness. But with these tea Kcups, I can have a fresh brewed sweet tea in 30 seconds made specifically for me or my guests and it is so fresh tasting and cool and refreshing. My friends who frequent coffee shops, have been impressed with the quality of the coffee and say that the brew is just as good if not better than local coffee shops because it is so fresh and made just one cup at a time. So I am very impressed and will keep buying this product now that my campaign is almost over. I am so happy that Keurig decided to make this product. Makes me love my brewer even more! I received this product as a sample from bzzagent.<br /><br />Pros -<br />1. fresh brewed taste one cup one cup at a time<br />2. No wait time for brews to be perfect<br />3. No stale day old taste from product sitting in the refrigerator<br />4. Coffee house taste at a fraction of the cost<br /><br />Cons - NONE

review/summary: Taste like corn muffins
review/text: I ordered these after I bought the Stonewall Kitchen gluten free chocolate chip cookie mix.  I was so happy to find something like this for my 7 year old!  Unfortunately, the cupcakes were really - icky.  They tasted like corn muffins.  My son is gluten free due to sensitivity, not a disease.  Therefore he does not have to be 100% gluten free.  This makes our choices a bit wider when I am looking at ingredients for him.  The chocolate chip cookies were very good and I'd buy the mix again and make them.  I bought both the chocolate and vanilla cupcake mix.  We found them heavy, and didn't really like the taste.  They were totally disappointing.  I can now go to Hannafords and buy pre made gluten free cupcakes that are actually yummy - they are also a bit heavy.  They don't taste like corn bread and that is the plus.  My suggestion if you order these is make them mini cupcakes and make or buy your own frosting.  For someone who is gluten free, they do taste better than lots of things you can buy and make.  For kids who aren't - they will notice a big difference and most likely not like or want them.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I ordered this cupcake mix because a coworker was having a birthday and our supervisor has Celiac Disease.  Needless to say, I wanted to make sure he got to eat a cupcake too, but I didn't want to buy a bunch of weird flours and get stuck with the excess.<br /><br />One box didn't make 12 cupcakes like the box said, although if you don't fill the cupcake cups up, i'm sure you could get 12 out of the mix.  I like to fill my cupcakes a little fuller though, for aesthetics, so I ended up using both boxes to make about 18 cupcakes.<br /><br />The flour mixture itself was very fluffy and well sifted, which always makes for a nice cake consistency.  I didn't use the box directions, and instead used the weight watchers reecipe using orange soda and egg whites instead of eggs and butter.  The vanilla flavor wasn't completed covered up by the soda, so I imagien in a vanilla preparation it would taste pretty good.  The only off-putting part was when the cupcakes came out of the oven, they smelled a bit liek corn muffins.  but by the time they were frosted and decoarted, I didn't notice the corn smell.<br /><br />For the frosting packet, I used the butter and milk as described, but added orange flavoring to go with the orange soda cupcakes.  I think the buttercream mix was basically just confectioner's sugar that was processed without gluten 9since I think alot of corn starch used in regular powdered sugar is processed with wheat).  It didn't make very much frosting though.  Both packets together wouldnt have covered 24 cupcakes, but since I only ended up with 18 it came out perfectly.<br /><br />I made the cupcakes the night before they'd be served,  and the next day they were a little gummy, but not really much worse for the wear.  If I made these again, I'd probably store them covered on the counter, then frost the day of to keep them from getting gummy in the fridge.<br /><br />All in all, they got the job done - without any reactions(!) and all the 'normal' eaters still liked them!

review/summary: Solid product and good value.  But, my goodness, too much waste!
review/text: The oatmeal itself is tasty and pretty healthful.  It's not the best oatmeal I've ever had, but it is quite good.  And it is great to see yet another vegan-certified product on the market.  This is a great option for busy vegans (like me!) looking for a quick breakfast.  You can probably make better oatmeal from scratch, but it would take a lot longer.  So, really, this is a good product.<br /><br />But I have two (somewhat related) complaints.<br /><br />First, the serving size is *ridiculously* small.  Each packet of oatmeal is about 120 calories.  That's just silly.  Unless you're a child, or you're planning on eating much more than oatmeal for breakfast (or adding significant quantities of fruit to your oatmeal), you'll want to open a couple of packs each time you sit down.  That's a bit annoying.  (You could solve this one problem by buying the larger cups.  But they're a much worse value, calorie-for-dollar.  And the second problem, below, still applies.)<br /><br />Second, there is so much packaging and unnecessary waste.  It's absurd that ~50 ounces of oatmeal is spread out over six boxes, each of which contains eight microscopic paper bags of oatmeal.<br /><br />These problems could be solved by just selling single-container bags of oatmeal.  The result would be less waste and packaging and an easier time serving.<br /><br />Still, overall, this is a good product.

Those other "healthy" organic oatmeals tasted like candy to me.<br /><br />As expected, McDougall's tastes noticeably less sweet. Instead, you taste the oats and the apples. I'm very pleased with this product.

review/text: Thank god you get 48 of these packets.  These are amazingly good.  The key for me, who prefers thicker (not watery) oatmeal, is to put just enough water in it to cook, not to be liquidy.  This makes the flavors pop.  The apples are chewy and do not taste processed.  The cinnamon is so good, especially at the bottom of the cup.  This is definitely a great product.  I LOVE the fact that its got half the sugar and is actually healthy.  If you do weight watchers, a packet is 2 points.  I typically do 2 packets in a cup at work.  Its a great snack, late breakfast, etc.  Sooo good, and organic!

review/summary: Best of the instant app/cinn oatmeals I've had, plus organic and no funky extra ingredients
review/text: This is a really, really good instant oatmeal. I have a soft spot for apple cinnamon instant oatmeals and have, in the past, eaten Quaker's and McCann's versions. This one is by far the best. The flavor is nice, the apples rather generous, and it's light on the sweetness (which allows you to ratchet up the sweetness to your taste, which I appreciate).<br /><br />The texture IS NOT creamy right off, and this is a thing with instant oatmeals in general. Once you add the boiling water, let it sit for 3-5 minutes. I find when I let it sit about, stirring it up now and then, it gets to a truly comforting and nice "gloopy" oatmeal texture. If you just add water and stir--it will be "pebbly" and dry. Not nice. So, remember to give it time to get to the right texture.<br /><br />The ingredients list is minimal (which I like), the taste is very nice and "clean", and I tend to sweeten it just  a bit more. I also tend to use two packets, but then, I used to use two packets of Quaker, etc, as well.<br /><br />Another good product from Dr. M. Hurrah!

review/text: I am a huge fan of Dr. McDougall's products and this oatmeal deserves a lot of praise.  These oatmeal packs contain a reasonable 120 calories (most store brands have 150 calories).  One package of this oatmeal truly fills you until lunch.  Each packet has the perfect mix of apples, cinnamon and oatmeal.<br /><br />As you search for healthy oatmeal, you will find that the company makes large oatmeal cups.  I found the cups to be too large -- I started to remove half the oatmeal for my next day's breakfast.  I don't have to do that with the oatmeal packets because the portion size is perfect. I hope the company begins to make packets for the Dr. McDougall breakfast cups.

review/text: My dogs love these... either straight up, or crumbled on food they would otherwise not eat.  They don't get sick of them and almost never ever reject them.  They do quite often reject other treats, and certainly after a while of the same other treats.  But then tend to always enjoy these. In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!
