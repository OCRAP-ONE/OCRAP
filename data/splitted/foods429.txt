review/summary: Wonderful Grain Free Cat Food - A hit with my 4 kitties!
review/text: I cannot find this product in Maine (in my area) and when I discovered that I could get it at Amazon with Free Super Saver Shipping, I pounced on the deal! Great prices on quality food and now both I and my family of cats are very well pleased! I searched for grain free due to my diabetic cat's dietary needs but he turned his nose up at any other brand I brought home.<br /><br />My cats prefer the Fish Flavors in Gravy, and rarely do they leave any on the plate like they used to with Fancy Feast. I'm sure the other flavors are great too but my cats just don't like them.

review/summary: very finicky felines
review/text: Simply put, my cats love it. I used to buy another brand that was the ONLY one I could find that both would consider edible. That one was not available for a few months and I tried every canned food possible. They would not touch any of them, needless to say my friends cats got a lot of treats-then I found this company, they liked it right off the bat and they like most of the varieties. Finally, everyone is happy.

review/text: My cat is very picky and only eats certain kinds of food.  When he first tried the Paw Lickin Chicken, it instantly became his favorite.  He loves it!  It's also way healthier than most of other brands out there, any definitely beats any dry food for cats.

review/text: My cats love this cat food.  They enjoy the shredded meat and chunks of potatoes and vegetables.  This is a great supplement to commercial wet food, which I use when higher quality cat food is not available.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I think they have changed some of their recipes.  My cats used to love the Steak Frites, but they don't like the new version at all.  I still think the food is good and very high quality, though.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Weruva cat food, but my cats weren't thrilled with this particular flavor. They ate most of it, but didn't "dig in" like they usually do - just kind of picked at it. The dog, on the other hand, was more than happy to finish it off for them. I must admit that I was kind of glad when they didn't wolf it down, because it definitely smells very fishy and I was happy that I wouldn't have to buy it again! :)

review/text: I have two cats that are very picky eaters, sometime ago I found out about weruvia and they seemed to really enjoy it. So, in order to keep my furry friends happy and save some money I purchased weruvia online, and to my my surprise one of them would not eat it at all. I discovered that the food I purchased online unlike the one I was buying at the pet store was made in Thailand. I found a can from a previous purchase which had been made in the USA and the cat ate it without a problem. So, I wondering if anyone has had the same problems???

review/summary: Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken wet cat food
review/text: I have two diabetic senior cats in my brood and I try to make sure I feel them all the best quality food I can fit into my budget.  The cats do love this food and I feel good feeding it to them because it is high quality.  The ingredients read like human-food, there are virtually no preservatives and it doesn't have that "cat food" smell.  The cats always lick off all of the "broth" it's packed in before moving on to the shreds of chicken breast itself.<br /><br />My only caveat is the cost.  Yes, I know you pay more for good quality cat food but I have read that even a lower quality wet food is better for your cats than a diet consisting of only dry food, even if it's the best dry food.  I feed my cats wet food once daily and they have "grazing priviledges" with a bowl of high quality dry food (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WE5O">Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food</a>) that I typically have to fill once a day.  I may buy this once in a while as a treat but they seem to enjoy the less expensive leading brand just as much.

review/summary: Izze is great tasting!
review/text: My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon!  They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling clementine soda.  Nothing beats an icy, cold Clementine Izzy on a picnic. The clementine flavor goes well with a nice thick sandwich and a handful of chips, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.

review/summary: Amazing Drink.
review/text: This drink is absolutely great. It has less calories, sugars, and sodium than Pepsi or Coke products, plus it tastes great. My favorite is the clementine but I'm also partial to the blackberry and lime. It's not overly sweet and I think thats why I like it. If you're looking for an all natural, tasty drink, you've found it- Izze Sodas.<br /><br />The reason this review is 4 Stars is because the pricing here on Amazon is ridiculous. Aren't you supposed to get a deal when you buy by the case? I purchase an Izze everyday at work for $1.69... you do the math. I can literally buy more by purchasing them individually.<br /><br />So while this soda is spectacular, do yourself a favor and find a better price. C'mon Amazon.

review/summary: Great Tasting!
review/text: This is a very good drink.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Sparkling Clementine.  It is funny when I tasted the drink I thought, yup, that tastes like a Clementine.  Then I looked at the back for the ingredients.  There are juices (from concentrate) from White Grape, Apple, Lemon and Orange Juice.  No Clementine.  Funny enough it really is a nice flavor.<br /><br />Izze also offers this beverage in a just over 8 oz. a can.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />This is not a hydration beverage as much as a tasty treat.  It is not unhealthy so you don't need to feel guilty by downing one or two of these in a day.  Not calorie free but not too bad either.  The taste is not overly sweet.  I have heard from others who consider it bitter.  I disagree.  I think this bitter taste is from tastebuds too used to sugary sodas.<br /><br />A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book

While others might not be as sensitive to this issue I'm providing the information to make your own choice.<br /><br />Ingredients: roasted peanuts, roasted almonds, raw walnuts, dehydrated tart apple chunks, dehydrated half mooned kiwi, dehydrated half sliced mango, dehydrated sliced papaya with lime, dehydrated pineapple tidbits, dehydrated whole strawberries, banana chips, dried tart cherries, raisins.<br /><br />The ingredients have additional sweetening, flavoring, coloring and preservatives in the form of sugar, citric acid, FD&C coloring, sulfur dioxide, juices, salt, oils and "artificial flavor".<br /><br />It makes for a very tasty blend but not pure in any way.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I have two pugs, who have been on Newman's Own Organic dog food and treats for about 6 months now, with great results. While your dog will survive on any commercial dog food, the better the food you offer them, the healthier they will be and more longeivty they will have.  If nothing else, feeding a food like this one, because it is more nutrient-dense and does not contain undigestible fillers such as corn...less poop!<br />I previously fed Innova, which I was happy with, but made the switch to Newman's on principal.  Newman's donates all thier proceeds to related charities and has a seriously strong reputation for being a never-test-on-animals manufacturer (I know it's funny to not test dog food on dogs, but I don't mean taste testing- I mean ugly, awful, kept-in-cages-and-injected, etc. animal testing) and environmentally-friendly and organic (because less hormones and pesticides is healthier!) company.  Innova won't share thier practices...

review/summary: Great!
review/text: I recently started looking for a more natural way to boost my energy at the end of the day before hitting the gym. I used to use no-xplode and jack3d, and although I don't get that energy rush I did with those supplements, I definitely get through my workouts with the constant energy this gives me (no jitters, side effects either). The vitamin C in these should also helps get good pumps from what I've read too.<br /><br />I just got my shipment from amazon and these new ones tastes great! The wegmans ones I got at first tasted really bitter and heavy, but these actually taste like unsweetened tea. Will definitely be buying many more packs!!

review/text: I love this stuff. I am on my third case in 2 months. I can't hold on to it. It gives you energy and I love the flavor, its not similar to what a lot of people think about tea though. It's a much more earthy flavor, kind of a mix between green tea and black tea. If you like earthy and natural, this is great stuff.

review/text: My family and I love Indian food, so when my niece was cooking this up at her house and I got a whiff of it, I had to try it.  OH. MY. GAWD.  YUMMMMMMM!!!!  It's VERY flavorful without being too hot/spicy.  If you want it hotter you can always add some more hot spice to it.<br /><br />I use my BIG skillet, sautee a bunch of onion in coconut oil to start, then add whatever veggies I have on hand:  squash, greens, green beans, mushrooms, celery, ... you name it, I've put it in there, and it's ALWAYS delicious!  When I'm making enough to have leftovers I'll use 2 jars, but if it's just for the hubby and me I use just one.<br /><br />I generally make it with fish rather than chicken.  I've been using wild-caught cod and it's just marvelous.  Sometimes I serve it over quinoa, but mostly I just serve it as though it were a "fish stew" with the fish & veggies.<br /><br />TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!!!<br /><br />The Jalfrezi Sauce is just as delicious, BTW.  Try it too!

review/summary: not crunchy, but good
review/text: No, these are not crunchy, as the name implies... but are fresh strawberries "crunchy"?  If you put them in a bowl, add milk or rice milk to soften a bit, then add your cereal, nuts, whatever, you make a really great breakfast with a fruit flavor, no matter what the season. This particular brand is the only organic one where the berries are grown & processed in the U.S. I get them on Amazon's auto-ship plan, which brings the price down quite a bit, making it far lower than getting an equivalent in a market - which frankly, you can't, because even organic stores don't usually list where their freeze-dried berries are grown.

review/summary: Crunchies?  Not quite.
review/text: I am normally a huge fan of all-natural, healthy, and organic snack foods such as this one.  However, the product is not what it says it is.  These strawberries are not crunchy, but rather chewy.  For me, they did not have a desirable texture.  It seems that one of two things may have happened here; either not all water was removed during the freeze-drying process or somehow air (and moisture) got into the package, taking away from the product's crunch.  Also buyer beware, because these packages are only 1 ounce, not 1.5 as the picture and product description state.

This product is not marked with the USDA label, therefore is not 100% or even 95% organic acording to the USDA NOS.  If you buy organic in the US..look up the USDA NOS and find out what '100% Organic' and 'Organic' and 'made with organic ingredients' require for labeling.

review/text: These are terrible, I struggled through eating the first bag, then just tossed the other bags.  I opened the first bag and handed these out to my coworkers to ensure it was not just me, but there is unanimous agreement, terrible and NOT crunchie, as the namesake suggests.  The texture is like rubbery styrofoam.  The only thing I can say is these are yucky rubbery artificial-like taste. Maybe it is freeze-dried strawberries that just taste like this, but I will not be ordering freeze-dried strawberry anything after getting a taste of these.

review/text: For anyone who simply wants a basic, American-style cup of coffee, this is perfectly fine. No, it's not as full-flavored or (arguably) as good as most of the higher priced Tassimo offerings, but it isn't intended to be. This is a simple, inexpensive cup for everyday use.<br /><br />That said, I knocked off a star due to Amazon's current pricing. The unit price for the "Friday Sale" is roughly the same as the individual retail price at many stores. That's not a deal -- and certainly doesn't represent the sort of discount one would expect to receive when buying a 5-pack.

review/summary: It's Terrible.
review/text: Do you remember what it smells like to add water to an ashtray full of cigarettes? That's how this coffee tastes. I added a caramel, some hazelnut flavoring, a packet of hot chocolate with miniature marshmellows, and Coffeemate vanilla chai creamer too it. It still tasted bitter, like wet cigarettes and metallic. I think the metallic flavor comes from the t-disc packaging. It doesn't make sense to buy a $100 coffee maker and drink trashy coffee. Especially when you can take that same amount of cash and buy some good coffee. I ignored the bad ratings of other reviewers because I believed the positive reviews. The only redeeming factors are that it is cheaper (less than $7 at Walmart), and that you can make a single cup of coffee. If it were allowed, I'd give it a -5 rating (or &lt;-> -,  for infinitly horrible).

review/text: ... nasty.  I may not be the best connoisseur of olives in the world, but I definitely buy my fair share, as Amazon can tell you.  I practically live on olives.  These, however, are soft to the point of slimy mush and just not tasty at all (like any slimy mush would have "taste").  I should have called Amazon and complained, but instead, I just cancelled my "Subscribe and Save" subscription.<br /><br />Nice jar, though.  The best olives I've had to date from Amazon are the Byzantine Pitted Country Olive Mix, 5-Pound Bag.  Now those are fantastic, but they do come in a bag.  So now I have a great storage jar to keep REAL olives!<br /><br />P.S.  In case you're missing my point, do NOT buy these olives unless you have a person in your life you REALLY don't like and want to give them a "gift" they're not likely to forget!  :>)

review/text: I'd never had these olives before and thought I'd give them a try.  I find them to be softer than I prefer, and definitely much saltier.  If you're planning on cooking with these (or putting them in a pasta as I am), you don't need to add any salt to your dish.  The container is great though!<br /><br />The container is labelled:  Refrigerate after opening.  I hadn't planned on refrigerating these, but perhaps I should.  Anyhow, if you're ordering them, make room in your fridge for a container about the size of a pickle jar from the bulk foods section.<br /><br />As far as flavor... try to imagine your standard green (Spanish) pimento-stuffed olive but using a a black olive.  These are not mild - very strong vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Nasty
review/text: Not only were these olives WAY too salty (yes, I did soak 'em for forty eight hours to remove the sodium) but they were also lacking in olive flavor. After soaking most of the salt out all that remained was the nasty vinegar flavor. Olives should NEVER be cured in vinegar!<br /><br />These olives were also pretty soft and mushy. I guess for folks who don't have any teeth and hate the flavor of olives they would be just fine.<br /><br />NT

review/summary: The Best Olives Ever!
review/text: I love the Alfonso olive.  I used to drive 45 mins each way for this olive.  Now I just order them here. This is a big meaty pitted olive with a beautiful eggplant color. They are salty as are all olives. I do the same thing with these as I sometimes do with pitted kalamata olives.  I empty the brine and then refill the container with spring water.  I save the brine to use for cooking instead of adding salt.  The olives soak in the clean spring water and come out less salty but still with all the wonderful olive flavor!

review/summary: Great Flavor but Bottle Top Hassle
review/text: I used it in a Moqueca which is a Brazilian Fish Stew, and it was very delicious. The problem I had was with the bottle top. The recipe called for 1/4 c of the oil. Unfortunately, I was unable to remove the plastic top which does not unscrew.  It just has a flip top cap with a single hole in it and ended up just shaking it by drops into the measuring cup which was messy and a hassle.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: I don't know why I bought this, honestly. Guess I was tired of my boyfriend's requests for my from-scratch macaroni and cheese, and needed a quick fix. Bad choice. First off, it really doesn't save you any time or effort. The mix requires you to make a roux (the seasoning mix included, which tastes like garbage fyi, is seasoned flour that you stir into melted butter.) The only thing different about making this or real macaroni is the cheese; they include a bag of plastic-tasting velveeta in the box. I would rather spend the extra 5 minutes making the good stuff. This stuff tastes awful, with that artificial taste that only kraft can provide.<br /><br />This product is ONLY suitable for lazy people with absolutely no taste. I wouldn't even give it to my dog.

review/summary: Best Artisan Cold-Pressed Chia Oil - great Omega 3 source - in Plastic Bottle
review/text: I love chia as it is such a nutrition powerhouse.  I am so glad more companies are making it available in oil form as Chia seeds contain about 32% Omega fatty acids which is very high and rare for a seed. They are 61% Omega-3 (ALA) and 20% Omega-6 (LA). What a great source of Omega without an unhealthy omega 3:6:9 ratio!  Chia seeds contain about 42% fiber; 5% soluble fiber and 36% insoluble fiber. Fiber is essential for a healthy gastrointestinal system and inhibiting constipation.  21% protein and are high is essential amino acids, the building blocks of protein, for healthy cellular function.  A serving of chia seeds (1Tbls) contains as much calcium as two cups of milk. The calcium in chia seeds aids in bone health as well as para-thyroid, liver and kidney function.  Chia seeds also provide iron, magnesium, potassium (equivalent to 3-4 bananas worth), Vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, phosphorus, manganese, copper, iron, molybdenum, niacin, zinc, naturally boost energy and are gluten-free.<br /><br />Chia compares very favorably to the other main sources of -3's:<br /><br />Flax: Today the main source of vegetable -3's among dietary supplements is flax seed or flax seed oils. However, flax seeds need to be milled for effective use in human '-3 absorption, and unfortunately after grinding, it becomes rancid very quickly. In addition, whole flax seed contains cyanogenic glycosides and a vitamin B antagonist, both toxins, making whole flax seed a poor health choice for omega-3 oil consumption. Flax seed oil also has its problems as a "health food" as it has been used for centuries to produce oil based paints and linoleum flooring (another common name for flax seed oil is linseed oil). Daily flax seed consumption in Europe is controlled due to its adverse effects or is banned as is the case in France where flax has been banned since the days of Napoleon.<br />Chia seed oil is much more stable than flax seed oil. In addition whole chia seed has no cyanogenic glycosides, does not require pre-milling and its seed is digestible without grinding. Like flax seed, chia also contains no gluten, however the protein levels in chia seed are much higher than those found in whole flax seed. Thus, if choosing a seed based high omega-3 oil, chia seed is the safe and healthy choice over flax. There are no limits to consumption of Chia.<br />Fish: Another important source of -3 is wild fatty sea fish (Herring Fish, Salmon, Tuna). Fish oils rich in this fatty acid contain from 20% to 30% Omega-3. In the best cases, only 1.5% of fish body weight is -3. Fish oil also contains nearly 80% saturated fat and its omega-3's are quite unstable. In addition, fish oil may contain environmental toxins such as methymercury and PCB's concentrated through the natural fish food chain, and natural high toxins from the fish liver. World fish stocks are declining and gloomy projections about ocean contamination increasingly raises questions about the safety of eating wild fish. Today many fish oils have to undergo molecular distillation to remove these known toxins and carcinogens.�  Many people refuse to eat fish oil based products of any kind including fish oil concentrates.<br /><br />Chia oil is a stable, non-toxic alternative to fish oil with the added benefit of suiting vegan consumers.<br /><br />Meat: Beef, chicken and pork have very little -3's (0.43%, 0.3% and 0.09%, respectively) and are therefore a poor source of these heart healthy oils.<br />Algae: Some algae contain relatively large amounts of -3. However, they also contain very large amounts of saturated fat Most Western diets do not include algae sources, however certain types of algae are useful sources of DHA, a brain and CNS functional omega-3.<br /><br />Chia oil is a better source of Omega-3 than algae as, in the body, Omega-3 reacts with enzymes and A) counter-balances the effects of Omega-6 in the body and B) creates DHA. Taking algae based DHA does give you it's benefits but does not give the overall benefits that Omega-3 does.<br /><br />Chia: Consumption of either fish or algae based oils can be completely avoided if a stable plant based omega-3 ALA, like Chia, is substituted for them, since it has been shown that ALA is readily converted in useful amounts in humans to both EPA and DHA. In addition, ALA is a strong feedback inhibitor of the highly inflammatory omega-6 metabolic pathway which leads to the extremely potent prostacyclins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes responsible for pain, stroke and immune response. Too much omega-6 in the diet has been heavily associated with heart attacks, strokes and over reactive cellular responses to inflammation stimuli. Consumption of either chia seed or chia seed oil provides a good balance of omega-3:6 ratio in a Western diet that far exceeds appropriate levels of omega-6 intake.<br /><br />While this Foods Alive Chia Seed Oil is very high quality - cold-pressed Artisan and is light and thriving, I wish that Foods Alive would make it available in Miron glass as this bottle is plastic.  Miron glass would add a pretty penny to the price but it is worth every cent.  As far as chia seed oils that are bottled in plastic, I do not think there is a better quality chia seed oil than Foods Alive.  5-stars

review/summary: Best Sencha I've Had
review/text: I don't have the bulk bag but I do have the smaller 3.5 OZ bag, but I'm pretty sure they're both the same. I make it a habit now of whenever I go to Seattle to pick up a bag or two from the Japanese Supermarket. When you open the bag there's a sweet, vegetal aroma that is emitted by the high quality leaves. When you drink it, it leaves a nice sweet/ vegetal aftertaste that makes this my favorite sencha. For the more tea enthusiasts; in my opinion, this tea rivals (or sometimes better) some gyokuro teas I've had and at a cheaper price (generally).

review/text: I drink this everyday and was happy to locate a source where I could purchase large bag in bulk.  This tea is a good everyday tea, the bulk tea has a better aroma than when is in the tea bags (tea bags contain fine, powdery tea whereas bulk is more full leaves).  No acidic bite, rather a smooth, Japanese tea without the harsh bitterness of a typical Chinese green tea.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: My bottle arrived early and I was very excited to have found a good moisturizer. My bottle says organic coconut oil, buy it's advertised as 'virgin' coconut oil. I tried doing a little research, and couldn't tell if there is a difference between virgin coconut oil and organic coconut oil. The oil does keep my skin hydrated, but it is greasy and I use it in small amounts. I mix a small amount with my regular lotion so it will absorb in my skin better. If I don't mix it, it takes a long time for my skin to absorb the oil. I'm guessing this will be perfect for the winter, so I'm looking forward to using it then. I read that coconut oil is supposed to help with eczema, but it doesn't do a lot for mine. It does help with the itching (I can go 5-8 hours without itching), but the rash hasn't gone away. I had better results from a natural oil mixture that I buy at the drug store. I don't like that I have to mix the oil with my regular lotion (I was hoping to replace my lotion altogether), but it keeps my skin hydrated better than my lotion alone or other products I've used alone. I'd recommend this product, I look forward to using it in the winter.

On a side note, you need to drink at least one bottle of water for every can of tea you drink. It's highly acidic, and can leave you feeling queezy if you do like I did and drink hardly anything else.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great product and well worth buying... just in moderation!

review/summary: More Salt than Smoke
review/text: Came in 3 nice-sized shakers, sealed.  Has a very strong scent of woodsmoke when opened, which gives a great smoky aroma to foods, however I don't find it to impart much smoke flavor.  But aroma can deceive the palate, so the heavy scent may be all some people need or want for that hint of smoke in their dishes.  It does not give off any of that chemical-fake aftertaste or oddness that comes from imitation/liquid smoke flavorings, which is also nice.  It is easy to over-salt with this, and after a few mishaps, I found that I need to use 2-3 shakes less what looks/feels right.  Overall, it makes a nice alternative to plain sea salt for added aroma.
