review/summary: It was a bit Dry
review/text: I wasn't blown away by the flavor. I thought it would be more banana-y, but it wasn't. It was also super dry. Not like the cookies. THe cookies were moist. I don't know this was not for me. I don't think I will be buying this product. I received this for free in my Influenster Summer Beauty Vox Box.

review/summary: Good Snack
review/text: This bar was soft and chewy. I did warm mine slightly in the microwave before eating. It had a very banana taste, but not your typical nut flavor as the undertone. It tasted more of almonds instead of pecans or walnuts.

review/text: This is pretty good for a bar. I love oats and oatmeal, so I knew I would like this. It's filling and kind of dense, but it doesn't taste like artificial flavors and sweeteners. I think it would be better warmed up, but I didn't think of that before I ate it.

review/summary: A Nice Little "Pick Me Up".
review/text: Being someone who actually does NOT like bananas, this was actually quite delicious. Though this product, among a few others, was sent to me for testing purposes compliments of Influentser through their "Summer Beauty Voxbox" program, I would say that this would be a nice "pick me up" snack on the go. Moreover, though I did eat half of it, I ended up warming up the other half of the soft baked banana nut bread bar in the microwave (as directed) and it tasted good as well! With all that being said, is this my "Holy Grail" of snacks (I'm actually not much of a snack person to begin with) and I cannot live without it? No, BUT if I happen to see this in the stores and I wanted to pick up something, I would re-purchase this item due to it being a "healthier" option, a nice size (in my opinion) and the taste of it is quite pleasant.

review/text: I thought this was just OK, not my favorite Quaker product and I don't know that I would actually buy it.  It does taste like banana bread a bit and it is soft, but it's also crunchy in some places.  Almost like it was overcooked.  I think I'll take nice warm homemade banana bread and if I need something quick I'll stick with quaker granola bars!

review/text: This bar was pretty good. I really taste homemade. I liked the nuts on the top added a little texture to the bite. I heated my bad up in the microwave for 10 seconds as recommended, tasted great. Good alternative if you dont like muffins which can be a little dry. This bar was nice and most. But if you dont like sweets in the morning..id steer clear.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006H34CUS">Quaker Soft Baked Cereal Bar, Banana Nut Bread, 7.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>  I received a small sample of Quaker Soft Baked Cereal Bar, Banana Nut Bread from Influenster.com, a site that offers free samples to people who they believe influence others. Mind you, I won't write a positive review about something I don't like, wouldn't buy or wouldn't use. I love swag, but my opinions can't be bought. So, having written that I must say that I love this bar. I am not a fan of snack bars in general, preferring to get my nutrition and calories from other foods. But this little bar had me changing my tune. It tasted freshly baked, was moist and chewy - as promised - and didn't make me feel guilty about indulging. The only thing that I regret is the fact that the sample was so small. But I'll rectify that when I visit Amazon.com to buy a box. Or two. Or three. Yeah, they were that good.

Since I first tried the Banana Nut Bread flavor I have went through 4 boxes. (In less than a month!) They are a healthy snack ranking in at only 140 calories with 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein. They are covered in almonds with a crunchy texture and smell so delightful. I love them so much! They are my new favorite treat! Trust me, go buy yourself a box and give them a try!

review/summary: Quaker makes amazing snacks!
review/text: I was so happy to get to try out this bar free through the Influenster Voxbox I got! I am definitely one of those people that goes to any type of snack bar when feeling a little empty in the stomach. My favorite brand of bars to purchase have always been Quaker so I was pleased to get to try out something new!<br /><br />My number one type of bars to have are always ones that are along the lines of granola, oats, nuts and such. However, I was so excited to see something that's like a compacted baked good! The flavor I got was of course Banana Nut Bread and I have never tried actual Banana bread but I liked this bar! I love how it included almonds on the top because like I said, I enjoy that! This bar was very soft and chewy which is definitely something I look for but it also had some crunchiness which I also like - it was all just very balanced! I'm not a huge fan of bananas necessarily but I think this tasted great! You definitely get an after taste hint of banana but it all just works really well. This is definitely like having Grandma's goodies on the go!<br /><br />Overall, I think these would be amazing as a quick breakfast or snack any day! This bar was great (Quaker never fails to please) and I will definitely be trying out some other baked bars they have!

So many bars are so hard they break your teeth, or they taste kind of like cardboard with a grainy texture. These soft bars are really something I could get used to. Too bad there was only one in the box because my husband snagged more than half of it. I have not found it on the shelf yet, but hope to soon.

review/text: If you like banana bread, then you will love this bar! It's pretty soft and chewy, with lots of flavoring. It is a little too sweet for my liking (but then again I am not a big fan of banana nut anything in general). The nuts don't overpower the bar taste, which is good! The price is a little high but I do think you get what you pay for - especially since it is a very healthy product.

It also contains 5g of fiber content -- that is 20% of the RDA of fiber!!  Most people don't get the recommended 25-30g of fiber per day, so this is an excellent way to increase your fiber intake easily because it tastes so good!

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious
review/text: I know very few people who dislike banana nut bread. I also know very few people who can make a really good banana nut bread. One problem I do have with banana nut bread is self control. This bar is a fix for all those things. All of the taste and enjoyment of banana nut bread in a perfect portion, packaged perfectly for an on-the-go snack.<br /><br />Trick! Warm it up in the microwave for 10-12 seconds (13 or more and you will burn yourself terribly) and this transforms from a simple snack to a wonderful, healthy desert.

review/text: I tried Quaker's Soft Baked Bar in Banana Nut Bread from my Summer Beauty VoxBox by Influenster for breakfast.  I thought it was okay tasting, it wasn't that sweet. It also looked different compared to the official picture. Maybe it was just the one I received that looked like that. The one thing I forgot to do, however, was to warm it up. It probably would have tasted better if I did. It's okay for whenever you're in too much of a hurry to stop for a snack. It's small enough too.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised By This Delicious Snack
review/text: I received a Quaker Banana Nut Bread Soft Baked Bar in my Summer Influenster Vox Box for product testing purposes.  I received the bar free to try, and am not getting paid for my review.<br /><br />I did not have high expectations of this snack because I generally don't like banana flavoring and most of the time when I try a pre-packaged bar or cookie type snack I find it to have an undesireable texture, usually too soft with a greasy aftertaste.  But I do like nuts and this snack seemed to have an abundance of them.  First, I have to say that this is a perfect sized snack for on the go.  It can be eaten either straight out of the package and cold, or can be warmed up.  I had mine straight out of the package.  What I thought upon first bite was that this bar has a really nice texture.  It was not soft and soggy like I expected.  It had a crunch to it, and was just the right amount of firmness.  The taste was very nutty, with the banana flavoring present and you could also taste the oats in there as well.  The banana taste was not overpowering, which was what I feared.  I think the bar also had just the right amount of sweetness.  It wasn't too rich or too bland.  I knew after my third bite I'd be looking for these in the store.  I'm happy to say this snack did not leave the greasy feeling in my mouth when I was finished eating it.<br /><br />Each bar has 140 calories, and while I would prefer it to be a little lower, it does have 5g of dietary fiber and 50g of protein which I feel makes up for it.  I would say this is a nutritious snack that I will personally enjoy in the morning for breakfast, during the day while on the go (this is perfect for carrying around in your purse or even out in your car because heat won't melt the bar, it may even taste better heated up), and I think it will be a great snack to have at bedtime as well.  I'm planning on trying the other flavor of Cinnamon Pecan Bread after I finish the box of Banana Nut Bread flavor I just bought at the grocery store.  And I have yet to try this Banana Nut Bread flavor warmed, which I look forward to.  I think many people will enjoy this snack and should definitely give it a try.<br /><br />Thank you Influenster and Quaker for sending me this tasty snack to try.  I'm a fan now!

review/text: Received this complimentary by Influenster for testing purposes! I must say, I LOVED it. I am a picky eater so I never try out new food. I must admit, I was hesitant at first. However, after that first bite, I do not regret opening this package at all! :D It was crunchy and the taste was amazing. On top of that, it's healthy. I recommend this 100%

review/text: I didn't love this as much as i had wanted to. The box said that they use actual banana but it tasted very fake and overpowering to me...i don't know, maybe the bananas used to make the bar that I ate were a little over ripe. I liked the idea, and i bet some of their other flavors would be better.

review/text: Oh...one huge word for these YUM!  I was surprised at how good this tasted. I got a free sample of these to try.  I've always liked and trusted Quaker products, but still was wondering how good a soft baked bar would taste in a wrapper.  We tried it heated up and cold.  Heated was better, but eating it cold was great also.  For those watching calories..the count is not bad at all (or so I think in my opinion).  The first time we went grocery shopping after trying this we bought a box of these and a box of their other flavor Cinnamon Pecan Bread.  Both are very tasty.  Nice little treat to keep in your pocketbook or pack in the kids lunch kits.

review/text: Quaker's soft baked Banana Nut bread is delicious! Gave it a 10sec spin in the microwave and enjoyed an extremely tasty, warm treat to start the day. Banana nut bread is a personal fav dessert for me, but generally high sugar/calorie--this bar has a good weight and taste for just 140 calories, 5g of fiber, and 6g of protein. This turned out to be a surprisingly tasty AND healthy breakfast or snack option. Definitely going to pick up another box or two on my grocery run this week.

review/text: I received a sample of the Banana Nut Bread Soft Baked Bar in my Summer VoxBox from Influenster and they were delicious! It really did taste like homemade banana nut bread. The texture was chewy with just the perfect amount of crunch from the slivers of almonds.  They were nice and moist, similar to the consistency of a muffin, but nowhere near as messy.  They were so good I went and bought a box the next day! I found they were reasonably priced, with 5 bars coming in a box. Who would have thought something so good, could be healthy? Try them heated up in the microwave for a tasty treat!

review/text: I recently received one of these bars in my VoxBox for review purposes and really quite enjoyed it. I am not a banana person at all but like almonds so figured I would test it out and am glad I did. I wouldn't have picked a box of these up in the grocery store but since having tried one, I have purchased three boxes. I prefer to microwave for 10 seconds since the bar tastes better heated up. It is also a bit crunchy and isn't overpowering in flavour. The size is perfect to carry around in a purse and you can keep some in your car or to travel with.<br /><br />The bar also contains traces of coconut and pecans but I don't like either and you can't even taste these ingredients.

review/text: I was a little wary trying these because I don't like dense, chewy bars that hurt your jaw to eat, and that's what I really thought this was going to be. I couldn't have been more wrong! I bit into it and got a crunch from the almonds on top and (I had to check the ingredients) soy crisps inside! I received one bar as a sample and went out and bought an entire box that same week! However, even though on the package it says that it tastes great heated up, I didn't like it. Heated up it lost the crunch and seemed to become that dreaded chewy bar. I still give this product 5 stars though because heating it up is definitely not something that you have to do!

review/summary: Quaker Soft Baked Banana Nut Bar
review/text: I received a sample of the banana nut bars from Influenster's voxbox program. I loved them and went to buy more. hey're my new favorite post workout snack, especially after 90 minutes of hot yoga. I'm usually really hungry after this particular brand of yoga, but consuming anything too heavy makes me somewhat nauseous. This also tastes a lot better than some other snack bars I've consumed recently.<br /><br />I've been nomming upon the banana nut bread flavor. It tastes like real banana (unlike overly sacharin fake banana) and banana is fairly high up on the ingredient list after some grains and soy, nuts and sweetener. They aren't as good as homemade banana bread, but if I wanted them to taste exactly like that I'd make bread or go to a bakery. These are a tasty and more convenient option for me to grab when I'm on the go.

It does taste just like a banana nut muffin, this bar was moist and soft. My husband loved the bar as well. I would take this bar on the go or just have as a snack. It was filling with a cup of coffee, i will be purchasing more. yummy!

review/summary: Yummy snack
review/text: These taste just like a brand of oatmeal bars they has a while back. They are rather delicious. If you love bananas and nuts then this is the snack for you. Tho I must say, they are rather small, which kinda sucks. But still they're yummy, and they satisfied my sweet tooth.

review/summary: Quaker always good
review/text: My sister 'volunteered' to be the taste tester(due to my banana allergy) and like it very much. She said it tasted just like a CLIF bar (which to me is not good as I donot like the taste of those bars either). I have to check my local grocery store to see what other flavors Quaker makes. This would be great to take to school or work for a quick snack but maybe better as a part of a complete breakfast. Each bar can also be warmed up in the microwave for 10 seconds, it may taste more like a muffin.

review/text: I split this with my father because I wasn't sure if I would love it since it had bananas in it. I should have kept it all to myself! It tasted JUST like banana nut bread! Yum!! Hopefully they come out with a zucchini bread one next lol.<br />Anyways, this is a great snack and don't be turned off by the name, the taste does it justice!

review/text: These are delicious and perfect for on-the-go! I'm not a big "breakfast" person, but definitely still need something on my stomach in the morning. These bars are just enough to get me started for the day and easy enough to carry out the door as I'm running off to work. They also work great as an afternoon snack when I'm wanting to reach for something junky.<br /><br />The consistency is a bit dry.. but that's pretty standard across all cereal bars. It's not "legit" banana bread, but it's good enough to get an A- from me!

review/text: I was thrilled when I received this bar to try from Influenster and found that it contains a lot of protein for something that tastes so good!  It was the perfect evening treat when I needed a boost but really wanted to eat dessert.  Since I am hypoglycemic, I'm always on the lookout for something with staying power that doesn't taste like cardboard...will definitely be coming back for more of these!

review/summary: So Delicious!
review/text: It is soo good! It taste like the real deal but much healthier and not as sweet. I am really picky when it comes to the taste of banana bread because a lot of them are so sweet you need to down it with milk. I am lactose-intolerant so I can not down any milk. Quaker Soft Baked Banana Nut Bar gave me an alternative decision! I loved this right next to my Strawberry SoyJoy! I am sort of a health nut and I really like the "healthy" taste if you understand what I am trying to say. This one does taste "healthy," but the overall taste of banana nut bread is still there. These are convenient and good on the go! Definitely good for college students!

review/text: It says on the packaging that it tastes great when heated in the oven. And I believe it. It's pretty much a healthier banana nut muffin but in a square. Now, the bar was a little dry when I tried it but probably because it was sitting in the hot car for a few hours before I ate it. But I'm sure with a glass of milk, this would be a real treat. Great for on the go!

review/text: I received a complimentary sample of the Banana Nut Bread from Influenster. I had tried both the banana nut bread and cinnamon roll bars before and loved them so I was excited to get them. They taste great and are a nice break from granola bars. If you heat them up in the microwave for a few seconds you get a "fresh from the oven" taste.

review/text: I received a sample through influenster.com and shared it with my 3 year-old. It was very delicious and wanted more. When I saw them at Target I purchased 2 boxes and was upset when everyone else in the house ate them before I could get one. The cinnamon roll is really good too! This is totally Quaker quality and healthy!!!
