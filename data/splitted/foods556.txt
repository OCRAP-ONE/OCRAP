review/text: After visited the UK to taste this salad cream, I was disappointed to find out Amazon did not have it available but from the other sellers at very high price. I kept checking and found today that it became available for Amazon subscription! This salad cream remind me of salad dressing that I tasted when I was a child, a bit sweet and creamy. This makes an ordinary salad extraordinary! It makes me look forward to eat more vegetables!

review/text: My mother put a bottle of this salad cream in my luggage when I went home to Belize a year and a half ago. Found it when I was unpacking and we quickly finished it. Then last week, I found it at Publix here in Atlanta. Only $6.00!! They had two bottles left and I bought them both. I will buy it every time I see that they have it in stock. I love this stuff!

review/summary: Simply Delicious!
review/text: I have to tell you, after tasting this salad dressing in the UK I was 100% addicted to it.  It's delicious as well as a sandwich spread or in tuna or egg salad.  There's a hint of mustard and sugar and vinegar in it which gives it a great tangy taste that once you try it you just want more and more of it.  The pricepoint on Amazon when you buy a half dozen on them is better than in the UK!  Highly recommended product and wish they made it the USA too.

review/summary: Delicious! But why the massive price increase?
review/text: Yes, you can use this for salads, but it makes chicken sandwiches delicious, and is also a wonderful dip for fries (throw away your ketchup!). How good does it taste? Well, my 6 year old son, who normally runs away screaming from any green vegetables, begs me to give him lettuce or other green vegetables when they have been tossed with salad cream. Heinz, why don't you sell this in the USA? You would make a fortune. Thank you Amazon for this great 6 pack.<br /><br />Edit (April 2011): The price has recently increased 66%, which is very disappointing. I've lowered my rating to 3 stars because this is no longer good value.<br /><br />Edit (Jan 2012): The price has come back down again to what it was originally. Thank you Amazon! Back to 5 stars again!

review/summary: One Taste and I Was Hooked!
review/text: My mom was from England and I have made many ventures across the pond and each time I always looked forward to English sandwiches with Heinz Salad Cream. On my first trip in 1973 I had Heinz Salad Cream on a sandwich prepared by my aunt. I fell in love with the taste right away!<br /><br />It has a totally different taste from mayonnaise or salad dressing. It is wonderfully unique. I have tried it on salads and sandwiches and loved them both. I recommend this to anyone who likes mayonnaise or salad dressing and wants to try something different.<br /><br />Used to be, it was had to find anywhere in the USA. I used to bring back a dozen bottles each trip. Thanks to the Internet and better international selections in stores, it is easier to find.<br /><br />I agree that Heinz should market this product in the USA. It is sensational!

review/summary: great and delicious!
review/text: i bought these since my raw cacao powder that i usually buy from alive and aware was out of stock, i thought what the hey this is a GREAT price. but like another reviewer said, seems almost too good to be true.<br />although they are a little greyer in color than the picture which shows a richer dark brownish cacao nibs, they still tasted great.<br />in fact, i was really surprised by how delicious they are straight out of the bag. yes they are a tab bitter, as you would expect raw (unsweetened) cacao to be, but i was pleasantly surprised that they were totally edible this way, sort of like chomping on a roasted coffee bean but actually not that bitter even. my husband and i can nibble on a small palmful, plain, and like it that way.<br />but of course it is a little better with something sweet ;) i like it in a snack mix of raw cashews (naturally sweet and mild- a great compliment to cacao nibs) with large coconut flakes, and if i add some dried fruit it is REALLY heavenly!!<br />i am so glad i can eat my cacao without the usual sugar over load.<br />i even suggest brewing it like loose leaf tea in a strainer, and you can re-use the "grounds" a few times. sweeten if you like, maybe add a little good raw cream, and it is better than coffee and better for you to boot!<br />i am a total cacao-holic now.  5 lbs is NOT too much, so go for it!! we use over a pound a month between mostly my husband and i ( okay we give some to our two small children, just not too much!). i also LOVE to share this great blessing from Mother nature :)<br />i hesitated to give this the full 5 stars, because like i said, i think the color indicated slightly less than the freshest quality . but it is a high 4 stars, and i still totally recommend it, especially at this price.<br /><br />you will LOVE it!! peace be with you!

review/summary: Excellent Product at incredible price
review/text: Taste: These nibs taste a bit bitter just as they should because they contain no sugar and are raw unprocessed cacao. Cacao is considered a super food because of all the vast array and quantity of nutrients they contain and this is exactly the way to eat them to get the maximum benefit. My husband can eat them straight out of the bag but if you need a little sugar with your cacao like I do you could try this: I melt some dark chocolate, stir in about equal amount of cacao nibs and place teaspoonfuls onto a nonstick surface. Place in frig and when hardened, put them in a container and stash in the frig. The taste is really good, some lightly sweetened melt-in-your-mouth chocolate with crunchy cacao nibs for a great texture contrast. You could also add them to a shake if you have a really good quality blender. You could also do a search for recipes on the internet and you'll find all kinds of ideas.<br /><br />Quantity: Just right, enough to make it worth the free shipping but not too much that you can't consume it before it looses it's freshness. My husband and I can easily go through a lb or more a month.<br /><br />Quality: Excellent, they look and taste just like the nibs I purchased from whole foods a few months ago.<br /><br />Price: Excellent, only a fraction of the price you'll pay at a grocery store or other online sources.<br /><br />Shipping: Prompt, well packaged.

review/summary: LIARS!!!!  This is not raw cacao!
review/text: If you've ever had raw cacao nibs, you should realize immediately that these nibs are roasted.  I contacted the seller about this, and here is what I said, and how they responded:<br /><br />Me:<br />Hi.  I received 5 lbs. of Cacao nibs yesterday, but they are not raw like I ordered.  These distinctively smell and taste like roasted nibs.  After I noticed this, I looked at the bag.  The label says that it is Organic, but doesn't mention being raw (Organic, Herbal Essence Cacao Nibs).  Do you want to send me some raw nibs or give me a refund?<br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /><br />Them:<br />Raw Nibs are so bitter if not roasted, All cacao nibs have to be roasted at low temperature.<br />All our customers love them, try it, if you chose not to use it, fine please return the 5 lbs bag for a refund.<br />thank you<br />imed<br /><br />So, they've decided that since raw nibs don't taste as good, they're going to roast them.  (Why not throw in some cream and sugar while you're at it?  They taste really good like that!).  It's fine if you want to roast them, just don't market them as raw!<br />But, I decided to give them the benifit of the doubt.  Maybe they "roast" their cacao at a low enough temperature to still be considered raw.  I emailed them back:<br /><br />Me:<br />At what temperature do you roast your cacao?<br /><br />Them:<br /> below 80 degrees.<br /><br />Below 80 degrees?  That's gotta be celsius right?  A quick conversion tells me they roast their supposedly raw cacao at 175 degrees.  That's not raw by any standard.<br />I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt one more time.  They did say that "all cacao nibs have to be roasted..."  So I emailed Navitas Naturals about their raw cacao nibs (I was eating Navitas nibs before trying these).  Navitas processes their cacao below 118 degrees, making their cacao truly raw.  Halaleveryday is clearly a shady company who should not be trusted.  Yes, these nibs taste better than raw nibs, but you're not buying raw cacao for the taste.  I advise staying away from Halaleveryday, Alive and Aware, and Herbal Essence products.<br /><br />How are these roasted nibs?  They taste much more like chocolate than raw cacao does, and are much crispier and easier to chew.  There are definitely some hard pieces (pieces of shell, I assume?), so watch out for your teeth if you decide you can trust this company enough to eat their products.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I was apprehensive about investing in a whole five pounds, as I wasn't sure of the quality. (A few mentions of "grey" color, etc.) But the price was so right! I had been getting a quality product from Wilderness Family Naturals, but it was considerably pricier. PLUS shipping. So I went for it- ordered the 5 lb. "Alive and Aware Organic Raw Cacao Nibs" off of Amazon.<br />As a cacao nib connoisseur, I can say these are perfect. Read up, if you've never ordered nibs before, because these won't be just like eating a candy bar only healthier. No, nibs are unique. They are going to be a tad bitter, and yes, maybe the crunch is a bit unlovely for some.<br />But for cacao-nib-lovers, these are every bit as good and fresh and tasty (and rightfully colored) as any I've ever gotten. Only difference: All the rest have cost a lot more.<br />Go for it, I say! Order these! Keep the extra in the fridge (I suppose you could even freeze 'em), and they'll keep months. Yum...

review/text: These are a fantastic product. I first bought them because they were cheaper than Nativas, but I prefer them.  The pieces are larger which is better for me because I snack on them.  I don't use them for cooking or smoothies.  I love the taste and texture.  I seriously can't stop eating them. If you're thinking they'll taste just like dark chocolate you'll probably be disappointed.  It's very apparent they're the source of chocolate, but they're definitely more bitter than even a very dark chocolate.  My only concern is that I eat a lot of them and they're loaded with saturated fat.  1 ounce has 35% of your daily value of fat and 130 calories.  I went through a 5lb bag in 3 weeks.  I'm afraid to do the math.  I just ordered another bag but I'm definitely going to slow down on them. - I just did the math and I hope I'm wrong - that's almost 4 oz. a day.  140% of my daily saturated fat and 520 calories.  Yikes!

I later transferred the nibs to another container and weighed the empty plastic bag; it was .95 ounces so I was shortchanged almost 3 ounces of nibs.

review/text: I have only eaten a few handfuls of these but have already bitten down on 3 pebbles.  I almost broke my teeth!  These cacao nibs also contain a lot of hard shells .  Also, I could tell by the taste that they were roasted.  The whole reason I bought them was because they claimed to be organic and raw.  With all this deception, now I'm wondering if they're even organic.  They do taste pretty good, though not as good as the truly raw nibs I bought before because the roasting imparts a slightly charred flavor.

I love sauce but ended up spitting out the noodles because they were just awful.  And though I love salt....this product was mostly salt.

I like the consistency of the noodles, the convenience of the product and love the fact that I can have these on hand in my pantry and they don't require refrigeration for storage.<br /><br />The only negative about the product - and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars - is the fact that I have problems peeling back the covering after heating. I am a senior citizen with limited strength in my fingers. The product requires brute strength to peel back the covering and I have to resort to scissors every time. The scissors or knife get messy and sometimes I end up with part of the chicken & noodles all over my countertop.

review/summary: One of the better Hormel meals
review/text: The chicken and noodle is definitely one of the better meals in the Hormel line. It is a little bit salty but no where near the saltiness many of the red meat meals have. The noodles are nice and thick (a previous reviewer described them as hard but mine were exactly as they should be even with the extra thickness) and the chicken is fairly substantial. If this were less calories and way less sodium, I think I like it enough where I might actually have this once in a while for a really quick lunch. But unfortunately 1400mg of sodium is way more than what I'm looking for in a lunch. Even still though, this is a pretty tasty one for Hormel.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison.

The veggies are a good size. The sauce is delicious. I add a little black pepper and mix it all in and have a great, filling, inexpensive, and FAST meal! Love 'em!!!

review/summary: Much too salty!!!!!
review/text: I am a senior whom is disabled enough to not be able to cook as I once did.  The Hormel Compleats are a godsend for me.  This one is especially good, and I shall be ordering it on a regular basis.  There is one problem, however, and it is common to all the Compleats: there is entirely too much sodium in them.  I am having a time with my feet swelling.  It is a real shame when you consider how difficult it is for us seniors to have to re-adjust our ways of doing the simplest of things.  We should be able to depend upon time-tested brands like Hormel and Campbell's to supply us with reliable products.

review/text: We get the very good "Snacking Nuts" directly for the warehouse store that uses Kirkland as it's store brand. These contain 24 individually packaged (8 each) 2oz sized servings of Roasted & Salted Cashews, Dry Roasted & Salted Almonds, and Roasted & Salted Peanuts.<br /><br />The 2oz is perfect of an afternoon snack or take along on a car trip. The nuts were fresh tasting and not over salted.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: I wanted to like them...
review/text: The thing is they taste stale to me all of the varieties that came in the box. It was not a seller issue because the expiration dates aren't until April & March of 2013, but nonetheless.  Kirkland usually has great products, but won't be purchasing them again.  We'll find another alternative.  They are salty, not as bad as most pre-packaged nuts. Wish they could just roast and barely drop some salt in, but alas the answer is to put the work in and shell my own.

review/summary: Nuts arrived past their "best by" date
review/text: I bought these as part of my husband's Father's Day gift and wrapped them without scrutinizing them carefully.  When he opened them today, we found that they were already past the "best by" date of April 21, 2012.  He told me he'll eat them anyway or I would have requested a replacement.  Seller shouldn't be shipping product which is past its "best by" date.  Additional feedback posted 6/18/12: Wow! I didn't even contact amazon customer service--all I did was post this review.  When I opened my email this morning there was a notification from amazon that they had refunded the full purchase price on these nuts.  That's what I call proactive customer service!  With service like that I can order new products with confidence, and will do so again!!!

review/summary: Good Nutrition. Good Taste. Not Too Salty. Just Right Size.
review/text: Nuts are a major part of my diet and I've found one of the best sources at my local Costco Warehouse store. The problem is that they always occur in huge-sized bags or jars. Well, the last time I was there I spotted a 48 oz (3 pounds) box of Kirkland Signature Variety Snacking Nuts packaged as peanuts, almonds and cashews in 24 individual 2.0-oz bags. Perfect. I use individual bags for my lunch, for a snack, for taking along hiking or camping or for giving to my little boy (3.5 years old). Just right! The bags could be opened as needed and need no turn the whole batch stale. Besides, these are three of my favorite nuts. Good Taste. Good nutrition. Not too salty. Just right.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Slightly Disappointed - Inconsistent
review/text: My son has always loved these bars and we were getting a box about weekly from the grocery store.  I looked them up on Amazon and was excited to see that I could essentially get a box or two free by buying a case versus the individual boxes.  The problem is that many of the boxes had bars that were not the same consistancy as my son was used to and they just fell apart or had what he called syrup on them.  I am not sure if they were stored differently which caused issues or what but I was very disappointed.  I know my son threw numerous bars away when he had been begging to eat them up to this point.  I am hoping I just got a bad case but I am not sure whether to order again.  Before this experience I would have given the product 4 or 5 stars.  Based on this case maybe a 2 so I averaged it.

review/text: These bars are great but recently they changed packagaing and style, I get why less waste, better for the environment, etc.  But unfortunately for me, my autistic son recognized that they changed the packagaing and refuses to eat them now.  He used to love them and I also noticed the bar is more compact now and texture is different.  I still think they are good but unfortunately I will have to take them off my auto delivery service since they were purchased for my son.  The Bars were already delicious I just wish they wouldn't have changed them.  But I do recommend these they are delicious.

review/summary: EnviroKids Berry Bars are a livesaver
review/text: Both of my children are gluten free and we are always looking for easy and delicious snacks to get us through the day. I am a big fan of EnviroKids products, including the Crispy Rice Berry Bars. They are soft and chewy, with little bits of fruit. My kids eat these up and I feel okay with them eating these on an almost daily basis because they have so many natural ingredients. The only drawback is that they can get messy-- my two-year-old especially tends to hold on to them too long and the rice cereal starts to come apart and get stuck in the carpet, clothes, etc. Still a great gluten free product!

review/text: These are very tasty bars.  They have enough dried berries to taste, and I usually get at least one with every bite.  It is a sweet bar, kind of like a Rice Krispie Treat, but not quite as sticky.  They're soft and stay fresh for a long time, too.<br /><br />I love the organic ingredients, always feel good about eating foods without synthetic pesticides or other crap like that.<br /><br />These bars don't have high fructose corn syrup, thank goodness, so right there tells you they're worth the cost.  They do contain invert cane juice, which is 1/2 fructose, so if you have a fructose intolerance, use caution because of that ingredient.<br /><br />I highly recommend these, especially for those on a gluten-free diet.

I have it as a breakfast bar, snack, dessert, and it's only only 110 calories (something I now have to watch due to weight gain).  Chocolate & peanut butter flavors are great as well.

review/text: Although they are obviously marketed to kids, my husband and I keep these around all the time. We take them with us when we go hiking for a quick snack (he prefers the peanut butter). Also, they are only 2 points on Weight Watchers so they fit in our diets and I prefer them to treats with artifical sweetners and loads of chemicals. I try to stick with organic as much as possible so appreciate that aspect, too. They don't have much fiber, but I consider them a treat so it's ok. For more fiber, I recommend LaraBars and ReBars. They are both excellent products, but not as much of a "sweet treat" as Envirokidz bars.

review/text: We've tried these bars several times in a few different flavors and they are always cross contaminated with dairy.  I think the chocolate actually contains milk so that may be the source of the problem. My kid's allergic so it's pretty easy to tell when a new food is causing a problem.<br /><br />They're delicious and the times we've tried them they are never stale or too hard to chew (like the other natural crispy rice bar that is actually dairy free).  Wish they didn't have a cross contamination problem.

review/text: I also had ordered these bars and had my ordered cancelled. They had the money pending out of my bank account, and had sent an e-mail stating that this item was on back order and should ship within 7-10 days. Then, a couple days later,  they decided they had listed the wrong price so they cancelled their orders. They should not have sent out an e-mail stating they were backordering when that was a lie (they obviously have no problem today having it in stock). I will not order from this company again...

I believe that the item was posted at a too low price and Amazon or Vitamin shoppe couldn't keep up with the volume of orders.  Very disappointed.

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: I give this product two stars because there are no artificial ingredients and it is 75% organic. That is all it has going for it.<br />I'm trying to go "all natural" and "organic" with all my purchases. I saw this for about $5 for the five pack and since the price was comparable to the Velveeta version (which is far from "all natural") I bought it.<br />Stirring the cheese sauce into the leftover water from cooking the macaroni took a few minutes. I did not time it, but it was more than two minutes. My son would not eat it. I made myself a package. It tastes kind of like macaroni with Cheetos powder on it (although I think Cheetos powder would taste better). I wound up melting a piece of organic American Cheese on it and stirring that in to make it palatable.<br />I think I'm going to try to figure out how to microwave a small amount of regular macaroni then melt cheese on it in the microwave to make my own macaroni and cheese.<br />This product was a big fail in my household.<br />This is the first Annie's product that I have tried that I did not like. Before trying this stuff, I was 100% satisfied with Annie's products.

review/summary: not as good as regular annies
review/text: I am a huge fan of the original annie's pasta meals, so when this came out I thought it was a good idea. However, it was poorly executed. When you use the recomended amount of water, its to water, even after 10 mintues of sitting. Too little, your noodles will clump together and get undercooked. Obviously they didn't test this product enough. Stick to original annie's!

review/text: Have enjoyed Annie's White Mac & Cheese very much, but this microwavable variety is more trouble than its worth.  You must use a very deep & wide bowl to use in the microwave or the water will boil over and you'll be left with very hot, uncooked macaroni in the bowl and a starchy mess in the microwave.  It is much easier to make the conventional variety in a pot!

review/text: I bought the Annies Homegrown Microwaveable Mac-n-cheese.  Actually my wife bought it because it is so-called "healthy".  It was hands down the worst macncheese I have ever tasted, and after trying it, I would be loathe to try any more Annies products.  It had a nasty plastic-like aftertaste, I had to rinse my mouth out.<br />I am throwing away the remaining 4 packets because I would not feed the crap to my cat!  This is a definite DON'T BUY IT!

review/summary: Not as good as the white cheddar!
review/text: This is an easy lunch for a vegetarian, but the cheese flavor is better with the white cheddar variety.  Also, it says to use 1/2 cup of water, and it really needs about 1 cup if you even want half a chance of stirring the powdered cheese into the noodles, it is way too dry without more water.  I've started eating Annie's instead of Velveeta, which I used to eat regularly, because of the organic noodles.

I was in quite a hurry, but I was starving, and the rest, as they say, is history! It's a very good breakfast on the run, and its great for kids, as well. I doubt the company would market it as such, but if it's good in the evening, it should be just as good in the morning!<br /><br />Yum!

review/summary: Good for a quick meal, but not always quite right
review/text: My kids have been asking for some quick fix mac 'n cheese, and I bought this.  The kids have been eating it, but they say that there is a slightly weird aftertaste.  When prepared following the directions, the noodles sometimes aren't quite cooked, and the water ratio isn't quite right --- sometimes ending up with inadequate water to make the sauce. Perhaps that's my microwave, but I haven't noticed this problem with other foods.  The powder sauce packet doesn't mix well even with the hot bits of water, leaving clumps.  The pluses --- quick to make, kids will eat it (sometimes), portions are small -- perfect for a preschooler, requires no milk or added oil.  We are satisfied for the amount we paid, but not likely to purchase again, unless there is a promotion or sale.

When I saw that Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6),<br /><br />was on Amazon.com, I said goodbye to the real world, and hello to the guy with the big package.  I would advise everyone to throw their lives away and click the "buy this product" for Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) immediatly, if not sooner.<br /><br />While they are at it they should go and buy Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and also Amish Style Roll Butter to compliment your Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6), with Ener-G Foods Papa's Loaf, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6) (for your Amish Style Roll Butter, of course.)<br /><br />I can personally say that this is easy to make, first you place your Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) into a thing of boiling water.  Then you grab your Ener-G Foods Papa's Loaf, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6), then grab your Amish Style Roll Butter and spread on about 8 ounces of this bad boy.  Then grab a cup and pour in some Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, for delicious whole milk flavor of course.<br /><br />I also can personally say that Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6), saved my family.  My husband was beginning to get aggravated from having to actually go over to Flow's food for his Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6), then we saw it on Amazon.com, and we've been happily married for five hours.<br /><br />So in conclusion, buy this item immediately, who needs a life when you have Amazon.com?

review/summary: Best coffee I ever tasted!
review/text: I was introduced to fine coffee in the early 1980s when I lived in San Francisco.  Ever since then, Celebes Kalossi has been my daily bean with Jamaica Blue Mountain or Kona Fancy as a special Holiday treat.  But Wow!  This Kopi Luwak puts even these three fine coffees to shame.  Kopi Luwak has been on my "bucket list" for tasting ever since I saw the Nicholson/Freeman movie of note.  I made it according to the instructions:  10.0 grams of medium fine grind to 6.0 oz of filtered water.  Stir it; let it sit for a couple of minutes; strain it into a second cup.  Mmmm...Pure, strong, rich coffee flavor with not a trace of bitterness.  When the cup is gone, the aftertaste lasts and lasts.  A really great coffee and I am glad to have made its acquaintance.

review/summary: Sweet clean taste, very pretty flower
review/text: My 12-year old daughter and I have just found tea flowers, and wanted to try a tea that wasn't heavy with black tea leaves.  This tea is very refreshing and lovely tasting.  The strawberry flavor is truly delicious without being overpowering.  We did use some honey to sweeten it a bit, but the second cup I drank was unsweetened, and it was nice too.  The flower opened up nicely and was attractive, which is important when you buy tea flowers, as the visual is part of the ceremony.  I would buy this tea flower again, and will.  I recommend this as an afternoon tea with cookies or a morning tea with a light breakfast.  It won't be strong enough to stand against a heavy meal. It is also good as just a tea without a side at all.
