review/summary: My kids LOVE them
review/text: When I found out two of my children were allergic to dairy and eggs, it was quite an adjustment.  Fortunately, we found Nana's Fudgy Wudgy Bars fairly soon after their diagnoses.  The kids think they are delicious, and I love them as a parent because they are a bit healthier than most "treats".  They are also conveniently packaged so that if we go to a birthday party, the kids can just grab a bar, and take it with them so they aren't left out when cake is served.  I give a package to their teachers too at the beginning of the year so that if there are any special occassions celebrated at school, my kids still get their treat.  The fact that my kids consider them a special treat, they must really be yummy, although I have yet to try them myself.  BTW, we tried a few other flavors of Nana's bars and cookies, but this one is the only one my kids like (or should I say love).

review/summary: NOT GLUTEN FREE!
review/text: After eating this product, I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet. Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.<br /><br />For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind:<br />1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining.<br />2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.<br />3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis.<br />In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it!<br />Don't eat Nana's products!<br /><br />Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamela's chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites.

It is very important to me what ingredients are in the foods I purchase. I am not happy with Amazon's business this time. Ingredients change often! Amazon needs to keep up to date with the ingredients if they are going to have them listed on their website.

review/summary: Great New Flavor from Amazon
review/text: This is a great new flavor in a bulk type bag.  Each one makes two gallons and is great for big families or parties.  I live by myself and use a tablespoon to make a 1/2 gallon pitcher full.  I might add more powder if I want to use a lot of ice in my glass (as I have been doing this awful hot summer) so that the drink remains strong enough to enjoy and not get too watery.  I like to make my own flavors and have added some of the wild strawberry to some of the crystal light teas to create another good drink.  I would like to see even more flavors packed this way so I can experiment with new combinations.

review/text: I am not a huge coffee drinker but I need some caffeine every once and a while. This is alright. It does taste like hot chocolate but on the largest cup setting it tastes like chocolate water. The middle setting is alright but I feel it tastes the best on the smallest cup size. Sometime I will mix 2 of the small cups together to get a decent size drink. I am a fan of the Cafe Escapes line as they taste very good and don't make a mess while making. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a small drink!

I subscribed to this product so I could save money and I'm so glad Amazon offers this product. Shipping direct from the coffee company is a killer and a dealbreaker for sure.

review/text: The aroma exudes confidence and vivacity, proudly presenting sharp flavors of iron and a hint of chocolate.  It depends on the density of the packing into the espresso filter, but this coffee ranges from the sharpness to a much more mellow, reserved flavor.  A good platform to fine-tune your packing pressure, amount, and water temperature among other things.  Won't disappoint.

review/text: Ahh.. Bonarda. When we were in Villa La Angostura, Argentina, we were served (unknown to us) a Bonarda varietal wine. It was the recommendation over the pervasive Malbec of Argentina. It shocked when poured because of the inky darkness of the wine. Exploring further with a taste and a swish, it revealed itself as a very nice, surprisingly not tannic wonderful wine. We are not experienced wine fu-fu's so my description may not be what you expect but I highly recommend that you try a Bonarda, especially Lamadrid. It held up well against brisket so it will go with anything. We had the 2008.

review/summary: Baronet Coffee Fair Trade Organic Small Village Blend (140 g), 18-Count Coffee Pods (Pack of 3 BAGS)
review/text: I will NOT purchase these coffee pods in the BAGs again.  I WILL purchase this same coffee in a BOX where the pods are individually wrapped in sealed packets.  The first thing I noticed about the coffee pods that I got in the bags was they had less coffee in them.  Also, grounds had escaped from some of the pods and settled in the bottom of the bag.  What a mess - so I had to throw most of those out.  Check out the amount per pod that you get in the bagged coffee vs the boxed coffee.  The bag states 140 g in 18 pods which is 7.7 per pod.  The box states that the pods are 10 grams, which is a thicker pod and better coffee.<br /><br />Update on 6/6/12 - I should have stated that I have a Keurig machine that I have a holder for that the pods to fit in, instead of using K-cups.  The 10 gram pods are just right for that and it costs a lot less to make coffee this way.  I didn't know about the Senseo machine and that the smaller pods may work better for those. Thanks for pointing that out.  Still, some of the pods in the bags were coming apart in the bags that I had purchased.

review/text: OMG wow! This stuff is awesome. The flavor is incredible, and it allows for great color contrast in certain dishes (e.g. I sprinkle it on some hummus for color + flavor). It works awesome for fish and veggies. The flavor is phenomenal, and the amount you need for that salty taste is perfect. We ordered several different salts (pink, gray, black, etc.)....but this one is, by far, our favorite over all. It tastes so clean!!!<br /><br />You want good flavor without the unhealthy punch of regular salt? This is your answer. Very versatile and welcome.

I certainly don't consider myself to have a refined palate, but there is no mistaking the flavours. A little goes a long way - another reason this salt is well worth the extra expense.  I guess I'll have to try the bamboo next.

review/summary: Quite hard crystals not as good as others
review/text: I got this and "Course Gray Sea Salt" from Brittany both from Amazon. The crystals in this salt tend to be very hard and hence are more like little stones than anything else and also do not impart as much flavor as you eat them added to your meal.<br /><br />I have not tried grinding them up. The other salt was not as hard crystals and added a lot of good flavor to the meals I added it to (sprinkling a little on top).<br /><br />I will not get this again. I will get the other again.<br /><br />It will last you forever unless you are a salt junky looking for high blood pressure, as this amount of salt is a HUGE amount of salt in you want to stay healthy. Just a tiny bit with each meal is plenty, and that is the problem here! The tiny bit doesn't impart much flavor or texture. The Brittany did.

So many times in my experience, I find that the product can be old and seriously dried out (it probably doesn't move very quickly here in the Midwest). But when I received this order from parthenonfoods.com, and immediately opened it, I was absolutely delighted at the product's FRESHNESS and deliciousness! I'll be ordering again soon from these folks. It's a pleasure to have found a vendor whose product quality I can trust. These folks deserve your attention!

review/summary: Loss of good will
review/text: I have purchased halva from this company in the past and have received delicious halva on those occasions.  Additionally, because we were happy with the product, the amount of halva we ordered progressively increased until we purchased 5 pounds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, on our latest order of 2 pounds, upon opening the package, we discovered that the halva appeared to have somewhat of a pungent odor.  We then tasted the halva and immediately found it to have a rotten taste.  Upon closer inspection, I discovered that the halva had possibly come in contact with moisture or that the halva sent was dated.  I began the inquiry process and explained the incident with Parthenon foods.  I was shocked and dismayed when they sent me the following reply (verbatim):<br /><br />"Hello,<br />We are sorry, but this item is not old and very fresh.  Are you referring to the package being a little oily, which would be normal?  Halva is not perishable and can not be "rotten" This product is very fresh and perfect to consume.<br />Sincerely,<br />ParthenonFoods.com"<br /><br />I laughed out loud due to their statement, "this item is not old and very fresh", which essentially admits their item is not very fresh!  Pretty funny huh?  Anyways, they were not willing to rectify the issue, even though we spent a considerable amount of money on their product on numerous occasions.<br /><br />Fortunately, the outstanding service of Amazon came through as always, and they themselves rectified the issue by reimbursing me the full amount.  I then of course spent the same amount on a different brand of halva (through Amazon of course!)<br />I will never purchase food items from Parthenon foods again, bad customer service, unwillingness to rectify situation, prompt destruction of good will.  At least they were honest about the halva being "...not old and very fresh"...!

review/text: My experience was similar to others (with negative reviews) in that the company took a long time to ship the product and the halva was of questionable quality.  As for the shipping time, it took them 4 days to get the item out, whereas other orders with different merchants on the same day went out within 48 hours.  The package also arrived after the due date.  As for the quality, the halva I received had a rubbery "skin" covering its surface.  I've bought and eaten a lot of halva in the past, and I've never come across any with this type of latex-like surface.  I will not order from this company again because it just seems as though they don't care about their customers (see also Mike's Review for more in this regard).

review/summary: Could be better...
review/text: These bars are an excellent source of fiber and a very convenient way to fit more into your diet.  At 12 grams of fiber per bar, just one bar will put you well on your way to meeting the daily suggested amount.  However, the taste isn't that great.  They are dry and very dense.  I wouldn't mind the heaviness of the bar, if the manufacturer could find a way to make these a little more moist.  I felt like I needed a whole glass of milk to go with it just to be able to chew and swallow.  My taste buds didn't detect much of a chocolate taste either.  I think that the Banana Walnut and Apple Cinnamon cereal bars, while also dry, have a better flavor than the Brownie bar.

review/text: These little guys are almost magically filling. I just ordered a case on Amazon because I can't find any more in the stores near me, and I haven't been able to find a substitute for them that fills me like they do. Some users have complained about the Brownie flavor, which is the only one I've had. Their taste and texture actually reminded me a bit of figs more so than brownies. They might be an acquired taste, but to be honest, I personally prefer it to the alternatives that taste too much like candy bars to made me feel as though I've had a satisfying snack. My main word of caution is to not buy these as a snack for a road trip, a day of big meetings, or similar situation in which you can't necessarily control your bathroom access; the high amount of fiber will make you want to be flexible with that.

review/summary: My favorite!
review/text: I'm so glad Amazon started carrying these!  I recently moved to New Orleans & when I checked the F-Factor website, it said there were no stores that carry these bars within 100 miles.  They are very dense and they're more fruity than chocolatey, but I don't think that they're dry at all.  I'd rather have these than Fiber One Bars any day!

review/summary: Actually really good snack bars
review/text: They seem to be very healthy and they are tasty as a snack bar.  My only negative is that whatever seeds are in the snack bar, should be ground prior to the mixing process.

review/summary: Tastes Horrible!  More Filling!
review/text: I ordered a case of these based on my experience with other Health Valley products.  These bars would make great on the go snacks or even meal replacement bars, if they didn't taste so bad.  To me these fall into the sawdust cuisine category.

review/summary: Great sauce for Couscous
review/text: I eat couscous as my main carb staple daily and i always use Jyoti sauces like this to prepare it.

review/text: I love using Kelapo for pretty much everything in the kitchen, but then I found out how great it works for bug bites and skin and wanted to take it with me everywhere. I started using the pouches because they fit perfectly in my wallet, so now whenever I get eaten up by bugs I have my coconut oil with me to save the day.

review/text: My dog had problems with skin allergies for years. He needed to be put on oral steroids several times a year to treat his condition. I found that using this shampoo regularly along with feeding him a food made for dogs with sensitive skin has kept him off of medications for an entire year! The shampoo is gentle and effective.

review/summary: As far as canned barbecue goes, this is pretty good
review/text: I recently picked up a few cans of this on sale at the grocery store and was pleasantly surprised. It's not great barbecue in the classic sense, but does great anything come in a can?<br /><br />The cans I bought did NOT contain high fructose corn syrup, which was a nice bonus considering most store-bought barbecue sauces nowadays use HFCS. As long as Vietti doesn't use HFCS, I'll keep buying a few cans of this to keep in my pantry.

review/summary: HORRIBLE
review/text: This is HORRIBLE. I grew up with Castleberry's BBQ but they no longer make it so I tried this.  I am sorry to do it to them but I'm giving the other 9 cans to the food bank. So salty I nearly gagged, I offered it to my Lab who will eat anything and even he wouldn't eat it.<br /><br />If you want good canned BBQ try Patterson's. I emailed Castleberry's customer service and the lady was kind enough to poinT me to the successor company who took over processing the BBQ that Castleberry used to produce. The company is Bost Distributing and their website is... bostdistributing.com<br /><br />Amazon......please start carrying Patterson's Pork Barbecue

review/summary: Good coffee, good price
review/text: I don't normally drink strong coffee, so this variety was good for me. Good flavor, but not too strong or bitter. The only down side is that several k-cups (probably 6 or 7 out of the first 2/3 of the box) failed and left an excessive amount of grounds in the brewed coffee. If not for that, it would be 4 stars.<br /><br />At the price I paid ($27.75) it is a pretty good value as well.

review/summary: Mother-in-law says PERFECT.
review/text: I order this coffee for my mother-in-law. My husband will drink it occasionally, but prefers Timothy's slightly stronger Private Blend. My mother-in-law settled on Breakfast Blend after trying several different variety packs. She drinks her coffee black and thinks that this blend of Timothy's makes the 'perfect' cup of coffee. Not watered down, but not too strong, either.

review/text: The coffee is very good even though I prefer Green Mountain but it's a litte more expensive. I feel that Timothy's breakfast blend is going to catch right up. Every time I order it it seems the cost is higher and higher. I am tempted to go to Bed and Bath and redeem my coupons for Green Mountain.<br />I do love shopping at Amazon though!

review/summary: Good Coffee at a Good Price
review/text: I'm just an average person who occasionally drinks coffee in the morning or to stay awake if I've got something important to do at night. I'm not very particular with the taste of my coffee. My only real requirements are that it has a taste and that taste isn't extraordinarily bitter and difficult to take. In my opinion this coffee has a really nice flavor to it without an extremely bitter after taste (I drink my coffee black). I've tried certain blends of Dunkin' Donuts coffee that you can put in the refillable pods and by comparison this coffee has a heck of a lot more taste. Also, I haven't had an issue with a pod being defective or not working and the box had all fifty pods in it. So I can say I'm very satisfied with this purchase especially since these are towards the bottom of the barrel in pricing for k-cups on amazon.
