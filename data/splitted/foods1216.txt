review/summary: tastes like brown water
review/text: The description of the product says "breakfast blend" so I expected something that would actually provide a bit of a caffine wake-up... but when you actually receive the box you find out it's also described as "mild." (Had I known this, I never would have ordered this to start with.) When you actually taste it, you find out "mild" is a vast overstatement -- the "coffee" tastes like warm brown water with no character whatsoever. Since none of the 47 K-cups remaining (there are 3 coffee drinkers here -- all agree it's not worth a second cup) can't be returned, guess I'll save it for company who really don't want any coffee but are interested in how the brewer itself works.  Then we'll throw out the end product.

review/summary: Defective Product
review/text: The best thing I can say about this product is it is POOR.  Poor in taste and quality.  We end up getting coffee grind in our cup 80 pct of the time.  We now strain the coffee in order to avoid the grounds. It's not the coffee maker because others work fine, NO Grounds at all.  If I new how to return them I would.

review/summary: Bad product!
review/text: I ordered these somewhat gingerly after reading reviews on the Timothy brand and the defective seals.  Having my fingers crossed I proceeded to make a cup of coffee this morning with my new K-cups.  I got a bad batch and there were coffee grounds everywhere!  What a mess!  I have the rainforest blend and they work great so it is obviously just some of the blends that are defective.  Amazon made it right for me though because of their unsurpassed customer service, but I will still steer clear of this brand.

review/summary: Three quarters of these didn't work correctly
review/text: I bought 2 boxes of these K Cups and they were a total waste of money.  At least 3/4 didn't work.  They would kind of explode in our keurig and we'd end up with only 1/2 a cup of coffee and that would be full of grounds. When we opened it up, there would be coffee oozing out the top of the k cup and all around it was covered in coffee grounds. They worked a little better if we  punched a hole in them with the keurig, opened it up, rotated the k cup and then closed it again so there were multiple holes in the bottom. Many of them would still explode though. At first I thought that it was a fluke but it happened to k cup after k cup and with both boxes of cups.  The Timothy Columbian coffee k cups did the same thing. Other brands work fine so I know it's not our machine.  I won't be buying them again.  Too bad because the coffee itself was very good.

I was happy to see Amazon has this 50-Count K-Cup for a great price, then a sale to boot!  This particular brand is a very good coffee.  Not too strong, yet very flavorful!  I like the fact I can try others too.  The selection is very good but for my first cup in the morning, the Breakfast Blend by Timothy's is the way to go!

review/summary: HORRIBLE, BAD QUALITY & TERRIBLE VALUE!
review/text: My first order of the product several months ago was fine, good price and product worked, the last order was terrible.  While the price increase is not a big deal the quality and taste of the product has rapidly deteriorated.  My last order only about 10% of the cups worked, most had the seal broken and the other either had so little coffee in the cup it was like drinking hot yellow water. Additionally, most of the cups that were still sealed broke in the coffee maker.  Talk about a product going to hell, my first box was great.  I will never order from Timothy's again and am sorely disappointed in Amazon for continuing selling this product after all the negative feedback.  I use to trust Amazon but now it's just like buying from ebay.<br /><br />Buyer Beware!

review/text: Was a good deal when selling the 50 count for $22 (less than 50 cents per cup). However, at $27+ it's no longer worth buying from Amazon.  Can get the same deal at the grocery stores when buying an 18 count box for $10 and can even get the Green Mountain brand for that price. Good coffee though and I considered setting up the automatically times shipment to my house every month, however until it drops down to below 50 cents per cup, I won't.

review/text: K-Cups are defective. Filter collapses and you get a cup full of grounds or a partial cup of coffee. Whwen you try to remove the K-Cup it makes a huge mess dripping grounds and coffee all over everything. Called Tomothy's customer service three times and you get an anwering machine and they DO NOT RESPOND to your complaints. My Kuerig works perfectly with four other brands so it is definitely a defective product.

review/summary: Very Disappointed in  Timothy's
review/text: i had earlier bought a box of timothy's 50 breakfast blend kcups and not only got a great tasting coffee, but fast shipping. at the time, timothy's was the only seller i found that sold in this large amount. so i bit the bullet and paid the $7.95 shipping. the kcups arrived in 3 days and i didn't have a single problem with any of them.<br /><br />when it came time to buy more, i reordered from timothy's again. after waiting and waiting and getting down to 3 kcups, i came back to amazon to see if my favorite breakfast blend from green mountain was available in the 50 kcup size. it was, and i jumped on it because i really didn't want to go to town to buy a small box while waiting.<br /><br />the kcups i ordered from amazon came 2 days later. still no timothy's box in sight. it finally arrived today, 10 days after the original order. to say i'm disappointed in this is an understatement.<br /><br />there are two reasons i'm returning the timothy's coffee. 1) i got the green mountain 50 kcup pack considerably cheaper than the timothy's coffee. in fact, when i ordered the green mountain kcups i also ordered some apple cider kcups [2 boxes of 24 each]for my husband and between them it was less than a $1 more then the timothy order. 2)since i got the first box i ordered from them in 3 days, i feel i had a reasonable expectation of something similar with this new order. i wasn't even able to track the package [i'm not sure why that was, maybe because it came from canada?] so i had no idea when it would arrive. on top of that, they are not only making me pay for returning the box, they could also take a 20% restocking fee. but that's ok. they'll only get it this one time.<br /><br />i gave this a 4 star rating because the coffee really is great if you're looking for a medium blend coffee that doesn't remove your taste buds. unlike many other reviewers, i didn't have any problems at all with any defective kcups. as much as i love the coffee, the price and iffy shipping times doesn't lend themselves to repeating the experience.

review/summary: Very weak!!
review/text: This item showed up in my Quick Picks and in looking at it I saw that I had actually bought it a couple years ago when most K-Cups could be bought via Amazon's subscription service (get a % off the price if you sign up and then receive the same item in so many months). So, I thought, hey - it's another dollar off today and I've bought it before so why not? and I ordered it.<br /><br />I'll tell you why not.  It has got to be the absolutely weakest coffee I have ever gotten.  As soon as I brewed the first cup I remembered why I cancelled the subscription after the first box years ago.<br /><br />I did a second cup on the smallest setting on my Keurig and even that was weak. Very little flavor... very watery.  I tried a few more. The same. I now have 45 cups left sitting in the back of my pantry.<br /><br />Others may like this coffee, but as for myself I like a medium roast.  I realize this breakfast blend would be considered a light roast but I have enjoyed other brand Breakfast Blends before.  I am just very disappointed in the Timothy's World Coffee and feel that I wasted my money.

review/summary: Taste at a price
review/text: Although I can get K cups cheaper at another site, I was unable to get the blend and the manufacturer. So in order to get the product I wanted, it cost more. Ten cents might not be seem like a lot. But K cups themselves are pricing coffee at something like $62.00 a pound for the amount your getting. The price of ease.

review/summary: Green Mountain Ruined a great coffee
review/text: Ever  since Green Mountain bought Timothy's coffee, the quality has been sliding fast downhill. It now has hit bottom. Green Mountain bought so many different coffee companies(look on their website) and they have created a virtual monopoly on the k-cups.<br />Wait to next year when they lose their patents as newer and much cheaper k-cup manufacturers hit the scene.Until then, break out the old Mr.Coffee  and make coffee the old fashioned way!!

review/summary: Great Buying Experience but not my favorite DeCaf K Cup Flavor
review/text: Product Review<br /><br />The product itself is decent.  One of the better Decaf K-Cups out there.  Especially since the choices are fairly limited as far as decaf options.  Although I am partial to both the Donut Shop Decaf and Donut House Decaf.  This comes in a close 3rd.<br /><br />I feel Timothy has a slightly more bitter taste when compared to the previous two mentioned.  But overall fairly decent.<br /><br />Amazon Experience<br /><br />For those that already know they like this particular blend my experience with amazon was amazing as usual.  Shipping was free and fast.  Packaging was great.  And price was slightly lower than anywhere else I found.  Definitely would buy from amazon again!

review/summary: Really, no packaging??????
review/text: We purchase K-cups from Amazon on a regular basis.  I buy for my family as well as my parents.  We have always been 100% satisfied.<br /><br />First of all, it took a while for us to get our coffee.  We ordered the TW Breakfast Blend as well as some decaf from a different coffee company.  The decaf showed up right away, no problem as usual.  A week later when our TW Breakfast Blend showed up, I opened the cardboard packing box to find 50 k-cups.  That's it, just the K-cups, no packaging, wrapping or anything.  Usually you get 2 boxes of 25 or whatever.  We open one box and put the other away for storage.  Okay, so now I have no place to store this lovely brown packaging box with my 50 loose k-cups.<br /><br />I know it sounds petty but it was just weird.  I was even nervous using them as I was wondering if they were safe????  Coffee is fine, but I've never purchased something, especially a consumable, that wasn't professionally packaged.

review/summary: Nice flavor, good price, wakes me up, no problems
review/text: I haven't tried any other k cups, but I've had the opportunity to try many different coffees in general. Tim's tastes good, balanced, non acidic. I use the largest cup setting for my morning cup in my travel mug and the smallest setting for a couple of mid day cups per k cup. I drink it black, black with stevia, with sweetened rice or almond milk, in smoothies...it's very nice all the way around and actually wakes me up.<br />I am going to try the other brands of k cups I see highly recommended, but I am tempted to just stick with Tim's.<br />I have also not had any defective cups or explosions, leaks or grounds in my coffee and I am just finishing up a box of 50.<br /><br />I'm going to try Green Mountain next. I hope I'm not disappointed!

review/text: I have tried numerous brands of K-Cup coffee in the past year and many different blends.  Timothy's World Breakfast Blend is by far the best out there.  Even the other breakfast blends are not nearly as good. Timothy's is not too strong but still has a very good coffee smell and taste.  I don't even try any of the others any more.  If we want a flavored coffee, we just add one of the various flavored creamers to the coffee and it is better than having to buy different coffee.  And the price through Amazon  is the best you can get - best coffee - best price - why would you want anything else?

review/summary: Ok but not my favorite. Good to have when you need to surve a variety of tastes in a hurry
review/text: My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups.  K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgagn Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. Of the three manufacturer's I have tried, Timothy's was my least favorite because it was the weakest. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

In fact In the evening I have it with a little Sambuca.  It makes a great after dinner drink.  You can't go wrong no matter what time of day you use it.  It's also good as Iced coffee.

review/summary: Mom, Help! Hot Poop!
review/text: So, a few years back, when my son was just 18 months old, I discovered these and thought they'd be great with chili (they were!). As I was eating them, my son saw them and wanted to try them. I figured, what the heck, they were kinda spicy but not enough to hurt the little guy. So I gave him a couple. He loved them! So, I gave him a handful, and he munched away happily.<br /><br />Fast-forward to the next day.<br /><br />My wife is in the office when she hears a blood-curdling scream from my son's room!<br /><br />She rushes in to see what's the matter, and there stands my son, a look of panic on his face, yelling "Mom-Mom help! Hot poop! Hot poop!" as he reaches back into his diaper to try and get it all out.<br /><br />Needless to say, at the time my wife was not amused.<br /><br />However, this brand of cracker has henceforth and forevermore become known in our family as "Hot Poop Cheez-Its."<br /><br />And yes, my son still loves them.

review/summary: Great with Tomato Soup, in Chex Mix and Hamburger Patties!
review/text: This is a really tasty snack cracker. My kids love to eat these right out of the box but we really like them over tomato soup, they're also great adding 1 cup to homemade chex mix.  Another favorite is to finely crush 1 cup hot & spicy cheezits and mix into 2lbs of ground beef, I add a little worchestershire sauce, one egg, and some garlic salt and then make my own hamburger patties.  It makes 8 quarter lb patties.  They are fantastic that way and everyone will love your hamburgers.  If you want a little more kick then add pepper jack cheese but we just use american slices.  These are our favorite of all the cheez-its.<br /><br />*Just a note that this is the 9oz box and not the normal 13.7oz box so just beware when comparing prices at the grocery.

review/summary: Most of the crackers in the boxes were in pieces...
review/text: I ordered this product through Amazon and found that most of the crackers were broken up into pieces.  I don't know if this was because of poor handling during shipping or just a faulty batch.  The flavor was good although it got old after a couple boxes, but flavor is a subjective thing so you may or may not like it.  Another thing to note is that these are the 9 oz boxes, which are smaller than the normal box you are used to seeing.  I didn't notice that when ordering, so I thought I was getting a better deal than I actually was.

review/text: I really enjoyed snacking on these great crackers from Cheez-It although I do like some of the other varieties a little better.  One word of warning, however, do not remove your contact lenses before you thoroughly wash your hands!  The pepper adhering to your hands may cause irritation if you rub your lenses before placing them in the lens case for disinfection.  Thus, when you insert the lenses later, there may be burning as I found out to my dismay.

review/text: I clearly am in the majority here in saying that I couldn't stand these.  I love all the other varieties of Cheez-its, and I normally love hot stuff (hot wings, "poppers", etc) but I disliked these crackers so much that I had to toss them out.  I found the hot flavor just weird; didn't go right with the texture of a Cheez-it either.  I put a bowl out at a party and they went largly untouched, so I have to think other people had one and didn't come back for more.  One other reviewer mentioned crushing them and mixing them with hamburger meat.  That might be worth trying.  As it was, after a month of sitting in my pantry I've tossed these out.  Buy a box in a store (if you can find them) before you commit to a case.

review/text: Our nine-month-old daughter is ready for a more substantial breakfast than plain cereals.  We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.  This blend of fruit and grains (and, in some cases, yogurt) provides everything she needs for a good breakfast and keeps her full for several hours.  Plus, the flavors are not overly sweet.  One note:  at least two of these flavors include yogurt.  Some babies younger than 1-year may have a reaction to yogurt and other dairy foods, so just watch out for that.

review/text: We feed our baby this Wholesome Breakfast at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.  We're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  We particularly like that this food contains yogurt.  When she was young (~6 months old), our baby loved yogurt but couldn't eat it plain because it would cause a rash around her mouth.  She was never bothered by the yogurt in this food, though, perhaps because it was mixed with other things.  Now that she's older (10 months), our baby can eat all the yogurt she wants without a skin reaction, but for awhile, this variety of Wholesome Breakfast was the only source of her favorite food.

She'll eat this any time of the day, and we're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.

review/summary: Best Organic Baby Food!!!
review/text: My son is lactose intolerant but he's able to eat this for some reason!  Moreover, it's great to start off a day with a nutritious meal versus eating empty calaries with little to no nutritional benefit.  Regardless, I'm very pleased with the quality and taste.  Yes, I tasted this and it is delish!

review/text: My little guy just loves this jar. I love the line of breakfast blends.  I am happy with Amazon's "grocery" business. It is great to have the convenience to order these on-line and have home delivery.  I can't imagine going the store and having to get a whole case and go through check out. I try to make him some meals, but I trust Earth's Best and love the flavor combo's and they are so convenient.

review/summary: contains MILK!
review/text: I love Earth's Best products and only use them to feed my baby, besides home made foods. I rate this one one star because the seller didn't specify that this product contains milk, which my baby cannot tolerate since he is lactose-intolerant. So for us, it was a waste of money, and I bought two packs...

review/summary: MILK in the ingredients
review/text: This baby food, labeled for 6+ months, contains heavy cream. My baby could not digest it; we had a very bad day. Maybe I missed that in the description, but in any case, everywhere I've read and according to my pediatrician, you're supposed to avoid cow's milk products before age 1 (why they make formula using cow's milk and not a much more digestible milk like goat baffles me and is a rant for another time--my son drinks the lactose free kind, in any case). I ordered another variety of "Wholesome breakfast" too: Pear, Apple, Oatmeal. Same thing there. I'm guessing they all have heavy cream in them.

review/summary: Really a wholesome breakfast
review/text: We initially tried few sample from Ralph's and our Baby started liking it .. We don't give formula to our Baby and we give only Mom's milk.<br />i think when we combine that with this wholesome breakfast you will have a satisfaction that you are really taking a good care of the Baby..<br />What's more it had got more calories than the regular baby foods and it had got 35% iron which i consider important.. It has dates in it. Very few baby foods for breakfast have dates in them.. on the whole it's really a wholesome breakfast.. Add organic on top of that what else can you ask for.. I had only one thing to complain about.. it's availability is rare.. i had to wait for a month to get it.. I don't find it in the store shelves either..

review/summary: Fun to Eat
review/text: This isn't something to fill your belly, but it is a fun treat. What it is, is a saucer shaped wafer , which contains a sweet and sour powder on the inside. It tastes good, particularly if you like the combination of sweet and sour, and if you don't want a treat too heavy. I must note though that the different colors do not change the taste. They pretty much taste all the same. The wafer, if I must compare, tastes like a wafer you'd find on a plain ice cream cone, except a bit softer, and chewier.

review/summary: Davidson's Red Passion
review/text: I've been pleased with all of the Davidson's offerings I've tried up until this point.  This one just wasn't that good for me.  And as a newly converted tea drinker, it's got to be good if it's going to keep me out of the soda aisle.<br /><br />The flavor was very very weak in this tea.  Which rather surprised me considering the ingredients in it.  I prepared it like all others, letting it steep for awhile in boiling hot water, but it didn't even give off the nice scent that most of Davidson's teas do at this point.  Sipping it I could taste the bitter aftertaste of the tea, but none of the other flavors were present and it just tasted like hot water.  I'd like to think that maybe it was just an old teabag, but it was freshly purchased and that didn't seem to be the case.<br /><br />The ingredients, like all Davidson's teas, were very good at least.  Organic Rooibos, peppermint, cinnamon, orange peel, lemon peel and natural flavors were the entire list.  And I am pleased that they attempted to use some organic products.  But as said before, with all the other flavors, it really surprised me that this tea was so weak.  I've had the rooibos tea in other mixtures and liked it, so I know it wasn't that I just didn't like this type of tea.<br /><br />Not my favorite for sure.  I will continue to enjoy my other Davidson's teas, but not this particular flavor.  The rest are being taken to work and tossed in the shared food pile in the hopes that someone else will like it more.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: A nice thick flake of  rolled oats for a hearty breakfast!
review/text: We like the taste and texture of these Mother's "thick" rolled oats - and they come in a smaller box, which is very convenient - in the cupboard or in the freezer. We buy the case regularly and freeze most of it. It cooks right up frozen and stays perfectly fresh in the freezer for a year or so. These oats cook up flakey or creamy, depending on how you cook them. More water, or milk, makes them creamier. Great for chewy oatmeal cookies, too! My folks call these oats "REAL old-fashioned oats!" They sure are a treat if you've never had them. Recommended!
