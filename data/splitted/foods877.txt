review/summary: no taste, a mess
review/text: I usually order the unsweetened flaked coconut and it's fantastic. I saw that this was twice the amount of coconut in a package for less then double the price but it was shredded.  I tried it and now am I sorry.  It's shredded but it's so finely shredded it flies everywhere and sticks to everything and leaves no taste at all.  I am so very disappointed. Will go back to the flaked and never order this again!

Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed... Every time I have fed my dogs any brand of straight canned dog food, with the exception of Science Diet, they had diarrhea. Not with this one. Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00. I also ordered the chicken with rice and the dog food for all life stages.  My dogs love them all the same. I had never purchased food with lamb in it before but the one for life stages has it. i do not like the way veal or lamb are treated and have never eaten it myself either. However,having said that, I will be ordering this monthly for my dogs. Just wish there were more choices without lamb. It is impressive that their cattle are free range grazing cattle and fish are ocean not farm raised. I believe my dogs are eating better than us! Seriously, you will be impressed with the ingredients list on these foods.

review/summary: Warning this product may contain a doggy stimulant
review/text: First things first, unfortunately there is not an option for "Dog Loves It" on Amazon's reviews so I hope this is not misleading...I personally have never eaten the stuff so this should not be viewed as "I like this" and I haven't been able to teach my dog to verbally communicate yet so I'm going to have to go off of body language cues. That being said....15 month old, female German Shepherd with a sensitive stomach seems to love it. Had her on it for 5 months now. Half a can mixed with your dry food of choice 2X a day and you'll have a pretty darn wild dog at and post feeding time. Just bought a pack of the chicken grain free to see if it elicits equal enthusiasm. Inevitably, some of the cans always wind up at my doorstep dented, but I don't think that has any impact on the product.

review/summary: My dogs love it, and love the combination beef and fish!
review/text: I always wanted to try out Canidae for my dogs, and when I saw the price Amazon offered for these, I had to go for it. The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan "all the time", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it.

review/summary: All but 2 cans in the case were severely damaged
review/text: I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places. Even the inside cans were damaged. So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store. At least then I can be sure that the cans are not damaged.

review/summary: Canidae 12-Pack Canned Dog Food, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth, 5-1/2-Ounce Can
review/text: I switched to the smaller cans because I have a Yorkie, and it took too long for her to finish the larger cans.  But to me, all Canidae products are great.  Let me tell you what happened.  Three years ago, my little dog had hot spots all over her.  She was miserable, itching, scratching, moping around.  I took her to the vet who gave me a cream which didn't help.  Then one time, I went to my groomer who told me the truth:  SHE'S ALLERGIC!  These hot spots are Alergies!!!  Huh?  Why didn't the vet tell me this?  (Was it because he was also selling the other dog food I was using?)  The groomer suggested I look for a product that had no corn.  I liked the Amazon reviews about Canidae products and tried it.  Not only did she take to the change right away, (although I gradually changed food) but her hot spots cleared up.  Needless to say, Canidae products are all I use now.  I don't care that they are a little more expensive!  They cleared up my poor dog's misery, and that's all that counts!

I will try mixing in some cheaper stuff and trying to move toward feeding this.  But I am warning anyone who is trying this that it isn't immediately appealing to my five totally different (and hungry) dogs.

review/summary: Quality dog food, but he still can't have it...
review/text: For about three months we were feeding this formula and the Senior formula to our 18-year-old Gilligan, mainly because he has a very long list of health issues that we try to sidestep like landmines and I strongly believe the prescription foods sold at the vet office are nothing but crap.  I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues.

review/text: My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.<br />I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.<br />I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description, however, the picture was of the larger can.  They offered a return, I would have been stupid again to pay $16+ total in shipping to and from to get a $14 credit.<br />I told customer service the picture was misleading and she said she wasn't sure on this product, but in the past they've told Amazon they have wrong pictures on certain items and Amazon does nothing about it! I don't know if it was their fault or Amazon's fault, but I do know I paid DOUBLE!  I have purchased a lot of items on Amazonb and this is the first time I've felt CHEATED.

review/summary: YOUR DOGS WILL LOVE THIS FOOD! IMPRESSIVE INGREDIENTS
review/text: My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great! The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others get this mixed with their Bil-Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients. Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed... Every time I have fed my dogs any brand of straight canned dog food, with the exception of Science Diet, they had diarrhea. Not with this one. Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00. I also ordered the chicken with rice and the dog food for all life stages.  My dogs love them all the same. I had never purchased food with lamb in it before but the one for life stages has it. i do not like the way veal or lamb are treated and have never eaten it myself either. However,having said that, I will be ordering this monthly for my dogs. Just wish there were more choices without lamb. It is impressive that their cattle are free range grazing cattle and fish are ocean not farm raised. I believe my dogs are eating better than us! Seriously, you will be impressed with the ingredients list on these foods.

review/summary: Warning this product may contain a doggy stimulant
review/text: First things first, unfortunately there is not an option for "Dog Loves It" on Amazon's reviews so I hope this is not misleading...I personally have never eaten the stuff so this should not be viewed as "I like this" and I haven't been able to teach my dog to verbally communicate yet so I'm going to have to go off of body language cues. That being said....15 month old, female German Shepherd with a sensitive stomach seems to love it. Had her on it for 5 months now. Half a can mixed with your dry food of choice 2X a day and you'll have a pretty darn wild dog at and post feeding time. Just bought a pack of the chicken grain free to see if it elicits equal enthusiasm. Inevitably, some of the cans always wind up at my doorstep dented, but I don't think that has any impact on the product.

review/summary: My dogs love it, and love the combination beef and fish!
review/text: I always wanted to try out Canidae for my dogs, and when I saw the price Amazon offered for these, I had to go for it. The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan "all the time", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it.

review/summary: All but 2 cans in the case were severely damaged
review/text: I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places. Even the inside cans were damaged. So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store. At least then I can be sure that the cans are not damaged.

review/text: I really wanted my little shihtzu, Sheldon, to like this food but it was a no go here.  He barely sniffed it and walked away.  I loved the size of the cans as well as the impressive ingredient list.  I do have to say that it didn't smell alot like chicken to me though so I understand him not even tasting it.  Too bad though.  I would have loved to add this to the very small list of foods he will eat.

You can see the pieces of rice, and it doesn't smell offensive like some of the other canned dog foods. I notice their nails and coats are strong and healthy, too! This is the BEST dog food! And trust me, I've tried many... A++++ for Canidae! The only drawback is shipping cost... If anyone knows where they offer free shipping, please let me know :) THANKS!

review/summary: Canidae 12-Pack Canned Dog Food, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth, 5-1/2-Ounce Can
review/text: I switched to the smaller cans because I have a Yorkie, and it took too long for her to finish the larger cans.  But to me, all Canidae products are great.  Let me tell you what happened.  Three years ago, my little dog had hot spots all over her.  She was miserable, itching, scratching, moping around.  I took her to the vet who gave me a cream which didn't help.  Then one time, I went to my groomer who told me the truth:  SHE'S ALLERGIC!  These hot spots are Alergies!!!  Huh?  Why didn't the vet tell me this?  (Was it because he was also selling the other dog food I was using?)  The groomer suggested I look for a product that had no corn.  I liked the Amazon reviews about Canidae products and tried it.  Not only did she take to the change right away, (although I gradually changed food) but her hot spots cleared up.  Needless to say, Canidae products are all I use now.  I don't care that they are a little more expensive!  They cleared up my poor dog's misery, and that's all that counts!

review/text: I am trying to get my dogs (all shelter dogs although one is purebred) off low-quality grain-based foods and bought this to add to their high quality lamb and rice kibble, which they eat well.  They wouldn't eat it at first, and then only grudgingly.  I am going to try again, but I am distressed because I don't like throwing out food.  I will try mixing in some cheaper stuff and trying to move toward feeding this.  But I am warning anyone who is trying this that it isn't immediately appealing to my five totally different (and hungry) dogs.

review/summary: Quality dog food, but he still can't have it...
review/text: For about three months we were feeding this formula and the Senior formula to our 18-year-old Gilligan, mainly because he has a very long list of health issues that we try to sidestep like landmines and I strongly believe the prescription foods sold at the vet office are nothing but crap.  I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues.

review/text: My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.<br />I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.<br />I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description, however, the picture was of the larger can.  They offered a return, I would have been stupid again to pay $16+ total in shipping to and from to get a $14 credit.<br />I told customer service the picture was misleading and she said she wasn't sure on this product, but in the past they've told Amazon they have wrong pictures on certain items and Amazon does nothing about it! I don't know if it was their fault or Amazon's fault, but I do know I paid DOUBLE!  I have purchased a lot of items on Amazonb and this is the first time I've felt CHEATED.

This (and the other Teavana products that I've tried) are certainly no Lipton.  The strawberry lemonade is great as an iced tea, although the fruit expands quite a bit, so you may want to split the dried product into two tea balls (I have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RIZ7">Stainless Steel Mesh Tea Ball</a>x2), for a 2qt pitcher.  It also pairs well with oolong, roobios or green tea... friends have tried it with black and white teas, but I'm not a fan. You can definitely taste the different fruit flavors, and the rosehips give a nice scent but it doesn't taste like you're chewing on flowers.  Happy drinking!

review/summary: Exceptional value, spicy and convenient.
review/text: What a great deal. Has Indian food ever been this quick, cheap and easy to prepare? It may be a little small for two servings, but there is definitely enough basmati rice with cumin for two. I added a small dish of chutney on the side, and roti as well, and it made a nice vegetarian meal for two. The package suggests that meat eaters can add their cooked meat to the sauce -- and I actually think I will add leftover fried paneer cheese the next time I make it. It is rather spicy, and very economical.

review/text: Not bad for a quick microwave meal.  As to be expected from a Korma, it really has no spice whatsoever.  Comes alive when adding your own peppers.<br /><br />It's not up to restaurant quality, but you could do a lot worse for 3-4 minutes of preparation.

review/text: First thing out of many , many purchases over the years that I wasted my money on. I went by the reviews. Honestly I looked forward to this and then I smelled it.  It smelled bad. I mean REALLY "OFF". I couldn't get past the smell. I passed it to  my husband and he eats anything but one mouthful and he was done. The rice would have been okay on its own so we will throw the vegetable stuff away and just keep the "expensive" rice. I have eaten Indian many times so the smell was not due to the spices.

review/summary: Wrong order
review/text: So I ordered 8 jars of Pataks Tikka PASTE, the first batch I received were 4 jars of chicken Tikka Marinade, I decided not to return because it was simply too much trouble and the second batch might be correct, well the other 4 jars arrived yesterday, I pulled out the first jar, it was Tikka PASTE, I was thinking hooray they got it right, then the other 3 were Tikka Marinade. I purchased Tikka PASTE so I can make currys. I use Pataks curry paste all the time, I'm originally from the UK where Pataks is very popular to use to make currys. I have ordered curry paste before off Amazon, I will definitely not use these again. If you get Tikka marinade, it's for marinating chicken and putting it on the grill. A paste you can use to make a curry.

review/text: I got the Mystic Morning flavor, and if this is what a medium roast from this brand tastes like, I wonder how deep their dark roasts go. It's a bracing flavor profile in the morning, the kind of coffee that'll put hair on your chest. If you want your coffee strong enough to get up and walk away on its own, this is for you. Bear in mind though that an 8 oz pack will not go very far.

review/text: ...one of my favorite pleasures in life and I decided to try this brand once it was on sale for under $6. A bit lighter coffee then I'm used to but it was smooth and well rounded with just the right amount of nutty after taste. I'll be watching for the whole bean since I'm sure it will heighten the flavor. Actually bought some interest in the company (JAMN) since i think Mr. Marley has a winning product. Sure would be fun to sit down with him and listen to stories about his father over a cup of this Joe!

review/summary: Does what it claims!
review/text: One of my dogs is 4 years old and his teeth are worse than my 8 year old.  He only eats dry dog food but has brown teeth and extremely smelly breath.  I have owned or lived with more than a dozen dogs in my life and hands down his was the most funky breath I have ever smelled.<br /><br />I tried the "Checkups" from Costco (also sold on Amazon) and they simply didn't do anything for him.  I was desperate to find something to give him to help clean his teeth while also taming that horrible breath of his.  I came across these Dingo's and decided to give it a try since they love the double meat Dingo's.<br /><br />I give him two per day (regular size) and he is 31 lbs.  I didn't try to look for any improvements in his breath or teeth for at least a  week, but I definitely noticed it before the second week.  The results were borderline unbelievable.  His breath doesn't smell bad at all.  His teeth are no longer brown.<br /><br />I also supervise him while eating his treats (which he absolutely loves).  To the other person who commented, my condolences to your friend; I too have had a close friend lose a dog (choking on a tennis ball).  While I believe that these can be dangerous if not used properly, I also believe that a tennis ball too can do harm.  The bottom line is you have to watch your dog while they eat treats and use common sense when determining if they seem inappropriate for your dogs size and eating (he eats treats like we starve him).  Also, while I won't try to provide advice on how to treat a choking dog, I will simply mention that spending 5 minutes with Google may in fact be the best 5 minutes spent of your life (or your dogs).<br /><br />One last reason to get these is they are fully digestible, where as rawhide is not.  These go through both dogs without any problems (such as gas)!

Less than 2 days and I got the free shipping with the upgrade.<br /><br />Very nice aroma, full flavor, although the Breakfast blend is lighter flavor, it still leaves a pleasant coffee taste in your mouth.<br /><br />With the coupon, I paid approx. $4 per lb and you cant get bad coffee for that.  Very good and Im ordering more before the sale ends Oct 31, 2007!<br /><br />I put this coffee on par with the Green Mountain coffee and this is much less, but I love GM!

review/text: I really must disagree with the other two reviewers.  I have found the aroma of this blend to be bitter, acidic and burnt.  That carries over and makes for a pretty lousy cup of coffee.  However, it isn't undrinkable and I suppose I'd put it on a par with what one would get from a cheap supermarket choice.<br /><br />Now, to be fair to Cafe Altura I want to note that there was air in my bag.  I don't know if this is unusual or if they do not vacuum pack their beans (which would lead to oxidation fairly quickly and hence the bitter aroma).

I also make full pots of this to make iced coffee which is very refreshing and not overbearing. I would definitely order this again.

Brewing gives off a nice aroma, the beans are evenly roasted, and the taste is just right for us. We do recommend this organically grown coffee. It sure beats the national brands coffee from the supermarket.

review/text: For me, this is not a morning tea but it's a nice digestive in the afternoon, after a meal, or a much needed pick-me-up in the evening. I'll save you'll the explanation of why ginger is good for digestion - you can easily find a lot more info on this online.<br /><br />If you haven't tried Ginger tea before I suggest making some at home to try and only buying this if you're satisfied with the taste. It's really easy, just make green tea like you normally would along with about 1/8th of an inch of grated or chopped ginger root per cup, lastly add a few drops of lemon/lime juice when you're done steeping the tea.<br /><br />Alternatively, you may find this tea in your local grocery store in a single pack, which is a worthwhile investment before going for the 6-pack here on Amazon.<br /><br />When I am home I make it from scratch as described, I bought these tea bags to keep in the office or take with me when I travel. The ginger/lime combination is very refreshing and stays surprisingly potent for a packaged product.<br /><br />Overall, recommended but be warned that Ginger Green tea is an acquired taste and you will be disappointed if you are expecting a regular green tea.

review/summary: Excellent Dog Treat
review/text: My ultra finicky American Eskimo dog, Precious, loves these treats. I buy this brand because they are manufactured in the US not China. Originally I bought the duck jerky PetsMart carried, which was from China and it made Precious extremely ill. Now I only buy treats made in the US or Canada. These particular treats are best for smaller size dogs, big dogs would probably gulp them down instead of chewing them up.

review/summary: LOVE THE STUFF!!!
review/text: In all the years I've shopped on Amazon, I've never written a review.  But after reading the only two written for this coffee, I'm compelled.<br /><br />  My husband and I have drunk this coffee for years and now live in rural Illinois where we have no access to it.  On a whim I looked on Amazon this morning and was stunned to see it.<br /><br />  We brought 20 pounds with us when we moved from Seattle and have just about gone through what we have.  I have served it to my elderly aunt here in Illinois, and she loves with it.  My sister and brother-in-law also give it high praise.<br /><br />  I would describe this coffee as strong, rich, and well balanced in flavor.  As with many things in life, it's "to each his own" when it comes to coffee.  I, for one, think this is a fabulous product.  At the Costco store where I shopped in Seattle, it was an ever-present product that seemed to sell well.  I am THIRLLED to find it on Amazon!!!  I've found my new source!!

review/summary: Maybe I'm being unfair because of my dark roast bias, but...
review/text: ...this coffee tastes horrible.<br /><br />Having not learned my lesson to never look a gift horse in the mouth, I complain every chance I get about this smelly swill my employer buys to caffeinate the troops. In fact, it is this sort of indiscretion that lead me to bringing my own press pots, digital gram scale, and Costco french roast (yes, lowly mass-batched beans!) to work.<br /><br />If all you're looking for is a caffeine buzz, this will do the trick. But the cost is an acidic after taste that camps out on the tongue for the next few hours. Usually, I equate lighter roasts such as these with "inoffensive," i.e. suitable for general audiences, including those who don't want a coffee to overwhelm them. Some (myself included) might even say "bland."  In acts of desperation when supplies are running low, I've supplemented my mellow dark roast with a scoop or two of this -- and its "flavor" adds a sour exclamation point that can't be masked.<br /><br />I'm not the only one who detests this brew: a few of my coworkers have similar sentiments, though are either too cheap to bring their own, or just aren't as passionate (aka abnormal) as I. And maybe this is work's way of cutting down on coffee consumption, which isn't all bad since there are Peet's and Starbucks nearby.

review/summary: Returning Customer
review/text: I bought 5 pounds a few months ago and am now buying another bag. I love restaurant coffee, maybe because it brings back many happy memories of sipping coffee in diners and chatting with friends. I was looking for a coffee that would capture that same aroma and flavor. This restaurant blend coffee does just that.<br /><br />I have been a coffee drinker for 60 years and have passed through the stage of drinking the over-roasted, over-powered stuff you get at Starbucks. I prefer a smoother, less acid drink; but more flavorful than the Brazilian blends. I give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Best coffee ever for price and flavor! Wish all Costcos sold it
review/text: I've been drinking this coffee for many years now and have taken to buying bags of it when I'm in the Bay Area Costco to bring to places I'm going to that don't carry it.  I think it is fantastic, especially for the price and I used to work at a pre-Peets/Starbucks coffee place in Cleveland back in the day and I lived up the street in Berkeley from the original Peets so I think I can judge a good coffee. I'm thinking the ones that don't like it are not paying for it and when the boss or someone else pays of course it isn't going to be as good as what you'd get at specialty coffee places. When it comes down to price and flavor, this is the best but try to buy it at a Bay Area Costco and pack it in your suitcase as the price here at Amazon (and on Costco.com) is too high. These bags should cost no more than $30 with shipping.

review/summary: Why? How?
review/text: Why? Why does this coffee exist? I have never had coffee that tasted this bad. Why would anyone make something like this?<br /><br />How does one make coffee taste so terrible that you must force yourself to swallow each and every sip. I would much rather take shots of bottom shelf tequila. Coffee like this is the reason why Starbucks and other coffee chains are still in business. Not because they make great coffee, but because they make palatable coffee.<br /><br />If there is any suggestion I can provide, please refrain from purchasing this coffee. If you are desperate for your caffeine fix then you may consider this, but please do not you will save yourself pain and suffering.
