review/summary: Pretty intense
review/text: I got the Mystic Morning flavor, and if this is what a medium roast from this brand tastes like, I wonder how deep their dark roasts go. It's a bracing flavor profile in the morning, the kind of coffee that'll put hair on your chest. If you want your coffee strong enough to get up and walk away on its own, this is for you. Bear in mind though that an 8 oz pack will not go very far.

review/summary: Coffee is ...
review/text: ...one of my favorite pleasures in life and I decided to try this brand once it was on sale for under $6. A bit lighter coffee then I'm used to but it was smooth and well rounded with just the right amount of nutty after taste. I'll be watching for the whole bean since I'm sure it will heighten the flavor. Actually bought some interest in the company (JAMN) since i think Mr. Marley has a winning product. Sure would be fun to sit down with him and listen to stories about his father over a cup of this Joe!

Lightly held together with a candy glue and cut into little squares. Well, how could I possibly  resist? Into the shopping cart they went along with a nice-looking bag of trail mix. I love snacks like this. They're tasty and satisfy my snacking urges, yet they're made out of nutritious ingredients including protein and fiber. Did I mention that they're fresh and delicious? Plus, they have limited saturated fat, no trans fat and not very much sugar. Mmmmm, good. A Perfect treat, just so I don't eat too many.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Not too bad
review/text: It's hard to describe the taste of this version of MiO (Green Thunder, originally 'Thunder Punch'). It tastes close to green apple, green Kool-Aid, or a non-carbonated green Monster energy drink. However, it's definitely better than its current counterpart Black Cherry in my humble opinion. While both have a syrup-like texture, Green Thunder is much more enjoyable. Try small amounts in clear-colored drinks such as Water, Sprite, or Sierra-Mist.<br /><br />Note, I had to dig on the internet to find the nutrient/caffeine numbers since the nutrition facts per servings are based on percentages. However, besides having zero (0) of most common facts which MiO is branded for (calories, sugar, carbs, etc.) and only 10mg of sodium, here's what I came up with for the caffeine and B-complex:<br /><br />Caffeine: 60mg (20mg less than Red Bull, and quite a few premium coffees)<br />B3 (Niacin) - 10% daily value - 1.8mg<br />B6 (Pyridoxine) - 10% daily value - 0.2mg<br />B12 (Cobalamine) - 10% daily value - 0.6�g (0.0006mg)<br />&lt;2% mixture of Taurine, Guarana Extract, and Ginseng Extract (Panax)<br />*Side Note: B-vitamin consumption and overdose is really a non-issue with over the counter mixtures. Over abundance in your system will usually be urinated out, and quite a few other energy supplements have 6000% to 8000% of daily value B-vitamins (5-hour).<br /><br />While it doesn't come too close to the effects of main stream energy supplements and drinks, it has about the same effect as a light homemade cup of coffee with B vitamins. It also doesn't add to you calorie count if you're mixing it with water during your morning and afternoon shifts at work. And furthermore, being in a convenient container, you can almost take it with you anywhere. Make sure you start out with small amounts if you're sensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />Bottom line: Despite the price, I recommend trying this. Buy this flavor first (if you like the aforementioned described flavors).

I've used old water bottles and filled them with club soda, squirting Mio Green thunder energy until it becomes a 'mountain dew-ish' color (about two squirts) and it's like a whole new drink. It's like a generic brand of an energy drink or soda, but without the damaging sugar that dentists cringe at.

review/text: I'm not exaggerating when I say that I was a hardcore caffeine addict last semester with microbiology and organic chemistry to study for. I'd say 4-5 cups of coffee/day would be an accurate count - that is until I realized how jittery i'd become after my 3rd or 4th cup. I stopped cold turkey once finals ended and the withdrawal effects were horrible - I could not wake up past noon. I always liked how mio made my water taste better, but I wished it had some kind of stimulant effect...and then, voila! mio energy! i was immediately drawn to it's appetizing color and loved its apple/kiwi taste. It's a lot cheaper than buying a cup of coffee/day and it doesn't go bad. I bought a couple - one for my purse, another for my backpack and even gave one to my sister. It's the perfect energy boost for when a yawn creeps up during the middle of the day. boost of energy without the crash!

review/text: Being something of an energy drink junkie, I was eager to try this out and see what it tasted like.  "Green Thunder"? What exactly does that mean..?  My first impression was somewhere between Monster or Mountain Dew, with the sweet tart-ish flavor of Red Bull (even if the radioactive green color is a little unsettling).  Pretty good overall!!  Hard to believe it's zero calorie... I think it tastes great and usually end up putting in more than the two squirts that are recommended. I'm hoping I can use this to wean myself off of Red Bull, seeing as it's much cheaper and waaay lower in calories. In my opinion, Mio has done it again. $4/bottle isn't too bad a price; it's approximately what I can find in grocery stores.

review/summary: Green Monster + Shaved Ice Syrup = Mio Green Thunder
review/text: A lot of people complain about Mio Green Thunder's flavor. I happen to like it. I can't stand drinking plain water so I few squirts of this stuff make it taste pretty good. See, I work full time and go to college full time... So a normal day for me is 2-3 cups of coffee then about half way through the day I drink a Rockstar or Monster. Over time I've become somewhat immune to caffeine so even after drinking all this I never feel jittery.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll give a quick run down of Mio Energy. It taste like Green Monster without the carbonation and has a slight syrupy texture found in shaved ice. The good thing about Mio is that you can mix it light or strong depending on preference. Sometimes I squirt some in my mouth because I don't mind the taste and it reminds me of warhead candies when it is concentrated. I think from reading the other reviews that the user put too much or expected this to taste like koolaid or something. If you read the contents you will know that it will have a slight flinstone vitamin-ish flavor to it. Mio doesn't give me a huge boost like a good cup of coffee might. But add this to a bottle of water and it's enough to keep you steady throughout your day.

review/text: The good news is that this caffeine-infused death syrup works - it'll keep you up all night, every night, for the rest of what's left of your meager life. The taste is weird, but not terrible: extremely tart, extremely sweet, and the aftertaste of burning tooth enamel is actually relatively pleasant. The bad news is that if you drink this, even once, your internal organs will prolapse and/or solidify, not necessarily in any specific order.<br /><br />Overall: RECOMMENDED!

Being an active middle school kid, I know you really need a little pick-me-up some days. I keep a bottle in my bookbag when I need it.<br /><br />As for the taste, its not to bad. It kind of tastes like monster. Its got green apple hints and tastes a little like punch. I like it enough to drink it again. :)

review/summary: PLASTIC bottle! Oils absorbe PVCs even at room temperature.
review/text: I have been using lots and lots of Bertolli Oil for long time. I use it only raw, so I can fully appreciate its flavor.<br />I was really pleased to see it here on Amazon, at a price that is slightly lower than in any local stores.<br /><br />What a huge disappointment it was to see, upon delivery, that the bottle was cheap transparent plastic.<br /><br />Decent quality extra virgin olive oil MUST be in glass bottles or at most cans (e.g. Carli oil has some big cans along with glass bottles), even better if dark glass, because light also deteriorates its quality. I am Italian, in Italy extra virgin olive oil is a staple and people use a lot of it. But I have never seen any extra virgin oil sold in plastic, in 24 years that I've lived in Italy.<br /><br />I could not believe that they ruined the Bertolli oil storing it in cheap plastic, and the taste reflects this poor storage. It does not nearly have the same rich taste as the oil that is stored in glass. I believe this is because it has been stored for too long in that worthless bottle. It expires in 1 year so probably it was bottled about 10 months ago.<br /><br />This oil as it is in the plastic is really not worth the price, for the taste it has, you can find some better oils for lower price (while to me the Bertolli oil in glass bottles is UNBEATABLE for its rich taste, and I have tried many many oils).<br />This is why I am canceling my subscription and I am going back buying again the same oil in a local store that sells it in respectable glass bottles.<br /><br />You can google "extra virgin olive oil plastic" and you'll find many results that advice to stay away from plastic bottles as oils absorb PVCs a lot, even at room temperature. This is unhealthy and it also affects the taste of the oil. Some people think this is no big deal because they cannot notice any difference in taste. But it is a matter of fact that, even if you cannot taste anything different, the oil deteriorates in plastic. Many other foods are perfectly fine stored in plastic, I am not against plastic at all! But not oils, especially the less refined (extra virgin) ones.

review/summary: Another Great Multi-Purpose Product
review/text: I am a great believer in olive oil, especially the benefits of cooking with extra virgin olive oil and name brand olive oil. Bertolli is consistent in quality, and extra virgin is less fattening even if the taste is supposedly not as good as the 100% pure variety. It's great as an oil and vinegar combination for salads, and in this poor economy, you will also find that it makes a great hair conditioner that is much cheaper than real hair conditioner.<br /><br />As I said two products ago, you do what you have to do.

review/summary: Bertolli Extra Virgin Olive Oil - Nice Taste and Good Quality
review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHPNI0">Bertolli Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Super Value Size, 51-Ounce Bottle</a> is a nice product.  The taste is definitely great and this oil is much more flavorful than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHR2MU">Bertolli Extra Light Olive Oil, Super Value Size, 51-Ounce Bottle</a>.  Extra virgin olive oil is much tastier for salads or simple recipes than the light olive oil.<br /><br />Of course you have to make sure you are getting the proper oil for your needs and recipes.  Sometimes the light olive oil is called for by certain recipes.  Some people also need to use *light* for health reasons. Olive oil is generally considered to be healthy so those people should be the exception.<br /><br />The other thing to keep in mind is the price.  This is one of those products where it really pays to subscribe.  It's on the expensive side anyway, but subscribing makes it more bearable.<br /><br />You can never have too much high quality olive oil when you love to cook.  This stuff gets used quickly.  So even though it's a nice sized bottle don't be afraid to subscribe!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I have to admit, I am an Olive Oil snob. I cook alot and extra virgin is most generally my choice. Now most of you know, that oils and vinegers run the gamit as far as price is concerned. The better the quality....the more you pay. For a passionate cook who also watches the budget, this olive oil fits the bill. Great quality at a good price. Nothing beats the smoking point like olive oil as far as my cooking goes. I keep several kinds of oil in my pantry and they all do different things, so do not assume that all oils are the same or deliver the same performance. Read up on their "specialties" for good quality results. I have this oil on auto delivery and it is just about gone when I receive my next order!

review/summary: Candy for Grown-up Tastes
review/text: I found this tasty candy on vacation, but alas there are some drawbacks to small town shopping.  That's why I was happy to find these available on Amazon. It is a very strong flavor, not sugared up for general consumption.  If you're a fan of the instense flavors found in Altoids, you'll appreciate Chimes.  The peanut butter may cut the bitterness of ginger, but in no way distracts from the intense flavor.  And when the candy is gone, you have a nifty tin for sewing notions, little bits of hardware, or any sundry of small things in need of a sturdy box in which to hold them.

Having loved the original flavor of Life cereal since as far back as I can remember I wasn't sure how they could add cinnamon to it and make it work - they did.  I'm one that loves to mix cereals and this one mixed with the Cinnamon Burst Cheerio's - love it so much I pretty much have this every day!<br />Get a box and try it!  If you enjoy cinnamon AND you enjoy original I think you'll enjoy this.

I'm a big fan of "sticky" cereal, and what I mean by that is cereal that is not soggy but not out-of-the-box crunchy, either. This cereal turns to oatmeal mush fairly quickly (I hate oatmeal, oddly), so if you like it less-than-soggy, you have to be quick or go easy on the milk. It tastes fantastic, though. It's not too sugary nor does it taste like cardboard. It's just right, honestly, and it's a lot healthier than a lot of other cereals (although it is not the healthiest). A bowl of this while watching LOTR is a perfectly comforting combination for some reason. (:

review/text: I have begun purchasing all of my cereal in bulk from Amazon and have had great success so far. This 6-pack arrived padded and shrink wrapped, in great shape. I think the cereal itself is more delicate in nature to some other types of cereal and I suspect it may be ever so slightly more subject to settling that heartier cereals. The package I received all had an extremely good date.<br /><br />As far as the taste, Cinnamon Life is fantastic and mild - not too heavy on the cinnamon. It has slightly more sugar than regular Life and I think I can taste that extra bit. One of my top picks.

review/summary: Awesome cereal at a very reasonable price
review/text: Life cereal is quite tasty. Cinnamon Life is even better. It's sweet, but not so sickeningly sweet that only a child could like it. I'm an adult and I enjoy eating it regularly.<br /><br />What's better than Cinnamon Life? Cinnamon Life at Amazon prices. The "regular price" for a box of this cereal at local grocery stores is in the neighborhood of $3-4. Outrageous. I commonly see supermarkets offer it for $2.00 in their weekly ads. That's more reasonable.<br /><br />However, Amazon's regular price undercuts even the supermarket sale price if you choose the Subscribe and Save option. Plus, when you do Subscribe and Save you can choose your shipment rate based on your consumption rate, never have to worry about running out, and get free shipping! What's not to love?

review/text: Although the cereal is a great tasting cereal I gave this one star because the price of $41.50 that they are selling it for here on Amazon is rediculous!!! That's almost $7 a box. I don't know about you but I know I've never paid $7 for a box of cereal. Wal-Mart sells the 21 oz. (6 pack) of Life Cinnamon cereal for $19.68. Just make sure you shop around because when you see a deal that you think may be to good to be true, it probably is NOT a good deal.

review/text: Best you know you are buying a Northerners idea of collard soup.  It is really white bean soup but tasty!  It is worth buying due to the short prep time.  Tastes like you simmerered the beans all day.  By the time you cook the corn bread the soup is also ready to eat!<br /><br />High starch but good fiber source as well.  Serves two very generously and definitely three, maybe four, with smaller appetites or extra sides.<br /><br />Did I mention tasty?  Just do not expect collard soup with lots of collards.

review/summary: Great coffee when the price is right
review/text: I love my coffee and have tried all the name brands as well as some generic.  I always come back to Folgers Classic Roast.  It is the perfect medium blend and the taste is rich, suberb and totally satisfying.  Great for the morning pick me up or any other time of day.  But coffee is getting expensive.  The large containers of all brands used to come in 39 oz sizes.  Then they went down to 33 ounces for the same price.  Now many are going down to this new 22 ounce size.  I am amazed in the stores at the high price of coffee now.  This Folgers coffee here on Amazon is an amazing deal for price and quality of coffee when you use subscribe and save.  You get three canisters, a total of 66 ounces, for $19.49.  It comes out even cheaper to what two 33 ounce used to cost in the store.  And my local store just had this 22 ounce size on sale for $8.99. For 3 that's $8 more than this great Amazon deal.<br /><br />This review is definitely about the superb Folgers coffee though.  I must add that I also find the 22 ounce size very user friendly for the coffee stays fresh longer due to the smaller size.  Same amount of coffee in 3 canisters rather than 2 for the same price.  But as always there are some sellers on here trying to rip the buyer off when Amazon is out of stock.  No coffee is worth the ridiculous prices some will charge.  $47 for this?  Be real.  Just be certain to purchase it from the ever reliable Amazon themselves and you will be getting the best coffee out there at an unbeatable price.  Love Folgers and Amazon.

review/summary: The best flavor for the price
review/text: Folgers classic roast has been my trusted brand for coffee most of my life.  I have tried other cheap coffees, but this one is by far better for it's rich aroma and taste.  More recently I started buying the smaller 22.6 ounce container whenever the grocery store has it marked at least a dollar lower.  The reason for this is the larger container can last me about two months.  Toward the last couple weeks, the rich flavor is noticeably reduced.  With this smaller size, I don't have to worry about finishing it before that happens.<br /><br />I would recommend buying this at the local  store if it is available in your area as it is a bit cheaper that way.  I can usually pick it up for about $6 each  at Homeland.<br /><br />Edited to Add- Due to rising prices.  The average for this size of coffee is now $7.99 at my local store which can make Amazon the better deal.

review/text: I've tried different brands, and different roasts, including gourmet coffees, but I always keep coming back to Folgers Classic.  To me, it offers a smooth, relatively full bodied flavor, without being overpowering or bitter.<br /><br />Happily, it is usually among the lower priced coffees.  I don't buy on price alone, so this is an added bonus for me.

They last a lot longer in your mouth than cough drops, and there's lots of people who praise honey (particularly Manuka honey) and its medicinal properties. I figured it couldn't hurt.<br /><br />One thing I do not like is the overall shape of the lozenges. They're like 2 small rectangles stuck together, and it's a very weird shape to have in your mouth. Just imagine a lego block in your mouth; that's these lozenges. The rough edges will relatively quickly become smooth in your mouth, but it's a general irritation that these aren't made in a more mouth-friendly shape.

review/text: This salt has a pinkish color and is said to come from sea salt deposits deep in the Himalayan mountains.  Ok.  All I can say is it tastes great.  If you taste this next to regular table salt, you will never use that nasty tasting table salt again.  We also taste tested it against another brand of sea salt, and this one was much better tasting.<br /><br />I wish I had the words to describe the taste, but sadly I do not.  I feel at a loss for words, like when cigar taster James Suckling reviews cigars in Cigar Aficionado magazine and describes the taste as "chocolate, earthy, with hints of leather and cinnamon"  ???  I just don't get it, I have smoked those cigars and never taste chocolate or leather, or some of the other wacky flavors.  But they do taste good, and his descriptions make them sound soo much better.<br /><br />All I can say is get some of this salt, you will not be disappointed.

The good thing about this salt is 1.) it's not toxic to your body like regular tablesalt, and 2.) it has a much bolder flavor, so you end up using way less than your used to, but still achieving a great flavor in each dish.  I cook meals from scratch every day and i know this salt is going to last me a while, so i believe it's a great deal.

review/summary: Old favorite
review/text: We used to buy this coffee pretty often but the local supermarkets started cutting back on selections and raising prices and the Community whole bean coffees became expensive and not always available.  While the price of coffees seem to be rising recently, I found Amazon's price for this coffee to be a little lower than the local grocer's prices and the convenience of ordering it is unquestionable.<br /><br />Community coffee was what almost everyone drank when I was growing up in Louisiana.  However, my parents were not Community coffee fans.  When we visited neighbors and relatives, Community coffee was always served.  It was almost always overly strong dark roast that had been warmed over several times and, frankly, I didn't care for it much either.  It was not until several decades later when Community began to market a better quality of coffee in whole bean form that I started drinking it and liking it.  The Private Reserve Louisiana Blend Dark Roast reviewed here is one of their better quality coffees and my personal favorite.  It's nothing like the burnt-out tasting Community coffee I remember from my youth.  This coffee is balanced, smooth and rich.  When bought in whole bean form and ground fresh, it's a great morning cup of joe.<br /><br />Now, Community Coffee Company has been located near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, since it began.  The roasting facilities, to my knowledge, never has been located in New Orleans as a previous poster stated.  Community did open the first of several coffee houses in New Orleans in the mid 1990s, however, the coffee is not roasted in New Orleans.  Since Community Coffee is considered the Official Coffee of Louisiana and is served all over the state--including New Orleans--those who are unfamiliar with the state outside New Orleans may be under the misconception that it's New Orleans-based.
