review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: When you first receive this basket you think wow this looks great.  However once you open it you start to realize how not great it is.<br /><br />1.  The most weird thing about this basket is that they items have been repackaged.  There is a box of carmel corn the cover made it look like it was a fake version of the item.  When you open it up you are even more suspicious b/c the caramel corn is inside a wheat thins box! huh? many of the items are similarly repackaged this way.  I would never send someone a basket that is so obviously homemade instead of a legit company.<br /><br />2.  many of the items were so small.  Inside was a tiny box of jelly beans, a one serving of peanuts, cashews etc.  I am use to seeing in baskets a can of nuts not a single serving snack travel pack. Also some of the items were a little strange to me - German hot mustard in a green tube...it didn't seem to match the caramel corn, jelly beans, nuts and crackers.  There was a package of sausage but still...<br /><br />3.  never heard of the brands -- now this could just be me.  these may be very famous brands and people know them all over the world.  But with the suspect packaging I thought the food itself was also of a lower class.  After tasting the items such as the caramel corn - which was stale, Hit cookies which were blah an oreo is better, and the malt shop taffies not very tasty, my disappointment just grew.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone.  you could build a better basket on your own or go with a well known company.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br />after I wrote this review Black Mountian now ig4U sent me a new basket.  It was packaged so much better.  It didn't look scary fake like the first one did.  I appreciate the company's effort to make right something that was not good.  I think that a person would be ok sending out their new and improved baskets.  I still stick to my original post that I think the food items were boring and not names that people would know but they tasted fine this time.  I change my star rating to 3 stars.

review/summary: The "real" basket is very nice
review/text: I got this as a vine item to review, and the first one I received was not gift-worthy.  It looked good in the packaging, but once you took it apart, things had been recycled and repackaged.<br /><br />A few weeks later, I received the "real" package with a note saying that they had accidentally sent a protoypye and that this was the real gift package.<br /><br />*Whew*<br /><br />I really enjoyed the second one.  The food was fresh and in its correct packaging.  There is an incredible selection from jelly bellies to summer sausage to caramels to nuts.  I love the mustard that goes with the sausage.  I'm not a big fan of the pretzels.  The cheese spread was pretty good.  The Biscoffee cookies were awesome.  I think there could have been a few more crackers - after all, there was both cheese and sausage to put them on.  The taffy was nice and soft (I like the root beer best).  I like the basket that it comes in - it's small but sturdy.  I ended up with two baskets, and they are probably going to be gifted to others next Christmas with cookies in them.

review/summary: Very poor value
review/text: I was given this gift basket as a Christmas present. I thought it extremely poor value. It consists mainly of large packages with minimal contents. For example just 5 biscuits, or 3 pretzels. I imagine many of the items were given away by the manufacturers as samples. Even the airlines do better than this.

review/summary: Would never send these poorly repackaged items as a gift!
review/text: At first glance, the Snackalicious Food Gift Basket by Back Mountain Baskets looks like your average snackable goodie basket, complete with various nuts, cookies, pretzels, cheese, dried sausage and candy.<br /><br />It's upon closer inspection that we realized that many of the items have in fact been repackaged with tacky glossy paper featuring inferior color Xeroxes of the original labels, poorly wrapped around repurposed cartons.<br /><br />In other words, the ill-fitting glossy paper with the obviously reproduced MmmmPop! All Natural White Cheddar Popcorn label is barely concealing a reused box of Nabisco Wheat Thins Stix.  Open that up and you'll find a tiny bag of the promised popcorn.<br /><br />Peel back the paper with the color printer copy of Wege of Hanover Sourdough Hards Pretzels and you'll find an old, taped-up box of Cheez-Its, inside of which is a small package of the pretzels.  And lurking behind the paper packaging of the All Natural Fleur De Sel Caramels from France?  Mmmm--a box of irresistible Crystal Light Energy drink Mix.  Inside that are a handful of the advertised caramels.<br /><br />If all this tacky repurposing was part of some green recycling initiative on the part of Back Mountain, then they should have included a note that explained their company philosophy.  But there's no such note--just the feeling that they simply used other boxes so they'd stand up better in the baskets/look more substantial/disguise the fact that some of the items have been divvied up from cost-saving bulk packaging.<br /><br />The end result is something that looks like it was assembled in your own kitchen rather than something you'd order from a presumed legitimate company with the intention of sending to someone as a respectable gift.

review/summary: A snack for everyone in the family
review/text: Bought it for a gift.  Arrived in perfect condition and made a great presentation.  There was something in the basket for everyone in the family.  Products were all the favorite snacks like nuts, cookies, taffy, summer sausage but much more intriguing - the basket was opened immediately so everyone could try a Malt Shop Taffy (chocolate shake, rootbeer float and cherry cola!).  The all natural nuts were fresh and crunchy and the sausage was delicious on its own but even better with the mustard that accompanied it.<br /><br />*I ordered this basket when my wife gave me the task of buying a present for a party. In my quick perusal of Amazon, I felt I completed my assignment perfectly.  My wife, of course, checked up on my order and was horrified to see I ordered something that received some 1 star reviews.  The days were looooong until the package showed up and I was accused, more than once, of not being detail oriented enough.  Thankfully I was absolutely vindicated when the basket arrived.  After reading the other reviewers (and reading what "vine" was) clearly there was a mix up with the baskets sent to that program - that seems to happen early so they are the first reviews - which unfortunately caused me agita (why I am even taking the time to write this).  I hope no one else will be confused by this very strange situation.  And no, if I realized I would have been in the dog house for the shipping period, I wouldn't have picked this item -- however, for the record, I was right.

review/text: Growing up in England, Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles were about as common as a hershey bar would be here in the U.S. When I found out I could order these on Amazon I jumped at the chance, and waited impatiently for them to arrive!<br /><br />Usually when it comes to candy, I pick out anything that is the color red or purple, but I think one of the most magical qualities of these Fruit Pastilles, is that almost every flavor is WONDERFUL. Seriously, I'm not exaggerating!<br /><br />These aren't the cheapest, but they are imported, and are well worth the premium. Even if you didn't grow up with them, give them a try...you will be pleasantly surprised!

review/summary: Great idea and easy to use with a meal
review/text: I have enjoyed using Urbani's truffle oils before to add some truffle flavor to dishes or meals but this weekend we tried Truffle Thrills.  We used one can mixed with pasta that took seconds to prepare and cook.  The truffles just need to be warmed and added to the pasta, we used some of the truffles as a spread and it was a great starter.  We also used the second can to top off some fresh cod and it gave the fish a great taste of truffles and artichokes.  What I like best beyond the taste of the truffles is just how easy it is to use and get the great taste that can only be found in truffles.

review/summary: They Can Do Better
review/text: I'm a huge fan of VitaCoco because their basic coconut water is fresh, tasty, not from concentrate and a much more natural gym drink than Gatorade.  I also am a huge fan of buying VitaCoco over Amazon because it's a whole lot cheaper than GNC or the random delis that sell their products.  And I'm a big fan of Rihanna's music.  Sadly, I am *not* a fan of this Rihanna-inspired flavor.  The sugar (evaporated cane juice) seems unnecessary and counter to the health marketing... just user riper fruit!  Also, I'm not a fan of dragonfruit since its actually a very bland, watery fruit despite the cool name and appearance.  If you want tropical then stick with their Pineapple, Tangerine or Passionfruit flavors!

review/summary: Extremely nasty. Cannot drink.
review/text: When I bought this, there were no ingredients to be found. Not here. Not on the maker's lame web site.  From what I could tell by the photo, it looks like coconut water, pineapple, orange and watermelon... and that sounded really good.<br /><br />I actually complained to the company that there was no information, and they added the content to this page.  As you will see, it now says "coconut water, pink guava, oranges, red dragon fruit, and pineapple"... and gross.<br /><br />I don't know where the pink guava and whatever the frig red dragon fruit is on the photo, but apparently what I thought was a watermelon is one of the two.  I have also tasted the plain coconut water, and the only good thing about that is that it is a base to add with something else.  The only combination that works and is tolerable to drink is the coconut and pineapple combo.  And even after a couple of those, you don't really enjoy it.  But this tropical fruit case is still in my fridge.  I tried 4 different times, and each time I have had to dump it.<br /><br />... and Rihanna is certainly not a selling plus for me. I can't tolerate her either.

review/text: I really feel it is not the flavor that is causing the problem; it tastes rotten so I'm wondering if the packager let some part of the juice sit out too long.  I haven't had a problem with VitaCoco products prior to this so I really think that is what happened.  I am also concerned because these comments have not been addressed by the company.  In my opinion, these should be recalled.

review/summary: Tropical fruit taste makes it
review/text: Two good things about this drink come to mind, when compared to other similar products. The 17-0z container has a screw top that is so much better than the foil strip on the 11-oz one. Also the tropical fruit flavor is much better than the acai-pomegrante flavor of the 11-oz variety. Coco water has a unique taste that for me, at least needs to be masked, even though I like the best concept that coco water is better hydration than plain water or the store energy drinks.

review/summary: I love coconut water, but this is not good at all.
review/text: I really thought the reviews were mixed because some people just don't like coconut water, so I ordered this.  It is NOT good at all.  In fact it has weird smell to it.  It is in my refrigerator, but I think I will have to throw them all away as I cannot get myself to drink it.  I did drink 1/2 of one mixed with orange juice and it didn't taste bad, but just thinking about that weird smell makes me not want to drink any more of it.<br /><br />I have bought other Vita Coco Coconut Water in the past and loved every one of them.  I should have passed on this one.  It really isn't drinkable, in my opinion.

All the cartons had a foul odor and brown gunk around the lip.  So Amazon sent me replacement.

review/text: I love tropical fruits and thought this would be great, boy was I wrong!  They put so much dragon fruit flavor in it that it drowns out any of the other fruits and that is all I can taste.  Not a tropical fruit BLEND.  A little dragon fruit goes a long way and they way over did it here.  Too bad, I like the other vita coco choices and was shocked at how bad this tastes.  If you are a fan of dragon fruit, you will love this!  If not, take a pass and get a different flavor.

Since they had a deal on this flavored one, I figured I'd try it. Bad call. It tastes so bad, that I'm debating just tossing it all out. I've even had two friends try it, and neither one liked it - wondering if it went bad, or was meant to taste bad.<br /><br />Moral of the story? If you want to try something new, don't buy a 12-pack.

review/summary: Worst packaging and drink ever!
review/text: I was hesitant of buying this product since there were so many mixed reviews. I decided to try it since I enjoy coconut water. I have been to the Caribbean and enjoyed water coconuts and fresh exotic fruits, so I thought I would love this. I was excited when this arrived. I opened it up and the smell threw me back. When I twisted the cap, the pouring spout ripped away from the carton, which made the ease of storing much more difficult. I tried a sip and it was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. It tasted bitter and it smelled like burnt rubber. I have tried several of the exotic fruits listed in the ingredients, but this drink tasted nothing like them. I tried chilling it to see if it made the taste better and there was no improvement. If you are expecting this to taste like real coconut water, you will surely be disappointed. Fortunately I purchased this on Amazon and their customer service has been awesome and taking care of this issue.

review/summary: Do yourself a favor and try a bit first..
review/text: I bought this on sale and thought it was a great deal.  How can one go wrong with coconut juice?  Apparently Vita can with their tropical version.  I haven't tried their plain coconut juice, so I don't know what that's like, but I can assure you that the tropical one is very difficult to drink.<br /><br />One would think it's very tasty due to the mixture of fruits, but it's not.  Imagine drinking coconut juice and adding a bit of sour and a bit of sweet -- that's what this is.  Some people may like it, but it's just not good in my opinion.  To me, it seems like Vita had a bunch of excess juice from other products and decided to just mix it all together with a splash of coconut.<br /><br />It's not worth the regular price, and not even worth the sale price (I purchased these for under ten dollars for the pack of 12).

review/summary: not very good
review/text: I do love coconut water, it is very refreshing on a hot day. This one was on sale and sounded pretty good. Well it is not that good. The coconut uses must not be YOUNG coconuts. Water from young coconuts have the sweetest flavor. This had an almost stale flavor the was slightly covered up by the tropical fruit added. Usually I have to hide the coconut water from my 3 kids or they will drink all of it in a few days. I put all of this one in the fridge and now, 2 weeks later, there is still more than half left. The base coconut flavor was just not right. I have tried several different brands using subscribe and save and the best is "Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp" I have been to SE Asia and had coconut water there from street vendors and restaurants, it is simply delicious. Taste Nirvana is a close the that FRESH wonderful flavor that I have found so far. I would not buy this one if you are not sure, there are much better ones out there.

review/text: To all the reviewers who is giving this a bad reviews, I could understand if you tasted it and do not like it, because not everyone has the acquired taste for this drink.  However, I think this drink is awesome, and being from the Caribbean, this is just perfect.  I love, love this drink.  I should mention to everyone, it is an acquired taste.  If you are not familiar with coconut water and certain kinds of tropical fruit, you probably will not like this.  This is so refreshing, nice and cold.  Thanks Rihanna.

review/summary: Best coconut water.
review/text: Vita Coco has the best coconut water of any and I have tried most of them.  I love the tropical fruit flavor.  It has a distinctive guava flavor.  For those who do not like this flavor, it is probably because they don't like Guava or tropical fruit.  You can add some of the Vita Coco Pineapple to it and make your own fruit flavor.  I usually mix it with the pineapple or the passion fruit.  I also believe that coconut water has helped build my immune system and I drink it every day.  This is a great product.  So not be afraid to purchase because of the negative reviews.  I would give it an AAA***+++++.

review/summary: Flavor not good and container lid was unglued on half of them
review/text: Some of the other flavors in this brand of Coconut water's are very good. This one is nasty in my opinion. Also the screw on lid and the part it screw onto had come unglued. This is the only flavor I had trouble with but out of my 2 cases half were unglued. The product wasn't hurt so I just poured them into a glass but it was a little inconvenient. Otherwise I LOVE this brand. I like the pineapple coconut the best.

review/summary: Never again!
review/text: I purchased this thinking "what a great deal!" Now I know why it was, and it really is a bad deal! First off, several containers were defective. The top parts were not secured (they flipped up), so the screw off top wouldn't work properly. Second, really didn't like the taste. Thought I would as I love the Peach/Mango, but this is awful, doesn't taste @ all like tropical fruit! Perhaps, this was just a fluke (defective bottles, bad taste), & I realize all tastes are different, so some may like it. The defects were just insult to injury...  Turned out to be a big waste!

If you want vita coco I recommend the tangerine, pineapple, or even the plain flavors. Those are good.  This flavor is not.

review/summary: Refreshing~~~
review/text: I read the negative reviews AFTER I made the order. So I was worried when I tried the first pack. Apart from having more fruit taste, this is as good as the original Vita Coco Coconut Water. I still don't understand why other people don't like it. One possibility is, if "fruit" only means oranges and apples (and nothing else) to you, you probably won't like the "exotic" fruit taste here.

review/text: If so, you should like this.  I guess some people expected a more traditional "tropical fruit", like fruit punch, or pineapple or something.  But this is basically guava, with its associated "creaminess" from the pulp.<br /><br />I like it, the kids like it, the wife doesn't.  Ordered the second pack already, because the first won't last long.<br /><br />It's DEFINITELY better than the acai-pomegranate, so I'd say it's a safer buy than that flavor.<br /><br />As a side note, my daughter says it has less sugar than the peach-mango.

review/summary: According to CNN's report on VitaCoCo....
review/text: (update)According to an article on CNN.com on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the label.<br />"Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.<br /><br />The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., almost matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount."<br /><br />I ordered two to try out from Amazon but while waiting on the delivery, I was out shopping when I observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk/water! I bought one brand-name from Lucky's Super Market and another brand from Walgreen's next door. Being of Polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland, I thought, "Hmmm..all these centuries coconuts been around, suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting. Let's see what the catch is". Both were almost $3.00 but only a particular brand I bought at Lucky's taste like REAL COCONUT MILK 'WATER/Milk' right out the coconut. In Asia, coconut milk comes from "soaking the flesh of the older coconut". But I'm not from Asia which is why I call it coconut milk & not coconut water right of the coconut.<br /><br /> Finally, VitaCoCo came. I tasted it and spit it right out. It didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all'. Then I looked to see where it was produced. Before I go further let me explain something to those who may not know. Agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands, or from the Caribbean islands. You won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world. Vita CoCo says it is produced by a company in Latin America, Brazil. Produced for All Markets Inc. New York, NY. My sister then poured some into a glass and screamed, "OMG They're ripping people off! It's watered down!" She said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it. Some less, some more but never crystal clear. The younger the fruit, the richer, more nutritional, and milky the coconut milk. The more mature the fruit, the sweeter & thinner the milk. As the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit. The meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk. So I told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says, 100% pure coconut WATER. It's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water, or this is what Brazilian coconuts taste like (flat)? And it seems like they're using 'over-riped' coconuts. Which makes sense. Then the meat of the coconut could be sold and not tossed out.<br /><br />As for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt, DO NOT rely on Vita Coco's ad. My aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of Vita CoCo and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone. This is also how we knew Vita CoCo must be using over-ripe less nutritional coconuts, or watering it down. I ended up having to prepare the daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime. Drink mango or guava juice all! The most nutritional of all island fruits ;)

review/text: I hate to even say exactly how good this coffee is, for fear when I go back to get more, it'll be sold out!<br /><br />My absolute favorite "special" coffee at a $$$ price has been Kona, with Jamaican Blue Mountain a close second. Both are pricey, making them not for the everyday grind.<br /><br />Last year there was a sale on Camano Island, and after reading various descriptions, the Guatemalan whole beans seemed like a good type to try.<br /><br />I used to buy A&P whole beans, which is a perfectly good brand for every day coffee. But ever since I tried Camano Island, in particular the Guatemalan beans, I haven't bought my usual A&P.<br /><br />Camano Island Guatemala beans are very rich, give a nice flavor, with just the right amount of roasting - not too light to be inconsequential, and not so dark as to remind you of Starbucks BURNT coffee.<br /><br />In fact, this coffee is so good, I haven't even bought Kona or Blue Mountain! This coffee is so excellent, it's as good as the best coffee I've ever had. And on sale (I've had it anywhere from $4 to $6.50 a pound in the five-pound bag), it's a minor miracle!<br /><br />If you use whole beans, I recommend a burr grinder and a good drip pot (I use Cuisinart.) You will NOT be disappointed!<br /><br />But please, don't buy it all. Leave some for the rest of us!

review/summary: The story behind the beer...
review/text: To begin with, I gave this an honest five star review because this gem has been my go to brew for years now. This tripel is delicious, starting with the picture perfect golden head. You're greeted by an aroma that's floral and spicy, and then the taste is slightly sweet with some caramel but also spicy and fruity. The only hint that it's 9% is the warm feeling you get drinking it, because it is deceptively smooth. The presentation in a corked bottle is also nice. Plus the price is great.<br /><br />So, the story behind the beer is that once the recipe was perfected, the head brewers at Unibroue were searching for a name worthy of what was inside the bottle. They wanted a name that respected the history of Quebec as well as the style of the beer. After a while one of them got fed up and yelled in French "Ce n'est pas la fin du monde!" which means it's not the end of the world, were they to not find a name. Inspiration struck, as for the first Europeans, Quebec was considered the edge of the known world.<br /><br />Cheers!

review/summary: La Fin Du Monde!
review/text: La Fin Du Monde (The End of the World),  is a Belgian-style golden ale that hails from Quebec.  It has a robust 9% alcohol by volume ratio, yet it goes down quite smoothly (maybe a little bit too smoothly).  It has a nice full flavor, without being overly sweet.  Moreover, because it's produced in North America, it tends to be about $3 - $5 cheaper per bottle than its Belgian counterparts.  I am a Belgian and Belgian-style beer fanatic, and I consider this particular brand of ale to be one of my top 5 favorite ales.  The 750ml corked bottle is the perfect size for sharing with a friend...that is, if you really want to!

review/summary: ENOUGH TRANSFAT TO STOP A TRAIN IN ITS TRACKS; ENOUGH SUGAR TO INDUCE DIABETIC SHOCK, ENOUGH FLOUR TO BLOCK AN ARTERY BUT
review/text: that irresistible dickensian odor as it warms . . .<br /><br />British culinary experience is not world noted. From London's bangers and mash to Liverpool's scouse to Glasgow's haggis, this Isle of Bad Teeth is not normally sought for its kitchen fare.<br /><br />And so within this small can it comes to us.<br /><br />In Dickens we read of the ravenous appetites consuming the most bizarre items, of Tiny Tim's bag of lard boiled with brandy and a plum, of whatever it was Fagin gave his small boys in London's slums. Here we share a taste of those delights.<br /><br />Do not let this discourage you. Let a can of this sit (opened) in a pan of bubbling hot water, alongside a can of evaporated milk. This in itself makes an adequate holiday pot-pourri, filling your house with cozy warmth, and this is undoubtedly the only safe manner to consume it: olfactory rather than gustatory, considering the transfats, sugars and flour. (Remember my child the warm mothering spirit of Adele Davis, she of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451155505">Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit</a>, warning us of the three white poisons: salt, sugar and refined flour, oh yeah and fats).<br /><br />Yet, for those who truly find this "to die for" place the pudding on one bowl, pour the milk on top, add extra cinnamon, and as desired, honey or molasses over all, and enjoy.<br /><br />Best thing since Indian Pudding!

review/summary: Fantastic white tea for the cost.
review/text: Just in case you're new to White Tea a little background might be helpful...<br /><br />...in a nutshell, White Tea comes from the same plant (Camellia sinesis) that all other tea comes from (e.g. black, green, etc.) but what makes it "White Tea" has to do with when the leaf is harvested and how and to what degree it is processed to yield the final product.  In the case of White Tea, harvest occurs very early in the leaf's life cycle after which it undergoes very minimal processing.  At this early stage the leaf still has a white fur-like coating, hence the "white" moniker.  Also, due to these factors, White Tea also has by far the highest antioxidant content of any other tea and remains superior to all others in terms of healthful qualities.  If you haven't ever researched the health-promoting qualities of tea it's really amazing and worth some research when you have the time.  Tea - especially White Tea - positively impacts everything from cardiovascular disease to cancer to eyesight.  I would definitely rank White Tea (and Green Tea as well) in the "superfood" category on the same level as things like berries, garlic, tomatoes, or salmon. White Tea comes in four primary categories.  From highest grade to lowest they are:  1. Silver Needle White Tea (Bai Hao Yinzhen), 2. White Peony (Bai Mu Dan), 3.  Tribute Eyebrow (Gong Mei), 4. Noble, Long Life Eyebrow (Shou Mei).  White Tea is known for its mellow and delicate mildly-sweet flavor and pale-golden color.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Octavia Organic Silver Needle Tea certainly exemplifies the above qualities.  It isn't bitter or "grassy" in the least and represents a very solid and high quality White Tea. Is it the very best? No.  But then again, some White Teas considered the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me fetch hundreds of dollars and ounce (!!) so considering the cost trade-off this is a great choice. It's very mild and lightly-sweet and tastes wonderful simply plain. The tea comes in a nice resealable air-tight tin.  The leaves themselves are of obvious high quality (whole leaves with  only minimal breakage or other "parts" of the leaf) and smell wonderful.  I should mention here that I also drink <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1W8">Rishi Tea Organic Silver Needle Loose Tea, 1.4-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> another very good tea that I would recommend and bought through Amazon as well, although I slightly prefer the Octavia.<br /><br />...<br /><br />While I'm here I thought I might as well speak briefly about a few related issues that will prove very helpful if you're new to tea, especially high quality loose leaf tea:<br /><br />1.  It's all about the water. Bad water = bad tea.  If you really want to do it right, consider buying some really good water such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267A38Y">Volvic Natural Spring Water, 500ml- Bottles (Pack of 24)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTN6QS">Glacia Norwegian Spring Water, 5 litre Box</a><br /><br />2.  Water temperature.  It's really important to get the water temperature right because if the water is too hot the tea will get bitter and if it's not hot enough the flavor will be weak and less complex.  It's a matter of taste of course but most recommend about 185 degrees for White Tea.  A thermometer such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GE2XF8">RT600C Superfast Waterproof Pocket Thermometer by ThermoWorks</a> will make getting the right temperature a cinch.<br /><br />3.  Brew time.  How long you steep tea profoundly impacts the flavor.  If you brew it too long it will get bitter.  Again, it's all a matter of taste but most recommend 3-5 minutes for White Tea.<br /><br />4. Amount of tea used.  This too is totally a matter of taste, but I mention it only to point out that the robustness and strength of the tea has as much to do with how much you use as your brew method or how long you steep.  For example, say you wanted a stronger flavor.  You could always steep it longer, but you can also simply use more tea, which will yield a totally different end product.  Yeah, both ways will make the tea taste "stronger" but in a completely different way.<br /><br />5.  Brew method.  Of all the issues involved this seems the most confusing.  There are many ways to effectively brew tea.  You may wish to do a little research to find which way works best for you.  But I would offer a few methods that have worked very well for me.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LM0S">Bodum Chambord Coffee Press</a> has become my favorite method of brewing because of ease, simplicity, and efficiency.  Simply throw some tea in the empty press container, boil your water on the stove preferably in a glass stove-top safe vessel such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5X826">Medelco 12-Cup Glass Stovetop Whistling Kettle</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I7FCMO">GROSCHE GLASGOW Glass Teapot and Kettle with Infuser - Stovetop Safe , 1000 ml 34 Fl Oz capacity</a>, let it cool slightly to the correct temperature, pour over the tea in the press, cover with the press top, let it steep the desired amount of time, press and pour.  Wha-la! Great cup of tea.  If you're on the go I would definitely recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S1CV">Thermos Nissan 12-Ounce Stainless-Steel Tea Tumbler with Infuser</a>. This thing is bullet proof, very high quality, will keep your tea smoking hot for hours, and will never spill or leak.  You can also use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G8XORG">Adagio Teas Paper Filters</a>. Although not ideal it's certainly better than missing your tea!<br /><br />And just in case you don't know you can brew high quality loose leaf tea multiple times which contributes a lot to this Tea's price-value ratio.  Expect about 50 cups of tea (depending on how strong you like to brew your tea) per container.  Multiply by two and you can see where the price is more than reasonable (about 20 cents/cup).  Plus, it's organic which is always a huge plus.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I'm very surprised at how much I've come to enjoy drinking tea.  It may in part have something to do with the ritual aspect of it, the fact that it's so good for you, or maybe the excuse it gives you in the middle of a busy day to slow down for a second, breathe, and think.  However, I'm convinced tea has real and perceivable benefits beyond just psychology.  My diet tends toward the healthy side, I exercise regularly, and am very aware from day to day what my body and mind feel like, and since I started drinking tea regularly (about 2-4 cups a day) I've noticed a difference in overall energy and alertness. I have more focus ability and I don't get drowsy or "dull" in the middle of the afternoon.  It's subtle but sustained and obvious, and the "boost" (for lack of a better term) that tea gives me doesn't feel like caffeine, energy drink, or other "induced" or "artificial" energy but rather a nice below-the-surface sort of "I feel good" sort of thing, similar to the way you feel after a good night's sleep.<br /><br />It's extremely healthy, tastes great, and may even give you a few moments of peace in your day.  I can't think of a higher compliment to give any food or drink.

review/summary: I like the team but not the flowers and chips
review/text: This is the first time I tried Octavia White Tea.  After I opened the can, it looked O.K.  The whole leaves looked fairly fresh.  However, as I consumed about one third of the can, I started to see significant amount of yellowish chips and tiny flowers.  In addition, more broken tea leaves were found deeper in the can.<br /><br />I then poured out the entire can of white tea leaves to examine.  I was surprised to see how much impurities were buried in the tea leaves.<br /><br />To be honest, I have not seen that much impurities in a whole leaf tea of any kind (white, green, or black). To me, the tea farm did not do a good job in handling the tea leaves.  I would strongly question the claim of USDA Organic rating of this tea.<br /><br />If you never tried white teas before, please do not assume that the yellowish flowers and chips are part of the white tea.  They are not since this tea is Silver Needle.<br /><br />I had to remove all the impurities by hand-picking all the whole tea leaves and discarding the broken ones and the yellow flowers and chips.  I still question how this tea could be so badly handled by the tea farmer or the tea exporter/importer.<br /><br />I am sure there are better white teas out there.  Tea lovers should share more information on their findings on the many different brands.

review/summary: simply the best
review/text: I found Octavia Tea at a local health expo few years ago. Until then, I have tried numerous store and online organic tea companies. I consider myself a Tea Fanatic:). This has become my favorite tea after one sitting! I have never gone back to any other green or white teas. This is simply the best tea I have found! I highly recommend the Silver Needle and the Ginger Peach Teas from this company. Simply amazing!

review/summary: Excellent quality, not the best
review/text: The quality of this tea is really good, but not the best, and for the price, its not worth it.  I recommend going with Portrero Tea, or the Tao of Tea, superior quality and a much cheaper price.  Octavia USED to be a good price for its quality, but since then they've reduced the amount in the tins, and they've increased the price. Won't be buying any more of this tea.  Adagio silver needle is of equal quality, better price and larger quantity.<br /><br />Portrero | Tao of Tea<br />  ''''''''<br />Octavia | Adagio

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: Most of the SodaStream syrups are good, some are better than others, but this one is terrible.  It is bitter, the reason for which is explained in the next paragraph.<br /><br />When mixing as per instructions on the syrup bottle there is insufficient room in the 1 liter mixing bottle for all of the syrup.<br /><br />Sorry, guys, you need to make the mixing bottles larger or make this syrup more concentrated so the measured amounts of water and syrup both fit into the bottle.

review/summary: Sodastream
review/text: Hi I bought my Sodastream a week and a half ago and to my surprise I'm impressed. I had to mess with the formula a bit but I think I got it right. I am a die hard Pepsi freak, and no it doesn't taste like Pepsi but it does taste like an old favorite RC Cola and the lemon lime is great also. When you get your sodastream home mess with the formula. I give it 4 to 5 pumps not the recommended 3 pumps, not enough fizz. And also let it stay in the frig for about an hour or more when you make it before you have your first glass. It settles and you have more of the right flavor. I agree it might not be a savings on price but I used to purchase 3 to 6 six packs of 24oz at a time in one week and carting and recycling all that plastic is a lot for me being slightly handicapped. So in the long run I still am happy with this product. But when I travel in my car I might stop and get me a Pepsi still for the ride lol. They say not to have it out in the sun so that's the reason I would buy my back up Pepsi.<br />Hope this helped<br />Ar8derfangrl

review/summary: Orange Pineapple
review/text: I ordered the orange pineapple soda stream mix, and the taste was great. It was refreshing and just sweet enough. I was tired of the super sweet sodas, and I wanted something different. It was perfect. The only problem was, I was lead to believe that I was going to get 3 of these syrups because the title description says "3 pack". Unfortunately, I only received ONE. I'm not sure if the other flavors arrived in packs of three, but the orange pineapple DID NOT! I wanted to let people know just so no one else is disappointed.

review/summary: Love the Orange Pineapple, like the Pink Grapefruit
review/text: I bought a SodaStream a few months back and got myself started with four flavors from their naturals line - Orange Pineapple, Pink Grapefruit, Black Currant Pear and Lemon-Lime.  Since this particular Amazon listing is only for the first two, I'll concentrate on reviewing those.<br /><br />The four stars is really for the Orange Pineapple.  I usually use a little bit more than a capful - the natural syrup is lighter than the artificially sweetened one, so I use a bit more.  I LOVED the Orange Pineapple.  It was gone very quickly.  I like orange soda and pineapple soda, and this was a perfect blend of the two, so delicious.  It was refreshing without being overbearingly sweet, which I appreciate.<br /><br />The Pink Grapefruit I would give four stars.  I was disappointed originally because I read that it was a good replacement for Fresca, which is one of my favorite sodas.  It doesn't really taste much like Fresca - it's reminiscent of Fresca in that the main flavor is grapefruit, but the sodamix is far more grapefruity than Fresca (which has other citrus flavors).  Once I got over the initial disappointment, though, I appreciated the flavor for what it was.  It's tasty.  It's also very refreshing - it's the flavor I reach for if I want my thirst quenched.<br /><br />Apple Mango is next on my list.

review/summary: Good beans for baked beans recipe
review/text: I found a recipe that called for these dry beans (you obviously soak them overnight) in a  baked beans recipe.  The beans were fairly expensive (like 5 bucks) but the killer was the shipping fees.  The beans were good (you even put beer in the recipe with brown sugar, honey, molasses, etc.) but not for the price I paid to get them to me.  There are other beans in the supermarket that will work as well.
