I found them at a grocery store in Kenosha, WI (I think that it was pic n save or jewel).  They are incredibly good.  If you can find them, horde them.

review/text: I was curious about these, and so I bought the least expensive selection of them.  First of all, it's a ridiculous price for what you get.  I'm sure that the reviewer who said that you can buy this for a couple of dollars at a big-box store is right.  But worse:  the candy is so stale it's hard and crumbly.  This stuff should have been thrown out.  That's what I did with it.  A complete waste of money.

review/summary: Caution!
review/text: Shopzeus, which advertises with Amazon, offers 4 48oz barrels of Utz party mix at a very good price.  The problem was that they sent just one barrel.  After emailing them, they said that a warehouse employee will be notified to fix the problem as quickly as possible.  It didn't happen that fast, but nearly 2 weeks later, a package of not 3, but 4 barrels arrived.  But then the problem was they sent outdated merchandise, the sell-by date being 4 weeks previous.  The contents seemed okay, however, so I accepted it even so.  I saw another review where they sent one can of dogfood to a customer who ordered a case, and Shopzeus didn't immediately fix anything for them.  Also, a 92% positive feedback they have overall leaves 8% of customers not fully satisfied, and with tens of thousands of transactions, this figures to over 2500 of them having some problem.  So, be advised.  If an order works out, great.  If it doesn't, their claim to guaranteed customer satisfaction may leave one to wonder.  Kudos to Amazon whose buyers protection guarantee oversaw this, but also, and to my surprise, sent me a notice that my purchase price is being refunded.  I kept a friend abreast of this story as it progressed, and after learning the outcome, he simply emailed back, "I love Amazon".  You bet.

Love it on whole grain english muffins or even a spoonful as a snack. It's a great way to eat protein and healthy fat. When you want protein, but are going light on meat, this makes a delicious meal on whole grain toast, muffins, or on a banana or apple or celery for a snack.

It has about 170 calories a serving and can be eaten by diabetics. Caponata is cooked eggplant in cubes, with capers, olives, oil, etc. in a light tomato sauce. Excellent at room temperatures. Available in the Italian specialty area of most markets at 3.99 to 4.99 for a 7 ounce can.

The slight mint and lemon flavor makes it marvelously refreshing as an iced tea.

review/summary: Arizona Sugar Free Green Tea with Ginseng Iced Tea. I love this stuff.
review/text: I will soon be 73 years of age. In my lifetime, I have consumed many flavors and types of soft drinks. Arizona Green Tea is the best tasting of all to my old taste buds. I like the kind that Amazon.com sells better [ASIN:B001THXOIS AriZona Sugar Free Green Tea with Ginseng Iced Tea Mix, 1.7-Ounce Tubs in Cannister (Pack of 4)], than the pre-mixed, liquid variety. I think it has a milder, better taste.<br /><br />After mixing a pitcherful, you can use the left over little container for storing little things. Or, do as l do and sort your pills into it. I am not kidding; those containers are handy little things to have around.<br /><br />As is normally true, Amazon.com offers the best price to be found. Amazon.com's subscription plan is an especially good deal.<br /><br />I strongly recommend buying this product from Amazon.com on a subscription basis. Then, you will never run out. And you will not find a better price anywhere. I have found none as good.

review/summary: Collosal waste of plastic
review/text: I did not realize that this product consists of about 24 individual little plastic containers of powder.  Have to open and discard each container each time you make the tea.  What a way to totally pollute the environment unnecessarily because these containers will last for hundreds of years. And all these little plastic containers are nested in 4 bigger containers.  I mean, c'mon, just have one container powder, and a scoop.

review/summary: I Love This Tea
review/text: I originally bought the bottles from the grocery store. I found the canister on one occasion, tried the mix and was pleased, but I couldn't find it, again. The bottles were heavy to carry so my preference was the mix. Less storage space required was another advantage of the canister. I decided to look on Amazon and was pleased to find it. I'd give this six stars if I could. I have a prescription for this item.

review/summary: X-Cellent instant tea mix
review/text: Compared with Arizona's bottled teas, this product is clearly the winner. It tastes fresh, while the Arizona pre-mixed tea tastes stale... like it sits in warehouses too long prior to being sold... which I imagine it does. Other instant tea mixes vary from poor to barely acceptable. This mix is "clearly and refreshingly" at the "tea-top!"

review/text: Best tasting tea, especially at room temperature. Often I use three of the small containers per one gallon for added flavor , especially if I fill the container all the way to the top. Keep gallon container refrigerated over night for freshness. The tea has an excellent taste when hot. Ice or cold temperatures reduces its taste to me .

review/summary: Love this as a substitute for soda!
review/text: I have been really working hard to cut out soda and think this is a great substitute to do that! Yes, it does have Splenda in it (and wish it had honey but how could it come in such a small canister)?<br /><br />The taste on this is great. I bought a mixing jug and mix this with just a bit more water than the recommended amount. The 4 packs have lasted me for months and should last be a bit more and I will buy some more when that happens.<br /><br />If you are trying to eliminate soda then green tea is a great way to go. The only downside may be the storage of it which is why I would recommend buying a jug to make it in. I almost wish I had a bigger jug so I could make two packets so it lasts longer. We drink a lot of this!

review/text: Best Product I have found in a long time. This Canister holds Six tubs that makes 2 Quarts of the Best Green Tea Ever!  I was so happy to find it in the convenient Tubs for travel or at home.  Finding it in the Stores was terrible, so when I found it on "Amazon" at such a great deal I could not pass it up! The Canister is sealed and each tub is sealed by them self...so they do stay fresh.<br />They make them in different flavors & have Sugar-Free which I could not find in any store.  Even if you are not a Arizona Tea drinker you will be very surprised how good this product taste...Once you get these you will be on the Auto order before you know it.

review/summary: BEST ICE TEA EVER
review/text: My whole family loves this ice tea drink. We go through a gallon a day. It is refreshing, sugar free, caffeine free and the cheapest drink next to water. What more could you want. It is easy to carry back home, my bad back loves that. It is easier to store in cabinets. We take the canisters with us when we travel, no threat of spilling. The canisters are better for the enviroment than plastic jugs or aluminum cans. Plus we use the empty canisters later for storing anything from nails, screws, threads, etc. Can keep things dry & sand free at the beach. Our extended family has grown fond of it also. It is not available in their area so they are ordering it by the case online. The only thing you need to do is clean out your pitcher routinely. A residue will build up on the inside of the pitcher over time. I love it mixed with cold water and chilled. My husband likes it a little stronger by mixing powder with hot water and chilling. It makes a difference.

review/text: I enjoy this item very much. I first had this product in a can premixed. not many places carried it, and then I discovered the sticks. they are nice for the office or a road trip, but the tubs a re nice to mix a batch for dinner. The tubs are well proportioned and I do not have the issue of unused mix in the bottom. The convenience of a subscription reduces the price enough to continue ordering through Amazon and so I do not have to continually browse for new sources.

It's great stuff, and I highly recommend it.

review/text: I've cycled through various super-premiums with my Rhodesian Ridgeback over 7 years including Orijen, Wellness, Eagle Pack (old formulas), and numerous Natures Variety. Her poop looks like Willy Wonka chocolate bars on this stuff. It's super digestible with less stool. And don't be concerned by the dark color. The other food that I love is Honest Kitchen, a dehydrated food, but it is so expensive that I've only used it as an additive / topping but would also recommend those foods if you don't have a large dog due to the cost.

review/summary: Great selection, poor packaging
review/text: I ordered the 35 pack and received two of each flavor, and three of one flavor.  I understand this is a random selection, so it's luck of the draw. My complaint - I visualize a couple of people packing these boxes, just tossing the K-cups in a box from other random boxes. No liner, separators, or even stacking. So when it arrived, a couple of the tops were slit open, obviously by hitting against the edges of another K-cup.  Nothing spilled out, so I was able to use them. Expiration dates were Mid 2012 thru early 2013 (I received the order in Dec 2011.) The earliest exp. date was five months away.<br /><br />Would I order it again? Sure. The price is decent - many K-cup samplers charge over a buck per K-cup.

review/summary: Nice Variety of Flavors
review/text: I received the Crazy Cups Flavored Coffee Sampler (pack of 35) today and am quite pleased with it.  The K-cups came packaged in a brown paper bag encased in a sealed plastic bag.  (Since it was labeled a "sample" variety pack I didn't expect the cups to be packaged in a box - which is fine by me.)  The flavors were random as was the quantity of each flavor.  I liked that there was more than one or two of each flavor enclosed because this will give each person in my family a chance to try each one.<br />The only way it could have been a tiny bit better was if they sent an additional flavor of the Donut House Coffee instead of 6 of the Chocolate Glazed Donut one. Same goes with the 5 Hazelnut Noisette.  (Although if I like them, I'll be very happy there were so many!!)<br /><br />FYI: In my sampler I received the following:<br /><br />Green Mountain Coffee:<br />3 Caramel Vanilla Cream<br />5 Hazelnut Noisette<br />2 French Vanilla<br />3 Southern Pecan<br />4 Mocha Nut Fudge<br /><br />Green Mountain Limited Edition Coffee:<br />2 Pumpkin Spice<br />2 Spiced Egg Nog<br />1 Gingerbread<br /><br />Gloria Jean's Coffee:<br />4 French Vanilla Supreme<br />3 Hazelnut<br /><br />Donut House Coffee:<br />6 Chocolate Glazed Donut<br /><br />If the price remains low, I will be buying this sampler pack again - real soon!

review/text: The price isn't too bad, but I guess my expectations were too high.  Most of these coffees were very low on flavor.  The coffee part was okay I guess, but individual coffees aren't a good value, especially if you are someone who drinks more than 1-2 cups a day.  I ended up buying a K-Cup attachment and buying a large container of Folgers coffee and making my own.  This is a much better value.<br />Summary:  Coffee okay (cost too much per unit)- Flavor, not so much.

review/summary: Good product, awful packaging
review/text: This item really shouldn't be listed as a gift pack, because of the packaging.<br /><br />The product inside is exactly as described, but the K-cups are just piled in a plain brown cardboard box. I expected that there would at least be attractive labeling on the box, but no. It's a plain brown shipping box. It's not a huge problem, but I wouldn't even consider giving this as a gift without moving the contents to a better-looking container. I'm using a good looking cigar box because I know my recipient will like it and use it again, but a nice basket or decorative tin would also be good choices.<br /><br />Also: the limited edition print is not impressive. The others in the series may be show-stoppers, but this one . . . not so much. You can see the image by clicking on its thumbnail on the item page, two birds with coffee beans. When my husband saw it, he said, "It looks like something out of a coloring book." I will not be including it as part of the gift.<br /><br />So, taken all in all, I'm not sorry I bought this item, but I'm glad I have a better container to put it in.

review/summary: Great assortment *sold* by Amazon
review/text: I don't know if I got lucky with mine, or if it's because my assortment was actually sold by Amazon (vs another seller fulfilled by Amazon), but I got a great assortment.  In my pack of 35 cups, all of which were in fine shape and did NOT come in a bag (they were in a box, which was packed in another box with bagged air for padding), I got 26 unique flavors, and nine duplicates (but a max of two of any one flavor).  The majority were from Green Mountain Coffee, but I also had some from Wolfgang Puck, Donut House, Timothy's, Grove Square, Van Houtte (only one of those), and Gloria Jean's.<br /><br />My only complaint, and this is very minor, is that two of the cups were cider drinks instead of coffee, but I'm perfectly willing to try out the cider in the evening when I don't want the caffeine.  Certainly not worth taking off a star.  I'll definitely purchase this assortment again, but I'll make sure my seller is Amazon.

review/summary: **THINK TWICE** NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT**
review/text: I was so happy to see a k-cup variety of most of the flavors I would be interested in trying.  I was lead to believe what was posted in the description would be what I would receive.  From the description it said you would receive 25 different flavors.  What was received was 80% of coffee from Green Mountain in only 3 flavors and I received flavors that were not advertised like Limited Edition Gingerbread and Pumpkin.  I understand not all of what was advertised would be available but when I go to my local grocery store or WALMART I see Hazelnut Decaf and Kahlua, of which I received not ONE in my order. In fact, not one DECAFE was added to my order, which was expected.  If I wanted what I received I would have purchased the variety pack from the local Bed Bath and Beyond.  In addition, the packaging looked as if I took home something from my local market,stuffed in a brown paper bag and stapled closed. Please be aware what you see is NOT what you get. I am so disappointed with this seller I feel that AMAZON should put a process in place to limit a seller who has a bait and switch like this.  SELLERS should be more wary not to take advantage of their bread and butter..."THE CUSTOMER"!

review/summary: Confused
review/text: Like the first reviewer, I too was surprised to get a box (no inner box at all) of loose k cups. There was a cardboard tube in the middle of the box to keep them from rolling around too much, but one was wrinkled so badly it almost fell apart.<br />This is a nice assortment and you can compare different brands of the same flavors for your reference. But the package and presentation is low budget. Also no poster as described.<br />Rating it a 4 for coffee assortment but a 0 for packaging and product misrepresentation!

review/summary: Not the variety promised
review/text: I ordered because it was supposed to be a variety of 25 different flavors without ordering 25 boxes. However, I only received 20 different flavors not counting the ones that technically are same flavor just a decaf version. I also received 4 of one pod when I thought it could have been a little more diverse. The product did not match the description given and that's what is disappointing. I would have at least like to have been shipped what I thought I was paying for and not ripped off about 5 more flavors to make the most of the variety. With that being said, I do not think I will be ordering from amazon again.

review/text: I was a little hesitant in ordering as there were several comments about the lack of selection, however, I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box.  There was definitely 25 different flavors and about 4 which there were 2 of.  All in all a great way to sample different flavors without having to commit to an entire box of 16 which can be very costly especially if you end up not liking the flavor.  I love being able to sample some that I might otherwise be hesitant to try.

review/summary: Lucky Draw
review/text: After reviewing the other reviews I took a chance and ordered this directly from Amazon.<br /><br />I am also not a fan of decaf and was worried about how many decafs I would receive in my order.<br /><br />Only 2 of the 35 were decaf so as the title states I got the luck of the draw. The rest were all coffee and only four were labeled "iced coffee" versus coffee or cappuccino.<br /><br />It gave me a nice variety in an easy to open cardboard box. It gives me a nice variety of two of each item with the exception of "Island Coconut" where I received three of them which is ok.<br /><br />The box has an expiration date of 12/21/2012 which is fine as I'll easily drink 35 cups between now and then.<br /><br />I hope others have the same luck.

review/summary: Highly Recommended!
review/text: Alough there are quite a few negative reviews it seems the company has taken the consumer's advice and improved on the product. Just opened my box (yes box, not a bag as some older reviews stated) and it was like Christmas in October! 23 different flavors with 35 k-cups total, more variety than I've found anywhere else (especially for such a reasonable price). Some of the flavors I recieved were: mudslide, caramel vanilla cream, mild mtn blueberry, mocha nut fudge, chocolate glazed donut, kahlua original, pumpkin spice, vanilla skyline, butter toffee, island coconut, and maple sleigh. There were also some basics like french vanilla, hazelnut, etc. along with a couple(2) decaf (yes, decaf, it is called a VARIETY pack after all), and a couple(2) cappuccino k-cups. All in all, this is a fantastic way to try a wide variety of flavored coffees without spending a small fortune. Buy it, you know you want to :) Cheers!

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised!! (and Kosher)
review/text: I recently purchased a Keurig machine and wasn't cure what kind of K-cups I should get.<br />I didn't want to commit to a large box of one flavor because<br />A. I like variety and B. What if I didn't like the flavor?<br /><br />So, despite many awful reviews, I decided to take a risk and order this project.<br />And like the title says, I was pleasantly surprised!<br />The product came in a rectangular box, not the paper bag many reviewers were offended by, and the K-Cups were nicely organized inside.<br />I received a wide variety of K-Cups from different companies. While many of them were vanilla or caramel, even those came in a variety of blends and companies.<br />Also included were several cappuccino K-Cups, which I didn't even know existed.<br />Additionally, considering it was fall, I received two Pumpkin Spice K-Cups - Yum!<br />2 Brooklyn Maple Sleigh<br />2 Brooklyn Hazelnut<br />2 Brooklyn Vanilla Skyline<br />1 Green Mountain Mocha Nut Fudge<br />1 Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />2 Green Mountain Island Coconut - Limited Edition<br />1 Green Mountain French Vanilla Decaf<br />1 Green Mountain French Vanilla<br />1 Green Mountain Hazelnut Decaf<br />1 Green Mountain French Vanilla Iced Coffee<br />1 Green Mountain Hazelnut Noisette<br />1 Green Mountain Caramel Creme Vanilla<br />2 Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice - Limited Edition<br />1 Green Mountain Southern Pecan<br />2 Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuccino - Dairy<br />2 Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino - Dairy<br />2 Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino- Dairy<br />2 Kahlua Original<br />1 Gloria Jean's Mudslide<br />1 Gloria Jean's French Vanilla Supreme<br />1 Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee<br />1 Gloria Jean's Hazelnut<br />1 Wolfgang Puck Jamaica Me Crazy<br />1 Donut Shop Collection Cinnamon Roll<br />1 Donut Shop Collection Chocolate Glazed Donut<br /><br />As well as a couple others that I have already drank and don't recall which they were.<br /><br />Overall I was very pleased with the variety I received and none of the included cups were expired, damaged or dried out in any way.<br />Would definitely order again and suggest it to others!<br /><br />P.S. All of the included K-Cups were certified Kosher.

review/text: When I received my purchase I could not wait to open it.  It was just like Christmas!.  I received many different varieties. So many choices I couldn't decide which to try first!  There were regular coffee, decaf coffees, Iced coffee and ciders.  I have now tried all of them and was happy with everyone.  I of course have my favorites now and so will order more of those but when a variety is called for I could not beat this package.

review/summary: Way less than advertised selection, even when counting decaf as a seperate flavor.
review/text: I was hoping when ordering this that it would come with many unique flavors to try, the main reason I bought the Keurig over other competing products was the selection of coffee flavors. This package does not deliver on the variety it promises. When counting each flavor without duplicates there was 21 selections, however three of these were decaf versions of the same flavor from the same company. The majority of the selections were either hazelnut or french vanilla from different companies, if you remove the decafs and choose only one of hazelnut and french vanilla from all companies there are only 10 different flavors of coffee, much less than the advertized 27. I will not be buying this selection of k cups again nor will I be buying any of "crazy cups" mixed packs.

review/summary: Seems better than it is, for my taste
review/text: I thought I would want to try every brand and every blend, but it turns out once I found my favorite, I wasn't interested in trying the rest. I like dark, bold coffee flavors and most of these were very LIGHT and left me feeling like I was drinking watered down coffee. Although I was really looking forward to the variety I didn't enjoy most of them and it soon turned into a chore to get through the box so that I could go out and buy the flavor and brand that I wanted most. If your unsure of which brand will be right for you or you like weak coffee go ahead and give it a try, but if you like rich dark bold coffee, skip this pack!

I'm glad I wasn't swayed by what I read because I love what I received! I didn't get anymore that 2 of any 1 flavor and only 2 decafs. Which is fine with me because I can use those for company without having to buy an entire box. Also, my K-Cups were delivered quickly and without damage. Mine were shipped in a box, not a paper bag like I read in some previous posts. So, I am happy with my yummy coffee assortment and plan on getting another!

review/text: So, the point of this purchase was to get a variety of flavors to try.  The upside of this purchase was that 8 or more brands were represented and the box included regular, decaf, iced coffee, and cappuccino choices.  The downside was that I got duplicates of several k-cups!  There were 2 of each of these: Wolfgang Puck Creme Caramel, GMC Caramel Vanilla Cream, Gloria Jean Mudslide, Gloria Jean Butter Toffee, Jamaica Me Crazy, Kahlua, and Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut.  I can understand one or two of the same, but that many?  It almost negates the point of buying a variety pack.  Even without the specific repeats, you're already getting multiple brands of flavors like hazelnut and vanilla.  Sigh.
