review/summary: Regular Non-Organic Zoe EVOO tastes better
review/text: As you can see by my name, I am a green, organic mom blogger, and always try to shop accordingly.  I was already a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZU2">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1-Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and was glad to see an organic version.  Unfortunately, though how much we tried to like this, the organic Zoe Organic EVOO just doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the non-organic variety.  This organic one definitely tastes like it's made from a whole different variety of olives, leaving it with a pronounced sharper, greener flavor with a bit of a bite.  It's very distinct, and totally overpowers my cooking.  The non-organic Zoe EVOO doesn't do this; it blends in perfectly as a marinade, for dipping bread, drizzling as a final touch on cooked dishes, etc.  So, unfortunately, in this case, go with the non-organic, which I have on Subscribe & Save reorder, and is a pantry staple in our house.

review/summary: Mellow taste, good buy.  Is there BPA in these containers?
review/text: I like that the Zoe olive oil comes in the metal containers, as opposed to plastic.  The packaging was good; there was not the slightest dent in either can.<br /><br />But there's the BPA thing.  Buying organic, you'd like to know there's not any bpa in the lining of the can, lurking there for months, canceling out part of the benefit of organic.  If Zoe does not tell us, we have to assume the bpa is there, as in other canned foods.  I did a casual search but wasn't able to find out anything specific for Zoe on this. The same casual search turned up many questions about bpa, no definitive answers.<br /><br />I did find a 2003 government sponsored scientific study --- [...] that found BPA was taken up by (absorbed into) olive oil in greater amounts than either water or 3% acetic acid!  Apparently, BPA links with lipid molecules very easily.<br /><br />Why can't we be sure, 8 years later, that BPA isn't leaching into food?  Unfortunately, I found that study link AFTER I'd bought these two tins, so the only thing to do is tranfer contents into glass and refrigerate.  I always keep olive oil refrigerated after opening anyway, in spite of the inconvenience when it solidifies and you have to pour warm water over the container to get it to pour.<br /><br />There's the pouring problem...  I'd read reviews beforehand, so I knew that you had to pull on the green tab to raise the plastic spout.  However, I usually don't pour much at one time, so am still getting a bit of dribble onto the top of the can.  So the plastic spout isn't working for me.  I'm considering glass containers such as the Global Amici drizzlers, just for pouring; this must be a common problem with olive oil.<br /><br />I can't detect anything buttery about Zoe Organic's taste.  And it's not as olive-like a taste as Colavita, for example.<br /><br />Next time, organic or not, I'll try something else for more flavor and to use as a dipping oil.  I'd consider the Zoe special varieties, but apparently they come in plastic containers, with no BPA disavowal in the descriptions.  With so many plastic items being imported from places with little manufacturing controls, it's not sure that any disavowal could be trusted, anyway.

review/summary: Disappointed in price change
review/text: Amazon just cancelled the 1L 2-pack of this good oil via subscribe & save @ 18.71 for my last shipment. That is 67 oz's of oil. Now it's 51 oz's for 22$ in subscribe & save, that is an increase from 0.28$ per OZ to 0.43$ per oz -- about 30% increase in price. Not anywhere as good a deal as it was before. This is good middle of the road, organic olive oil, been using it for last 2-3 years. But it's getting way to pricey for what it is.<br /><br />Maybe it's not Amazon - maybe it's the supplier price increase -- but it is a sad turn of events.<br /><br />Just read a bunch of articles about how low olive oil prices are hurting europe -- sounds like gouging to me.

review/text: The only other olive oil I can compare this to is "Filippo Berio" from the supermarket. I did a smell and taste test comparing these two oils. The supermarket stuff smelled awful and nothing like olives, while the Zoe had a nice olive scent to it. The supermarket stuff tasted nothing like olives while the Zoe did.<br /><br />Not a great comparison, but definitely a good buy if you can get it on sale or with coupons.

review/summary: A quality oil
review/text: I have been using olive oil for many years, even in sweet baked goods.  A couple of years ago the New Yorker magazine contained an article exposing all of the problems with Italian olive oils in recent years.  So I decided to switch to a Spanish olive oil, preferably organic.  Zoe ended up being my choice, mostly based on price and its fairly middle of the road flavor.  I have now been using it for about five years and remain satisfied.  It is not the best olive oil around, but it is consistently good and not priced so high as to cause pain.  I have not had problems with it going rancid.  I like the tin, but am still careful to keep it in a cool area rather than near the stove.  Once I have used half of the can's contents I prefer to decant the rest into a smaller, dark glass container.  I can't say that I love the spigot, but once I figured out how to pull it out I have had no problems.  The product stays in the tin or pours nicely into the dish or pot I am using when cooking.  I have not had any counter messes nor do I find a lot of oil around the spigot.  Finally, I like being able to buy through Amazon's subscribe and save program, which makes this oil a bit more economical to use.

review/summary: Pretty good, light OO
review/text: This was a pretty good olive oil.  I tried just dipping my bread in it to see the full flavor and this is my conclusion, even thought I freely admit I am no expert or anything.  First thing I noticed was the viscosity of it, pretty thin.  I don't know if that is good or bad, just an observation.  I figure this is good for salads, and didn't have too much effect on me dipping bread, but would rather have it a bit thick.  The flavor was good, not great.  It didn't have the rich fruity, nutty flavor I was hoping for, but was OK.  I had been using Pompeian and think I prefer its flavor better, at least in dipping.  After I use this up I will go back to Pompeian, its cheap at wmart and to me has the best flavor of any I have tried.  Conclusion is if you want a thin, light oil then this is a good choice, for a more robust flavor, there are better options.

review/text: I am getting this regularly via subscribe and save option and I must say this is a pretty good deal given the quality of the product. Although the taste difference in organic vs regular Zoe oils is subtle, I like to believe going organic is good for me. If you know much about or have used olive oils regularly, you'd love the taste of this particular extra virgin olive oil. Apart from being healthy this is full flavored - real extra virgin and not diluted like many store brands- and comes in a can to protect the oil from exposure to direct sun light. Go for it, with free shipping, you can't go wrong.

It has a good flavor and is great for baking, frying, etc.  I even like the tins, and I use a can opening to remove the tops when the tins are empty and use them for cute storage.  The price has gone WAY up recently though, which is really frustrating. Amazon has a history of jacking the price up on anything that sells well or gets good reviews. I depended on my regular shipments for my cooking needs and now I need to look for another affordable replacement until Amazon puts the price back down in the normal range (if they do).

review/summary: DO NOT BUY!
review/text: I am pretty upset about the recent pricing change on this product. I have been buying this for years and have had this on S&S for sometime.  My S&S was recently cancelled by Amazon at the same time it was suppose to ship (hence i ran out of Olive Oil).  I went on to re-order the product and thought at the time it was cancelled due to Amazon Frustration Free Packaging (yes I should have paid closer attention to the ounces when re-bought)however to my dismay when opening the package today the tins were HALF the size than the old ones.  So basically I am thinking ok - I wont be buying this brand again, I'll have to find a new one. Now I am even more upset as I just came on here to write a review and when I search Zoe Olive Oil - the 1 Liter tins came up - but are no longer on S&S <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060JNAE8">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and they are 50 cents more than the 25.5 ounce 2 Pack on S&S.  These are basically a rip off now.  I hate to leave a negative product review about something that I like, but this one bothered me so much I felt completed to inform other consumers about the recent changes.

I don't use butter or other oils anymore.<br /><br />Great product, well packaged for shipping, since Amazon likes to just toss things in a box without protecting anything.  This company thinks ahead, and the cans are very well protected for shipping.<br /><br />They are much smaller than they seem on the computer,  because of the shape, I guess.  Still a great value, even though they raise the price every order by about $2.00, so I probably will be shopping for another brand by next order..

review/summary: A Lighter, Less Intense Extra Virgin Olive Oil...
review/text: Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a lighter, less intense extra virgin olive oil - the fact that it is organic is an added plus.  This oil is perfect for multiple uses such as dipping, baking, and incorporating into dressings and sauces which require oil.  It is also the perfect introduction for those individuals who are new to using olive oil since the olive (fruity) taste is less pronounced than it is in other EVOO's (Extra Virgin Olive Oils).  My spouse is one of those individuals who was encouraged by the cardiologist to switch to olive oil, but who did not like its taste.  That is until, after reading the reviews on Amazon, I purchased Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  It is the first in a long line of EVOO's that has met with his approval.<br /><br />Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is light and has a buttery taste.  One can add herbs to the oil for extra flavor; it does not overpower their taste.  Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is excellent for adding to baked goods which call for oil.  Its mild flavor does not compete with the taste of other ingredients; there is no fruity aftertaste.  Personally, I did notice a peppery bite in my throat after using this oil as a dip, without the addition of either herbs or pepper.  The aftertaste was not particularly strong and was not evident when the oil was combined with balsamic vinegar or herbs.  Amazon's price for Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is excellent; it is far better than the cost of better EVOO's at the warehouse stores.<br /><br />This is a five-star product packaged in a three-star container.  The spout is difficult to pull out completely; pouring the oil can be a challenge.  The spout on the first can I opened was defective and split at the base when it was pulled out.  I did not notice this until I began to pour the oil and ended up with a puddle on the countertop.  Amazon's customer service was excellent with respect to resolving that issue.  I do like the size of the can which is easy to handle.  Unlike other EVOO's, Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil does not specify in which region of its country of origin the olives are grown, nor does it specify the year of harvest.  Further, unless the date is coded, the can does not indicate a best-used-by date.<br /><br />Despite these minor issues, this is a fine EVOO and I recommend it to anyone looking for a lighter, less intensely flavored EVOO.  You can't go wrong purchasing Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Amazon.

review/summary: Fine Organic Oil
review/text: I'm sure I'll reorder this product.  I cook quite a bit with Olive Oil...everything from Veggies, to Pancakes, to Burgers, and Steaks.  For cooking, it's tasty without any suprises.  Raw out of the bottle it has a bit of taste/zing to the back of the throat... a bit of burn.  That is entirely natural, and due to a naturally occuring penolic chemical in Olive Oil called Oleocanthal.  If your olive oil doesn't zing or burn the back of your throat, then it probably is a washed out, watered down version of the real deal.  Zoe has done a superb job here with Organic Oil at reasonable price.  Choose Zoe Organic, and be happy.  I recently read an article about a vinyard in Italy that had some 500 Olive trees.  Due to weather conditions, roughly half produced annually.  Many of the trees were over 250 years old.  Olive trees live 500-900 years, and some in Syria are as old as 1,500 years.  Anyways, the point is this.  With a crop of 500 trees, rough weather can produce 300 liters of pure organic olive oil.  The average tree in normal conditions will produce about 4 lieters of oil.  The current price you see for something like this Zoe Organic product is a steal.

review/summary: Best Value (Price/Quality) Olive Oil
review/text: I grabbed this on a special because it was such a good price for a quality olive oil. When I first tasted it, I was somewhat disappointed, because it had a strong "green" flavor, like the olives hadn't fully ripened. I relegated it to cooking and foods that it would be mixed in with, like hummus. Over time, I have grown to like it more, and now occasionally even use it for drizzling on salads and other foods where the olive oil's flavor is a stand-out part of the dish.<br /><br />I usually drizzle a little EVOO on top of hummus when I serve it along with kalamata olives, feta cheese, tzatziki and tabbouleh. Mmm, one of my favorite meals! I use the Zoe when I make the hummus, then use my favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BFG56A">'Nunez del Prado' Flor de Aceite Olive Oil Glass by La Tienda</a>, for the drizzle. I have bought it in a 1 Liter tin at my local upscale grocery store, but it is more expensive than the Zoe. I discovered Nunez de Prado when I asked them to let me have an olive oil tasting (like a wine tasting), and this one was by far my personal favorite.<br /><br />The special addition you get by drizzling the oil over many different foods really adds a lot of dimension and flavor, so you really want to get one that you love.<br /><br />The spout is messy no matter how I hold the can, so I decant it in into a glass bottle (store it in a dark cabinet).<br /><br />Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this oil for the price, it is very good quality, though it's not my favorite.

review/summary: Bad dispenser tin design, oil is fine
review/text: The olive oil is fine, but when you open the tin for the first time olive oil gets all over your fingers and runs down the sides of the tin. It's so full that squeezing the can a tiny bit sends up a fountain of olive oil. One must wipe the side of the tin clean after each use since oil invariably drips down the side. So good oil, bad tin design.

It is very floral/fruity with a hint of rich spicy herbs, and a bit of a bite on the finish - great stuff!<br /><br />Provecho.

review/summary: Quantity not worth the money
review/text: I could not belive the size of these tins for the price, so I ventured to measure the quantity since it didn't seem possible that the tins could possible hold 25.5 ounces in oil. Surely, the weight includes the weight of the tins which feels heavy enough to raise suspisions The quality was average and thus overpriced. Perhaps the fact that the oil is organic may due some justice. I will continue to do what I have been doing in the past and shop around.<br /><br />Update<br /><br />This oil is dangerous for frying in a pan, it splashes as if water was added to make this oil which would explain the lightness in texture. Disapointed that the container does not disclose that this is not pure oil and that water is being added.

But after a while she said that it was better tasting than any oil she had ever used and insisted that we reorder it.<br /><br />We use olive oil because we are concerned about our cholesterol. Just a little bit of Zoe is all that is needed to cook foods in an Orka steamer for delicious and healthy meals, microwaved in just minutes. We use it almost daily to make wonderful tasting, fish and vegetables that way. Chinese leftovers and rice tastes like it was freshly cooked when you reheat it this way with teaspoon of this oil.<br /><br />We recommend it highly!

review/summary: Great All-Purpose Oil
review/text: This is a great olive oil.  It is really low in price for its organic certification and the fact that it is first cold-pressed (first cold pressing yields a much more nutritious, flavorful oil).  Other olive oils that can make those claims often cost twice what Zoe does, or more.  As to flavor, it is soft, buttery, and a little bit sweet; it tastes like olive oil (sounds dumb, but many olive oils sacrifice their fundamental "olive-ness" to achieve a wider appeal).  On the other hand, it is not so strong as to overpower other flavors when you cook with it.  Great for roasting garlic, as a base for sauces, and for sauteeing vegetables.  The two small tins are a nice touch, too, as you get a decent amount of oil, but can keep it half of it sealed up for freshness.

I love that it is in a tin so that I can leave it on the counter rather than having to place it in the cabinet.<br />However, it is best to put it into a carafe or olive oil dispenser because it can be quite difficult to pour and not spill.<br />As for the taste, it is very light and a bit nutty. Levels above many of the other oils at the same price level.<br />For the price, one should certainly try it out.

review/text: the quality of oil is great. I give it four stars because of the tin design. It is difficult to pour out the oil without it dripping leftovers on top.<br /><br />For those who haven't had real evoo, it might taste bitter at first- as a fresh oil will. I was initially surprised by the bitterness, but over time have appreciated it because it cuts down on the unctousness; works great with the acidity in vinegars for dressings or dipping bread. EVOO is very healthy and should be used raw if possible, only apply light heat to it. this isn't an oil for frying.

review/text: I was that guy who always just bought a massive jug of extra virgin olive oil at whatever price I thought was decent. I had been getting the massive Bertolli jug at Sam's and thought that was pretty much the be all end all of olive oil. Man, I was wrong. I just accepted the fact that olive oil had a funky and unpleasant after taste.<br /><br />On a lark, I picked a few tins of the Zoe Organic when it was selling for $13.65 per two. This stuff is awesome. Great soft, mild taste that doesn't have the slimey and chemical flavor that most other olive oils have tried. I'm not an exceptional taster by any means, so I can't say it tasted like roses, or buttermilk or pepper or anything else. It's just good.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised at the small size of the tins. It isn't as big or as much oil as I pictured, but the sealed and dark tins should help it keep fresh for much longer. I don't think the price or quality can be beat.

review/text: This dog food is saving my wife and I over $90 a month! Before putting our Kerry Blue Terrier on this dog food we were giving him anti-itch pills daily; the itching and licking was so bad he was itching himself raw (and no they weren't "hotspots"). The groom recommended a diet change, we had tried a diet change years ago (recommended by the vet before trying the pills) but it did not help. The groomer recommended Duck and Potato which seemed to help a little. When we ran out of Duck and Potato, I did not want to go to the groomer to get more so I went to the locally owned pet store and picked up a bag of Chick Soup. In the time since he has been on this food we have not had a need to give him any more anti-itch pills. Also, his eyes are weeping less; by that I mean the black gooey/crusty stuff has pretty diminished greatly (we used to have to clean his eyes multiple times a day and now it's down to maybe once every few days). This dog food if the best. I will buy it from Amazon (our locally owned pet store stopped selling it) when it gets a prime status. Buy it, don't let the "recall review" wacko scare you. Give it a try!

review/summary: Great for my two dogs - a picky eater and an allergy-ridden one
review/text: We have been feeding Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul dog food to both of our dogs for about three months now (since Julyt 2012) and they love it.  By necessity, we have to be very budget conscious, but did not like the budget-friendly dog foods out there that are all made mostly of bone meal and corn by-products.  The ingredients on the bag of this dog food speak for themselves...it's real nutrient-rich ingredients that humans would eat (duck, beef, chicken, broccoli, barley, etc).  Both of our dogs are rescue dogs - one is a 4-year-old  Aussie Blue Heeler who is extremely picky with her food and the other is a 10-year-old Pug/Welsh Corgi/Staffordshire Terrier mix who has extremely severe food and pollen allergies.  This is the ONLY dog food out of many that we have tried that meets both of their needs very well and fits our budget very nicely.  I've read about the recalls only through other Amazon reviewers and am yet to experience any negative side effects (only good ones, like empty food bowls, full bellies, and less pooping!).  We love this food and highly recommend it.

review/summary: I'll never feed my dog's Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul or any other food made by Diamond
review/text: Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the "voluntary" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through "other" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED
review/text: Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste.  I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.

review/summary: No Taste
review/text: I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker, they are horrible.  Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all, it's not just a weak taste, there is NO TASTE!  And to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds, I made several more cups (using 1 k-cup per mug of coffee of course) for family members to see if they could guess what flavor it was, none of them knew and when I told them it was french vanilla, they were of course surprised since you can't taste anything at all.<br /><br />I will never buy Van Houtte again, what a waste of money.

review/summary: Just OK Flavored Coffee
review/text: A sample of these Van Houtte "French Vanilla K-Cups" were included with my Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System and it was fairly disappointing to me. This seems to be a "hit-or-miss" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.<br /><br />When made on the "Large Cup" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.<br /><br />CFH

review/text: Excellent coffee, but on the expensive side.  I like medium blends.  If you like medium coffee, this could be the coffee for you!

review/summary: Good flavor
review/text: I don't always like flavored coffees, but this had a good vanilla flavor, with or without milk.  I like the k-cup system, does a nice job when you want just a single cup.
