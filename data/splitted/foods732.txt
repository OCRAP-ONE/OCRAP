review/summary: Tasteless garbage! Tasteless garbage!
review/text: What a disaster! What nerve they have! They label this mess "Chicken and Broccoli" but there's no chicken in it. There's almost no broccoli in it, either. You get a teeny tiny pouch with some green dust in it, that they have the nerve to label "broccoli florets".<br /><br />Besides that, the little pasta bits have no taste or texture. Then you drown your meat that you added and everything else in a mass of tasteless cheese sauce that has all the calories and sodium of cheese and none of its good qualities (like flavor).<br /><br />What an expensive way to ruin some perfectly good meat.<br /><br />Step 1 in preparing this is to fry up the chicken. Stop right there, hand me the chicken between two slices of bread, and I'll be a whole lot happier, plus saving the cost of this disaster.

review/summary: Bait and Switch
review/text: I was looking forward to trying this product as it looks really good on the box. I was not pleased at what was in the box. I did not expect broccoli but what they package as broccoli is some sort of green dust-like substance.<br /><br />I decided to try but replaced the dust with real broccoli. I seasoned the chicken and cooked it separately. Once I had the broccoli and chicken ready I proceeded to use the product as stated in the box instructions.<br /><br />Once finished (and it is not fast) I served it to my family. The consensus was that it would be better to prepare it from scratch.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product unless you are starving and it is the only thing left in your pantry... better yet, go out and get something else.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Preparation for this product is easy. The hardest part of preparing it is cutting the chicken into 1 inch cubes. (I got my husband to do that part.) It's no more difficult to make this that it is to make Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's where the positives end. It doesn't look particularly appetizing until you add the cheese at the end. Though the cheese flavor is pleasant, there is another seasoning packet that you add while it's cooking. I'm not sure what it's for since I couldn't taste it. The chicken had very little flavor at its core. The pasta (orzo?) looks deceptively like bowties on the box but actually more closely resembles rice. The broccoli "florets" may as well be left out. They add nothing. They come dried in a packet. They look like dust as you throw them into your food. My husband described them as unpleasantly textured despite the fact that they are little more than bits. Certainly not what I would consider florets.<br /><br />I'd actually been planning on trying this. The description is great, but the actual flavor falls short. We have leftovers that no one wants. I wouldn't be willing to try this again.

review/text: I made this for dinner for my wife and three kids.  It was very easy to make and had a very good taste in my opinion.  Although the kids (2, 4, and 7 years old) didn't act like they loved it, they ate every bit  of it.  My wife was very underwhelmed by it and thought it was "bland".  She would have prefered larger brocoli pieces in it as well.<br /><br />It definitely beats mac & cheese with a vegetable (like green beens) for a quick meal.

review/summary: Good flavor but a bit dry
review/text: I like velveeta cheese and thought this combination would be good for our camping trip (practical meal).  Though the flavor is good, the result is not like what it's pictured on the box.<br /><br /> The sauce is not as cheesy as the picture shows.  The broccoli gives some flavor and color but don't expect anything bigger than a broccoli flake.  The flavor is good but not what I expected.  A bit dry and more like a cheesy 'orzo' risotto.

review/summary: Actually Pretty Good For What It Is!
review/text: This is a pretty good product, as long as you know what to expect.  Some of the reviews seem overly critical, considering that the product price and description are right in line with most other comparable items.  It looked fine prepared, and I'll post a couple photos to illustrate.  All of my family members liked it.  They didn't jump up and down for joy and declare that it was pure tastebud-heaven in a box, but they did have seconds.<br /><br />First, some background.  I find that one of the more challenging aspects of preparing meals for a family on a daily basis is often just figuring out what to have.  Some people are really organized and plan their menus for the week in advance.  They buy the exact ingredients they'll need for the next few days and always know what they're going to have.  I'm not that way. There have even been times when I've had something in mind and started to cook it, and then changed what I was making mid-stream, while still using the items I'd already started to prepare as part of the new dish.<br /><br />Maybe it comes from watching too many TV shows like MacGyver over the years, or perhaps I'm just weird, but the bottom line is I'm not that organized when it comes to everyday meals.  Aside from the staples, I usually look for good prices and buy what's on sale.  I also sometimes feel like having something different depending on the weather or people's moods or schedules.  This keeps things interesting and it's a system that works for us, but it's not perfect.<br /><br />The obvious downside of such a method is that there are days when I walk into the kitchen and have no idea what to make.  I look in the fridge and freezer and nothing comes to mind.  The old standby dishes can only be made so often, ordering out would be admitting defeat, and I probably don't have some of the ingredients I'd need to make something new from one of the cookbooks on the shelf.  Those tend to be the days I turn to my third-string emergency backup: boxed dinners.<br /><br />Most boxed dinners tend to consist of some kind of noodles or rice with various flavored sauces, sometimes dehydrated vegetables, and may or may not call for the addition of chicken, tuna, or ground beef.  This one fits the pattern (just add chicken), but adds a bit of a twist by using Orzo (rice-shaped pasta) and including a pouch of Velveeta cheese sauce and a small packet of freeze-dried broccoli bits for variety.<br /><br />I prepared this almost according to package directions but with a small variation.  I cut up some boneless skinless chicken breast into strips, letting them sit in a little oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt & pepper, and herbs for a while, and then fried them.  I only added the extra ingredients to the chicken because I had used more than the box called for.  Portion size looked like it would be a bit small for the family otherwise, but I was concerned that using more chicken would make the dish too bland since the seasoning packet was only intended to be used for about 1lb.  Other than that, it was made as specified, and with a crumb topping as the box suggested.<br /><br />Overall, it was about what I had expected from an inexpensive box dinner, and just a bit different from the typical chicken helper/hamburger helper/tuna helper.  Sometimes that's just what's needed to kickstart dinner on one of those nights when I'm out of ideas.  I'll probably buy more if I notice them on sale.

review/summary: puts the guilt in "guilty pleasure" without the pleasure
review/text: I am a sucker for mac & cheese. It's a guilty pleasure. I sneak a bite at every buffet and Thanksgiving dinner, even though I know it's for "the kids" and it's bad for my health.<br /><br />When I saw this, the marketing seemed to be aimed at grown-ups, and I thought, "maybe my wife will let me get away with this."<br /><br />It tasted like chicken covered in ballpark nacho cheese sauce.<br /><br />Orzo is a terrible choice for mac & cheese. If you follow the instructions, the Orzo becomes overcooked and its texture is so similar to the sauce itself it effectively dissolves. The cheese/starch ratio is too high. It should have been elbow or penne.<br /><br />Green dust came out of the broccoli packet. Once rehydrated, it looked more like broccoli, but there wasn't enough. I could not taste the broccoli at all.<br /><br />There are few things I won't eat, but I will never eat this again.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I have a recipe that's nearly as quick and much healthier. I designed it for convenience and speed. For better flavor, saute the chicken separately and add it last.<br /><br />1. Boil 1 gallon of water.<br />2. Add 1 box of pasta, 2 chopped raw chicken breasts, some chopped broccoli.<br />3. Cook until pasta and chicken are done.<br />4. Drain water from pot.<br />5. Slowly add 1 package of finely shredded cheese while stirring to melt.<br />6. Serve immediately.

review/summary: Where's the Broccoli?
review/text: While this "dinner kit" resulted in a fairly tasty meal (slather anything in Velveeta cheese sauce, and it's going to be tasty), we were pretty disappointed in this product.  The apparently freeze-dried broccoli was a joke!  It consisted of the teeny-tiniest little pieces of broccoli (think the individual little "nubs" from a floret), such that you couldn't easily detect the dish had any broccoli in it at all.  If you want a meal consisting of chicken & broccoli mac 'n' cheese, you would be far, FAR better off buying some plain mac 'n' cheese (we buy the Kraft Velveeta brand cheese and shells often), than steaming some fresh broccoli to add in with some chicken.  Even adding frozen broccoli florets would be a huge improvement over the "broccoli dust" (to quote another reviewer) included in this packaged meal...

review/summary: Couldn't do it
review/text: I'm a big fan of the standard Velveeta shells and cheese so I thought this would be great for a fast week-night dinner.  WRONG!  Ended up throwing it down the garbage disposal and ordering pizza instead.  I wish I had read the reviews first, especially Nancy's.  The first problem is that the "broccoli" was virtually non-existent.  I knew it would be dehydrated, but this stuff was dried up beyond recognition.  I immediately regretted adding it to the saucepan and wished I had steamed some real broccoli to toss in.  I pressed on, however, and added the cheese sauce.  It was thinner in consistency than the typical shells and cheese sauce.  I let it set for a few minutes to thicken but was not very excited to dig in.  The taste was bland and the only texture I got was mushy.  The calories and sodium content were also through the roof!  This was definitely not a good purchase and I wouldn't buy it again.

review/summary: A marginal meal with misleading packaging
review/text: Macaroni and cheese is a number 1 comfort food for me.  I've enjoyed both the Velveeta and Kraft brands before.  However, this cheesy skillet dinner kit falls very short of my expectations for the following reasons:<br /><br />- Chicken is not included in the kit even though the box label says chicken and brocolli.  I figured there would be canned chicken supplied but there wasn't.  So you need to add 1 pound of skinless chicken breast to this recipe as per the instructions on the back of the box.<br />- The pasta looks like Risotto (grains of rice).<br />- The dish is very salty.<br />- There was no broccoli taste to the dish even though there were the dried broccoli florets that were added at the end.<br />- Except for the chicken, the meal has the consistency of porridge so I had to eat it with a spoon.<br /><br />There are two calorie and nutrition counts on the box--as packaged and as prepared.  As packaged it's 270 calories per serving at 5 servings per box with 80 fat calories or 390 calories with 100 fat calories if you add the chicken. There's 620mg of sodium per serving but it tasted much more salty to me.<br /><br />I ate it, it was okay, but I would never purchase this dinner kit because I did not find it satisfying.  The only thing I liked a little was the cheesy flavor.

review/summary: Quick, cheesy dinner idea...
review/text: OK, I'm sorry but when I see a package that is labeled "Chicken and Broccoli" dinner kit, I sort of expect that there will actually be some CHICKEN and some broccoli included in the box! Although the product, as prepared, is tasty enough (though not so nutritious with high calories and sodium), I do prefer the brands of these easy prep dinner kits that do include the meat in an aluminum can or sealed pouch in the kit. I also think there needs to be more evidence of broccoli in the dish.<br /><br />This item would be great for hungry kids and you could definitely skip the additional step of having to cook and prepare the chicken if you're in a hurry. The velveeta and pasta are creamy and appealing to that age group.

review/summary: Eh, stick to regular Velveeta.
review/text: I like the concept of this: making regular Velveeta shells and cheese a little more substantial by adding in broccoli and chicken, but it just didn't work very well for me. Obviously, taste is very subjective, but this is just my take on this product.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE Velveeta. It's been one of my favorite boxed Mac n' cheese products since I was a kid, but there was something about this that made me nauseous after about 3 or 4 bites. It also became extremely sticky after a few minutes of sitting on my plate. That never usually happens with regular velveeta shells and cheese. I don't know if perhaps the "formula" is different for this, but it just wasn't very good and the richness became overwhelming fast.<br /><br />Overall, I'm going to stick to regular Velveeta Shells and Cheese.

Actually, if there was NO broccoli, that would have been better then the dusty powdery mess that they tried to pass off as broccoli. It's a shame they dropped the ball on this one. I really enjoyed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0075AELU8">Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac Cheesy Skillets Dinner Kit 12.86 oz (Pack of 6)</a>...it was creamy and cheesy, but not too much.

review/summary: Definitely Cheesy...just okay for me
review/text: I thought this would be a nice compromise between what I like for dinner, good chicken and pasta with veggies, and what my son likes, anything resembling macaroni and cheese.  The cheese sauce was creamy with a balanced flavor, but I had to add extra chicken pieces (good thing I was using pre-cooked rotisserie) to get a goood cheese to pasta/chicken ratio.  Without the extra chicken this would have been too cheesy for my taste.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was the "broccoli" that in the end looked like big parsley flakes rather than broccoli. Although the prep was easy and relatively quick, I was reminded why I like my own quick recipes that allow me to have real vegetables of recognizable pieces and real cheese which I personally prefer to Velveeta.<br /><br />Would not buy again.

review/summary: It wasn't as awful as I thought it would be....
review/text: or as my nine year old said "it tasted a LITTLE better than it looked", which I can tell isn't very good.  So let me preface this review by the fact that the only boxed food my kids ever get is boxed rice like rice pilaf, and prior to trying this I have NEVER fed my family this type of meal, so they certainly aren't used to something like this showing up on their plates.  I mention this only because I spoil my family with food that is easily identifiable and that alone may have put them off from this dish.  We had to force the kids to take a bite of this and they both thought it was just awful.  My 7 year old got up and made himself a ham sandwich and let me tell you he is the type who likes to be waited on, so I can assure you he was motivated to not have to eat any more of this stuff. On a more positive note, the directions were super easy to follow and it was done in 20 minutes.  On a negative note, the supposed brocolli looked more like brown flakes mixed in that in no way resembled brocolli or even the picture on the box.  I was so dissapointed, since we always eat fresh veggies with every meal, that I had to cook some fresh brocolli and add it in so I didnt feel so awful about serving it.  In addition, my husband and I didn't think it was as awful as our kids did, but we didn't think it was good either.  Basically, my husband suggested it was the type of stuff that might be served in a homeless shelter, at which point my nine year old said "I don't think even the homeless would like to have to eat this."  In conclusion, this was a waste of perfectly good chicken (as well as the brocolli I added) and we won't ever be having it again.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: We finally got a chance to try this Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner. It makes a delicious, excellent meal that is quick and easy to prepare and actually tastes like a homemade dish. It is not overly flavory, salty, nor does it taste chemical-ly in the least. It took us about 30-40 minutes to prepare including making the chicken first. The box makes quite a lot of food, it is high in calories, and filling, and very satisfying. The only negatives we found was that we agree that the broccoli florets are almost indescernible, and next time we would make some fresh broccoli to add; and also I got a headache after the meal, perhaps due to some spices or additives in the mix. Can't say for sure. Obviously this is a processed food, so it shouldn't be used every day. But it doesn't taste processed. We liked this very much, and these mixes obviously are a great way to add variety to your regular meal rotation. The pasta in the packet are so huge, I thought I was eating a large variety of wild rice. It really tasted good. I would definitely buy this again.

review/summary: Try Turkey Breast To Add Tasty Texture To Velveeta Cheesy Skillets
review/text: Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Chicken and Broccoli works best with a well prepared kitchen.  First, I recommend using at least a 12" diameter fully covered skillet.  I replaced the portion of chicken with turkey breast cut up into pieces and cook until done.  Next, I add in the 2 � cups of water, seasoning, one quarter stick of butter and pasta.  Bring it all to a boil, cover and reduce heat to simmer for the next 7 minutes.  Finally add in the yummy Velveeta cheese sauce pouch and stir in the tasty goodness!<br /><br />Coming from Louisiana, I prefer a little more spice in my meals and found myself adding just one more ingredient to get that unique Cajun flavor!  Sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of Southern Cajun Seasoning Low Sodium to give your meal a real spice kick without all that salt.<br /><br />We enjoyed eating this meal.  Out of a group of just three people who ate this while watching a New Orleans Saints game, there was none left 30 minutes after it was prepared.  The broccoli florets gave the meal a real interesting vegetable taste and the pasta was just right.  Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Dinner Kit really can make everyone at the table smile, if given a little Cajun kick.

review/summary: Not much flavor
review/text: I really wanted to like this product but found that it really did not have much flavor.  I had to add some grated Romano cheese to it to make it more palatable.  The picture on the package does not look anything like the end product.<br />The pasta did not cook evenly and ended with some falling apart while other bits were still tough and chewy.<br />I certainly would not purchase it at the regular price.

review/summary: Got Kids then this is perfect!
review/text: I have come to love the Kraft products and no one can find a more wonderful old fashioned comfort food that's better than mac and cheese.  Velveeta has been around for more years than I can count and has not cut down on it's quality of product in these times of financial instability.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully creamy delicious meal in a box that's easy to cook and delicious.  Want the kiddo's to eat broccoli then what better way then with mac and cheese.  Putting chicken in it just makes it a wonderful delight any night of the week but sooooooo wonderful on a cold evening dinner when you hanker for something down home good.<br /><br />Affordable price makes this a must have for stretching the buck to feed the family while giving them something that is just darn good.  Protein, carbs and dairy all in one pack that is easy to make.  It's nice to see a company pride itself on what the public will enjoy without cutting corners on quality and flavor.

review/summary: I kind of liked it, but I wouldn't recommend it to you.
review/text: "When are you going to make that thing?" my friend exlaimed, seeing the yellow box on top of my fridge for the umpteenth time. "It's been there forever - are you ever going to cook it?"<br />"Yah I'll get around to it - I just don't like Velveeta.  It's fake."<br />Well, I did finally get around to making this last night.  If you don't want to read any further, I will say I kind of liked it, but I would never recommend it to anyone.<br />I've uploaded some photos as well if you want to check it out.<br />Let's break it down:<br />1) This thing has a packet of Velveeta "cheese".  I know Velveeta is this great american standard that we all grew up with, but that fake cheese stuff has never sat well with me.<br />2) The seasoning packet and "brocolli florets" are a total joke.  The seasoning did nothing for the dish, and the "brocolli florets" were this dark green and BROWN broccoli-DUST.  No flavor whatsoever.<br />3) It doesn't smell very good when you cook it. You fry up unseasoned chicken then boil it with the pasta and "spices" and "broccoli florets" and it just doesn't smell nice.  You dump in that gross cheese sauce at the end, and maybe only then does it smell remotely edible.<br />4) For ease of cooking, I suppose it's OK - it's a one-pan meal.<br />5) This stuff is filling. But wait till it coagulates: it's disgusting.  It firms up into this scary solid cheese-pasta mash.<br />6) It actually tastes OK - it definitely has that american-macaroni-and-cheese thing going for it.  If you like that, then you will like this.<br />------<br />I can't recommend this to you, however. Let's look at a few things.  COST: This box will run you about $3-$5 depending on where you shop. The pound of chicken you need will cost you another what, $5-6?  There are a number of similar dishes in the frozen food section that are about the same price ($8-10) which already have the chicken in them and have actual whole vegetables (not broccoli dust posing as "brocoli florets").  INGREDIENTS: Gross. Check out the label on this one.  Please, do not be fooled: most stuff like this that you buy in the store has all kinds of crazy fake-flavor enhancers and weird colorings that should make it illegal to call it "food".  You could make your own "cheesy skillet" - try actual cheese and actual garlic and actual broccoli.  Too expensive?  Too difficult?  Take a look at your kid's gut and you tell me if it's worth it. Do a little research into "Natural Flavors" and get back to me.<br />------<br />Overall, yeah, I ate it. I had like a third of it for dinner last night and it was strangely addictive.  But at no time do the spices or broccoli come into play.  It's all about the pasta and crummy cheese sauce here, folks.  Even my chicken is an after-thought, containing no flavor of it's own after only being briefly pan fried then boiled to death in this muck.<br />If you like Velveeta, you'll be ok with this. But I don't recommend this to you, and I'll never buy it myself.<br />** UPDATE **<br />The leftovers were totally gross.  I heated them up the next day for lunch and it's like.... just so sad.  Like eating wallpaper paste.  I actually microwaved some frozen broccoli (broccoli florets - real ones!) and mixed them in - it helped immensely but still I would never buy or make this ever again. 2 stars.

review/summary: Just ok.
review/text: The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner overall wasn't bad. The sodium contained in this was much lower than the previous Skillets Dinner I tried, Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger. However, it had sort of a Rice-A-Roni feel to it. Not that it tasted like it but it reminded me of it. I was never really a fan of Rice-A-Roni. That's maybe part of the reason why I wasn't really into to this product. The directions were straight forward and the preparation was simple. Though the pasta was pretty good, I was a bit put off by the somewhat gooey consistency. I followed the directions to a tee so there is nothing that I did to make it come out this way.<br />All and all, this is not something I would buy on a regular basis. There are other, more appetizing choices than this.

review/text: Surprisingly good.<br /><br />Very easy to make, but it did take more watching and stirring than I would have liked. A nice alternative to Hamburger Helper when you need a "desperation dinner."<br /><br />The kit consists of a packet of risotto (a rice shaped pasta), a flavor pack, a pack of freeze-dried broccoli, and a pouch of Velveeta cheese. You provide and brown your own chicken, boil the rice with the flavor packet, add the chicken, add the broccoli (it looks and smells weird out of the pack), and finish by adding the cheese. The final product looks ok (only vaguely reminiscent of vomit), but it tastes and smells good. It did not taste as salty as I had expected (much less salty tasting than Hamburger Helper), but I did feel thirsty after I ate it.<br /><br />You could also make it without the chicken for a vegetarian version, or if you are feeling particularly lazy.

review/text: It's hard to come up with something positive about this product. The pasta is tiny nodules shaped like grains of rice; the broccoli is about two tablespoons of grainy black powder that looked like insect parts; the cheese sauce, while fairly tasty, was only remotely cheese-flavored. About the only part of the dish I liked was the chicken, and that was my contribution.<br /><br />This might be a good product to stock in your emergency kit, since you can be sure it'll still be there when the big one hits. If you want cheese, chicken, pasta, and broccoli, buy your own cheese, chicken, and broccoli, and add them to a box of Pasta Roni or some such.

If you have some chicken and need to throw together a meal in a hurry - this is for you.  It is easy as can be to cut up chicken, saute it, and then ad this package.  I must say that more brocoli and larger peices would have made me give this entree another star.

review/summary: A great-tasting dinner entree you can whip up in a few minutes... what's not to like?
review/text: The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit I received as part of the Amazon Vine Program resulted in an easy-to-make, hearty, tasty dinner entree.  All I had to do was cut up a few boneless chicken breasts into little pieces, brown them in a skillet, then add the contents of the kit along with some water (the cheese went in last after everything was basically cooked).  I can't say there were multiple subtle nuances in the final dish, but sometimes you just want something that is fast, tasty, and satisfying, especially during the work week. And this dish was all that.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the pound of chicken breasts the kit called for, in conjunction with the pasta, broccoli, and other contents included in the kit, provided more than enough food for my wife and I, with enough left in the fridge later for our daughter when she got home from work. She really enjoyed the whole cheesy chicken and pasta aspect of the whole thing, but then kids always take to Velveeta, so no big surprise there.<br /><br />After enjoying the sample I received, I'd definitely buy this product again at my own expense.  In fact, I already bought a different flavor in this same line by Kraft and Velveeta, one involving ground beef and a cheeseburger/pasta flavor, but that's another review.  And another positive one too.

review/text: That's what I found myself thinking as I entered into the last phase of cooking this meal. I'd just spent some time fluffing up some yummy, tiny starchy bits of goodness along with some browned chicken breast, steaming in some dehydrated (and some fresh) broccoli, adding in a little spice pack, creating a lovely looking skilletful of creamy goodness.<br /><br />And in my right hand I held a tube of Velveeta cheese. You know the stuff. A bizarre yellow colour that belongs on the cheeks of a clown, not on food. A peculiar unctuousness that one imagines might be similar to that of natural cholesterol. No flavour, just a fatty presence. Dutifully, thinking of you, dear readers, I spooged the stuff into the skillet.<br /><br />The results were less than fantastic. The meal was satisfying, or at least wasn't directly and immediately awful, and my boys gleefully gobbled the stuff up, but I already have plans to make a more natural follow-up to this meal, with a homemade cheese sauce, and I figure it'll cost about the same as this box, be a whole lot healthier, and take only a few minutes more of my time so long as I'm making the sauce and the meal at the same time.

review/text: Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets is probably not something you want to eat all the time, but for a two day leftover product was not half bad. If your looking for veggie content you'll need to make a side like we did (green beans) because the broccoli exists in name alone and gets lost in the cheesy yellow sea that is the chicken and cheese sauce. It was perfectly tasty stuff though the cheese sauce tends to overwelm the pasta just a little bit. It's actually better on the second heating when all the ingredients have a chance to fully blend together. It's a perfectly acceptable meal, but nothing i'd want on an every month basis.

The quality of the product is quite good.  Make sure you have a big enough pan/skillet to contain the chicken breasts and all the boxed products.  I have a rather large skillet and that barely kept in all the food.

review/summary: surprisingly good
review/text: This is not the type of food I ever buy - I rarely buy packaged, processed, ready to make kits. And, if I make pasta, it's Ezekiel's sprouted grain pasta. But, I saw this available through Vine, and I decided to try it because I travel a lot and figured it may be something my family can make without too much trouble when I am away. I have to say, it was pretty good.<br /><br />Two of my kids were home the night I made dinner and the 10 year old and 17 year old really liked this. I did not use the broccoli included in the package, and instead sprinkled some fresh broccoli on top. The packaged broccoli looked awful; it was dried, crumbly, and small. It barely resembled broccoli and I was afraid it would just taste nasty and ruin the dish. I also added cold grilled chicken breast slices and stirred them in when the dish was hot so the cheese and pasta warmed up the chicken pieces just enough.<br /><br />The cheese is processed, but overall it didn't taste like it. And, the sodium content was not nearly as high as I expected. My 10 year old LOVED the meal and wants it again.  This really surprised me and it's a great thing to have in the cabinet for emergency dinners.

My only complaint about it is that there is so little broccoli. I'm assuming this has something to do with them being dried out and put into a little tiny packet. Still the flavor is there and enjoyable. Next time I'll just add my own additional broccoli.<br /><br />Don't confuse this with velveeta shells and cheese. This doesn't taste the same. There is seasoning that is part of the kit that gives it a very different flavor that Velveeta Shells and cheese.

With the names Kraft and Velveeta on it I expected it to be somewhat better than generic boxed mac-and-cheese, but that's about what it was like. The box does not come with chicken, so it's not really what I would call a "dinner kit." The broccoli amounted to tiny green flecks that we couldn't really taste. Overall, it was edible, but that's about it. I wanted to like it, but I'm sorry. I won't be buying this for my family.

review/summary: Velveeta made me sad
review/text: I love Velveeta shells and cheese, so I fully expected to enjoy this meal.  First of all, it doesn't come with chicken, you need to add your own... which I kind of expected.  So I cooked up my chicken and started tearing open the packages as the box directed.  I actually made this according to the instructions (normally I use instructions as suggestions).<br /><br />First of all, this doesn't really taste like the shells and cheese pasta I was expecting - far more bland.<br /><br />Second - The broccoli was like eating hamster food - it didn't rehydrate and was basically like running across the stray leaf or twig in your meal.<br /><br />B - the pasta was shaped like Orzo - which for some reason was just weird - perhaps if they had been spirals they would have held the cheese better or something.<br /><br />The best part of the meal was the chicken I had made... I wish now that I had blackened it to add flavor to this completely bland boring meal.<br /><br />Final decision - this required more work than many other skillet meals I have made and though I can't say it tasted bad... it certainly isn't something I'll buy again.  I guess if you like eating glue with sticks in it, this is the skillet meal for you.

review/summary: Too many bad nuts...
review/text: I have eaten many brands of soynuts over the years and have come to enjoy the ones that are crunchy (as opposed to hard). I bought this bulk package because my trips to Whole Foods are a bit spread out. Many of the soynuts in this product are extremely hard to eat, and I end up spitting them out. The ones that are good are usually just fine, but it is disappointing to find so many inedible soynuts in a package. I think I will stick to Whole Foods 365 brand.

review/text: This stuff is simply crack for cats.<br /><br />All my cats are addicted to it so I use it as treats, and the big bag goes a looooong way if you only give them a few kibbles at a time like candy. I've turned friends on to this stuff and it's always the same thing - their cats go crazy over it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend to use it as a regular food because it's very fattening and you'll wind up with lazy jumbokitties that take up all the couch space.

review/summary: Puts Cream of Wheat to Shame
review/text: Like a lot of people, I grew up on hot cereals and old-fashioned Cream of Wheat in particular.<br /><br />Graduate to something WAY better:  Cream of the West Roasted Wheat.  This is a whole grain product, not just the starchy farina part of the wheat.  It's better nutrition and digests very well.<br /><br />Easy to stove-top cook, give it a vigorous boil to bring out the flavor.  Microwaves well, too.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I love hot cereal for breakfast, and I've always liked Cream of Wheat but it has almost no fiber in it- 1 gram. Cream of the West has 6 grams of fiber per serving however, and tastes even BETTER. It has a nutty, hearty, delicious flavor but a very creamy texture. You can microwave it in 3 minutes and it doesn't get all those nasty lumps like in C of W, it's so easy! I like to add just a little salt and a dash of cream and it's a scumptious, filling, and healthy breakfast for both children and adults. I love it!

review/summary: I love this cereal.
review/text: This is the best tasting hot cereal around.  It has a nutty flavor and my body craves it.  Don't over cook it or let it get too thick, just bring the water to a boil, stir in the cereal and take it off of the heat and it will thicken up on its own.  A dab of butter and a little bit of sugar or erythritol sprinkled on top and you have a good breakfast side.  I wish I could roast my own wheat and get the same flavor, but I have not had any luck with experimenting recipes.  I can't find it at the grocery store on a regular basis for some reason, so when it is in, I purchase all they get in and store it in the freezer to keep it fresh and weevil free.  I would love to get this from Amazon, but almost $10 in shipping is ridiculous.  If this ever goes on super saver shipping, I am a customer.  Until then, it will be hit and miss when I can find it on the grocery shelf.

review/summary: Something is Very Wrong
review/text: The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.<br /><br />The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY.  I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping.  With each order there is always another price increase.<br /><br />My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store.  The store did not repack it.  Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item.  It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor.  The following information shocked me, and I quote:<br /><br />RIGONI FRUIT SPRD  8.82 OZ  Pack  6  Retail  5.99<br /><br />Did you note the price?  Retail 5.99!!!!  It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE.  No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price.  Am I missing something here?  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Perhaps on principal alone I will give up on this product.  The GREED is beyond comprehension.

review/text: My cats do not like pate style cat food.  Thus, they enjoy Fancy Feast in all varieties except "Classic".  They really enjoy little pieces, be they grilled or shredded, in gravy.<br /><br />This was promoted as:<br />Delicious melding of filet mignon and seafood flavors<br />Delicious and enchanting shapes made with real seafood<br />Enchanting shapes made with the delicious taste of real chicken and turkey<br /><br />However, there were no enchanting shapes, just the Classic can shaped pate. So it was disappointing.  No where does it say this is Classic.<br /><br />Also, it comes in three seafood varieties. I don't see where the filet mignon, chicken and turkey flavors come in.

But I will say that my cats love it and I guess that's the test, huh?  My cats have always been very partial to Fancy Feast so I give it to them as a treat.  I also have to mix a little into their vet prescribed food (which they DON'T like) to make it palatable for them.  They'll eat pretty much any wet food the vet prescribes as long as I mix in a bit of Fancy Feast - without it they just turn up their noses and won't eat it.<br /><br />I get the food by subscription with free shipping so I always have some on hand.  It's easy and convenient and I love having it delivered right to my door.<br /><br />I rate this food and the subscription service with five Meows.

I think it would taste even better. It easy open can makes it perfect for snacks on the go, and easy lunch at work. What a great product!<br /><br />OK I was just joking, but seriously though.<br /><br />My cats love this stuff! My older cat who is about 15 years old begs for this every morning like clockwork. He knows my schedule and will meow at the shower knowing it's time for his canned food the minute I get out. I can only assume it must be good since it appears to be the highlight of my cat's day.<br /><br />I'm very careful about what food I give my cats after the issue with the contaminated off-brand food almost killed one of my cats several years ago. I could buy cheaper cat food, but it's not worth the gamble.<br /><br />My cat's like it, and it's reasonably priced here on Amazon.

(Although the reported serving size is 1/4 cup, so go for it!)<br /><br />The label says: "Hand picked real Hawaiian Kona coffee beans dipped in dark chocolate."<br /><br />Ingredients (because I was wondering, before ordering): Semisweet chocolate [contains sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin (an emulsifier), vanilla], Kona coffee beans, natural cocoa powder, confectioner's glaze, gum arabic, natural & artificial flavors.<br /><br />They are marked with the Kosher K / pareve symbol.<br /><br />The chocolate and the bean are both good to my mind, and the proportion of the two as well. These are just what I was hoping for, in all their dangerous goodness.<br /><br />There are a LOT of beans here, too. I filled almost 5 24oz mason jars with this 5-lb. bag. (Yes, I know that doesn't add up... the difference between an ounce as a weight and an ounce as a volume... It's over 14 cups.)

We had seen some at different places but the price was usually over $1.00 an ounce. So when I found these on Amazon for $38 for 5 pounds I decided to give them a try. We were both very pleasantly surprised by not just the quality of the item, especially since it was in 5 lb bulk bag but also the flavor of the dark chocolate and the Kona bean together. It was a perfect combination. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone, and I plan to buy more very soon as we are down to our last pound.

review/text: I have tried many different brands of choco covered espresso beans, from amazon to the local coffee shops.<br /><br />These are far superior to any I have tried to date.  There is only a small amount of dark chocolate (which is what I like, less calories more caffeine) and the espresso bean has a great taste basically the bean melts in your mouth.<br /><br />I say this as I have tried some where the bean is like eating bark or some have so much chocolate covering them you can barely find the bean so you feel sick before you get the desired pick me up from the caffeine, so this is a refreshing change as the bean to choco ratio is perfect..<br /><br />These are pretty spendy but in the long run well worth it since you only need a couple beans to perk you up vs the other brands that are out there... will be buying again:)

review/summary: Works great for motion sickness!
review/text: I was on a ferry from Seattle to Victoria and the waters got rough and the crew started passing these around.  I was skeptical, but tried them and found that while my stomach was a little uneasy, I was certainly not as sick as I had been in similar experiences in the past.  I was still skeptical as to whether it was the ginger that helped or if, maybe, I had just outgrown sea sickness, but a couple of months later when I went whale watching, I realized that I had definitely not outgrown it.  So, when my family came to visit and we decided to go to Disneyland, I decided to buy this candy.  A lot of the rides make me queasy and can send me to the sidelines for 15 - 30 minutes - way too long for kids to sit around and wait.  Anyway, I found this candy really did help.  I had a piece about every hour and then also immediately before and after a fast/crazy ride.  It wasn't as though the motion sickness was completely eliminated, but it was greatly diminished.  I went from being sick to being a little uneasy - and it definitely didn't last long.  I didn't need to sit down at all, I just kept going and a few minutes later, I was completely back to normal.<br />BTW - these don't taste bad, especially after you've had a few. They are different tasting enough that your kids probably won't be bugging you for a piece all the time, which is a bonus.

review/text: I ordered these for help with my "morning" sickness.  I overlooked that these were not the hard candy version that I've used in the past, but I still like them even though they're chewy and don't last as long.

review/text: I got some of these and some of the less intense ginger candy. I like this one better than the less intense. Some of the little packages wrapped around each piece of candy are a bit hard to get open, but most opened well. I carry some with me in my purse now!

review/summary: Strong and Smoky
review/text: This is a strong, smoky coffee that can make you feel like a sophisticated coffee snob in the morning. It's smooth, rich, and velvety, and I always feel like a genius after brewing it, like, 'yeah, I just brewed this and it's so good. I am a coffee master.' That being said, it's almost a tad too strong for me - but I tend to prefer medium roasts. If you're looking for a strong coffee, I'd recommend checking this out.

review/summary: One of the best kcups out there
review/text: I found this to be one of the best kcups available.  The Colombia has flavor typical of a coffee chain's brewed coffee- bold, lots of subtle flavors, not bitter, smooth, etc. Type "Colombia barista prima" into Google for detailed tasting notes from other folks.  I REALLY enjoyed it and will be purchasing the largest box possible for my next order.

review/summary: Finally, a coffee that makes K-cups worth converting to!
review/text: When I recently started using K-cups, wasn't sure that the quality or the intensity would be up to par.  I wound up trying many of the standard k-cups which for the most part were ok but not great.  The Barista Prima French Roast is well worth trying.  Very intense and flavorful. No more concerns about throwing away my old coffee pot.

review/text: WHILE BARISTA ITALIAN ROAST COFFEE IS A BIT PRICIER THAN MOST OF THE KEURIG'S STYLE COFFEES, IT HAS A GREAT RICH FLAVOR AND IS WORTH IT.<br /><br />BY ACCIDENT, I RAN A SECOND CUP OF WATER THROUGH THE KEURIG ON A PREVIOUSLY USED K-CUP.  THE COFFEE WAS STILL RICH AND YUMMY.  SINCE THEN I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT I CAN GET AT LEAST TWO SERVINGS PER EACH K-CUP.

review/summary: Yes, finally!
review/text: I've tried a lot of KCups, looking for the fresh, dark, really rich espresso-roast flavor that I love; all of them seemed weak and/or flatly bitter compared to my dark beans-by-the-pound favorites. I'm almost a coffee snob and only bought the Keurig because my mornings are just too rushed, sort of a shocking decision. I love the convenience of the machine, but it was like grabbing a cup at the convenience store taste-wise - just the required morning medication, eh.<br /><br />So I was really, really surprised and delighted when I discovered this one. I hear they pack the Barista blends with more coffee - that does seem to be the case, they're plump little cuppies.<br />And wow, a real espresso taste, zero acidity, darkly fruity and full-bodied, and for once not tasting watered down. If you don't like espresso you won't like it, especially neat. But with half and half and sugar this one's really wonderful, too.  Love it, love it.

review/text: I have to say the new offerings are great. the french roast and the Italian roast have a nice strong coffee flavor. I would say remember your first cup out of a keurig, the reason you bought a machine, these two flavors remind me of that.<br />Those first few lines are from my review for the Italian roast, they are both excellent.

review/summary: Bold But Not Rocket Fuel Bold.  Nice, Smooth Flavor.
review/text: This Barista Prima kcup is my favorite of the four Barista Prima varieties that I've tried (House Blend, Columbian, Italian Rost & French Roast).  It has a nice dark, moderately bold flavor that creates a smooth wake-me-up in the morning.  There is no kick to it - just a even, enjoyable experience.<br /><br />My coffee preferences are medium-bold blends.  I brew a 10oz cup & this coffee maintains its flavor in this size cup.<br /><br />This is a kcup that I would put on my shelves.  Recommended.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received this kcup in a sample variety pack sent our by Keurig to its customers.

review/text: I love a high quality French roast. Since I was in college, coming home to visit my parents and drinking my mom's amazing coffee has never been beat by my Keurig.  Until now.  I love it.  It's super rich and flavorful.  It's not overly dark and there is no burnt taste like "other" coffees (you know who I'm talking about).  This is truly a lovely coffee.

review/summary: Definitely My New Favorite
review/text: I've been a Timothy's Rainforest Espresso fan for a couple of years now but this coffee is giving it a run for the money (well not really because it's overpriced).<br /><br />I delayed purchasing it (I have a $.50/cup limit and Barista runs twice that) until I found it on sale. Having used Keurig pots since they first came out a decade ago and having tried about 80 flavors, I find myself choosing this one over the Rainforest for my first cup each morning.  It's flavor is bolder and clearer than Rainforest and seems more satisfying.  We have a house full of guests now and the carousel has dozens of different coffees on it but the Barista coffees are the ones I keep having to refill.<br /><br />Still I ding it one star because of price.<br /><br />8/12 - found them for $.60 a k-cup (box of 96).  Bought two boxes which will last me two months.  Love this coffee.<br /><br />10/12 - Been drinking Barista Italian for 10 months now and have tried over a dozen new options in the interim.  None came close to the robustness of this coffee.

review/summary: Best dark roast k-cup by far
review/text: I am pretty picky when it comes to my coffee.  Tried just about everything.  Can not stand the weak blends and only like dark roasts (extra bold).  Used to drink Timothy's Parisian Nights, Midnight Magic and Green Mountains Dark Magic on medium water selection to get a strong enough brew, but now Barista Prima French Roast ONLY, on the large water setting.  Even with extra water it is perfect.  Little pricier than some of the others, but it is worth it, plus I get a full cup of coffee now when I brew on the large water setting.  I should also mention I only use filtered water when I brew my coffee, makes a huge difference.  Filtered water and a Barista Prima French Roast K-cup and it will by far blow everything else out of the water.  Nothing else compares.  If you like a really dark, smooth, flavorful coffee, you must try this.  You will not be disappointed.  But keep in mind, this is only for people who truly like the darkest roast (i.e. I think it curls my hair). Serious coffee drinkers only!

review/summary: Good Coffee for a Designer Coffee
review/text: I have gradually come to realize good coffee doesn't have to bite your head off. People have been convinced that the more your socks curl, the better it is. This is a pretty mellow but substantial brew. It doesn't have the hardcore after taste and isn't bitter. No fruity or whatever else descriptors. It's just a good basic cup of coffee for the average person. Basic is what I'm looking for in the morning.

review/text: One of the best k-cups we've had.  If you miss the way starbucks tasted on the Tassimo, this is the closest thing you will find in the k-cup world.  Coffee was great and the price was very good too.  Super saver shipping took FOREVER.  They sat on the order for a week before even shipping it and then it was another 4 days to get to us.  I actually had to go out and buy a box before this arrived which was what I was trying to avoid by ordering it online.  Used to order all my coffee online from Amazon before they dumbed down the free shipping.  Now, not so much.

review/summary: Italian Roast very nice
review/text: Amazon seems to have combined the reviews for three different products here, Italian, French, and Columbian. I picked up a box of the Italian Roast at the grocery, and I really like it. It is strong and full flavored without bitterness. For hot coffee, I make the larger size cup, and the smaller for iced coffee. I checked Amazon to see if I could save money, but it looks like the same price I paid at the store ($9.99 for a box of 12).

review/summary: bitter hot, but great for iced
review/text: At first I thought I had wasted my money. I hated this coffee. It is very bitter. Then I had a great idea...use it for iced coffee.  I brew it for a medium cup. Fill a tall glass with ice. Fill glass 1/3 full with milk. Add your favorite creamer. Add coffee and stir. So if you hate this coffee hot, try it cold.

Love the smoky flavorl  I recommend you buy it straight from Keruig, as a member (which is free) you can get a box of 24 for 17.24.  I always order 3 boxes at a time and get free shipping.  Also like the Italian roast, but is a bit stronger and, I think, harsher flavor.  Where ever you end up buying Prima French Roast, you'll come back for more!

review/text: This is my favorite brew by far. I have always been a french roast fan because I just love the flavor of coffee. This delivers that bold, rich taste without tasting "strong." It's smooth with no hint of bitterness at all. If you love the flavor of coffee, give this a try.<br />However, it's much cheaper at Walmart. I buy 18 K-cups for $13 there. I wouldn't pay the prices here.
