review/summary: donut anger
review/text: The seller did not package with care, had cool pack that melted (cool pack had no plastic , was cloth).This sogged up one of the donut boxes ,had to throw out.Also  both boxes had broken donuts as well as both donut boxes plastic top had ripps as though someone deliberatly damaged the donuts.I would of returned my order but figured after reading the sellers profile with complaints of the same problem  and the the seller giving the run around , and the people still waiting for their money back that I would just worn you , order at your own risk.

review/summary: Get some today and ignore the diet debacle for a while...
review/text: These chocolate donuts by Entenmann's really do a great job of giving you a pleasant snack or a sugar boost when you're on the run and can't take time to sit down for something more substantial. They make a great after school snack as well.<br /><br />The box holds them well even though it's not the sturdiest cardboard. It's a recloseable box, too. The artwork on the box reflects good judgment; and, more importantly, you get four nutrition facts labels on the box--one label for each of the four different types of donuts inside the box. Ignore the oncoming diet debacle and enjoy one or two anyway! SMILE<br /><br />You get eight donuts to a box--two with crumbs on them; two with vanilla swirls on the chocolate frosting and four more with a much more plain type of chocolate frosting and a yellow colored vanilla cake inside. Excellent!<br /><br />I would eat these donuts before the expiration date on the box, however. You don't want to be eating stale donuts!<br /><br />Unfortunately, these donuts are loaded with sugar--and sugar can turn into fat inside your body if you don't get enough exercise. Worse yet, these donuts are chocked to the brim with fat--as much as 60% of your daily allowance of fat in just one of these donuts! I definitely wouldn't eat these donuts every day.<br /><br />Hey, life is for enjoyment. Treat yourself or someone to a donut or two now and then but DON'T overdo it on these for the sake of your health. Four stars for the nutrition and diet debacle.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br />  I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/text: Sempio makes some great naturally brewed soy sauce. This is that great old fashioned soy sauce you used to find on the table in your favorite Korean restaurant. The dispenser bottles work well and allows the saucing of the food with just the amount you are looking for. The sauce it's self has a deep earthy flavor. There is plenty of salt here, but the salt flavor is not totally overpowering. We found it to be great for cooking and as a condiment.

Each bag makes a gallon so I open a bag and then store the mix in a jar and measure out typically 1/4 cup to add to the meat drippings in the pan, add a bit of wine or water and some dried porcini mushrooms and then thicken a bit. It is also perfect for french dip sandwiches when you have no drippings, after all that is what it was meant for.

review/summary: Intense Flavor - Love the Concept
review/text: This flavor is very intense. I can't drink it without making funny faces and I prefer the grape or original flavors but I love the concept of donating to Avon Foundation for Women Breast Cancer Crusade.<br /><br />Mammograms are not an efficient way to diagnose breast cancer but it's really all we have. You can literally have breast cancer for years before it shows on a mammogram. What we need is a blood test, much like the PSA test men have to diagnose prostate cancer.<br /><br />That's why I support donating to the Avon Foundation. They are more upfront about what they spend the donations on (unlike another popular breast cancer foundation) and they are pro cure but they are also for finding better ways of diagnosing because the earlier breast cancer is treated, the better the survival rates.<br /><br />Anyway, this flavor of 5 hour Energy works every bit as well as their other flavors and part of your money will go for a great cause.

I just moved and forgot to change the shipping address the seller REFUSED to contact the shipping company so they can reticulated my order to get it shipped to me. I even called UPS and asked if I could just change it, but to no avil. Alot of communication between me and the seller, most of it bad. I was well aware it was my fault, and i was trying to correct my mistake but like I said, the seller refused to help a paying customer and told me "You provided us the wrong Address and informed us too late to changed it. It's your fault not giving us the wright shipping address.We can't Refund you at this time."<br /><br />As i previously said, I even contacted UPS to have my address changed. This indicates to me that the seller dosein't care about good ol fashion customer support.<br /><br />The seller did not even care that I would not be receiving my order. I would have payed for a product I would not even receive, Yeah, the seller did not care one bit. But thanks to Amazon support i got my refund<br /><br />While a great product, i drink this stuff everyday! Id just go buy it at your local store

review/summary: Tastes like cardboard
review/text: Review is for Rich Cocoa flavor.  These granola bars were not very good at all.  On the okay side, they do have a nice deep cocoa flavor and are not very sweet (but the overall flavor is lacking).  However the texture is very bad, I think in part due to stale, nonroasted soybeans that are pressed into the top of the bar.  The bars are dry and taste like cardboard, even through they are slightly chewy.  They also have 160 cal, 40 cal from fat but only 3 grams of fiber.  Other bars of a similar calorie count have 4, 5 or even 6 grams of fiber, so the Eat Think Smile bars are poor in comparison.  Not worth eating -> 1.5 stars (rating as 2 stars).  There is a chance that these bars may "grow on you" - I have eaten 4 of them and the last one seemed not quite as bad as the first.  But there are definitely better options out there - try Kashi or Pure brand bars instead.<br /><br />Update 4/26/12<br />I have now eaten a couple of boxes of these and they have grown on me somewhat.  They are actually pretty good - not too sweet and have a nice chewy but not tough texture. They are a good change from the syrupy mainstream "chewy granola/trail mix bars".  But there is still no excuse for the stale soybeans pressed onto the top of the bar or the measly 3 grams of fiber.  And they do still taste somewhat like cardboard, so I am not changing my title.  I now rate this product as closer to 3 stars.  I am not running to the store to buy more, but they are not too bad.<br /><br />I saw the review about eating these with ice cream and actually think they would make a pretty good ice cream sandwich.

review/text: That's great that they have so many good ingredients that are beneficial, but the problem is no one is going to want to eat them when they taste like compressed particle board.  Which these do.  They're like Kashi bars, but worse.  Incredibly hard, bland, flavorless and just an overall huge disappointment.  I had half of one, and couldn't even finish the rest.  My 5-year-old son took one bite, and I couldn't get him to eat anymore.  After the rest of the family and my extended family tried them, I couldn't GIVE these things away.  No one wanted them.  They're THAT bad.<br /><br />So if you want to eat a bar with good ingredients and you have lost any and all sense of taste, these are the bars for you!

review/summary: Disappointing at first, Better after a few tries
review/text: I enjoy eating healthful foods.  It makes me feel better when I make "healthy" food choices.  I believe that the "think" part in the name of these bars plays to that. I also feel that they are counting on that part a bit too much for the success of their product.<br /><br />My first impression of these bars was that they were dry and disappointing, both in flavor and consistency. There was a slight taste of chocolate, lots of rice, and the soy nuts and almonds were dry and falling off the bar. The ONLY real pleasure about it for me was the thought that I'd eaten something somewhat healthful. Otherwise, my feeling was, "I wasted 160 calories on that?"<br /><br />Well, I thought that the box was well designed and attractive.<br /><br />Be forewarned, do not attempt to eat one of these without a drink handy.<br /><br />Two stars for nutritive value, but I'll take the cup of green tea over these for my antioxidants, and maybe a handful of pistachios or almonds, thank you.<br /><br />3-15-12  After having more of these, I felt that I needed to amend my review.  I think that the chocolate taste in them is quite good.  I've grown more accustomed to the texture and consistency and, actually, kind of like them.  When I eat one, it satisfies me for quite awhile.  I'm raising them to four stars.  I guess that's why they sent us 6 boxes!

review/text: The Eat.Think.Smile Rich Cocoa chewy granola bars sounded so promising as I like the taste of chocolate and cocoa. The cocoa taste did not disappoint, but the rest of the bar did. This is dry, dry, dry, and even more dry. Perhaps these were intended for astronauts in space?<br /><br />Unlike their Mixed Berry <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BPVE3G">Eat. Think.

Chewy Granola Bars, Mixed Berry, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> granola bars that were saved by the fruit bits, there are no fruit bits in this one, so it is very dry.<br /><br />Eating it with water or milk, or dipping or dunking can help a little bit, but still.<br /><br />I wouldn't throw it away but I wouldn't buy it either. If they fix the recipe, this has promise on the strength of the cocoa flavor.<br /><br />There are five individually wrapped bars in a nicely designed cocoa color themed box. Each bar has 160 calories with 4.5g of fat (0.5g saturated, 0g trans), 0mg cholesterol, 60mg sodium, 26g carbs (3g dietary fiber, 7g sugars), 4g of protein, 10% magnesium, 8% iron, 4% Vitamin E, 2% calcium.<br /><br />The back of the box states that one bar has more antioxidant power than a cup of green tea.

review/summary: This is pretty healthy, but it tastes like it.
review/text: Two and a half stars would be my specific rating. There are things about these bars that had potential, but I won't be getting these again.<br /><br />Each chewy granola bar from Eat, Think, Smile is loaded with anti-oxidents. They claim there is more in one serving than in a cup of green tea. The bar is on the small side, but dense with oats, puffed rice, soy nuts, almonds and cocoa. There are 160 calories (40 from fat) and 4.5 gm of fat per serving. This is not a gluten-free product.<br /><br />Let us come to the taste. There isn't very much of it. The bar lacks moisture, making the mouth-feel distractingly dry. The flavor, though it is not bad, is very "one-note" and drab. You sort of feel like you are eating a health bar, instead of enjoying nuts oats, and puffed rice with cocoa. My husband took one bite and gave it to my son. I only ate half and gave the other to my daughter. Incidently, both our kids (8 and 2) loved them, but they eat everything. Since we ordered a pack of 6 boxes, they get to eat 34 more bars! :)<br /><br />I'm bummed that these didn't work out for us, since they are decently healthy for a pre-packaged item.

These are not nearly as hearty as a Granola bar nor as crunchy as some other types of bars, but I like them and would buy them again.  Most importantly, you get a blast of cocoa-chocolate flavor which made me come back for a second.

review/summary: Slightly cocoa flavored cardboard with great antioxidants!
review/text: First off if you have allergies make sure that you take note that these bars are made with the same equipment that processes peanuts, other tree nuts, wheat, milk and eggs.  I like the ingredient list overall but if I do not have a drink handy I feel as if I will choke while eating this dry bar.  I do love the idea that CocoaOne has more natural antioxidant power than a cup of green tea.  However, I will never select these bars again due to their dry texture and overall lack of taste.  Good nutrition has to give me a little bit of pleasure while partaking of it or I will not continue to partake.

review/summary: Taste like plain granola
review/text: I found these granola bars to be dry and not very sweet. The ingredients list both sugar and evaporated cane juice so I would expect a sweeter taste. Also, the cocoa flavor is very subtle. I don't think I could taste it if I didn't already know that these bars have cocoa in them. Really these bars just tasted like regular granola to me.<br /><br />The allergy information on the box I received states: manufactured on the same equipment that processes: peanuts, other tree nuts, wheat, milk and eggs.

review/summary: Really like these!
review/text: There are 5 granola bars in each box. Those these are chewy, as advertised, they're also very dry. So a dry chewy, if that makes sense. There is a definitely cocoa flavor...more of a dark chocolate/straight cocoa than your traditional chocolate/milk chocolate. I like the chocolate flavor, but it's not something I'd eat if I was craving chocolate, because the chocolateyness is very light, and the texture doesn't lend itself to that sort of craving. I like superdark chocolate (Like the 90% cocoa stuff), and that's the flavor this reminds me of. If you're a strictly milk chocolate person, maybe pass on these.<br /><br />The ingredients list on this is pretty good looking with no strange stuff. The star players are cocoa, who gran oats, soy nuts, and almonds. Apparently, the unique kind of cocoa used means that each bar has more antioxidants than a cup of green tea, which is cool if you're into that sort of thing. The fairly high protein and dietary fiber amounts mean it does keep you full fairly well, so this is a good snack or lunch dessert to get you through the rest of the day.<br /><br />calories 180<br />cal from fat 40<br />total fat 4.5g<br />saturated fat 0.5g<br />trans fat 0g<br />cholesterol 0<br />sodium 60mg<br />total carbs 26g<br />dietary fiber 3g (very good!)<br />protein 4g (not bad)<br /><br />{EDIT 3/4/2012} So I find myself going back to these again and again during the day when I need a snack. I REALLY like them. I came back today hoping to see a subscribe and save option (I used to get a certain flavor of Clif Bar that way, but it's not available any more and I thought this would be a good substitution). Unfortunately there isn't one, but I still may purchase these form time to time. I had a Fiber One bar the other day and it tasted soo sweet. I much prefer the dark choclately flavor of this bar to the sugary taste of the Fiber One. Also the Fiber One bars are small, but this is fairly substantial and takes more than 2 bites to eat, which is nice. I hope these stick around!

review/summary: Stale and Flavorless
review/text: Yesterday I reviewed the "Mixed Berry" flavor (which has no berries, just cherries and raspberry juice), and I found it to be stale. I was hoping that maybe I just got a bad batch, but this batch of "Rich Cocoa" bars is also stale. Not quite as stale as the so-called "Mixed Berry", but stale none the less.<br /><br />But what's worse is it had no flavor, either. I've had paper with vegetable-based ink that had more flavor than this bar!<br /><br />I really don't think that I'm going to be eating the remainder of either box. I have better high-fiber granola bars in my cupboard already, and I'm just going to buy more of them. I'm going to check to see if there is anything in these that birds and other wildlife shouldn't have, and if they clear that test, I'll periodically put one out for them.<br /><br />These bars are incredibly disappointing.

review/summary: Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!
review/text: The first bite reminded me of Cocoa Puffs cereal. It's not an extreme chocolate experience, but I thought it was pretty good for what it was. The best parts were:<br /><br />1. It's not too sweet--only 7 grams of sugar. The first thing I tasted was the cocoa. The nuts/oatmeal second. Then the sweet. It is a lot less sweet than a Fiber One bar (which is way too sweet for me).<br />2. It is slightly soft. I rip pieces off to eat. I appreciated this a lot more than the crispness of the dark chocolate oats Nature Valley Granola bar I had the day before yesterday that broke into pieces in the wrapper.<br />3. You can see the constituent pieces of nuts/oats/nibs.<br /><br />It would be better if it had more fiber and protein in it.

review/summary: Not thrilled
review/text: Eat Think Smile's granola bars are granola treats that contain the company's special mix of African and American varieties of cocoa.<br /><br />Pros - On the plus side, all of the ingredients are all-natural and include whole grains. The cocoa also means that it is high in anti-oxidants.<br /><br />Cons - On the negative side, the bars themselves are not terribly chewy, but rather dry and stiff. Indeed, I don't know which of the ingredients it was, but something in the bars was so hard that I was afraid that it would damage a filing or crown. To make matters worse, the bar has more calories (160) than a York Peppermint Patty (140), though to be fair it does have less carbs (26g to a Peppermint Patty's 32).<br /><br />Overall, I was not thrilled with this bar, and don't expect to buy any more.

review/summary: Taste Better Than They Should
review/text: My father in law is a health nut who carries protein bars that are truly all health.  They taste like tar.  I have protein bars by Kellogg which are full of sugar and taste great but they are as close to health food as a typical chocolate cake is.  These are great because they are 80% of the way toward the healthy bars and they have 80% of the taste that the unhealthy ones do.  The best of both worlds.  I gave 4 stars because I have tried bars like these which have the same health and even better taste, but since those are a lot more money I'm not complaining.

review/summary: LOVE them but do not buy if you are looking for something sweet!
review/text: I LOVE dark chocolate almost the point of eating unsweetened cocoa.  That being said, I love these bars.  They have a very dark-chocolate taste that is really not sweet at all on the first bite.  After a few bites, you get more of a sense of the cocoa in them and they get a stronger, chocolate taste that is nothing like the first bite.  Most people will be fooled from the smell.  Opening the package is like opening a candy bar. The scent of cocoa is rich and sweet like a good milk chocolate bar or a good packet of cocoa.  The soy nuts on the top give a nice crunch to go with the overall-chewy texture of the bar.<br /><br />Another aspect I like is how filling these bars are without spiking my blood sugar.  I try to follow a low-GI/low-sugar diet plan because I am highly susceptible to the effects of either.  These bars are just satisfying for me to use as a great, portable afternoon snack.<br /><br />In short: Dark chocolate lovers will like these and they aren't sugary.  Milk chocolate/candy bar people may not like them right away, but I encourage anyone to get more than one bite in to get the true flavor of this great snack.

review/summary: Decent, but with a few caveats
review/text: I rate this product as 3.5 stars, had I reviewed it after trying just 1 bar, it would've been a 1 star product.<br />Why?<br />It tastes strange. There is a weird smokey flavor you don't expect from granola bars. I did not like the first few bars I ate, but since then, they have grown on me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- compared to other granola bars, it is slightly 'healthier' (more wholesome ingredients in general)<br />- uses natural cocoa (refreshing, since most use milk chocolate, a few use the better dark chocolate, but can't beat straight cocoa)<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- taste (obviously this varies, but I would be surprised if you at least don't find it strange at first)<br />- Since its not packed with sugar, you're not craving to eat 10 of these.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Soy is heavily fertilized and uses lots of pesticide as well. Given the "eat, THINK, smile" branding, you'd figure they might want to use organic soy beans. I don't eat everything organic, but there are a few products that I try to get organic, and soy based products are one of them.<br />- Not very filling (1 bar = 1.4 ounces)<br /><br />Honestly, given the soy nuts, slightly odd taste and the price, I'd be hard pressed to buy this product unless it was offered at a huge special discount.

review/text: I am always on the lookout for new granola bars since they are a mainstay of my picky toddler's diet...so I was eager to test these. Of course, I taste-tested it first, and wow, my first reaction was THIS IS AWFUL. It was pretty tasteless, really dry, and it almost tasted stale. I figured maybe that's just what "healthy" granola bars tasted like, but my husband (who is more apt to enjoy a healthy bar) said it wasn't that great, either. Edible, but not tasty. I did try giving it to my son, and to my amazement, he did eat it without complaint (though he generally only eats half of a bar). But because my kid only kinda likes them, my husband thought they were meh, and I disliked them completely...they only get two stars.

review/text: I really love these bars. I've tried just about every type of meal-in-a-bar out there, and these are some of the best I've tried. Not because they are knock your socks off great tasting (though they are so yummy!) or because they are super filling, but because they are delicious and nutritious without being too filling, too sweet, or that I feel like I've eaten a candy bar when I eat them. They're just about right. They have a light airy consistency like a rice krispie create with a bit of crunch from nuts. A nice chocolate flavor and just the right kind of filling. They satisfy my hunger without making me feel too full or that I've eaten something bad for me - like other meal replacement bars do. I love them and will purchase again.

review/summary: Needs more flavor! Tastes Blah. Ice Cream helps a lot!
review/text: I could taste the cocoa just a little bit but the rest of it is really blah. Some honey and a light sprinkle of salt would work wonders on the flavor. But, after I got past the first one, they weren't too bad. After a couple of them I started to like them a little more. I think it was because I was expecting something more like the Quaker Oats Smores bars with the little chocolate chips that I like. Once I got past my expectations and could just take them the way they are, and not what I thought they should be, they turned out to be almost good. They really need to do something to add some more flavor. I was also surprised at the size of the bars. They are at least twice the size of the Quaker Oates Granola Bars. If they add a little honey and some more chocolate to these I would buy them over the others. As long as the price was the same or lower than the other bars. Another thing that would help the flavor would be to use salted nuts on them. Kinda like the Payday candy bar. The nuts on these are really blah and a little honey would help keep them stuck to the bar too.<br />  I found one of these broke up and added to a bowl of ice cream is pretty good. And I like to freeze those pudding cup things, makes them like ice cream, and part of one of these bars broke up and mixed with the frozen pudding is pretty good too. Makes a different healthy snack food any who. Or closer to healthy than a lot of junk snack foods out there and makes them something different.

The taste is marginally acceptable but reminds me of eating a slighlty bitter cocoa-flavored rice cake.  My biggest issue is with the consistency of "chewy".  If by chewy the manufacturer meant that when you eat it that it becomes stuck to your teeth than mission accomplished.<br /><br />I would recommend trying one of these before buying a case of 6 boxes (e.g. 42 bars).

review/text: I have to give these bars 3 stars as they have brown rice syrup as the sweetener.  I actually received these right after the news came out about brown rice syrup being a large source of arsenic in food. According to multiple sources, you should not eat more than one item per week that contains brown rice syrup so your body can process the arsenic. So you can make your own choice but I will be looking for other alternatives.

review/summary: Some People Like The Taste of Health
review/text: For my review, I gave out these bars to for of my friends -- all males.  Three of these friends are healthy oriented, and they liked the bar.  One in fact is a vegetarian and loved it.  He commented how he was happy the bar didn't have an overwhelming 'oil smell' to it like other bars.  The other two that enjoyed it thought it delivered what they've come to expect from healthy food -- average taste but on par with healthy food taste.  And the fourth person who isn't used to eating healthy food, thought it tasted like crap.  No surprise since this person is more accustom to Oreo cookies than health bars.<br /><br />Personally, I thought the bar tasted just okay.  I was hoping for a more powerful cocoa taste but it's only a light flavor.  To help these bars along, I put a layer of peanut butter on them.  That bumps my rating of them up to a 4 out of 5.  :)  Honey might do the trick too.  I did find the texture and crunch to be at just the right level although I thought the bar could be a little more moist.<br /><br />These bars are definitely for the health conscious so don't expect a lot of flavor, but the flavor isn't unappealing -- it's just light.

Smile"  so let's see how I feel about each of those...<br /><br />Eat... As I open the package the appearance is like that of most granola bars.  You can see the rice crisps, oats nuts and cocoa bits.  The smell is a pleasant marshmallowy fragrance.  Taking a bite, well, I was not impressed with my first bite.  The bar is dry and actually very chewy seemingly like stale rice crisps glued together.  I did experience a strong cocoa flavor and spent a while chewing.<br /><br />Think...This experience is really making me think about the nutritional facts, so I look it over and I'm not very pleased with the fat, nor the carbs vs. proteins.  The fiber is ok but I can think of many other ways to get fiber in my diet. However, the sodium is a very nice low #!<br /><br />Smile....After a few more bites I have decided that my original choice makes me Smile and if I have nothing else to eat, I could eat one.  Otherwise, I am going to stick to my Kashi GOLEAN Bars which do have a higher sodium count and is a tad higher in fat.  But the taste is far better as well as all the other labeled nutrients like sugars vs. carbs and the vitamins....go look for yourself and see what you THINK!

review/summary: a great work horse bar that will give you energy, has a great mild flavor and you won't get sick of
review/text: The Think Smile Cocoa bar is already my favorite bar!! It is hard not to grab for another after eating your first.  I have tried tons of bars:  Cliff (not too sweet but somewhat vitamin taste), Odwalla (soft but has somewhat vitamin taste), Nature granola (dry and hard- a relative of mine chipped their tooth on one), Luna (can be sweet but nice and light), Kind (great but pretty sweet almost like a desert- sometimes I can't finish it), Kashi (nuts can be rancid and many of the bars sweet), Trader Joe's breakfast bar (chewy and mild but okay taste- peanut is better than chocolate) and Larabar (cake like but for me a bit of after taste).<br /><br />I think what I love most about the Cocoa bar is that you can have a bunch and not feel sick of it.  Sometimes I have to eat 2-3 bars at work a day whenever I can because I don't know how my schedule will be and this bar always fits my mood because it doesn't have an overpowering taste or heaviness.  A lot of the energy bars and breakfast bars have a lot of sugar, feel heavy, taste like you are eating something with a vitamin taste or you just feel like you are eating something healthy and force yourself to finish it- ugh!<br /><br />I want something that tastes good and I can keep eating throughout the day.  My old standard was the Kashi peanut chewy bar because it is slightly sweet, not heavy and isn't really dry.  But unfortunately a lot of the time the peanuts are rancid.  The Think Smile Cocoa bar is, in my opinion a lot better.  It has a light feel (it contains rice crisps), a mild cocoa taste that isn't over powering, is chewy, not too dry and has a mild sweetness compared to other bars.  I won't say it is bland but if you like a bit of chocolate taste, this bar is perfect for you.  I even gave one to my mom and she is the pickiest eater ever and she wanted another bar....<br /><br />If you are looking for a great work horse bar that will give you energy, has a great mild flavor and you won't get sick of I highly recommend trying this one.  (I think they also have a berry one, I haven't tried that one yet!)

review/text: These granola snacks are very yummy with a good chocolatey flavor. They have really healthy ingredients with no corn syrup of any kind which I appreciate, and at 160 calories with 12% of your daily fiber you don't feel too bad about eating it. The only thing is you need about a gallon of water with it and you need to be ready to do a lot of chewing. I wouldn't recommend these for a quick refueling on a bike ride or hiking because you have limited water in those situations. But for a mid-afternoon snack at work they are fine and more nutritious than you would generally get.

review/summary: It's a great bar!
review/text: From the moment you cut open the package, the cocoa smell wafts out, and you know you're in for a treat.  The Eat.Think.Smile. rich cocoa granola bar is delicious and healthy, a sometimes rare combination. It's easy to understand the ingredients and is easy to nibble on for a great quick breakfast or snack.<br /><br />The special African cocoa has antioxidants, according to the package, and is comparable to a cup of green tea, one of my favorite accompaniments.  The box and web site explain the details about how healthful cocoa is, and why its CocoaOne is so special and exactly where it comes from.  Each main ingredient in these bars, whole grain oats, rice, cocoa, and nuts, stands out nicely.  There is a lot of competition for granola bars, but this one is low in sugar and fat, though it isn't high in fiber, it does contain some, 3 grams per bar.<br /><br />There is crunch when you bite in, though an occasional piece may be a bit hard, you know you've got something substantive.  It's not sticky like some bars and doesn't crumble which makes it easy to eat on the go.  It comes in other flavors, which I have actually tried, and I'm impressed with the choices.  I'm think the name is too long and it would be better with just one word, instead of trying to be clever with  fanciful sayings. However, the product is tasty and hopefully, good for you. It's nice to see a company promoting a product for healthy living.

review/text: When I first bit into one of these bars I was expecting it to taste very sweet, but it is not real sweet like a candy bar. It tastes good, but not super sweet, so if you like stuff that way, as I do, then this is the bar for you. Most bars like this have too much sugar, this does not. Could taste better with more sugar, but I think it is better just like it is.

review/summary: Enjoyable and Healthy?
review/text: I never before found a can that combines brown rice, per say, and beans. You heat it up and add some tasty choice of Beef, Fowl, Seafood or Veggies and you have a standard meal ready to be consumed. I have come to appreciate Eden Organic. Yes, I admit that I usually add a little more salt, pepper and herbs but in the end they do taste very good. I initially was looking for the beans alone but when I read the label and since I only use brown rice now a days, we gave this combination a shot and for us, it paid off! I can cook all manners of legumes, beans, etc but hey, if a nice organic company wants to do it for a while for an acceptable price, why not? For sure 4 Stars or even higher, they are reliable fare but for a couple of weird reasons we ended up with 6 cases of different kinds so we are still figuring how are we going to consume so much since most of the times we are only 2 people. That is the beauty of canned food, I guess, that it does keep longer and well. 4 Stars!

review/summary: i couldn't manage to choke this stuff down
review/text: like one other reviewer, i'm from the "Deep South", so my regional culinary experiences have colored my perspective of what "rice and beans" should taste like.  still, i have a hard time imagining anyone finding this stuff even remotely palatable.<br /><br />what i like about it?  Eden is a really good brand.  it's organic, and it's got good ingredients and low sodium.<br /><br />what i don't like?  really, this stuff is pretty foul.  personally, i didn't think it smelled that bad, but the taste was another story.  the rice itself wasn't quite cooked to my liking...i prefer for my rice to come out a bit dry, and this was very different.  but over-moist rice i could live with.  there was nothing wrong with the beans themselves, either.  the biggest problem to me was the "sauce", for lack of a better way of putting it.  you know how when you buy plain, unseasoned canned beans they come canned along with this thick, gloopy juice-type liquid?  the "sauce" was essentially that stuff with a tiny bit of onion, garlic, and sea salt added, and it tastes every bit as bad as it looks as it oozes from canned beans when you drain them.  it almost makes me wonder...did they intend for people to drain the beans and rice before heating and eating?  if so, the can doesn't say.<br /><br />with a good deal of modification, this stuff might be edible, but i don't think there's anything that could be done to make it actually taste good.  i had picked up 1 can from Whole Foods to have for lunch at work, where i don't exactly have a good supply of seasonings on hand.  i ended up at the Greek place across the street instead, because i just couldn't make myself eat this.  based on what i'm seeing here, there are quite a few different varieties of "rice and beans" made by Eden.  perhaps some of the others are better.  in any case, if you're thinking of trying some, definitely DON'T start here!!  the pinto beans and rice are just awful!

review/text: I'm from the south. I'm no stranger to the rice and beans combo. This is one of the most foul things I have ever put in my mouth. It's not quite as bad as vomit, but it's close. Coming out of the can it smelled of rotten feet. I thought I'd give it a chance and heated it up. No luck. Now it tasted like hot rotten feet. Ketchup? Even worse. Maybe my dog will eat it.<br />I honestly feel like throwing up right now.<br /><br />It is THAT bad.<br /><br />I don't know what in the name of holy hell kind of pinto beans or rice they used, but DAMN.<br /><br />EPIC FAIL

review/summary: The best olive oil you've never heard about before
review/text: No joke. I wanted to start using olive oil for my family for health reasons but I honestly never understood why people liked it quite so much. It had...for lack of a better way to describe it...a strange aftertaste or taste on the back of my tongue that I found very unpleasant. I am very curious about food and always asked people about it...figuring it was entirely possible I hadn't had a good experience with olive oil. While vacationing in Florida I was in a Greek district (Tarpon Springs) and found a small Greek grocer who was extraordinarily kind. When we came to the olive oil section, he pointed out all the olive oils that were popular with tourists. My question to him was, "Which one do you have in your kitchen at home, though?" He pointed to this oil...the one with the peculiar logo was the one on his dinner table. I didn't try this until I got back home to Arkansas. In one teaspoon I was elated and crestfallen. I'd finally found a truly sweet, flavorful olive oil without the strange aftertaste. I now saw what people enjoyed and appreciated about this ingredient...and I live in B.F. Arkansas and finding it would likely be next to impossible..great. I started searching for it immediately. I found it on Amazon, but at the time they were out of stock. In my research, I found this is a farm who harvests and makes all the oil they can for their farm..then they are done until next season.  Well, that explained why it wasn't available at the time...and spoke to me about the commitment of this farm to only put out a quality product. I kept an eye out and once I found it was available again...I got a 3L can.  There are plenty of ingredients I can get just about anywhere. My olive oil is NOT one of those things. I am very picky. This olive oil is smooth, sweet and delicious. If that matters to you, this is the one to get. If not, buy whatever makes your tongue happy.

review/text: This is a God sent as I love the flavor of Sazon but, haven't been able to use it anymore due to having to follow a low salt diet.  The name brand Sazon is high in sodium and also contains MSG.  The Marshall's Creek version has only the herbs and spices and, believe me, tastes the same as the name brand but without the saltiness.  I've already used it to make paella, beef stew, and chicken fricasse. It works well with so many savory dishes.  If you need to cut down on sodium you can still create delicious meals with Marshall's Creek Sazon and many other Marshall's Creek seasonings.  I also bought their Adobo seasoning and it's also terrific.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Italian Tradition and Delicious Treat for All
review/text: For those who haven't experienced torrone almond honey nougat candy, you are in for a treat. This Italian specialty confection is authentic and a product of Italy. Although it looks like it will be hard and/or sticky, it is miraculously soft. Each piece is sealed in foil for freshness and carefully packaged in a small box like a gift. There are eighteen tiny boxes per 6.35 ounce package. When I was a child, after eating the candy, I would keep the little boxes and use them to store special treasures. I have added a photograph to show the individual packaging for each piece of candy.<br /><br />Only 45 calories per piece and 3 grams of fat with only half a gram of saturated fat, as far as candy goes, this is surprisingly natural. The candy is loaded with toasted almonds and flavored with vanilla, orange or lemon.  A distinctive very thin white wafer coats the front and back of the rectangle providing a satisfying lightly crisp texture. Torrone has a short ingredient list with toasted almonds as the first on the list and chemical additives thankfully absent, so there are no artificial colors or preservatives.<br /><br />There is nothing else like this Italian confection.  It is usually reserved for holidays, and I know in my house it wouldn't feel like Christmas or Easter without it, although it is certainly wonderful year round.  Ferrara's torrone would make a lovely hostess gift or an unusual treat to tuck into a Christmas stocking.

review/text: i grew up with the la florentine version. i should have went with that product instead of 'settling' based on price. the nougat is not at all delicate. it is ultra chewy and bordering on hard. not at all soft as is la florentine. the wafer paper is also not delicate, rather it is thick and very noticeable.<br /><br />i did not care for the taste of any. first i ate the orange flavored without looking at the box. it seemed to me to be heavy handed and, i thought, tasted of lemon. i checked the box to see if it were lemon, no. the lemon too was heavy handed. the vanila was borderline ok on not being overwhelming. all were to me, too sweet and too sticky. more like eating taffy than the sensual and delicate la florentine i grew up with.<br /><br />i was disappointed as my wife had never had these before. it was a poor showing of what i had thought they should have been. i had to apologize to her after having raved about the tastes i had on my own. i rapidly canceled my subscription package.

review/summary: It's not Christmas without it . . .
review/text: We grew up with another brand and I decided to take the plunge with Ferrara and try it.  Upon opening the top (which is a lift up flap) the blue colored boxes were all lined up.  There are vanilla, orange and lemon flavors.  I tried the vanilla.  Opened the little box and inside was a sealed metallic bag which held the goody.  It was a good size, for Torrone, and upon the first bite the rice paper wafer was fresh, the nougat was sweet but not sickeningly and the almonds were toasted and crisp.  Then the childhood memories flooded in - I'm sitting at the long, dining table with the credenza behind me and I'm facing the front window looking out at a winter day. The women in the kitchen doing dishes and cleaning up after a huge meal, the Italian chatter ebbs and flows, the men watching the Christmas sports in the other room, and me sneaking the first tastes of Torrone enjoying bite after bite of the delicate goodness.  Memories in a box and this brand didn't fail.

review/text: We have a 15 months old Blue Great Dane ... we still consider him as a puppy, even he is already 120 lbs. When we first got him at 10 weeks of age he was on Nutro Natural, but we switched him immediately to Eagle Pack, veterinarians and breeders pointed Eagle Pack as the shrpest formulated food for Giant Breeds.<br /><br />Since then we tried with Boston several other samples, from other brands. He seemed to like Nature's Choice Farm Stand Selects and Nutro Ultra food, but only for sampling. He's always happy to find a bowl full of Eagle there waiting for him to take of it.<br /><br />Regarding ingredients and supplements, Eagle Pack Super Premium is the far best of all. And the fact that it is specially balanced for Giant Breed dogs is something that You won't find anywhere else.<br /><br />Consider this food for Your Giant Breed best friend. Look at the labels, check the ingredients, read about protein balance and other stuff that your dog needs. I guarantee that You won;t find any other food that will come close to Eagle Pack. Let me now if I'm wrong. I will be happy to let Boston sample something else and than look at him when his all happy to go back to good ol' Eagle.<br /><br />Cheers !!!

review/summary: NOT good food
review/text: Long time online shopper, but first time ever writing a review. We have a 7 month old Great Dane pup. When we got her at 12 weeks, the breeder had her eating Holistic Select Giant breed puppy food, which was good for awhile. Then her stool became very loose. So upon reading other reviews we switched to Eagle Pack Giant breed puppy food. Her stool was still a little loose, but we thought that it was possibly the switch of the foods so we wanted to give it a chance. Well after about 5-30lb. bags of eagle pack, her stool was still very loose and she was eating her and our other dogs poop. (very gross to be kissed by that....YUCK) A friend told us that she was doing that because she was missing a vitamin or supplement in her diet. She was also consuming a tremendous amount of food as well as always voraciously hungry. We started researching what to do then all of the sudden she was having uncontrollable diarrhea, not good for a 100lb. puppy. We did not have time for anymore research we had to do something now!<br /><br />We ended up at a local store and discovered Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul Large Breed Puppy Dry Dog Food. We decided to try a a 18lb bag, even though the protein levels were a couple percentage points higher than we had been told to give a Great Dane. But the list of ingredients was wonderful when compared with a lot of other top brands, I am no expert but just reading the long list of ingredients it seemed that they had more all natural ingredients, as opposed to the supplements that the others were putting in their food.<br /><br />We got it home and immediately made a complete switch from the Eagle Pack food she was on. We did not do the customary blending of foods for a week or so to introduce the new food and ween her off the old. We did not have time as her tummy was so upset, we also did not want anymore of the Eagle Pack in her system. She loved the taste and gobbled it up. Within about 24 hours her poops started to firm up a bit. This got progressively better as the week went by, but still a little soft as to make picking up difficult especially on grass. We added In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs to her food and presto she pretty much has a firm stool every time, She is also eating noticeably less food (YAY!$$$) which she seams to be getting better nourishment from it. She is also no longer eating poop (YAY!!!). We attribute that the little bit extra protein in this food is what she was missing from her diet. We are going to ween her off the In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs and see how she does without the supplement now that she is totally use to her new food.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br />1. Good quality ingredients<br />2. Less supplements than some other brands<br />3. Slightly higher protein than we would like, but it keeps her from eating poop so that is ok<br />4. Affordable<br />5. Retains more of the food so she eats less, which saves a fair amount of money.<br />6. Her coat is super shiny and healthy<br /><br />P.S. We also switched our senior citizen American Bulldog to the Eagle Pack Adult food, and she got a very loose stool as well, and she has never been loose a day in her life. We now have her on Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Large Breed Dry Dog Food, and she is great and very healthy as well.

After being on it for about 4 month or more now I am convinced that it is worth the price for several reasons:  Our dog eats less of this food because of the higher protein content so a bag last a long time, his coat is shiny and he doesn't stink like our other dogs did.  That is what amazes me the most is that his breath isn't horrible like most dogs and that he doesn't stink at all!  I will continue to buy this for our dog as long as I am able!

I also got her some of the chicken flavor, which has even lower protein and uses rice as its first ingredient.

review/summary: Only buy when on sale
review/text: I bought this recently when Amazon had it on sale, ended up being around $6.00 a pound.  Not a bad price for an organic whole bean coffee.  Description says it finishes with a sweet marshmallow taste, I didn't find that to be true.  I would rate it as average, good coffee flavor, but not worth the regular price.

review/summary: Delicious Alternative to Sugar
review/text: If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great Price for Great Sweetener!
review/text: A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally.

review/summary: Not as great as I'd hoped
review/text: They were discontinuing these at my local grocery store and after purchasing this... I can kind of see why. I know that this isn't going to be an eating experience akin to fresh or even frozen tuna steaks, but I expected a little more than this.<br /><br />Taste-wise, there's not a lot of mesquite flavor. This was more salty than anything else. It's not a horrible flavor, but when you compare it to some of the flavors that abound in the bagged/canned/ready-to-eat tuna market this just falls short. I've tasted far better.<br /><br />Texture-wise, my tuna was rather dry in texture. I wasn't expecting it to be like the tuna you cook up yourself, so this wasn't really a deal breaker for me. Bagged tuna is sort of a 50/50 type of thing as far as texture and dryness goes, although I did note that there was a substantial amount of water in the bag.<br /><br />Overall this is just one of those items that is just a disappointment. It's not bad enough to where you'd feed the remaining bags of tuna to the stray cats or chuck the rest of your meal in the trash, but it isn't good enough to where you can see yourself going out of your way to buy more of it in the future. I've got a couple more of these tuna steaks in different flavors, so I'll see if those are any different. I wouldn't say that you should avoid this, but it wasn't really something I'd recommend rushing out and buying either.

review/text: I saw these at the grocery store and decided to try them.  I think they were two boxes of ten packets for $5.<br /><br />I figured I would try one box and see how I like them. The box mine came in look a little different than the box pictured here but appear to be the same product.<br /><br />They turned out to be pretty good. The grape flavor dominates but there was bit of the cranberry flavor in the background. Nice and sweet tasting. According to the box it is sweetened with a mixture of aspartame and ace K.<br /><br />ETA 10-23-12<br />I liked it enough to buy some more. The price was reduced at the store I got them at to 2 pkgs for $3 on sale. IMO a bargain. I think it tastes a lot like grape juice with just a hint of cranberry. It freezes well into something akin to a sweet grape Popsicle if one uses about 12 ounces of water instead of 16 ounces. The taste is quite sweet but it does not induce carb cravings in me.

review/summary: Yum! - but don't use too much!
review/text: I'm not sure how much good a review of Szechuan peppercorns will do for anyone.  If you're looking for it on Amazon, then you probably know what you're getting.  I bought the 4-oz package, which was a huge amount of the product -- easily enough for a year in our house of once-per-week stir fry.  These were fairly priced, and had plenty of punch -- a little too much punch, in fact.  My favorite recipe for stir fried Szechuan chicken with ginger calls for a tablespoon of these.  The result was a meal that smelled wonderful, but all we could taste was the peppercorns.<br /><br />So if you're looking for that "spicy/numb" mouth-feel, these are what you're looking for.  You might want to dial the portions back a little, though.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I ordered this product since it was the cheapest per volume available on Amazon, but what I learned was that you get what you pay for.  The product I received had a high quantity, well over half of the pods, with seeds in them.  The seeds aren't terribly difficult to remove, but it is very time consuming.  I had read on line that you can just grind them in mrtar and pestle (recipe I was using wanted powdered Szechuan pepper) but the seed when broken have a texture roughly equivalent to sand.<br /><br />I was also disappointed with the flavor intensity, I don't know if this is a problem with this particular product or if descriptions were simply overblown, but I got very little flavor out of the ones I used and what I considered to be a level of 'numbing spice' that was not even worth mentioning. Disappointed

review/text: I've been buying this by the case on subscribe & save, and have found this to be really useful.  I can simply make it up per the directions, and it makes a quick tasty lunch that gives me energy for hours.  love the sliced nuts in it - gives it some crunch).  I keep a case of it at work for lunch breaks.  When I'm home, I experiment with it by cooking up a cup, and then mixing it with noodles, soups, chili, eggs, whatever I'm trying to use up that is in the refrigerator.  I really like mixing a cooked up cup of this with a packet of the pre-cooked organic quinoa that I also buy through Amazon's subscribe & save, that's an excellent vegetarian protein combination, and digests really well, gives me energy to get through my work day afternoon.  The spice packet that comes with this product is quite nippy (for my Irish heritage taste bud setup) so I use 3/4 of it when I eat it just out of the cup, but works perfectly when I mix it with anything else.  It's a great product, and inexpensive, and easy to prepare, just add water to the paper cup it comes in and microwave.  I keep several cases (6 cups) in the pantry.
