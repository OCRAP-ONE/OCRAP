review/summary: Sold out in local store
review/text: Ok I don't rate many food items.  I am afraid to give it 5 stars because that is going to make it more difficult to find.  My local store had a shelf set up for 15 items.  I saw how all the shelves were full of BBQ sauces and this one was off the shelf minus one bottle.  I just made some pulled pork wanted a new sauce.  So I bought the last bottle.  I could not believe the flavor.  It has a little not much heat in the backround and full of flavor.  I had two of my other favorite sauces out and tried a taste of them after having this one, Guy Fieri sauce made my favorite sauces taste flat!  So went back and still shelf is empty so paying to buy more online its that good!

review/summary: Good quality water biscuits
review/text: These Wellington Cracked Pepper Water Crackers are of good quality, made of winter wheat in Canada.  They have evenly-distributed flecks of mild black pepper that lend a very subtle peppery taste to the usual plain table water cracker.  They are evenly baked but a bit darker around the edges than in the photo on the box.<br /><br />I always like to keep some water biscuits on hand as sometimes no other cracker will do.  They were also my great-grandfather's and my grandmother's favorite crackers.  I prefer them to bread to serve with good cheese.<br /><br />I have not bought these from Amazon and it would be interesting for someone to comment on whether they arrive in good condition or broken from shipping.<br /><br />Serving size:  4 Crackers (15 g)<br />Servings per container:  about 8<br />The box has 4.4 oz or 125 g total and I have found that there are usually 36 crackers in the box, not 32.<br /><br />Each serving has 60 calories and not much else:<br />Total fat - 1 g<br />Sodium - 65 mg<br />Total carbohydrates - 11 g<br />Protein - 1 g<br /><br />Ingredients: Enriched wheat flour, canola oil and/or sunflower oil, cracked black pepper, salt, sugar, ascorbic acid and citric acid.

review/summary: Not as good as Nestle Kit Kats
review/text: I was very disappointed by the flavor of these Kit Kats which completely lacked any chocolateyness in the way I'm use to from Kit Kats.<br /><br />After some searching around on the web I found that Kit Kats in the States are made by Hershey rather than Nestl&eacute; and although Hershey license the exact same recipe from Nestl&eacute; to make their Kit Kats the vital 'Chocolate' itself comes from a different recipe; the so called 'Hershey Chocolate' flavor.<br /><br />Sadly this 'Hershey Chocolate' flavor is just that. Compare it to a Nestl&eacute; made Kit Kats and the difference is staggering. Nestl&eacute; Kit Kats actually taste like chocolate and not a mere sweet, slightly grainy paste.<br /><br />When a say 'tastes' like Chocolate. You may argue that the taste of Chocolate is what you grew up on. If you grew up on Hershey Chocolate you'd say that was the taste of Chocolate and the Nestl&eacute; chocolate was something else. I would disagree though... having tasted 60% to 80% real chocolate I can say the Nestl&eacute; Kit Kat's taste is much closer to this real chocolate bar.<br /><br />Indeed in Canada you can actually buy Kit Kat Dark which have a higher Cocoa content. Quite delicious; and I find myself more restrained in eating them because of the stronger flavour which is a good thing!<br /><br />So if you're a Canadian (or from anywhere else where you are use to the original Nestl&eacute; Kit Kat) looking to save a few bob by buying your Kit Kats in bulk from the States... be warned!

review/summary: best cereal, hard to find in stores
review/text: This is our favorite cereal by far. It has a good amount of fiber, but does not have that cardboard-like texture of some other cereals. The flakes don't get soggy and the oatmeal clusters and raisins are very tasty.  This is hard to find locally and the few stores that carry it are often sold out.  It was amazing to find that I can get it through Amazon, at a better price than we had been paying.  I ordered two to qualify for the free shipping, and they arrived earlier than I expected.

review/summary: Oatmeal Crisp Cereal
review/text: 10+ years of eating Oatmeal Crisp and still loving it. I've tried others (only if the grocer was out of Oatmeal Crisp) and have never found a suitable replacement for my morning breakfast favorite. I usually add a banana (sometimes strawberries) and 2% milk. The cereal has a great crunch right down to the end of the bowl...no soggy flakes as in other wannabes. When the grocer stopped carrying this cereal, and I couldn't find it in the other local stores, I went online and found that Amazon would deliver to my door...I now get 4 boxes every two months...without ever having to think about it. Automatic. What could be better!  -sniperboy360

review/summary: 3.5 stars
review/text: This is a cereal for grown ups but maybe not dieters, 240 calories in a one cup serving. For the full range of vitamins and minerals this manufacturer's Total or Kelloggs Product 19 are better choices.<br /><br />The appeal here is more texture than Total, which turns to mush if it sits too long. The flakes seem to have some kind of lacquer-like coating that renders them invulnerable to the encroachments of milk in the bowl. It doesn't go so far as to turn into a bag of granola but the power dosage of raisins will appeal to those who like a chewy cereal.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is probably engineered to appeal to those seeking a product advertised as being heart healthy, a whole grain product for older health-conscious buyers who place a priority on having healthy stools.

review/summary: A cooks dream if you want to reduce sodium.
review/text: This is a great seasoning.  My dad taught me how to cook and our favorite basic spice combination for meat, fish and poultry is salt pepper and paprika.  Decided to eliminate salt from my diet and tried a some supermarket brands that were not great.  Kept looking and saw a spot for this at Costco but it is always empty.<br /><br />Instead of waiting I got it here on Amazon and have been using it for a few days.  This is great.  The closest to salt(I can't taste the difference) but the mix of flavors actually work better with meat, poultry and fish.<br /><br />My only concern was using it in soups but I ground it up and it was perfect in my favorite summer soup (corn chowder with crab/shrimp).  I love it.<br /><br />Ingredients(from the back of the bottle):<br /><br />Organic onion, organic garlic, organic carrot, organic black pepper, organic red bell pepper, organic tomato granules, organic orange peel, organic parsley organic bay leaves, organic thyme, organic basil, organic celery, organic lemon peel, organic oregano, organic savory, organic mustard seed, organic cumin, Organic marjoram, organic coriander, organic cayenne pepper, citric acid and organic rosemary.<br /><br />I love this and it is a great salt replacement.

Or Potatoes, Butternut Squash and Carrots and lots of onion(add a little fast fry teryaki beef strips to the pot once finished cooking, and you have yourself a tasty meal). Robust flavor.

review/summary: Great Tasting Spice..But No Real Substitute For Salt
review/text: Make no mistake about it, this is a very healthy mix of ingredients that have a definite salt like flavor, or essence to them.  Course cut morals of pungent bulbs like onion and garlic with quite a few other things mixed in make this an excellent blend for soups, stews, casseroles, and what not.  I especially like its flavor in my home made spaghetti sauce.  Like other reviews have noted, I believe its the addition of orange peel and citric acid that gives the blend its punch that reminds one of salt.  I love this stuff and plan on ordering it often.  That being said, I have to also admit that this is not a true salt substitute in my opinion.  Some other reviewers refer to it as that, but I honestly believe that true saltaholics like myself will enjoy the mix, but still reach for the salt shaker, albeit perhaps with not as much to use in mind.  Most mixtures on Amazon that call themselves salt substitutes contain an alternative that is indeed salty, like potassium chloride for example.  Or, they are just a mixture of real salt and spices.  This Kirkland blend does not contain any salt substitute per say, and in my opinion it won't qualify for one if you are a true salt lover.  As mentioned before, this is a very course blend of ingredients that being large, are best suited for sauces, soups, etc.  It's by far the best use of this product as opposed to sprinkling it directly on your food.  In conclusion, I highly recommend this mix on all three counts.  Taste, value, and for the healthy choice that it is.  If you're looking for a true salt substitute for sprinkling on your food I feel you may be a little disappointed, IF you are a true saltaholic that is.  As a nice spicy mix for your kitchen however, I feel it will become a delicious asset to your cooking skills to be sure.  Recommended...

review/text: First off... I don't write reviews of everything I buy... just things that really stick out to me and to be honest I can't believe I'm reviewing a spice but this stuff is da bomb!!!<br /><br />I was over a friends house the other day and she made some homemade smashed potatoes that were amazing. I asked her how she seasoned them and such was my introduction to this secret weapon. I've been a member of Costco for a while but never even noticed this spice (probably b/c of the "no-salt" on the label - I know it's bad for me but I love me some salt)<br /><br />I usually season my white rice by adding some garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, salt and butter while it's cooking. It's nice but I wouldn't just eat a bowl of it by itself. Well, I went to Costco today to pick up my secret weapon and just made a nice big pot of rice and tasted it.... so far I had two packed bowls & I'm going back for more. I can just imagine what this will taste like on chicken, a sprinkle in omelets, soups... I feel like I can toss all of my spices now. If you're a member of Costco, buy it there, if not, it's totally worth the price. I'd still buy it w/o giving a second thought.

review/summary: Huge Bottle - The Spices are O.K.
review/text: Huge bottle and should last a year at least.  The spices are good but I still had to include other spices and vegetables to make the dishes good.  Unless the food is meant to be bland, one can't depend on the contents of this jar alone to provide all the flavor the food requires to taste really good.

review/summary: Really Good
review/text: This is a nice blend of spices. I definitely need less salt when I use this. It is in no way a complete substitute for table salt, though. My friend tells me it is similar to a product sold at Trader Joes. Their "21 Seasoning Salute" comes in a smaller size for about the same price per ounce as this product. They suggest grinding the seasoning to release more flavor.

review/summary: No-salt Seasoning !!! Thanks Scooby
review/text: I'm sure a lot of you guys are here because of the Scooby Bodybuilding, and Here is my review. Well if you've made it so far and you are here reading this review then don't expect it to be a real taste changing seasoning that you would expect to be real delicious and will make your food exceptionally tasty.But it does it's job, being all organic and add a little taste to the food with a distinctive flavor. I add a lot of it on my food while cooking and finish my meal without complaining about the taste or flavor. For a small experiment I let my cousins try it and they didn't like it, may be matter the fact they are not trying to lose the water weight/don't care about adding extra water weight. But go ahead and order it as it will help you to improve your habit of consuming a lot of sodium everyday. All you need is your willingness to achieve what this product helps you with being simple and organic, cutting down the sodium in take.

review/summary: Delicious Organic Raw Honey!!
review/text: I recently made a big move, and forgot to take the remaining 15 lb. tub of organic raw Canadian honey (from "Tropical Traditions") I bought this spring.  I almost bought another one from their website, because they had it on sale for $99.  However my funds are pretty low at the moment, so I searched for one a little less expensive.  In the end I bought this particular honey (at "VitaCost") for under $7.<br /><br />It arrived today, and I just tried it a few moments ago.  It's very similar to the Canadian honey, with maybe a little more pronounced floral taste (the jar says that it is sourced from Canada, and Brazil)!  I also love the fact that it's in a glass jar; so for any of you worried about leaching from plastic containers- I highly recommend this!  The consistency is very solid.  If you want it runny, you're going to have to run the jar under hot water, etc.  I personally don't mind it like this.  It's also got a white film just like the other honey had.  ..This is now the only honey I care to buy!

review/summary: Rich flavorful pinto beans every time
review/text: I discovered this spice years ago as a native Texan as it is stocked in nearly every grocery store in our state. It is  inexpensive to keep on hand to make a flavorful pot of beans with or without salt pork, bacon or any other meat added. It has garlic, onion, chili peppers and other spices to make a rich savory flavor that will have your guests asking what you use to season your beans.  I have given it out as gifts and the recipients tell me they still use it to make every pot of beans they cook.

review/text: I agree with some of the other reviewers (for the NON-Classic syrup). I have been buying this product, mostly to add to coffee, for several years. At some point, I noticed that the flavor changed, and (to my palate at least), it was a change for the worse. After noticing some of the recent reviews, I made sure to order the "Classic" flavor when my supply started to run low. When it arrived, I taste-tested vs. the "non-Classic" syrup that I still had on hand, and (again, to my palate), the "Classic" tasted far superior. I suppose other people may prefer the new flavor, but for me, the Classic is the one I'll order from now on.

review/text: I acknowledge all the things said about this dinner by the previous reviewer.  However, my interpretation is different-- I loved it.  For one thing, I suspected it had MSG.  Why?  Because it was so delicious.  I love MSG, no matter how bad a rap it's gotten over the past few years.<br /><br />This is comfort food, plain and simple.  No, it's not healthy.  If you're sensitive to salt or heavy preservatives, leave it on the shelf.  I suspect there's really no way for them to make something that doesn't need refrigeration without preservatives anyway.  Bottom live, I adored this and the chicken noodle variety, and avidly look forward to trying some of the other chicken varieties (I don't do beef or pork).

review/summary: Tastes OK for a processed food
review/text: The taste of this product is acceptable. It's about what I expected from a processed food product. Not "I have to have it again", but not "yuck! this belongs in the garbage". There's no wow factor here in terms of presentation or flavor, but it'll do if you're crimped for time.<br /><br />The turkey doesn't taste much like turkey. It's more like a hard disc of indistinct dry white/pinkish meat due to the manufacturing process. It changed the texture and flavor significantly in exchange for shelf life. Frozen TV dinners I've had contain turkey slices that are soft, relatively juicy, and really do taste like turkey that you'd get in cold cuts. This Hormel "turkey disc" does not taste like that.<br /><br />The stuffing is adequate. It's mushy, but the texture is greatly improved by the crunchy bits of celery added to it. The gravy is not so tasty and has a slight aftertaste that I found strange and unnatural. It does not taste like chicken broth.<br /><br />This product is relatively high in sodium at 960mg (40% of daily value). Good in a pinch or as survival food because it doesn't require refrigeration, but I do not recommend eating processed food on a regular basis for health reasons.

review/summary: Yep, It's OK In A Pinch
review/text: If you've seen my reviews for some other Hormal Compleats, this goes about in the middle.  Not as good as the meatloaf; but not as bad as the chicken with dressing.  Edible and handy and quick. Opinion.<br /><br />Let's just understand what these Compleats are and what we mostly use them for: a quick lunch.  I doubt that anyone expects a gourmet meal, nor anything with a lot of flavor because that might lose Hormel's mass-market appeal.  They're simple, non-intrusive quick snacks in most cases.<br /><br />We shouldn't expect a lot; we should expect salt.  That's how it's done, as most folks find salt and/or MSG make otherwise bland foods more palatible.  These are good for what they are and let's not expect fine dining or overly costly "health foods."<br /><br />In this case, you have your basic turkey, thin-sliced; OK but semi-bland dressing; and a semi-bland gravy, probably because somebody decided there just should be gravy dumped over this. Goes down fine; but not something we should get excited about.<br /><br />It's OK in a pinch.

BUT, it tasted pretty good, and is ready in 90 seconds with no refrigeration needed....so you have to cut them some slack! The meat is a pressed meat, but is not fatty or full of cartilage. The main portion is the stuffing, which is pretty good. Small bits of celery are still crunchy! The gravy sticks the whole thing together. If you have been in the military, you will recognize the MRE-like consistency...<br />I recommend this item, but don't pay more than 11 bucks for the 6 pack. Over that, it is NOT worth the price!

review/text: I bought some of these as last resort meals for when I don't have time to make something else.  They're better than I expected.  I wouldn't want them for Thanksgiving dinner, but they make a tasty quick lunch or dinner.  Yes, the dressing is nondescript, as are most commercial dressings, but it complements the turkey nicely.  It does have a lot of gravy; I'm not a big gravy person, but it's tasty too.<br /><br />I tried some non-frozen meals in the past, and I found them to be inedible, with an objectionable taste and texture.  These turkey meals are comparable to a frozen turkey dinner, except that they are stored at room temperature.<br /><br />Since these are sealed with plastic to keep them from spoiling, the plastic does not peel off readily when you want it to.  I had to slice through it with a sharp knife.

This is perfect for lunch or an easy dinner, esp if you add a small side salad. It's not too salty (although salty enough, and very flavorful) and the stuffing has celery and what appear to be tiny dices of water chestnuts because there are tiny crunchy bits...you get a hearty stuffing--not just croutons and gravy. I bought this at the grocery store on sale for $2...so buying it on Amazon is actually a bit cheaper and delivered to my door. If you like Marie Callender's turkey and stuffing frozen meal, then this is for you. The turkey (2 meaty slices) sits over the top of heaven and is enrobed in brown glory. Deeelish.

There are two slices of Turkey on a bed of stuffing. Good quick comfort food. Add green beans, corn, or whatever else you can get out of a can and zap in a couple of minutes and you're good to go. Also good to eat if you are sick and need some warm food.<br /><br />They must have irradiated them or something because no refrigeration is necessary. Just like canned food but better.

review/text: Hormel's Compleats Turkey & Dressing was the first of the Compleats meals I tried. I wasn't disappointed. It's very easy to prepare and I was pleasantly surprised to find the turkey white meat that wasn't stringy or grissly. Since I like plain bread stuffing... the stuffing was a nice compliment. It led me to try other varieties (I like the chicken breast with stuffing or mashed potatoes, roast beef with mashed potatoes, and the beef tips). You do not need (or want to) add salt to this! If you're tired and want a quick hot 'meal', this is the one to try. Only takes two minutes! I wish I could figure how to remove the plastic cover easily, though.

review/summary: Hormel Compleats Are Great!
review/text: My husband and I LOVE these Compleat Dinners!  I chose the turkey version because it is relatively low in fat and calories.  I love the 90 second prep time (although I usually add another 15 seconds to make sure it's really hot).  It you're in a real hurry and want a tasty meal in seconds, these dinners are your choice.  We have also tried several of the other flavors, some of which measure up and some of which don't but they're all at least acceptable and you can't beat the convenience  --  especially the fact that they're shelf-stable and don't need refrigeration or freezing.

review/summary: Delicious, but high stuffing-to-turkey ratio
review/text: This is one of my favorite Compleats meals due to its dependably tender, grizzle-free turkey.  The decent stuffing and tasty gravy complement it nicely.  My only gripe, however, is that it's mostly stuffing piled beneath a mere two slices of turkey.  Stuffing is, of course, useless "food", albeit a pleasant side dish, so I wish Hormel would replace two thirds of the stuffing with green beans and mashed potatoes (yes, I know, starch on top of starch, but at least potatoes are far healthier than white bread).  I can just hear Hormel saying, "Easy for HER to say", so, more realistically, how 'bout half the stuffing and twice the turkey and we can add our own veggies when we want to approximate a real meal.  As it stands, this is just a delicious, high glycemic-index snack with a pinch of animal protein.

review/summary: This product has an 'OK' quality to it!
review/text: This 'turkey and dressing' unit was better tasting than some of the other Hormel microwaveable products I bought recently to try out.  It still has way to much salt but at least the flavor is decent.  Again, the gravy is substantial and helps mask the blandness of the turkey and stuffing. However, I will NOT be buying this product again.  At almost 1,500 mg of salt, ~ 30 to 45 grams of carbohydrates, ~3 to 20 grams of sugar and ~10 to 15% of saturated fat per serving this would not be considered a good diet for anyone.  They do have 13 to 24 grams of protein in the form of "hydrogenated" corn, soy, and wheat protein.  They also have MSG hidden in the ingredients list as 'autolyzed yeast extract'.  I find it hard to believe that this big company can not make a decent product that is not loaded with CRAP!  I DO NOT recommend this product at all!!!

review/text: So I purchased this and now feel so suckered.  I was thinking I must have been starving when I ordered this.  Don't be dare fooled by the pictures and the other reviews of this product.  I am almost certain that Hormel has their employees or pays employees to write good reviews on their product here.<br /><br />I am a dude that usually eats just about anything.  I'm taking this "food" to a shelter or something.  I have not fully decided yet because I'm not so sure I want to put the homeless folks through it.  That's how bad the stuff is.  The chemical taste in the food is noticeable and it's down right nasty.<br /><br />I can't believe  I was duped into buying this product.  Hopefully I can get at least some satisfaction of knowing that someone homeless got to eat something. I don't usually waste my time writing reviews.  However, sitting here feeling a bit sick to the stomach, I just had to.<br /><br />Simply put... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

review/summary: hormel compleats are not tasty
review/text: I tried the beef, turkey, and chicken compleats and didn't like any of them. I had bought double of each compleat so I tried to get my brother and sister to try them and they didn't like them either. I bought so many because I really love the Hormel refrigerated entrees; the roast beef, beef roast, aus jus, and pot roast are really tasty and better then any other brand you can buy. The Compleats just don't have any taste. If you are making a doomsday zombie apocalypse stockpile and want items that don't need to be refrigerated then Compleats are much better then MRE's but these have a one year expiration date so you would have to eat them occasionally to keep a fresh rotation.

review/summary: The most edible of these dinners, if you do not disturb ithe stuffing's fluffy integrity.
review/text: The most edible of these dinners, if you do not disturb ithe stuffing's fluffy integrity.<br />You have to crack the edge, peel back a bit, cook it a couple minutes, then let it sit/rest a minute.<br />When you eat it, do not transfer it to a plate or stir it up...it will ruin the fluffy consistency of the stuffing and will turn into glue.<br />Eat it just as it sits, it will taste fine.<br />I gave it four stars just because the others are so horrible it rates it.  You can't spoil the Turkey anymore than it already is by microwaving it, because it is already over processed, not like you spoil the little bitty chicken breast with stuffing dinner. Even though it' two thin pieces, it still looks like it's real meat, not surprise loaf...thus, 4 stars.<br /> It would be less than one star compared to my old home cooking. Too bad I can't stand long enough to cook anymore.  I never knew I would ruin my body by being so hard on it staying in shape when I was younger.  Now I wish I sat around and did nothing my whole life, at least I'd be able to cook again.  Argh, we think life has all the possibilities in the world until our independence goes...used to fix everything myself too.  So, for now I'm stuck trying to find edible alternatives to home cooking....<br />Healthy Choice Bean with Ham soup and Vegetarian Chili are the only foods I can buy here that are as good as my homemade. A few years ago I lived off Omaha Steak's food, but now I am concerned with spending money I may not have long.

What's REALLY neat is you get 3 DIFFERENT flavors in the pack.<br /><br />As a rule of thumb, when I have to open up the last container of something I immediately place another order and didn't until the bag was getting very low.  THEN Amazon was out of it and I had to wait until they got more.<br /><br />It is great Amazon notifies their customers when a product is available and I was sure glad when I got the email from them telling me they had more of this brand.<br /><br />I hope Amazon never stops selling this stuff.

review/text: Like others have said, the consistency of this stage 2 combo is very thin, but it could be thickened with oatmeal or cereal. My 7 mth old loved the flavor and impatiently waited for more, which she doesn't do with all baby foods. I like that it contains spinach for iron and fruit for antioxidants and to sweeten it a bit. I wouldn't use these everyday while I'm home because they are somewhat costly per pouch, but they are a terrific option for travel or when you need something easy on hand to feed baby. I tried squeezing the contents of the pouch into her mouth, which she didn't particularly like, but I think that's just because she's used to being fed with a spoon. An older baby could squeeze and eat this themselves and if you find yourself without a spoon, it's a great option.

review/summary: A convenient and healthy snack!
review/text: My two-year-old devours these. We've tried all of the different flavor combinations Happy Tot has to offer, and this is by far our favorite - incredible, really, when it's nearly impossible to get my son to even touch peas or green beans. Like most fruit / veggie pouches, these travel well and are convenient for on-the-go. The lid screws back on as well in case your tot doesn't finish his / her snack. The Subscribe & Save price is right for us as well - at barely over $1 per pouch, these are the cheapest snack pouches to be found!

review/summary: Did not receive the size indicated
review/text: I love this product, but I received the 3.5 ounce packages instead of the stated 4.2 oz. It is still a good price if you use the subscribe and save, though.

review/summary: Great on-the-go snack
review/text: I love HappyBaby fruit/veggie pouches!  They all taste great, have good nutritional value, and come very handy when you have a cranky hungry toddler on your hands. The pouches still don't replace the real fruits and veggies, of course, but serve well when traveling or outside and need not make a mess.

review/summary: the new favorite
review/text: this is now Baby's new favorite food. She would take it out of my hands and feed herself pressing the food out of the pouch with her hands. I am not sure this was intended to be fed that way but when you have a picky eater ...This is still very fluid and well mixed- no chunks.

review/summary: Only way I can get some veggies in!
review/text: Insert picky 20 month old who is anti veggies and a frustrated mom who is willing to try anything. These really are a life saver when it comes time to making sure my daughter is getting in some type of veggie when she eats. She use to be a great eater but once the toddler stage came it all went down hill. Sure they are pricey but I know that she will always gobble this up when offered. We don't eat these everyday just a few times a week and Amazon has the best price!

review/summary: My little girl's FAVE flavor of TOT HappySqueezes
review/text: I love the variety of flavors and fruit/veggie combinations HappyTot offers.  Being a foodie myself, I don't really expect my little one to want to eat the same flavors or items every day so knowing I can offer her a variety and great combos like the Banana, Mango and Peach pouch has been a great saving grace since she really likes to try different things almost weekly.  This flavor seems to be her favorite one though as she'll eat this one or ask me via 'sign' for this pouch more then the others.  With it being organic, all fruits and with great vitamins, I'm thrilled to have this readily available for her to enjoy.

review/summary: Great for picky eaters!
review/text: I can always count on my 1 1/2 year old twins loving their HappyTots. Even on the days when they throw all of their other food on the floor. It's nice to have these around so I at least know they are getting some organic fruits and veggies (with none of the yucky additives that so many other kids foods have!) I also find that the squash & apple flavor makes a nice addition to oatmeal, muffins, and pasta sauces (a great way to sneak in even more veggies!)
