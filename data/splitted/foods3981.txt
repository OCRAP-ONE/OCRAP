review/text: Ok, these are not the best noodles you will ever have,<br />However, if you are looking for variety and on a diet then they serve their purpose.<br /><br />I recently had a personal breakthrough while dieting:<br />1. Loosing weight is not about eating what you want, that is how we got FAT to begin with.<br />2. As long as you are not hungry, you will not fall off your diet!<br /><br />Therefore, these are good for your purpose.

review/summary: ~Konjac Shirataki Noodles Pasta~
review/text: Well, I thought I'd finally let the cat out of the bag and share with those of you who miss pasta products the way I had. I've discovered a wonderful type of yam-noodle that has been eaten and enjoyed by Japanese families for centuries. It's probably one of the reasons there's so little heart disease in that country. This amazing product is called 'Konjac Shirataki Noodles'. This pasta product comes in many shapes and sizes for all types of pasta-style dishes. I, personally, prefer the Angel-Hair type and the Mini Pearl type pastas. If you're interested in enjoying this wonderful, safe, fiber-rich food source, then look no further than here at Amazon.com.  I hope you enjoy trying this excellent food choice as much as I've enjoyed sharing the gem with all of you. It's a totally guilt-free food. Zero calories, zero carbs, zero sodium, zero fat; just pure soluble fiber. It's a perfect food choice for the Type ll food plan. Due to the fact it's pure fiber, any meal that contains the konjac-pasta will keep one full and satiated for hours. I've been using this pasta daily since October, 2007. I'm certain it's helped with my most recent blood-work panels, too.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Not great
review/text: These noodles have a weird texture that takes some getting used to, and they have no flavor whatsoever. They are best used in asian type dishes. I wouldn't recommend tomato, or cream based sauces, they do not work very well with that. Overall, they really shouldn't be used in most cases to replace pasta in a dish, but if you are just looking for something to fill you up with few calories this is a good food to get.

review/summary: I do not plan on buying these again
review/text: I had read earlier reviews about the noodles smelling like fish. This made me wary to buy them, but I decided to be adventurous and got them anyway. When I first cooked them, there was no fishy smell that I could detect. The only problem I found was the texture. It was like jell and rubber combined. Once I got used to the texture, they were ok, but did not absorb much of the sauce they were cooked in. I do not plan on buying these again, but may consider trying one of their flavored noodles.

review/summary: Finally tried them
review/text: I have been hearing about konjac noodles for the past couple of years and finally got around to trying them. They are actually not too bad, if you are looking for a high-fiber, low glycemic and zero-calorie food. I ate mine with marinara sauce and although it wasn't great, it wasn't that bad either. I agree with other reviewers that it would be better in Asian dishes. I might try this instead of rice noodles in Pancit (an epic Filipino dish) or maybe Pad Thai. I  have a really great recipe for a low-fat Seafood Alfredo but I just don't think the texture of these noodles (even the ribbon/fettuccine-like cut of konjac/shirataki noodles) would cut it for that dish.<br /><br />To echo other reviewers: if you are sensitive to texture, you will probably have a hard time with konjac noodles. They can be rubbery. I think they are chewy and they remind me a little bit of calamari. I think konjac/shirataki noodles are a great thing f you are on a restricted diet, or if texture is something you can get used to.<br /><br />The smell when I opened the package was not exactly palatable, but I soaked them in cold water, and rinsed them in the colander, and the smell completely went away.<br /><br />All in all, even though the texture wasn't so rad, the plus side (calorie-free, carb-free, and high-fiber foodstuff to eat even if I've hit my daily allotment for food) definitely outweighs (heh, no pun intended) the downsides (chewiness, no taste) of the konjac/shirataki noodles. 4/5 stars.

review/text: The taste it's OK, it will just pick up other flavors in the dish but is a fantastic option for dieters. Just replace your diner mael with a bag of these with some veggies and tell me after one week.... For a great tasting meal, add one teaspon of peanut butter. DELICIOUS!!!!! but it will add about 100-200 calories to the dish which is a lot. I only recommend this variation very ocasionally, otherwise you won't loose weight. I buy this product in bulk from Konjac.

review/text: I ordered the angel hair noodles, and after one bite, I threw them down the garbage disposal.  Their texture is not really "al dente", and they have no discernable flavor.  I covered them with my favorite pasta sauce, but their texture and tastelessness made them seem just awful.  The closest description I can come up with?  Imagine soggy styrofoam...then you have a sense of what I experienced.  I know that some people have given positive reviews.  Perhaps they are less particular; I don't know.  I ordered 4 bags, and I have three left.  I'll probably just throw them away; I can't imagine offering them to anyone else.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Disclaimer - I am aware that there is no replacement or substitution for freshly ground spices, and hand prepared garam masala from a handed down recipe, etc.  That being said, here are my main comments about this item:<br /><br />1. The flavors work very well and this product has an excellent blend of fragrant spices.  I have used this in a butter chicken recipe, vegetable recipes, and to add a little kick or pick me up to normal dishes.  A little goes a long way!<br />2. The price is very reasonable, and I don't think I could have made this for less money (if I bought the spices from the local supermart) - and to be honest, I don't have a dedicated spice grinder at home. :)<br />3. Quantity - the producers give you a substantial amount of the spice mix in each container, especially for what I think is a really low price.  Take advantage of this!<br /><br />In a lot of indian, pakastani and sri lankan recipes, garam masala is a popular ingredient, so it is good to have this on hand and make the initial investment in the spice.  For years, what has stopped me from really getting involved in cooking these types of cuisine is the sometimes insane amount of spices they require - many of which I don't have readily on hand.  Having this removes a great deal of that pressure of not having spices. After receiving this, I went to the supermart and bought some turmeric, cumin and cardamon (sp?) and I was all set. :)

review/text: I ordered these, as a sour candy addict would, expecting 'gourmet' sour gummies. What I received was a wet globby mess. The coating on the outside of this type of candy is what makes them sour and tasty. These were a mass of soupy, gummy, wet ickiness. I have a feeling that the candy is probably tasty, but mine (all SIX bags) were inedible. So disappointed. Should have asked for a refund, but for some reason I felt like it was my fault for not knowing that they'd get nasty in shipping when it's warm. Thinking back, I now think the company should have known and either not shipped them, or found a way to counteract humidity. :(

review/text: Both the quality of the product and the experience of this sale have warranted my highest rating.<br /><br />I never realized how much lavender 2 lbs really is.  But when it was finally delivered, I was pleasantly surprised.  The lavender was so potent I could smell it through the packaging before it was opened--from several paces off, even.  From what I've seen and used of the product, it contains only trace amounts of leaf (non-flower) matter, which is very nearly perfect, and the color of the flowers is very intense and consistent throught.  I am very pleased with the quality and condition of the product.  This will last me quite a long time.<br /><br />When I ordered, I mistakenly thought that the product was in stock.  However, the seller promptly notified me of the situation and what options were available.  All throughout the process of getting the product delivered to me, they were always prompt in their responses to my inquiries and very thorough in their communication.  Despite the snag in the delayed delivery of the product (which was out of the seller's control), their constant communication and updates made this quite a positive experience.  For this reason alone I would purchase from them again.

review/summary: Pretty tasty, yet subtle.
review/text: I dont know that these Naked coconut waters are the best on the market. I have found that i personally like Vita better, but that doesnt mean these arent bad. Far from it. They go down quite easily actually, and are very refreshing. One thing i have noticed about the Naked brand of coconut waters in general, and this lychee one specifically, is the additional flavor is more of a complementary flavor than a standout one. So, in this beverage, the lychee, while noticeable, is pretty much a 50/50 blend with the coconut water flavor. Very pleasing. I would note also that coconut water can be an acquired taste, especially for people who generally drink sodas and the like, and blends like this can help a person ease their way into drinking straight coconut water. As a final observation, i think the 11.2 ounce portion size is perfect. Just enough to satisfy me personally.<br />I can even forgive that this is a PepsiCo product. Actually, i kind of hope the mega corps see the profitability in producing actual healthy beverages and will start (or continue) to provide these as alternatives to the other C@#p on the market.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I bought this flavor because it was cheaper. I love coconut water because of all of its potassium and naturally hydrating traits. The lychee is a sweet, bland flavor that balances the sometimes bitter tang of green coconuts. This brand is not as sweet as VitaCoco's water and adding lychee did not make Naked's overwhelming by any means. It was less invasive than say, adding pineapple juice. For me, that worked.

review/summary: More aromatic than flavorful
review/text: I had high hopes when I opened the tin and was greeted by the aroma of tea and oil of Bergamot.  The aroma of this tea is just spectacular.  Unfortunately, the taste doesn't live up to the smell.  It's okay, but somewhat bland, and nowhere near the transport of ecstasy promised by the aroma.  From now on I'll stick with the foil-wrapped Bigelow earl gray teabags from my local grocery store, which don't smell as good but which taste much better than this tea.

review/summary: Harney and Sons Earl Grey Supreme
review/text: Earl Grey lovers will certainly enjoy this tea.  The tin keeps the sachets fresh (and it's useful when emptied).  Experiment with brewing times to find your personal preference.  I do not use cream, lemon, or sweentener so I prefer a quick steeping.  A friend gave me my first Harney & Sons tea, and I've become a convert to their brand.  Tropical Green, Wedding, Paris, and everything Earl Grey, all outstanding.

review/summary: Nice packaging, flavorful tea
review/text: I first discovered Harney and Sons tea at a local, trendy gourmet shop.  I have since sampled several of their teas and have found the Earl Grey and the Wedding Tea to be the best.  The packaging is very attractive and when I finish the teas I use the empty tins to house my daughter's growing art supplies.  This particular Earl Grey is flavorful and warming.  One time I did purchase a H&S tin that was labeled "Special Earl Grey with Silver Tips".  That one was the absolute best but this one is a close runner up.

review/text: I found this at a local store and I picked it just because the tin was so pretty even though I did not like earl grey tea.<br /><br />However, this was amazing!<br /><br />If you are not a big fan of earl grey from other companies, try this. You would feel like you are holding a beautiful bouquet of flowers but it does not have strong fragrance. Try this! It is amazing!<br /><br />I have not drunken black tea for a long time and this makes me a tea lover again. This is amazing, seriously.

review/text: I discovered Harney and Sons Earl Grey Tea a few months ago at the Embassy Suites in Frisco, TX.  Earl Grey had always been one of my least favorite teas until then!  The smell and taste was phenomenal!  That very week I ordered 50 sachets from their website.  Since then I've made one other order.  All flavors have been superb. I told a friend of mine whose wife's birthday was coming up about the company; he order tea for her. And she loves it as well.  Great company, great product, and fast shipping.

review/text: The steeping instructions say to leave tea bag in the mug for 5 minutes for best flavor - I say it's more like 20 mins. It smells really great, but there just isn't that much flavor. On the otherhand, from the texture of the water, at least it looks like they don't cheat by coating the tea leaves with oil to enhance the flavor.

review/summary: Heaven in a cup of tea
review/text: I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />While I do prefer loose leaf teas, these tea bags provide nearly the same flavor profile as the loose variety and will not disappoint the Earl Grey enthusiast. If you've never tried Twinings, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!

review/text: If organic truly matters to you the fact that tuna oil is added to this puree is truly offensive. The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.  This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic.  Garbage, complete and total garbage.

review/summary: Product is good, packaging needs improvement
review/text: The packaging is rather painful to open.  They should design these with parents of new babies in mind.  Most food products with peel tops have one corner which is indicated as the side to open and the hard plastic has a crack allowing for the user to easily bend and peel the top.  No such luck with these tubs of baby food from Gerber.  It's not clear which side should be opened by the packaging and whichever one you choose will be equally stubborn before you can finally peel the top and feed your hungry baby.

review/summary: Baby likes it enough to eat it however, I just found out it's plastic #7
review/text: I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.

review/text: I bought this food as an additive to my dog's regular dry dog food.  My dog, who is actually quite large, has shown less and less interest in her dry food.  Now that I mix the two together she can't get enough!  Pedigree Little Champions has made life easier for me and my pet.

review/summary: NO SOY!
review/text: When I started my son on solids at 6 months, he developed a rash all over his torso. It seemed strange that he would be allergic to rice cereal, until I noticed that Gerber puts a soy filler in all of their cereals. I looked everywhere to find a soy-free cereal, and finally found this. My son loves it! Beechnut also has a soy-free rice cereal, but the texture is more gummy and makes my son gag. This has been a life saver. I purchase it (in great quantities) at WalMart.

I buy this from my near by Walmart super center for $2.76 including tax. Why in the world it is so much priced here. Usually in Walmart I find it in limited stock, whenever I go, I stock up two or three packs. Just for the price, I reduced one star.

review/summary: Love these things...
review/text: I will never again buy bagged supermarket pork rinds. I love these things! They are so much better than the bagged version. It took about 2.5 minutes in the microwave for mine to puff up. I bought the smokey BBQ and the cinnamon sugar flavors. A 1 pound bag of the unpuffed skins must be equivalent to at least a dozen store bought bags. The smokey BBQ has a bit of a slight kick, much better than the BBQ red flavoring stuff the put on the bagged supermarket variety.

review/text: I'm not over the top pleased with this product.  The label of BBQ flavor is misleading. (Think as in BBQ potato chips). In my opinion, it is not BBQ flavor nor does it have even a hint of any smokey taste; it is full of red pepper flakes and way too spicy.  Not my cup of tea, but if you like spicy hot, go for it. Are they better than Lawry's microwave skins?  Probably not. Will I buy them again? Probably not. - Overall just average for the price.

review/text: I recently discovered pork rinds and nothing beats fresh ones. These are pretty delicious (maybe a little spicy or too much bite in the aftertaste)<br /><br />But watch it very closely in the microwave. I followed the instructions to a T and they caught on fire. Even after I started paying close attention, there are almost always burn or scorch marks.

review/text: I bought a bag of these for myself, but my low-carbing husband ended up scarfing down the whole bag.  These pork rinds are great - not too spicy but still full of flavor.  They puff up pretty well in the recommended two minutes, but we've found you can pop the incompletely puffed ones back in the microwave (watching carefully against burning, of course) to get just about a 100% yield.  You can cook as little or as much as you want, too.  Hard to beat that!  We'll be buying more... and I'm looking forward to trying some of the other flavors!

review/summary: An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee
review/text: One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like "I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the "Original Donut Blend" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those "special" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

review/summary: Our Top Choice Coffee
review/text: When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant "Perfect, couldn't be better", and five points<br />indicated "Don't like this one".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee.

review/summary: Best Chocolate Flavor by Far
review/text: I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!

review/summary: Espresso
review/text: I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good.

In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious.

review/summary: Need to brew small cup size.  Check the price!
review/text: I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?

review/summary: If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee
review/text: I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to "double brew" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.
