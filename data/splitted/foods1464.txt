review/summary: Tasty for breakfast or any time of day!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that we have two young kids that are very picky eaters.  These even pass their tests and they love them.  There are four biscuits per pack so they can split them and are still happy.  I often forget to eat breakfast and grabbing a pack of these is a great way to have a healthy something that didn't come from a drive thru. The blueberry flavor is also very tasty.  Great for a snack or on the go, a must have for us!

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: These little things are delicious! I didn't expect much. My wife bought them apparently, and they were just sitting on the kitchen table. She must not have told me about them because she figured I'd eat them all. If that's the case, she's probably right. These things definitely exceeded all my expectations, and were good enough for me to immediately come here and right a review. They do seem pretty pricey here though, but I'm not sure what they run in the stores since I didn't buy them personally.

review/summary: Our new Go-to breakfast
review/text: My brother discovered these in Florida, and sent me a few (luckily they are now available locally).  My husband likes apple cinnamon best.  I like blueberry and my son likes cinnamon brown sugar (yes, a 12 year old will eat this!).  They are a great, quick breakfast before school for my son, and my husband keeps a box at work.  They are only 6 points on Weight Watchers for me, so we eat them every day.

review/summary: It's Really a  Cookie!
review/text: These are tasty and I am enjoying one with my morning coffee break while I write this, but reading the nutrition facts and the ingredients list on the package, I have to think that this is more of a tasty and somewhat healthy cookie than a substitute for breakfast. According to the package, a serving is four biscuits which adds up to 230 calories. Though that includes 3 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber, it also includes 13 grams of sugar and 8 grams of fat.<br /><br />They are good, tasting like a nice butter cookie with just a hint of cinnamon and apple. Still, I think I'll be more likely to have one from time to time as a little treat with my morning coffee or after dinner than to substitute a package for breakfast. There I'd more likely chose a low-fat fruit yogurt which would have more than twice the protein, less sugar and fat, and less calories.

review/text: I have had all three Belvita flavors and this is my favorite. I like the blueberry one but compared to the apple it isn't as sweet and the little blueberry pieces seem to stick to my teeth. The Honey Oat didn't have much flavor to me (these are just my personal tastes). The apple cinnamon is downright addictive! This flavor is always running out at my store so I tried ordering them online. They do break somewhat during shipping but not into crumbs, they stay in pieces. It's not a huge problem for me because I break a piece off to eat them anyway. Overall I'd prefer buying them at the store but this works when they're all out.

review/summary: Sounds like Velveeta, tastes like fake apple
review/text: I got a free sample of Apple Cinnamon Belvita from my gym a few months ago but had been avoiding it because I like my weekday breakfast to be less carb-heavy. Plus, the name of this product sounds suspiciously similar to a certain processed cheese substance (didn't anyone catch that in product testing?). At any rate, I was in a pinch this morning so I grabbed my Belvita and ran out the door.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me as I took a bite was the fake-o apple "natural flavor" this thing is infused with. It falls closer to Jolly Rancher than Jonathan on the apple spectrum. Additionally, it's a little sweet for my tastes. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture. I expected something too hard or overly grainy, but it actually is more reminiscent of a Biscoff cookie than anything else. And like Biscoff, it made a decent accompaniment to a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Because of the fake-o flavor, I didn't expect this to have any actual fruit in it, but little bits of dried apple kept getting stuck in my molars. Surprise. These are more of an annoyance than an asset, though, since I spent about 10 minutes trying to discreetly pick them out of my teeth with my tongue.<br /><br />Others seem to enjoy Belvita, but it's not really my thing. I have a sample of the blueberry-flavored one I'm going to try as well, but I can't see myself consistently purchasing it.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: We've used the other Sqwincher products for years at our company and so already liked the product. Returning today from working on the roof I opened our office refrigerator freezer and was surprised to see a stack of these already frozen and ready to try. Excellent - especially after being in the hot sun on a glaring roof. These truly are good. Three ounces is 90mL and each one is 45 calories of minimally food-colored mouth re-watering pleasure. I had the Mixed Berry flavor and I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Mom's Review
review/text: I bought these for my disabled daughter. She has trouble keeping food and liquids down and I was buying gatorade and powerade for her. My son is a construction worker and in this extremely hot summer his construction job started handing these out to prevent heat exhaustion and heat stroke. He brought one home to his sister and it did more to improve how she felt than all of the gatorade and powerade. It contains potassium and other electrolytes that the aforementioned products do not have. And they taste a whole lot better according to her. I started looking for a place to get them and found them at Amazon. Thank God for Amazon. I now purchase them in boxes of 150 and she benefits from them greatly. She tries to get 3 a day in and can tell a great difference if she doesn't get them all in.

review/summary: Ice Pop a Buzz!
review/text: Maybe they should call these "Ice-Pop-a-Buzz"!  Wow!  After receiving these via Amazon, I place a few of the selected flavors in the good ole' freezer.  Honestly, I didn't expect much.  Being an ole' southern boy, I figured another popcycle that would do nothing more than cool me down.  Hmmmmm....cool me down...gotta' have that in these dog hot "July days".  So, I tried one the next day.  Wowzers!  You, the reader, may not believe this but not only did it "cool" the engine, but geeze whiz "gosh-all-mighty" I felt a buzz!!  Now, I am not sure how to explain that but it was actually a high feeling!  Call it the sugar of 11 grams, or maybe the electrolytes just grabbed me.  Whatever it was I felt a freaking "buzz"!!  And, it stayed with me not just a moment or two, but for a good little bit!  Energized to say the least this ole' southern Coach was!!<br /><br />So, I thought maybe it was just me.  Well, later in the day, my son had one.  Folks, I didn't say anything, and about 5 minutes after he finished, he said hydrated and "ready to go"...in other words, he felt the immediate BOOM "pop-a-buzz" feeling as well!<br /><br />Wow, I know all the above sounds crazy.  Yet, never before with any of the other "cheap" type pops have I felt such a sensation.  And, with every single one I eat...same thing!  Errrrr....thanks Sqwincher for getting me addicted!!!<br /><br />As for the box, I should mention, it arrives in several flavors<br />1) Cheery<br />2) Lemon Lime<br />3) Mixed Berry<br />4) Orange<br />5) Grape<br /><br />I can only imagine, being a Coach myself, how these things may very well "take off" in athletics.  I already have plans to serve during halftime just like the good ole' sports drink we have all seen :)<br /><br />Bottom line is you very well are going to love these pops...<br /><br />For me, well, just call me crazy for the Ice-Pop-a-Buzz!!!  I am hooked!

review/summary: A joke as an electrolyte replacement or for hydration
review/text: These look fine as freezer pops and I have never tried this product, but I looked at the nutrition information on the Sqwincher website which indicates they contain, per pop:<br /><br />3oz water<br />1% sodium (does not say how many mg)<br />15mg potassium<br />does not show other electrolyte levels<br /><br />By way of comparison, I have a tube of nuun on my desk.  When dissolved into 16oz of water (the recommended concentration), one tablet of nuun provides:<br /><br />16oz water<br />14% sodium (345mg)<br />6% magnesium (25mg)<br />2% potassium (97g)<br /><br />If it's important to be hydrated and replenish electrolytes, this looks like a terrible product.  I'm giving this a 1 star review because if someone is engaging in a strenuous activity where you care about replenishing hydration and electrolytes, you need something that actually accomplishes that and this product claims to without actually doing it.  I'd recommend gatorade, nuun, or even just a glass of tap water because the electrolyte levels in these pops isn't high enough to really distinguish itself from water.

review/summary: such a special gem, this one!
review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

review/text: Why didnt I find these foods sooner????<br />My son is 18m and we are heading out of the country on vacation. I needed something easy to pack especially with the new 50 pound suitcase guidelines. I bought 4 diff flavors and distributed a small amount to each family member to carry for us in their suitcases. And it will be easy to carry in my backpack, all I will need is a spoon. And we tested them out and he loves the taste!

review/text: I am a candy bar addict and a sugar junkie, and when I head to the candy bar isle at the local Quicky-Mart I always pick up a 5th Avenue.<br /><br />5th Avenue is a wondeful blend of chocolate, peanut butter and crunch that will leave you hungry for more. 5th Avenue is unlike any other cany bar on the market, and if you've never tried one...do yourself a big favor. You won't regret it! Yum!<br /><br />Some history on the candy bar from Hershey's:<br /><br />William H. Luden (1859-1949) launched his fledgling candy business in 1879 and offered an extensive line, including cough drops, hard and soft candies, chocolates and marshmallow products. Unlike many confectioners during that time, Luden manufactured his own chocolate for his chocolate novelties and chocolate-coated candies. In 1936, he introduced the 5TH AVENUE candy bar, a milk chocolate bar with a crunchy peanut butter center.<br /><br />World War II forced Luden's to concentrate production efforts on Luden's menthol throat drops and 5TH AVENUE candy bars for military use. Immediately following the war, Luden's reverted to producing a full line of confectionery products including the famous Luden's menthol throat drops and 5TH AVENUE candy bar, as well as penny candy consisting of ladyfingers, pillowcases, mint patties, penny jujube novelties, penny hard candy, penny coconut novelties, cast marshmallow novelties, and a line of penny sugar-rolled jellies.<br /><br />Timeline<br /><br />1859  William H. Luden, founder, born.<br />1879  W. H. Luden Candy Company established.<br />1928  Acquired by Food Industries of Philadelphia, a holding company owned by the Dietrich family.<br />1936  5TH AVENUE candy bar introduced.<br />1980  Queen Anne Candy Company, Hammond, IN, acquired by Luden's Inc.<br />1986  Acquired by Hershey Foods Corporation.

review/text: Hershey's 5th Avenue is one of the best candy bars I have ever had the pleasure of ingesting...<br /><br />It's a perfect blend of chocolate, with crunchy peanut that reminds me slightly of a Chick-O-Stick, and also reminiscent of a Reesesticks...<br /><br />I hadn't had one in a long time, and a co-worker had shown me a box of these, and sold me a box of 36 bars for $4.00 at my work!

review/summary: "Comfort" drink - economy size!
review/text: This 2-pack is an economical way to purchase this British import.  Horlicks was a "staple" in our house back home - one of those "comfort" drinks for cold winter nights.  I haven't found too many places to purchase it here in California and when I do find it, it's not inexpensive.  I haven't found an American equivalent - similar, but not close enough.  So, for me, this is the best way to buy my old favorite.  The product arrived well packaged in a timely manor.  I will continue to puchase Horlicks this way.

review/summary: Price is comparable to Asian imports but has packaging flaws
review/text: This two-pack package totals 1600 grams, which is equivalent to more than 4.5 jars of (350 grams) Horlicks imported from some  licensed Asian manufacturers.  So in terms of price, this UK original import is comparable to the Asian import.  There is a small difference in the ratio of the ingredients, and my picky son can tell the difference (he preferred the taste of the UK version in a "blind-test").<br /><br />When I opened the package, I was alarmed to find some sprinkles of Horlicks power on the surface of the bottle.  I removed the shrink wrap of the bottle, and then opened the plastic cap.  To my surprise, the tin seal inside the plastic cap was broken.  Because the outside shrink wrap of the bottle that covers the cap was intact, so the power leak is not the result of a tampering act but a malfunction of the packaging process.  I will update my comments if the second bottle has the same problem.

review/text: I bought the lite version during my last trip to London, at one of their local supermarkets. When I ran out, I came here to Amazon looking for the replacement. In the absence of the Lite version, I got this one. The price is very good compared to what I paid in London. The taste is as good, but I noticed it requires more of the powder to achieve the flavor I want. But I'm not complaining. At this price I was able to buy 2 large ones. So, I'm happy. Now, if only they had the lite one I'd order it, because I feel quite guilty having this hi-calorie drink right before going to sleep. Aside from that, it is quite a treat to have. Certainly a comfort drink before going to sleep.

Yes, my dogs are big agressive chewers but I was thinking the toy would last a little longer.  The strips are kind of thin so they are finished with it in about 10 minutes.

review/summary: A Pricey, But Favorite Treat
review/text: My dog gets pesky and there's nobody else to entertain him. When I went into the local pet store and asked for a busy box for my 100# lab mix, they sold me the Bouncy Bone. It took my dog less than 10 minutes to figure out that he could just grab the ring with his canines, while pinning the ball to the ground with his paws on the nylon bone on either side, and just using brute force to pull the ring until it snaps off. Gone in less than a minute. He's not interested in chewing on the nylon ends, and he could care less about that large heavy ball. Can't say I blame him.<br /><br />I started cutting thick chews in half and drilling a hole through the center, larger than the core of the toy. Sandwiching the gnawhide ring between the pieces slowed him down considerably, since he had to chew through a substantial amount of rawhide to get to the gnawhide.<br /><br />My next investment was the Bristle Bone (uses the same rings). If you haven't completed your toy purchase, get this one. It cleans their teeth, massages their gums, and conceals everything but the edge of the ring. Within 5 minutes he had cracked the middle piece that houses the bristles with his powerful jaws. The toy is still usable, although it does lose bristles. However, it only slowed him down by a few minutes.<br /><br />Now I cut 3/8" off the outside of the rings, and cut that into smaller pieces to hide between the bristles on the other side, and use as special mini-treats. (I'm too cheap to use more than one ring at a time.) By doing this I am assured of at least 30 minutes to two hours. He's also pretty worn out from all the licking and biting.

review/text: China recently refused to let the FDA inspect pet treat manufacturing facilities.  [...]<br /><br />There is no inspection, legal system, or quality control to make sure you do not give your pet toxic rawhide if the rawhide is made in China.  There are other treats on Amazon that are American or European made--buy those.<br /><br />I threw out the rawhide rounds and cut pieces of US-made, no toxic chemicals rawhide into rounds to slide on this.  I put edible toothpaste (liver flavor--yum! yum!)on the bristles.  It is keeping my dogs' teeth much, much cleaner.  Great product, but dangerous to give your dog rawhide from China.  Over 6000 pets have died just from jerky treats alone.

Somehow they would eat the jerky completely without touching the cornstarch.<br /><br />Its a good toy and treat to keep them busy and out of trouble.  The treats a fairly cheap as well as the toy.

review/summary: Fun, engaging toy
review/text: This toy keeps my 7 month old husky/german shepherd mix fully engaged for about 20 minutes. We have to prevent her from running, jumping and playing while she recovers from a soft-tissue injury. It's very hard to keep this highly energetic and curious puppy from running around the living room out of frustration and boredom while she heals. The Busy Buddy Bouncy Ball really holds her attention and seems to burn up some of her excess mental and physical energy. She seems calmer afterwards. I can shower, get the laundry and do other chores out of her sight as long as she has her Buddy to play with. The rings are a little pricey, so I don't know if we'll continue to use it after she has healed. But for the next 3 weeks, we are devoted to this toy. I'm going to order a bunch of refill packs right now, so we don't run out! (Caution: 4 rings in 1 night seem to cause loose stools.)

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite Treat
review/text: We picked up the first Busy Buddy Bone at a Greyhound meet'n-greet in Philadelphia, although our boy is a Beardie. It became his favorite immediately. By itself, it's just a good little chew toy, but the edible "Gnawhide" rings make it "new" each time. Beardies need a lot of grooming; daily in fact. This is his reward for enduring his nightly torture.

review/summary: Best Chew Toy I've found
review/text: I don't write reviews very often -- only if I'm either very thrilled with a product or very disappointed.  In this case, I'm thrilled! :)  We just got two German Shepherd puppies -- and have tried numerous chewtoys, Kongs, etc -- but the Busy Buddy is the favorite!  I found that the pups like the rough rawhide rings better than the smooth ones... but they just chew the rough ones first & then go for the smooth.  This bone keeps them occupied for quite a while -- and they'll keep gnawing at it to get the last little bit of the ring off.  I found it lasts longer if you screw the toy together tightly -- that makes it more challenging for them to get the rawhide off.  Great toy!

review/summary: MY BIG OLE DOGGIE
review/text: I purchased the Busy Buddy Bone over a year ago for my hound dog (puppy at the time). I've purchased the inserts more than once because of her teething and it's a lot less expensive than buying rawhide bones every day.  It seems to calm her.  She is now over 60 lbs and when it's time for her to sleep she always has her bone with her.  I like the product, but I can't find it anywhere but on line in the area I live.

review/summary: Dog-gone It, It's Worth It!
review/text: My dog is the brainiac type.  No stuffed animals or balls for him.  He'd rather take apart a plastic bottle or a remote control.  I knew I'd have a hit on this toy and I sure do!  He's built up his speed to get the rawhide rings off the spools, but he's still interested in it and can't wait until I reload it.  Just be sure to remember which size toy you purchase...I accidently bought the wrong size replacement rings.  Luckily, they work at all sizes, but the treat after all the effort on his part is not the same.  Better than a Kong, which I'll probably be donating to the shelter dogs who would settle for less.

review/summary: A Horse Is a Horse Is a Snack, Of Course
review/text: My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots. In other words -- nearly impossible.<br /><br />But lord help me, I try.<br /><br />I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted crap.<br /><br />(Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure.<br /><br />The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!)<br /><br />I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.)<br /><br />And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag.<br /><br />So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting. That's a winner.

review/summary: Child Friendly Gluten Free Bread!!!!!!!
review/text: We stopped into this cute bakery on a recent trip to San Antonio where it is located.  We bought a loaf of their gluten free white bread for our 8 year old recently diagnosed with Celiacs Disease.  He loves this bread!  When I made him a grilled cheese he said it "tastes just like a real grilled cheese!"  It has a great taste and NO BITTER AFTERTASTE as is commonly the case with other gluten free breads we've tried.  Unfortunately, it is much more expensive(about $2.50 more when buying a single loaf)than the Udi's Gluten Free White Bread we usually buy at our local grocer BUT, in its defense, the loaf is much bigger than an Udi's Gluten Free White Bread loaf (my son calls Udi's toy food sized bread).  A slice of this Little Aussie Bakery White Bread is the closest in size to a regular slice of bread that we have found since he got sick.  I wish we lived in San Antonio because I would love to be able to buy him this bread exclusively but with the expensive price per loaf and expensive shipping ($9.99 for 1 loaf) we just can't afford it:(

review/text: First of all, the puree was fabulous, and it was wonderful to be able to find something like this which is very difficult to find even in the specialty grocery stores. That was amazing.<br /><br />However, that being said, it took forever to get the product. It was shipped by way of the moon and came into Illinois and then left Illinois (where it was supposed to be delivered). It even changed shipping carriers. It was (finally) supposed to be delivered by UPS and on their web site it showed one failed attempt. The problem was that people were home, no one tried to ring the door bell, no note on the door, nothing. Called the post office, they said they would try to re-deliver it the following day. Ok. Stayed home the next day. Nothing. No note, no one ringing the door bell, nothing. Looked on line and the UPS site said 2nd attempted delivery. Called the post office again, complained, they said they were sending the package back because no one was home to sign for it. They finally agreed to a third attempt, and I stayed home from work for a third day (ugh!). Still no one bothered to ring the door bell - they just left the package on the door step.<br /><br />What a nightmare.

review/summary: Great JBM with perfect roast
review/text: This Jamaican Blue Mountain is high quality, fairly fresh, and roasted perfectly. It has the characteristic smooth taste and acidity of JBM. It is a true "evening" coffee. A nice touch was that it is delivered in a vacuum seal bag with a heavy duty zip-lock on it, so it seals tight - just make sure you roll the air out of it when sealing it shut. I call it "fairly fresh" because, although the description says "roasted fresh immediately prior to packaging," I would question if they sit in the Amazon warehouse a long time due to the dryness of the beans we recieved. Keep in mind it is normal for lighter roast beans to be dry, but these were a tad extra dry. It is a good quality coffee though, and it gave us an experience that was close to when I roasted fresh.

review/text: I purchased this coffee to see what the hype was about.  I was expecting to be blown away; however, I was not.  This was a classic case of too high expectations.  This particular Blue Mountain coffee is a great tasting medium bodied coffee with very low acidity, which I appreciated more and more over the life of the bag.  Once I returned to drinking various less expensive coffee from various parts of the world did I realize how good the Blue Mountain was.  I constantly thought "something is missing" from subsequent coffees.  The bottom line:  I would purchase again - budget permitting.

review/summary: Very disappointed !!!
review/text: I can not wait to try this so called 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee.  It costs more than other Blue Mountains Coffee - over 50 per pound.  I can find cheaper price by other sellers in Amazon.  I thought it more expensive more tasty...  I am wrong.  The coffee bean is not fresh as what the seller described.  From the paper of the Package , you can tell it has been sit in storage for a while.  .. It is over price and tasted only little better than " regular "  non Blue Mountains coffee.  I purchased it based on the review from other two customers.  They gave it very high review.  Just want to post my opinion - to let other buyer know.  It is not worthy to pay that much money for it.  The true is .. you did paid more than other Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee.. but be careful .. it does not taste better than others.  Very disappointed !!!!  Over priced !!!!!  Don't buy it.

review/summary: Doesn't Work
review/text: We purchased one of these at Justice for Girls store.  The stamp is tiny, impossible to read, and hard to use. We could barely get one letter - certainly not a word or sentence.  My 9 year old tried it for 5 minutes and then just gave up.  In effect, we paid a lot for some gun and threw away the plastic case.  What a waste.

review/summary: Picky diabetic cat loves it
review/text: Our 10 year old diabetic cat Moo LOVES this food and is thriving on it. Blood sugar is much better, her coat and skin are beautiful and she's acting like a kitten again - racing through the house, chasing her mice, curious and playful<br /><br />It's expensive, but worth every nickel.  I don't know how much longer we'll have her, but this Blue Buffalo cat food is making however long it is a joy for all of us.

review/summary: Much easier to use than whole leaves
review/text: I didn't even know there was GROUND bay leaves and from now on I will definitely use this product as it is much easier to add to recipes and I don't have to fish out any leaves when my food is done cooking. I primarily add bay leaves to soups and stews and a special gumbo recipe I make. I love this version of bay leaves!

review/summary: convenient but...
review/text: It's very convenient to use.  You can put a teaspoon or two in everything including meatloaf and casseroles, and it adds a great flavor.  However, because it is in powder form, the flavor is not as bold as leaves.  It can also give your dish olive green color.  I wouldn't recommend this for stock or soup.

review/summary: I should have thought of ground bay leaves sooner!
review/text: I've used bay leaves in stews, roasts and soups for decades, and always had to fish in the pot for them before serving, or warn my family to look for them in their bowls.  I love the flavor that bay leaves gives savory dishes, but it never occurred to me that I could find them ground into powder.  Luckily I found this item for sale on Amazon when I was looking for Cajun Spice.  I got it with free SuperSaver shipping since I ordered over $25.<br /><br />I used these ground bay leaves in a stew over the weekend, and I'm in love!  No more crunchy leaves hiding in the vegetables! I would have normally used 2-3 dried bay leaves, so I added about 1/2 teaspoon of the ground leaves and it was just right.<br /><br />This bottle from McCormick Spice company is 14 ounces, which will last me for years.  It smells fresh and has a nice shaker lid, and I plan to use it from now on.

review/summary: Moderately priced, will last a long time
review/text: Ground bay is great for recipes like my turkey meatloaf and sauces, soups and stews from which you do not want to have to fish out the leaves just before serving.  Inasmuch as I live in a culinary hinterland, it is impossible to find.  My last purchase of ground bay over the internet ended up being flaked rather than ground. Good old McCormick's, however, is definitely ground.  It comes in a size apparently intended for restaurants, so this product will be in your pantry for a long time.  It never gets old on your shelf.
