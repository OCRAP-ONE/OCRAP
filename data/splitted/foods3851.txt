review/summary: A great rice at a great price
review/text: This is very tasty and aromatic rice, similar to jasmine rice, buy it doesn't raise your blood sugar as much as most other white rice varieties.  This is a good buy too, the containers, about the size of large coffee cans, are compact and very useful for other things when the rice is gone.<br /><br />I have used this rice in curry dishes, rice pudding, various pilafs, Asian dishes and even in burritos; all tasted excellent.  I drop it in my rice cooker and it comes out perfect.<br /><br />Very versatile and more interesting than plain white rice.

review/summary: Wonderful Customer Service
review/text: I ordered a"Broadway Basketeers Chocolate Heaven Gift Basket" for my sister for her birthday.  It product arrived in Florida in and I'm told it was beautiful and apparently very tasty except that the truffles had melted at some point during the delivery process.  I left a 'fair' review for them.<br /><br />In a little while I was contacted by the company asking if they could resolve my problem for me.  In the end they are sending a new batch of truffles.  They were very courteous and speedy at coming to a resolution and I am very happy with the results!

review/text: Unfortunately, basically everything in this box was horrible.  The yogurt pretzels were stale, the caramels tasted like chalk, and the popcorn was pretty bad too.

review/text: Like many other people here, I bought this based on a lightning deal on the site.  Even at a sale price, this wasn't worth it!  I was hoping this would be a dessert for 4-5 people, but it is barely a snack for 2 people.<br /><br />There is a lot of cardboard and air in this "gift tower".  The portions are small, and packaged like in-flight snacks.  The few pieces there were tasty, but it was mostly a let-down.<br /><br />Based on this, I'll just stick to regular "non-gift" samplers from now on.

review/text: I bought two of these gift towers because the product description says that they're certified Kosher.  If this is something that's important to you, you look for the certifying symbol on the product.  Two of the five products enclosed in the package, however, did not have the certifying symbol, meaning they are not -- for all practical purposes (like gift-giving)-- "certified kosher."

I was really disappointed once it was opened to find a very small amount of candy and chocolate inside of the boxes and most of the space is taken up by filler and I didn't receive the chocolates pictured in the photo.  I would not buy again or as a signle small gift to give to someone, presentation looks great but very disappointing on whats really inside.  The quality of the candy is good but it's very over priced for what it really is.

review/text: I saw the tower on line and it looked like a great deal. I have been sending Harry an David gift boxes as Christmas gifts for years and this seemed like a great value just from looks. I had a bad address and consequently had one delivered to my house and discovered that I had sent out three Barbie sized boxes of candy to all of my friends. It is true that the buyer should beware but deception only works once with me and I will never place an order with this company, Broadway Basketeers.

review/text: The Chocolate Towers arrived in plenty of time for the holidays & were very well packaged.<br />I thought the towers were slightly smaller than the picture portrayed but, since they were given to friends as a small Christmas token, they were fine.  The recipients expressed their delight & advised the chocolate was very good.  I'm not sure they would have advised if they weren't.  I should've ordered one for myself so I would've been able to judge for myself.  Will definitely consider doing that next year.

They were told my items were a hift but that did not stop them from sending it as if it were just some half assed shipment to a warehouse. I am disgusted, I feel cheated and I am embarrassed that my family thinks I went the cheap route again. Fact is, I purchased three separate arrangements to have delivered and they barely looked as if they could feed one person. I am horrified that Amazon allows these people to sell on their site.

review/text: While this gift tower assortment does include some nice treats and is pretty, it is very very small. I was shocked at the size and how much such a small assortment cost.  While you might not be able to replicate the looks, you could buy the ingredients for less than $5. Not worth the price, in my opinion.

The chocolate itself is smooth, rich, and does not have a waxy texture as do many I have tried before.  Do yourself a favor and buy these at least once. : )

review/text: The chocolate layer is luscious.  Soft, medium dark (definitely not blah milk choc, anyway), possibly a hint of coffee -- very delicate, VERY nice!  What REALLY pleases me however, is that the almonds are tender, not "roasted" to rock-hardness, as is so often, unfortunately, the case.  We just discovered these and will definitely buy them again.  There are maybe 2 dozen almonds in the box?  We didn't count, but did find that these are so luxurious and rich that one or two is a serving.

I tried this organic extra virgin coconut oil, 16 oz liquid by Good N Natural and was not impressed at all. Then I learned that it is not the best choice for high cholesterol. I love coconut but I cannot taste any hint of coconut at all. Mine arrived somewhat semi-solid--not liquid as I expected. This makes measurements difficult for me--I don't want to have to melt it reduce the semi-solid to the amount of liquid I need for baking. I am not accustomed to cooking/baking with this type of product but I would not purchase it again.

review/text: I have a female German Shepherd Dog that is now 16 mos old.  Since we got her at 11 wks old, she has been on a lot of different dog foods.  She came to me on Iams but after MUCH research and weighing pros and cons, I put her on Orijen.  Some say, the best dog food you can buy and it's expensive.  30 dollars for 18lbs I think I paid and that was the cheapest I have ever seen it.  I have also tried Taste of the Wild with her and she did eat that and I was going to use it, until I found 4Heath at Tractor Supply that is wheat, corn and soy free.  I figured... wow, 35lbs for 30 bux, not bad.  Get twice the food and it's still good food. Most food are Chicken based and but 4Health Puppy was mostly Lamb based and she seemed to like that more.  We got a second dog and he couldn't handle the lamb, so we had to switch and I ended up feeding them both Puppy Chow, the only thing that the new pup could eat w/o tummy issues.<br /><br />Puppy Chow turned into Dog chow and more issues w/ the pups skin came up.  He was an eater, fat and a pig.  My girl on the other had had always been very VERY skinny.  I had to mix her food to get her to eat.  In the right light, you could see ever one of her ribs and her spine and I was worried would turn me in for not feeding her.  She was THAT thin.  I had already nursed too emaciated dogs back to health, I know how to take care of GSD's but she would NOT eat or gain weight.  She dropped down to around 52lbs at like 11 mos old and she's very tall.<br /><br />After some issues with the puppy, trying grain free to help with the new found itch, I tried eliminated diets and what not.  I turned to Purina One Sensitive Systems and fed him that.  It seemed to help but we ended up having to rehome him due to the growing issues between the two dogs.  My female is a better only dog.  Too alpha for her own good.<br /><br />I got her a bag of Purina One Beef and Rice.  She's on her second bag now and you know what.  She's at a weight now that I don't want her to gain any more.  She doesn't need too.  Her coat shines, she's mostly black and it's very soft and glossy.  Her ear issues cleared up too.  She didn't have an infection, but they didn't look right and were a little junky.  Now that's all gone and her ears look good.  She'll eat the dog food plain, but I still mix some stuff in from time to time.  She loves the beef, and it's been really good for her.  Her stools are smaller and she goes twice a day, almost always.  Morning and night.  No vomiting, no gas, no itch.  Nothing.<br /><br />After a year of trying food, spending money, switching and hours, HOURS reading and standing in the pet stores looking and comparing, I found this food.  She will be on it until she is no longer with us.  I would venture to say that she's upward of 65lbs now, right were she should be.<br /><br />I love this food.  I'm only sorry that I didn't try it sooner and save us all a lot of time and money.  Not every store carries it, but the Orijin I had her on, only one feed store around here carried it.  It's not that hard to find. I don't care if it contains corn, obviously, it's doing her well.  That's all I can ask for.<br /><br />My sister has had her almost 14 year old GSD on Puppy/dog and Senior Chow her whole life.  Purina is doing something right!

review/summary: Formula change in July 2009 is a nightmare
review/text: When I adopted my rescue lab/chow mix, Sammie, the shelter said she was eating Purina One Lamb and Rice. So that is what I kept feeding her without knowing what I know now that I have read this site. But it seemed ok - she had really hard poops sometimes but otherwise seemed great and her coat was soft and shiny, enough so that people commented on it. THEN after the formula change this year, the itching started and the poops became worse (hard more often.) She developed red spots in her ears and a yeast infection in each one.  Then her fur got rough, dusty looking and then started shedding more than anything I'd seen in the 2 years I had her. It seemed like she lost 1/2 her fur! The vets told me this was not likely the new food formula of her same food...well after hundreds of dollars of vet bills and a miserable summer for her all itchy all of the time, I decided to change her food. I picked Halo after talking to a friend who is in to nutrition (people and dogs.) I changed her over slowly - about 9 days. The itching and fur remained a problem...until the day she was only on Halo. Poof! No more itching - that very day no more itching. After a month her fur was shiny and soft but sparce (I'd added Halo's Dreamcoat supplement too.) After 2 months her fur is shinier, softer and more full and lush than ever. Her poops are regular like clockwork and soft - like they never were on Purina One. And she *loves* the food! (I do a mix of canned and kibble.) She has a passion for that food she never had for Purina One - even before the formula change. I wish I'd listened to my instincts and switched the food after the first symptoms! Whatever Purina did to that food is a nightmare.  Read about in on line - you'll see many people have had very bad results since the formula change last summer.

review/summary: my dog loves it
review/text: My cairn terrier was eating the regular Purina One for almost a year.  He had gotten very tired of it.  He loves the darker, soft bites in this, and will pick them out and eat them, and then go back later to finish it off.  He eats all of his food every day now.  I like that he gets the "yummy tasties" but then also the harder food to help his teeth stay cleaner. The price is better than at the stores, and with Prime shipping, is a great savings and getting the pack of 6 at a time saves trips to the store - always.  Puppy says, "woof" which translates that he agrees.

review/text: This food has been so great for my two large 100lb pit bulls! they have very sensitive stomachs, and even the natural organic food upset their stomachs to where they would have constant loose stools. This food produces small and compact stools, very easy to clean up and they seem happier and healthier. Thank you purina one sensitive systems! I just wish they made bags bigger than 40lbs.

review/text: Our dog, who has a bit of a sensitive stomach eats this stuff, seems to love it, and has no stomach problems when we keep him eating this one brand. We get this product through Amazon subscribe and save, which has excellent pricing and is hugely convenient once you get your delivery schedule timed up with the rate at which you use the dog food. Just as we're down to our last bag, a new case shows up. Couldn't be easier. Not trips to Petco, and no lugging big bags of dogfood around.

review/text: My 5 year old Japanese Chin (12pounds) is a very picky eater with GERD. She prefers not to eat most days. I have tried many dog foods and this one she eats ALWAYS. She picks out the dark pieces and goes back after to finish the rest. She tends to be a gasy dog and I haven't noticed it get better or worse on this food. The biggest plus is that it has protein as the first ingredient and not a by-product.

review/text: This is a HUGE and wonderful tasting roast. I't comes in a reusable foam container with dry ice and has a neat burlap bag around the roast. They have sealed it in a cooking bag with all its juices so it can be placed right into the oven easily. You have to make sure to carve it across the grain so the pork will melt in your mouth, and believe me it does. also it will feed a gob of hungry people. This is a real people pleaser that you must try. With the holidays just round the corner I plan to place my gift orders early because they have been known to run out they are so good. And don't forget their hams and other products that are fantastic :)

Once you open the packs, you must find a way to keep them fresh. I put them in an empty metal container that has a tight lid. I would never buy this brand again.

review/summary: A Visit to the Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado. The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags. The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored. Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas. He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us. We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room. The smell of peppermint was overpowering. It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint. What a rush! The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry. For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea. Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder. The events of that day have changed my life forever. Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet. I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer. On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour. Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/text: I was looking for pure flour, no bromate, no GMOs, no additives or bleaching, and this product delivered.  One reviewer mentioned there was no ingredient list...there IS an ingredient list, and it contains the one ingredient in this flour: organic white winter wheat flour.  Nothing more.  I use it to make the best sandwich bread in the world, the kind on can't buy in grocery stores.  I use it in place of flour in all of my cooking and I have no complaints.  I'd have to say I like this flour best for what's MISSING, and that's a whole lot of chemicals we don't need.  It's the perfect flour!

review/summary: Not bad for a plant that traveled across the distance
review/text: -- Update --<br />Sadly, though, two of the stalks did not recover, so I had to remove them. I am still hoping though, so I transferred them to a different container and cut out all the dead parts. We'll see how it works.<br /><br />The one stalk did recover, but most of its leaves are limp and dying so I had to remove them. So right now, it's more of a stick with a little stump of a leaf bud, but I have not seen any signs of degradation to its health. I read that it takes longer for these plants to leaf up so I'm just going to watch closely. As of now, I can say it's recovering.<br />------------------<br /><br />Shipment came pretty quick. The plant was stuffed in a bunch of packing peanuts, with the roots soaked in plant gel (to keep the plant hydrated).<br /><br />I have to admit the plant looked a bit sad coming from the box, but considering it traveled from west to midwest, it's expected. It didn't look like it's dying, though, just a bit limp, the roots look healthy so I'm pretty sure it'd bounce back in a week or so.<br /><br />The vase it came with though was a bit too tiny for my taste. But I can just get a bigger one when my bamboo grows (pretty sure the bamboo will topple the vase over when it starts growing top heavy.

review/summary: An exquisite cookie!
review/text: Mother's Cookies have been around forever here on the west coast.  I didn't even know they were gone for awhile (due to financial problems I understand).  I am glad Kellogg's bought the company and brought them back.  I recently tried the Vanilla Creme cookie not knowing what to expect.  I was used to the Circus Animals and their delicious chocolate chip cookie over the years since I was a child.  Their Vanilla Creme cookie is just out of this world and makes me glad I have a mouth!  That's how good they are.  It is an exquisite cookie.  No coffee or tea should be served to company without these.  Your friends will wonder what they are and where they come from!<br /><br />In addition to being a great tasting cookie I love the design and texture of the cookie.  I feel really regal when I eat them.  I introduced these to the whole family and I got everyone eating them.  The local supermarket had a sale on them at two dollars a package and I ended up buying seven of them.<br /><br />If you like the taste of vanilla and are looking for a good cookie to try or just plain like cookies, you won't be disappointed with these!<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted to write a review for Mother's English Tea cookie but apparently Amazon has all the reviews linked to all Mother's cookies products and will only accept one review.<br /><br />I wanted to write that that English Tea cookie by Mother's is just as good as the Vanilla Cremes.  I am not sure but I thought I detected a slight banana flavor but very subtle.  They certainly don't taste like vanilla but they are a really good cookie.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s Mother's Cookies used to put out a variety pack and that's how I discovered their delicious chocolate chip cookie.  It has a chocolate chip taste so different than any other chocolate chip cookie I've eaten.<br /><br />I understand Mother's cookies are hard to find for much of the country except on the west coast.  The fact that Amazon sells them is a good thing.  So if you're wondering if you should give them a try, please believe me, they're all high quality cookies and taste great regardless if they become a favorite or not.  I am very fussy when it comes to food but Mother's cookies are so delicious that I am working my way to try every cookie they offer.  Vanilla Creme is by far my favorite.  As a side note, if your cookies should arrive crumbled or broken, it's the responsibility of the buyer to contact Amazon and complain.  Amazon has friendly customer service and will correct the problem if you complain.

review/summary: Can't get enough of this!!!
review/text: I do not usually eat sweets, as I find most American made desserts too sweet for me. However, these cookies are just so delicious that I cannot put them down! I love how the frosting is not just sugar, but also has a butter cream vanilla taste. It tastes like cake. The sprinkles add just the right amount of crunchiness before you bite into the entire cookie. As you chew, the cookie turns into a mouth watering sweet buttery cake dough. This is why I need to watch myself and count the cookies as I eat, to prevent over eating! Though they all taste the same, I am personally more attracted to the pink ones =) So glad I can get these cookies at Wal-mart!<br />I do not recommend buying this online, just because when it gets hot, the cookies tend to stick together. It is annoying having a double-cookie because they will not separate without breaking. Also, always store in a cookie place! Enjoy your cookies =) Thanks for reading!

review/summary: Mother's Sack-of-Fat Cookies [Caveat Emptor]
review/text: The English Tea and Peanut Butter Gaucho cookies, by Mother's, are probably the best tasting sandwich cookies I've ever eaten. However, this nirvana of the cookie munching experience, comes at a pretty hefty price. As I was gleefully polishing off the first bag, I happened to glance at the nutritional stats on the back. To my astonishment and horror, I found that just two cookies delivered 2.5 grams of saturated fat, 2 grams of trans fat, and a whopping 180 calories! For this reason, I removed one rating star and won't be purchasing these again, until this problem is resolved. C'mon Kelloggs, get yer 'stuff' in one bag and cut the trans fat! Sure, the saturated fat content is rather high, but the trans fat is not only unacceptable, it is entirely unnecessary. These cookies could easily be baked with lighter oils like canola, sunflower, or safflower. If you truly must, buy these cookies at your own risk, or better still, fear for your poor arteries and beg-off! [English Tea - 5, Peanut Butter Gauchos - 5, Iced Lemonade - 4, Iced Oatmeal - 3]

review/text: My Mom & I were itchin for a late-nite snack while on vacation out west with the rest of the family; we wandered accross the street from our motel & entered a grocery store. We tried these cookies & thought they were delicious -- small, bite-size tasty cookies w/o too many chips like Chips A;Hoy, etc. When we got back to Cleveland, Ohio, I tried to find them at our local drug stores. Eventually, I found out they are not available east of the Mississippi. ...Really obsessing over a chocolate chip cookie, I found them on a site called 'foodlocker.com'. But after Katrina, they were put out of order (that's unfortunate). One day a few years later, I thought I'd search Amazon, & my cookie-journey had a happy ending. I just wish Mom was still with us to enjoy.

They are very slightly larger and flatter, and the chocolate chips have a smoother, less chalky texture and better flavor.  The cookies are also slightly less brittle than they used to be, giving them a better bite and leading to less loose crumbs.

review/summary: Nice to get them in an area where it's hard to find them
review/text: I don't buy many pre-packaged cookies, but remember really liking these when I lived in Texas.  I decided to get some to have around, and am glad I did. I was a bit concerned about the shape they'd be in since they're cello-wrapped, but they got here in good shape.  I haven't opened each package- LOL, but by 'feel', they seem fine.

review/summary: Brings my childhood back.
review/text: I love the taffy cookies and so does all my family, these were always our summer time cookies. I have missed this so much and around where I live I can't find them in stores so I am thrilled that amazon sells these. They arrived in great condition and were well packaged. And I love getting four packs at once because then I don't have to order as often. Although our first order went pretty fast since we haven't had them in so many years. My mom doesn't order groceries from amazon so I did it for her and she was so happy I did. We love taking this on our boat and hitting the lake. Thank you amazon!

review/summary: Best cookies I've ever had.
review/text: I was given 1 of these cookies from a friend. I savored every bite. After I finished it, I was offered another and I immediately said "YES PLEASE" and I was told I had to buy them on amazon or select states. I ordered the 4 pack. I shared some of them. Everyone that tried them liked them and many of the people are begging me to order more and want to buy them from me. Yes, the Mothers English Tea Sandwitch Cookies are THAT GOOD. If you ever wondered "Why would I ever buy cookies on the internet when there is a large selection at my local stores?" Try these and you will have you answer. If for some reason you don't like them, it won't be hard to find someone to BEG you for more. I know that if they sold these at local stores around here, they would sell a TON. I don't know why they aren't sold nationwide or worldwide at local stores. Maybe they want to keep them "rare" and "special" and not just some "mainstream cookie" and have it be sort of like an "underground special treat", I'm not sure. They are worth every cent of their price. I can't say enough about these cookies. I highly recommend these to everyone. If you have to, have a few friends/family chip in and split it, if you buy the 4 pack and don't like them, you can give the other packs away as gifts/presents. A+ 5 star, my #1 favorite cookies without question.

review/text: We used to enjoy these cookies when we lived in CA where they were made. We missed them terribly when we moved and even bought 8 packs to take with us. When we saw them on Amazon we jumped at the chance to set up a regular shipment to us. They are no longer made in CA but taste exactly the same. They are simply the best and arrive perfectly packed and fresh right on time.

review/text: I used these as favors for my daughter's circus birthday party.<br /><br />I agree with other reviews, the cookies do seem smaller than what I remember.  Then again, I was a kid the last time I had these, and if you look at the nutritional value, you'll be happy that you get a few more small cookies versus 2 large cookies.<br /><br />They arrived in good condition, a reasonable amount were broken which is expected, even in the store.  The seals on the back of the bags were taped to help prevent them from coming open (much appreciated).<br /><br />They tasted great and everyone from kids to adults were happy to see them as a treat.  I will order these again since I can't find big bags on store shelves.

review/summary: Mother's Chocolate Chip Cookies
review/text: My review is for Mother's Chocolate Chip cookies. I purchased them based on all the positive reviews of this brand. I had never previously tasted them, although I'd seen them many times at WalMart. I thought they would be a less expensive alternative to Famous Amos Chocolate Chip cookies since Amazon has recently increased the price on those considerably. I was very disappointed in the Mother's brand. It did not live up to the compliments expressed in other reviews. They seem to have a strong "baking soda" taste and the chocolate chips have no flavor. I will not purchase these again!

review/summary: So happy that Circus Animals are back!!!
review/text: I was so distraught to see my favorite cookie company go under and remember buying a bag a couple months after from a second hand seller and thinking "This is probably the last bag I will ever eat!"  Well, I was pleasantly surprised today to have the familiar pink and purple packaging catch my attention from the corner of my eye today.  I bought a bag, wondering if they still tasted the same.  A couple of the cookies were smaller than I remember, but they taste exactly the same:  Perfect.  If you have never had them, I highly recommend you give them a try.  Of all their cookies, the Circus Animal cookies are by far the best in my opinion (which says a lot because their entire selection is absolutely delicious!)

I'm not sure how prospective customers can be informed items are near their expiration date or the condition is sub par, but they should be given the option to purchase "less than standard product". I won't gamble ordering ANY Mother's Cookies again.<br /><br />This holiday will have more cookie crumbs than usual, ugh!<br /><br />9/2/2011 5 STARS ... Coconut Cocadas ...

It wasn't until years later that my Mom weaned us off Drake's Coconut Jumbles and onto these to save money. Though not as coco-nutty  as Drakes's Jumbles these were always available. Neither were as good as any cookies my Grannies made :)

Imagine my dissappointment when I discovered these "New" Taffy cookies are not the same.  They have too much coconut in the recipe.  The old Taffy cookies were darker brown in color and had a completely different flavor.  I wouldn't say these new cookies are terrible, but if you are labeling them as "TAFFY" cookies, they are definitely not a resurrection of the late greats :(

review/summary: Goji Gold has changed my life!
review/text: I guarantee this product is and does all it says it does. I conducted a test trial on myself and over a month I noticed benefits in energy, memory, hair growth and overall better health. I take 1 oz each morning and within 20 min. I feet awake and ready to tackle the day...seriously! It is packed with antioxidants and has helped my emotional state...it puts me in a positive mood and a sense of well-being.  For a long while I had trouble getting out of bed and wanting to do anything.  You can ask my husband how often I wake up crabby and after I take my daily dose I'm myself again. lol  If you have a serious health condition you will probably require more, like 8 oz a day to see any real change but you must take this religiously every day to see the benefits.  1 oz. a day works for me. Now I have it automatically sent to my home each month with Amazon's program and I SAVE $$$$.<br /><br />Goji Juice has been traditionally used to alleviate the following conditions:<br /><br />  * to strengthen the heart and alleviate heart palpitations<br />  * fights insomnia and forgetfulness<br />  * contains polysaccharides which control the pituitary glands that produce HGH (human growth hormone) which is a powerful anti-aging hormone<br />  * can be used by pregnant women to alleviate morning sickness.<br />  * Has in clinical trials shown a partial reversal in sexual dysfunction in seniors<br />  * Used to boost the function of the immune system<br />  * Has some anti-cancer properties and has been successfully used to treat hepatitis-B<br />  * Has been used successfully for weight loss<br />  * Helps the body detox, cleans the blood and build the immune system.<br /><br />Here are some facts about this marvelous fruit:<br /><br />  * They contain 19 amino acids including the 8 essential amino acids.<br />  * They have 21 trace minerals including zinc, calcium, germanium, selenium and phosphorus<br />  * B vitamins<br />  * Has more Beta-carotene than carrots (which converts to vitamin A) and has a complete spectrum of antioxidants.<br />  * Has vitamin E which is almost unheard of in fruits<br />  * Has 500 times more Vitamin C by weight than oranges<br />  * It contains the anti-inflammatory agent beta-sitosterol which lowers cholesterol and takes care of sexual health<br />  * They have essential fatty acids such as omega 6 and linoleic acid that regulate hormones<br />  * Has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties

review/text: I decided to try the Goji juice on recommendation of a few people. I have tried it before, but with no regularity, so this time, I decided that I'd give this supplement a real trial. I've been taking it regularly for about a week. My basic observation is the juice does not taste, nor smell bad. It is pleasant to wake up and take my dose of Goji, versus choking down bad smelling vitamins and supplements. Score 1 for Goji!<br />Secondly, I do have more energy with the Goji supplement, however: It is no substitute for a good night's sleep. Also, sometimes it takes more than one dose to keep me going throughout the day. Granted, I've only been taking it for about a week. Lastly, I notice that if you take the supplement on the higher end of the dosage, you will not get a full 32 days out of it, which is something to keep in mind if you're watching your budget. Overall, not a bad purchase, and I will be anxious to see if the benefits from this product are cumulative. Good luck!

review/summary: Do Not Buy This Product here...
review/text: We have been using the Dynamic Health Organic Goji Gold Juice for a few years now (purchased elsewhere). We saw that it was a lot cheaper if we purchased thorough Amazon.com and used Autoship. So we have received 3 shipments so far but 2 of the 3 shipments were "Spoiled". I felt like I drank poison! It tasted (and smelled) like Vinegar! This is a storage issue, I am certain. If this juice is not stored at the proper temperature it certainly will spoil.<br /><br />I am going back to Vitacost.com which is a few $$ more in cost, but for over a year, I NEVER received "spoiled" product from them. Buyer Beware...it's not all about the cost when you are putting it in your body!

review/text: This juice is truly magical. It has given me such energy and vitality I didn't know I could have. I no longer get that late afternoon slump and I just keep going until bed time. I sleep great.  I know it's good for me too with all the wholesome nutrients a whole food supplies. I don't bother with a multiple vitamin anymore. This is all I need for the most part. I just love it and recommend it highly to anyone wanting to do something healthy for themselves. So drink to good health. Thanks Goji.
