review/summary: This stuff actually works!!
review/text: I will not say I am addicted to 5 hour energy but I have used it quite a bit this summer. I have never been a coffee drinker and don't like the energy drinks I've tried (Red Bull, Monster, etc.) I am a cabinet builder and installer and have never had a busier summer so I found myself putting in long hours. I couldn't believe the first time I tried this that I could actually feel myself "waking up" in the first 5 to 10 minutes. I have done a lot of research on any possible side affects of this stuff and found that it really is safe, if not abused of course. Amazon has the best price that I have found.<br />I prefer the pomegranate over the Orange but it's a little more expensive. The Orange isn't bad , besides I'm not drinking it for the taste!<br />I love it!!

review/summary: Better than other flavors.
review/text: I'm not sure any of these can be considered "good" tasting, but I like the Lemon-Lime better than the other flavors.  Helps to keep them cold, of course, but sometimes you just have to plug your nose and down it.  It works for me, but I don't use them on a regular basis.  I mostly just have some on-hand for those slow, dragging days when I knew I needed to get something done.  Decided buying in bulk on Amazon was better than paying gas station prices.

review/summary: Professional Driver On A Closed Course! :-)
review/text: Like most of the reviews posted here, I give this product a positive rating. For me, it does what it claims to do... and I especially appreciate the "no crash" effect after a few hours! I first found out about this product when I started racing Go-Karts this year... I hit the local Stop-N-Shop before getting to the track and decided to plunk out the $3.00, as I was a bit tired. I threw it in my cooler and then drank it just prior to my qualifying session. Almost immediately, I could feel the "boost"... and it helped out on track! I never felt the Niacin rush that some claim, but the one thing I did notice, was that my jaw was a bit tight due to the jolt of energy. I only have few suggestions: I've tried all the flavors, and I think the Orange flavor is the best; I drink the product chilled... tastes better to me that way; the flavor is a bit too sweet for me so I add it into my personal water bottle; I buy this on amazon because it's a lot cheaper than buying it at my local Stop-N-Shop!

review/summary: A ~~MIRACLE~~ when taken at the right time
review/text: So I'm the kind of person that hates getting up in the morning. I get tired, groggy, uncomfortable, and begin to doze off again if I sit down for too long. I get pretty tired throughout my day too, especially in the afternoons. So, when I heard about Five Hour Energy I simply HAD to try it. I had never drunk a lot of caffeine before, and I wasn't too thrilled about it being in this stuff in the first place, but I thought I'd try it out.<br /><br />I read online that some people need a whole bottle to feel any effects but that some people only need a teaspoon. So, I started by drinking 1/4 bottle in the morning: NOTHING. Still tired, still unhappy. So I upped it to 1/2 bottle in the morning: NOTHING. I had read somewhere that it tends to work better on an empty stomach, so I tried it first thing when I got up in the morning: NOTHING. I was really hesitant to drink a whole bottle and consume all of that caffeine, so I thought maybe it would work better for me in the afternoon. I tried a half bottle when I got home: NOTHING. I finally decided I would drink a whole bottle in the afternoon thinking all that caffeine had to do something: NOTHING. My next thought was to take a whole bottle in the morning, but after eating something as that helps lessen the chances of having a niacin flush from it: NOTHING. Disappointed, I wad down to the last resort: having it in morning AND on an empty stomach: BINGO! Within five minutes, I was awake, refreshed, and ready to start the day! It was one of the most amazing feelings I've ever experienced; being awake in the morning felt SO good.<br /><br />Needless to say, I now LOVE Five Hour Energy. I feel awake and alert in the mornings whenever I take it. However, I limit myself to 4 bottles per week, as I don't want to get hooked on caffeine or become dependent on the stuff. The only problem (and the reason this is not a 5 star rating) is because it only works in the MORNING and on an EMPTY stomach. I wish I could use it any time during the day but it just doesn't seem to work.<br /><br />If you're hesitant to try it, don't be! Go into your local drugstore and pick up a small pack and try it out. Experiment with different amounts at different times during the day. It seems to work really well for some but not at all for others, so the only way you're going to know if it works for you is by trying it yourself.<br /><br />And there is no crash like the bottle states: it wears off slowly, and if you're moving around all day anyways then you'll wake yourself up naturally by the time it truly wears off. It's great for students who need to stay up late to study, although I've never tried to use it after pulling an all-nighter. You probably need at least a couple of hours of sleep in order for it to work.<br /><br />Amazon.com has the best prices for this stuff in large quantities. You can get a 12-pack here for around $1.80 a bottle, which is really good. Flavor-wise, grape is my favorite, but I've tried most of them. The grape seems to have the least bitter taste; it's pretty sweet. The Lemon-Lime is really sour/bitter and the orange has a really potent 'orange-flavored-medicine' taste. Berry is my second favorite, but I'm eager to try the pomegranate.<br /><br />So PLEASE, if you're considering trying this stuff, DO!

review/summary: Perfect for the caffine sensitive
review/text: I have tried pills, (Stacker, Hydoxicut, etc). I tried the drinks, (Rock Star, Amp, coffee,etc). But all of them made me jittery and made me feel uneasy, even before an intense workout. I go to the gym at 5:30AM everyday and take one of these on the way out the door. As soon as I get halfway to the gym, I cannot wait to hit the weights! Now sometimes I will add a sugar free Red Bull on leg day, but one of these usually does the trick on regular days. I love this stuff. I hate the feeling most pills and drinks give me. This stuff just makes me feel alert.

review/text: My sister started to use this during inventory time's long shifts.  Her triglycerides were sky high before she started her half a bottle, not even every day. When she went back to her doctor, her level had dropped from over 400 to right around 200!  On no medications!  Her doctor says it's due to the niacin.  She told me about the energy boost, since I have Parkinson's Disease and between that & the medications, it was hard to keep up with work.  I love it!  And at these prices I can afford it!

review/summary: Better Than Coffee~
review/text: Having just purchased my next 12-pack of the "5-hour ENERGY" shots [Hours of energy now~No crash later] from Amazon.com, I can say with great certainty, that for less than $1.65/shot, I receive at least 4.5 hours of continuous energy, which enables me to begin and finish any project that I set my mind to. I'm always in a more 'chirpy and contented' mood, and this supplement never leaves me jangled, jittery, or crashing, the way most caffeine-laced products do--no running to the bathroom for frequent potty-breaks, either. I'm so very pleased that they created this product (just for folks like me)! Try some for yourself soon, and see what you've been missing.

review/summary: The Gentle Wakeup Method
review/text: I'm a night owl with a 8-4 job that is preceeded by a 1-hour commute, that often gets stuck on call during the late hours simply because my supervisor knows I'll be awake. So sleep is a coveted prize.<br /><br />I originally was drinking Monster energy drinks. While good, eventually my tolerance was so high I'd be drinking 2-3 of them just to keep going, which would start making my stomach rebel. I tried coffee as an alternative, and that was a guarentee for a rebellious stomach, and the stuff usually took a good hour to really have effect no matter how strong I made it.<br /><br />I stumbled onto 5-hour energy when hiding in a 7-11 during a sudden downpour on my walk to the office, and figured, "Eh, why not." I'd seen a few commercials, but kinda just wrote it off - primarily because I utterly hated that their early commericals were almost entirely a smear against other alternatives. I chugged it, then headed back on my walk once it was clear.<br /><br />I was awake and alert by the time I got to the office, and I'd only downed half the bottle. I was expecting an aftershot later from my stomach (I really have a touchy one), with only a very minor reaction from it.<br /><br />Big thing that hit me, was the price they slap on them Downtown; this 12 pack was the answer to that. Especially since I will easily go through them all.<br /><br />I very definitely recommend them.

review/text: This tastes great and is truly effective. I drank half a bottle every few hours everyday during finals week and was able to pound out those practice exams one after another--all day, baby! The best part is that there is no (sudden) crash like there would be after a sugar rush. The fatigue does catch up to you though, but not for a while and definitely not suddenly. I wouldn't advise drinking this first thing in the morning, though, like I did. Although you get a sudden jolt of energy, your stomach might be upset the rest of the day. It's best used to overcome that afternoon drowsiness, or to stay up late.

It can dehydrate you a little so I'd suggest making a mental note of your hydration status when using. I don't notice or have any side effects, except I can sit at the computer all day doing my job without having to try and stay awake!

review/text: I had heard good things from my friends about 5-hour energy, and I really needed a boost one day after school. I had a couple hours of jujitsu training that day, and I was in desperate need of a wake-up. I walked a couple miles home and on my way, I stopped and grabbed a 5-hour energy. I took it at 3:30, and by 4:45 (when training class started) I felt great. I went through the 2 hours of training just fine, but what really surprised me was that I still had a TON of energy after that. I really felt the need to burn that energy, so at 7:30 I decided to go for a run.<br />A while later, I realized that I just run 5 miles.<br />The energy wasn't an intense sugar high either. It just felt like I could run and never stop. I probably could have gone even further if my leg muscles were in better shape (I usually don't run very long distances).<br />This product did what it advertised and was WAY better than I expected.<br />Will definitely buy again.

review/summary: 5 hour energy
review/text: I won't spend a bunch of time repeating what others say - just reiterate - If you need constant energy boosts, you probably have some vitamin deficiency or a job that isn't providing enough enriching growth and fulfillment (too deep?) but if I have to slug through a few hours, this stuff works for me.<br /><br />It kind of just refreshes my perspective, not really boosts like i'm going to run a mile. I feel it less nervous than I do from a can of Monster Low-Carb.  Does make my heart beat a little more noticeable - which to me just screams "DO SOMETHING instead of sitting here watching TV or typing amazon reviews".<br /><br />It has sucralose in it (as does Monster Low Carb) which i think stinks. i'd rather just have a few grams of sugar than artificial anything so i don't drink it too often (though the sucralose is probably minimal since it's not a big drink) - on a side note - check out Xylitol from birch (not corn) if you want a supposed awesome alternative to sugar and sweeteners. Tastes just like sugar, comes like white sugar but none of the bleaching. No insulin issues, no tooth decay. on and on benefits and all natural.<br /><br />Back to the 5 hour - well, i like the berry flavor the best, so I buy that one.  the rest are tolerable to me with a slight eye squint of sweetener at the end of the glup - reminds me of Smarties candy from Halloween.<br /><br />Tried a few others and this one seems to work well for me without the cracky jitters.  Never done more than 1 in a day though.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: No shakes or quakes! This is exactly like having a cup of joe, and will cost you less! Two gulps of 5 Hour makes the rest of my day a breeze. I usually have it near 3 in the afternoon and I get more done in the 5 hours than I would in three days. Seriously. This stuff is not dangerous, rather it makes your days productive. Need to exercise? Got to make dinner for the kids? They need help with homework? No problem. And you'll have extra energy for whatever else floats your boat!

review/summary: More like the 10 Hour Energy Drink for me!
review/text: I have only used this product 2 different times in the past 8 months, and both times, I drank the whole bottle of it. It's probably not a good idea to do at first, maybe start out with half of the bottle, until you know how it will affect you, but I wanted to see what it would do.  For me, this was more like the 10 Hour Energy drink both times. I can drink a bottle of it in the early afternoon, and within about 15 minutes, I am very alert, and awake, and feeling very good with more than plenty enough of energy. If I drink a bottle, say around 2pm, I am still feeling the effects of it, even up to as late as 9pm or 10pm. The best part about it is, there is no crashing feeling when it starts to wear off. This will affect each person differently, so experiment with it, accordingly.<br /><br />The only complaint I would have with it, is that it makes my heartbeat, race. Not so much that it makes me want to panic, but I notice a real hike in my heart rate after about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Contains caffeine and other powerful ingredients. This isn't your typical cup of coffee with caffeine that wears off in 2 or 3 hours, this is powerful stuff, so please follow the directions and DO NOT drink more than prescribed, otherwise, you're liable to find yourself running circles on your ceiling.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anybody that needs a good boost of energy to make it through the afternoon. But as I stated, respect it, use it accordingly, and you should have no problems.

review/summary: No need for coffee. good value and good energy???
review/text: I think people either love or hate 5-hour energy. IF you're here then you probably love it and as i was, looking for the cheapest place to buy 5hour in bulk.<br /><br />gave it 5stars because 5hour is awesome. The energy feels clean compared to energy drinks and coffee. There really isn't any other way to explain it.<br /><br />I know its against guidelines to talk about price, but this 12-pack of pomegranate was the cheapest at the time. 19 or so with free shipping. IF anyone finds cheaper, PLEASE leave a comment with link to item.

review/summary: Packs a Punch
review/text: i just tried 2 bottles so far. my first i took halves and lasted 10+ hours. i waited near 72 hour mark before drinking the last half and it was really weak. my guess w/e is in 5 hour degrades over time when open because my second bottle gave me the boast as when i first opened my first bottle. when i take it keeps me focused unlike any energy drink or coffee i drank except for cocaine energy drink but that like drinking acid and feel like your gonna die. I only had berry it not sweet mostly bitter and the taste lingers in mouth long after you drink it this is only downside of 5 hour of energy and berry taste. Also i got that burning feeling in my veins the first time i taken this but that caused by one of vitamin Bs

review/summary: Energy plus without the shakes :)
review/text: 5-hour Energy works, and the best part is, you don't feel at all shakey or "antsy," and your heart doesn't seem to race. All I feel is energetic.<br /><br />I can't say it tastes all that great, but since it gives you the pep you need on those days when you don't seem to have the energy to get things done, it's well worth the taste. I've also found I don't have to drink much of it, about 1/3 of a bottle works just fine unless I'm particularly tired.<br /><br />Just one word of caution. I'd advise you not drink it before breakfast -- before you've eaten anything on any given day. I did this only once, and I felt a bit weak and nauseous.<br /><br />However, I now use the 5-hour energy drink fairly often, and as long as I drink it after eating just a little breakfast, or any time during the day after that, I've felt nothing but energetic.

review/summary: Great for long college classes
review/text: I've only tried these a couple of years ago and don't remember my experience. This semester I have an advanced college class from 5pm to 10pm every Wednesday and it's after a couple hours of work and another class. I usually drink coffee in the morning so I don't want to push it and drink more before a long class late in the day.<br /><br />I ordered the 12 pack of Pomegranate last week and yesterday just before class I drank my 1st bottle. Within two minutes I was actually feeling more alert and energized. I'm a 22 year old guy who's somewhat active but not exactly in shape, and this made me feel like going out and exercising even though I had been rushing around most of the day. I would say the effects lasted past the 5-hour mark as I was still feeling awake and alert around midnight (7 hours after drinking a full bottle). Of course results will vary but mine excellent on the first try. I'll update next week or anytime thereafter if I have any negative or interesting effects.<br /><br />UPDATE 2-10-2011:<br />I held out and didn't try another bottle until my Wednesday class came around again and I had the same effects as last week. I was alert and able to enjoy the class while others were fatigued from the long day. I ended up staying awake until 4am and I'm not sure if that was because of the 5 Hour Energy but I don't usually stay up after 1am if I have work the following day, so beware if you're interested in this for late night applications.

review/summary: Great stuff...little bottle, big effect (long shipping time though)
review/text: I love 5 hour energy.  It makes sense that some will enjoy the effects and other will not, as we all react differently.  I also agree that it has a decreasing return, even moreso than you experience with caffiene.  So one a day is plenty, and anything after that just gives you heartburn.  My only gripe is this seller's long shipping time.  I love amazon prime because of the 2-day shipment (otherwise I'd just go to the store), but, as this isn't fulfilled by amazon, it has taken over a week to actually receive the product.

review/summary: Efficacious for me
review/text: I am a big fan of this product.  I love the grape flavor, but you should realize that (at least, right now) you can get the extra strength version for about the same price - just not in grape apparently.<br /><br />There are some knock-offs that probably do the same thing, but there are also similar looking products with an entirely different toolkit of supplements.  I recommend trying this brand at least once.<br /><br />Also, when trying this for the first time, start with just a sip and wait 15 minutes.  If you feel fine, have a bigger sip, working your way to half a bottle.  Once you build a tolerance, you can have up to two bottles a day apparently.  Tolerance seems to fall off after a few days for me.<br /><br />I think if used wisely this is a healthful supplement, and the price is reasonable.

review/summary: This works!
review/text: As a morning person, afternoons are usually not a creatively productive time for me.  I found that when I try to keep going by drinking coffee I sometimes experience drowsiness as though the caffeine has an opposite effect on me.  I tried a few of the different energy drinks and found that 5-Hour works best for me.  The taste is OK, but I'm not drinking it for the taste.  I also like the fact that you don't have to drink a 16 Oz can of fluid.  I don't use it every day but when I need to work into the evening, it keeps me alert, energized, and productive.  There is no after-effect that I can tell.  I fall asleep quickly and get a good night's rest after 5-6 hours.  Results may vary for different people, but this works for me.  The price is a bit steep but you can find pretty good deals if you shop around and buy in bulk.

review/text: I ordered the 5 hour energy drink from Amazon because it is cheaper than buying it one bottle at a time.  This product is great when you need to stay alert for 5 hours.  I have had no jittery, caffeine type effects from it.  It just lets you have 5 hours of non-drowsy time and then it lets you go to sleep.  Very good for people who need to drive at night or do something that requires mental alertness.  Highly recommend it!!

review/text: I've tried a million kinds of energy drinks but these 5-hour energy shots always work the best for me. I have a lower tolerance so I only need half of one of these to get a good effect. They taste pretty good for an energy drink. They are a fruity berry flavor with hints of multivitamin. They last for at least five hours. I'll take them around 7 or 8 pm if I have to stay up studying and sometimes they'll keep me up until 2-3 in the morning.

Within about 30 minutes I began feeling very uneasy---sort of had the jitters----didn't have a lot of energy but was very nervous and just could not sit down.  I was afraid it was effecting my heart rate or blood pressure but I checked and both those remained normal even though I felt very uneasy.<br />I tried it a day later with the second bottle---same results.

This was given away for free at our company last week, and many were concerned because of potential side effects of sucralose.

review/summary: AMAZIING!!!!
review/text: I primarily use these to prevent a hang over. Since your body gets depleted of most of the vitamins that are in this it gives you an extra BOOST of these vitamins right before I go out for a night of drinking. I can have fun all night long, drink like I'm 18 years old again (and as long as I drink a fair amount of water also) I wake up with absolutely NO hangover whatsoever!!!!!<br /><br />I may feel a lil tired the next day from being out late, but NO hangover!!<br /><br />I've also used these about an hour before I go work out and it gives me an extra little boost to push myself a little harder on the treadmill or when I'm lifting weights.<br /><br />I HAVE experienced the niacin flush that they warn about on the bottle, but it went away within a few minutes. This usually gives me INSTANT "energy". It's not really an energy energy perse, but I feel a lot more alert and focused.<br /><br />THERE are THREE main reasons I use these......... 1.) PREVENT hangover  2.) Boost workout  3.) Energy boost<br /><br />I LOVEEEEE it for ALL three! (Especially the preventing a hangover part!

review/summary: The hubby swears by this product
review/text: There are a couple of uses this product is given at my house.<br /><br />My husband swears by it so much that we actually have the "Subscribe & Save" option for it (we get 2 12-packs every month).  He uses them when he's going to go out drinking with his buddies to avoid the next day hangover.  I've tried it for this purpose too but I couldn't vouch for it as much as he does because I've never experienced a real hangover just the occasional headache which I fix with a couple of aspirin.  He did use to get the whole spectrum of the hangover rainbow symptom (vomiting, nausea, headache, sensitivity to light and sound, dizziness, etc).  He swears that ever since he started drinking 5-hour energy before a night of drinking he's reduced his next day symptoms.  I do see him a bit more functional the next day and whether it's a placebo effect or an actual effect of 5-hour energy is disputable of course but I'm not claiming scientific certainty just personal experience.<br /><br />He also uses them in place of coffee when he's in a hurry and doesn't have time to make coffee.  Coffee in our household is more of an enjoyment but of course we do have the little caffeine habit that affects our productivity.  I actually do feel the same replacing one of these for a cup of coffee but nothing bits the deliciousness of a cup of coffee (the flavor of this thing is mediocre at best and absolutely horrendous at worst).  I've actually made the mistake of mixing a cup of coffee with one of these and I did feel jittery but if you just take the 5-hour energy without extra caffeine you should be OK. Of course if you are pretty much immune to caffeine at this point, both products at the same time won't make much of a difference.  I would be careful to drink more than two per day just because of the amount of vitamins contained in it.  You never know what kind of side effects you can get from OD'ing on vitamins.<br /><br />If you can get past the horrible flavor, I'd recommend it, otherwise stick to coffee.

review/summary: Sometimes works sometimes doesn't and it's overpriced
review/text: I remember when this product came to the market, it was dirt cheap at your local gas station. Now that the product has taken off the price has also taken off, it is easily twice as much as it used to be. For the price these things just aren't worth it. You can find alternatives that are just as convenient and work just as well for cheaper.<br /><br />As for the product experience its a mixed bag for me. Sometimes it would wake me up and other times it seemed to be more on the sedating side than the stimulating side. When it did work it was nice and smooth but did not overstimulate me like some other energy supplements/drinks do, I mean who wants the jitters and that nervous feeling in your gut? These did not disappoint when it did work.<br /><br />Positives<br />- convenient<br />- doesn't overstimulate (obviously will if you over do it)<br />- smooth come down<br />- works fast<br /><br />Negatives<br />- varied results, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't<br />- price to benefit ratio isn't that great, in other words they are expensive for what you get..they are like the red bull of energy shots, they may work but they are overpriced for what they are and there are better alternatives out there.<br /><br />Recommendation? If you have some patience when it comes to energy products then pills have the best price to performance ratio, I recommend iSatori Energize or Energy NOW products.<br /><br />If you want something that works faster than pills then I recommend getting the drink mix called "deton8" they sell them at Kroger (Smiths) stores and at $2.50-$3 for 10 packets its far cheaper than buying these and works just as well in my opinion.

review/summary: I love this product
review/text: I have never been able to tolerate the taste or effects of any energy drink.  I've always gotten jittery after finishing it, or given up after a couple sips because of the gross chemical taste.  I saw this in a gas station on a long road trip where I found my eyes drooping and decided to give it a shot.  I was amazed at the quick results, how suddenly peppy I felt, but without feeling weird.  I've found occasion to use purchase 5 hour energy 2 times since then (in about a month), and again had great results.  I decided to purchase with Amazon since it's so much cheaper, to have these on hand when I need them.  I work full time and go to school at night, and I have PCOS, so there are occasions when my energy gets really sluggish.  I'm thrilled to have these to rely on when it's absolutely necessary.  I definitely don't intend to get in the habit of using them, as I know anything like this isn't really healthy, but they're a lifesaver when really needed.  Oh, and they, like all energy drinks, taste pretty horrible (I've tried berry and orange), however, at only 2 ounces, I can tolerate drinking them and then washing it down with water or something else - thankfully the taste doesn't linger!

review/summary: Not magical, but close.
review/text: This isn't a LOT of sugar/caffeine.<br /><br />It's a LOT of vitamins and some energy blend. It has (supposedly) 200mg of caffeine, which is about as much in a strong cup of coffee. Compare this to the average 45 mg contained in Diet Coca-Cola. I compare this product to Diet Coke because regular Coca-Cola contains enough sugar to obscure the effects of its caffeine.<br /><br />With knowledge of its contents in mind, this product offers a subtle and extended increase in energy. It is clearly an increase in energy, but that doesn't mean that you'll experience anything similar to the energy boost from a sugar high. It's a much more controlled boost in energy.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone who is in generally good health. Even if you don't take it for extra energy, it's probably a good idea to take vitamins every once in a while rather than not taking vitamins at all.<br /><br />Forclosure: The only other energy shot that I tried is the Mountain Dew one...it wasn't worth it. I have consumed more than my fair share of energy drinks, though (rockstar, monster, etc.).

review/text: I figured this would be a good energy shot before my evening workout and it is. After working all day and still needing more exercise this really helps get me through. At first I was amazed at how good it tasted. It reminds me a bit of Kool-aid. Then the aftertaste hit and I thought I was going to die. Fortunately it is small so you can shoot it down and chase it with anything. I'll keep using these as long as I can find more. The pricer here on Amazon also makes them a valuable find.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098214251X">Build Your Beverage Empire</a><br /><br />5 hour energy shot has the best selling products on the market.  The berry flavor is the best selling flavor at the moment for every energy shot, not just 5 hour.  Five hour is still leading all energy shot products and companies.<br /><br />I've tried the product and sampled the product with distributors, wholesalers, retailers and consumers.  It is the best tasting of the 5 hour line of shots.<br /><br />As a consumer, the formula works and you will see an increase in energy as soon as you zip this 2 oz shot.  It is easy to drink and strictly an energy product. Many people tell me they don't like to drink the 8 oz, 12 oz or 16 oz energy drinks to get the same energy they can get by just carrying and drinking a 2 oz shot.<br /><br />As a wholesaler or distributor you are guaranteed turns with this market leader. The challenge is purchasing it at a competitive price.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Jorge S. Olson<br /><br />Jorge S. Olson is a beverage consultant and entrepreneur.

review/summary: Works for a Minute... Gives you pain for hours
review/text: I never drink energy drinks. I'm in college and all of my friends drink them like they are water. I never got the point of it.But today it was 2 pm I could barely keep my eyes open and i had class from 3:30 till 9:00. I needed energy and fast. Then the commercial for 5-hour energy popped in my head, "2:30 feeling" I knew some of my friends used it, so I thought why not give it a try. I figured it was small so it wouldn't do that much harm.<br /><br />I drank half of the bottle and within minutes I know longer felt like I was falling asleep. Unfortunately 10 minutes later I was feeling more tired than before. I decided to drink the rest of the bottle. Once again a quick 5 minute burst of energy and then back to exhaustion. Then everything got worse. Around an hour after drank the drink I found myself doubling over in stomach pain and throwing up. It has been 7 hours since I drank it and I feel like I just got hit by a train. Instead of helping me get through class the 5-hour energy made it nearly impossible.

review/summary: Use it to wake up, cheaper options
review/text: I use this to wake up in the morning because I have delayed sleep phase syndrome. It is very convenient to sip in bed, compared to a soda or a pill. I like the extreme version because I only sip it and the extreme lasts longer. I'm somewhat sensitive to caffeine so I never drink a whole bottle. I use the 5-Hour brand instead of the cheaper alternatives because it does have a bunch of chemicals, and I assume they have a lot to lose if something goes wrong, so they probably spend more on quality control.<br /><br />If all you want is energy, caffeine pills are way cheaper. You can get 60-100 for a few bucks. They only give you mental energy though, but 5-Hour gives you physical energy.<br /><br />Someone mentioned green tea. I also recommend matcha green tea. It is a very good low level, long duration energy, but it's also expensive. I won't even mention cocaine - oops just did.

It's an energy shot that comes in a much smaller package that keeps my energy on a higher level for as much as 10 hours and at 46 years old I need all the energy I can get.  It's a lot more convenient to carry, seems to have a longer effectiveness and I seem to like it more than I do the 5 Hour.

review/text: I would consider myself a caffeinated products connoisseur, so of course I've had 5 hour energy before.  But it's not something that I'd consume on a regular basis.<br /><br />It's just ridiculously expensive compared to equally effective products.  Right now I'm taking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">Black Friday to Cyber Monday Deal - 50% Off Sale: The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Drinks, Shots, Coffee</a>, which costs like 33 cents per pill, and gives me just as good (or better) energy boost than a ~$2 5 Hour Energy.  I've also taken <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3WFFG">iSatori Energize All Day Energy Pill, Tablets, 84-Count Bottle</a> in the past and also plain caffeine pills, and either one of those options would also be a fine substitute for 5-hour.<br /><br />Bottom line - if I get one for free I'll drink it, but why take a $2 shot instead of a 33 cent pill?

review/summary: Crash was difficult to tolerate, maybe tornados?
review/text: The happy news:  Wednesday was 100 degrees and I felt exhausted and unable to focus on the 90-mile drive.  Experimented with 1 bottle of Orange at 2 p.m.  It tasted awful.  At first it had no effect, and I did find some relief by pouring water on the back of my neck and back to revive me.  I continued driving and I would say about half-way (45 min) I no longer felt like I had a problem with tiredness or my driving.  At home I was able to complete several errands and continued working into late into the evening.  At 9:15 p.m. I began to feel my usual tired self, then normal drowsing and fell asleep without issue.<br /><br />During the night I awoke feeling like my skin was crawling without anything specific to scratch.  I am guessing that this is a generalized itching sensation from "niacin flush."<br /><br />The unhappy news:  Wednesday was also the day the three tornadoes hit Massachusetts so I cannot say for sure whether what happened the days after was from the 5-Hour Energy or from my adrenaline kicking in from pure worry.  I was glued to the TV for several hours watching the weather color maps as the storm systems moved Eastward.  Thankfully our neighborhood was out of range.  On Thursday I woke up and could not get going. It was tiring to do anything but shuffle around, wishing for energy that did not come. Thursday finally wound down in disappointment and Friday came with the same dreaded tiredness that lasted until afternoon when I snapped back into normalcy.<br /><br />So I do not know how to rate the product.  I am leery about experimenting with it further, especially since I am hypothyroid and tend to be tired, though nothing like what I described in the preceding paragraphs.

It says no crash, but just last night when I took this, I couldn't keep my eyes open after taking it, I kept trying to stay awake, soon as I laid on my bed, at 9 pm. I woke up at 1 pm the next day. I missed the entire morning because I had crashed so unbelievably hard.<br /><br />I do not recommend this to everyone, everyone has a different reaction to it, but mine wasn't so good.<br />I suggest if you take these when "Not Tired" to avoid heavy crashes like mine. I took mine after being up for around 18 hours. So take them when you are only feeling a little worn out, not exhausted or restless.

review/summary: Did little but your mileage may vary
review/text: It is hard to review products like these because results are very dependant on each person's physiology and are also subjective.  I don't think anyone who has said they've had great success with this product is lying, nor do I think those that have said they've had little success are lying.  As such this is a product you have to try to see what happens for you.<br /><br />I am not a huge consumer of energy products, but I do like to them from time to time.  My standard has been Rockstar Zero Carb (i.e. no sugar) which is a full size energy drink.  I have found that it works well and usually I don't need to drink the entire can.  The appeal of 5-hour Energy is its small size and easy storage.  I don't drink Rockstar for it's outstanding taste, so if I can get the energy in something smaller and easier to consume, why not try?<br /><br />I first tried 1/2 a bottle of 5-hour Energy as some of the reviews made me a bit wary of how I might react.  I found that 1/2 bottle had almost no effect.  On a different day I tried the entire bottle and again I saw almost no effect.  It is possible that there was a slight pickup, but nothing that would make this product worth buying.  I find this a bit strange because the ingredients and amounts appear to be more than what is found in the Rockstar Zero Carb mentioned above.  As such I would expect at least the same level of energy pickup, but again that wasn't close to being the case.<br /><br />I am not going to throw in the towel just yet, however.  I plan to try the "extra strength" version of this product to see if that yields a better result.  For now though, while I cannot personally recommend this product based on my own results, I think each person will have to try and see for themselves.<br /><br />Update: I tried the "extra strength" version of this product.  I took the entire bottle and found little to no difference between this and the "regular" version.  Since the regular version, as mentioned above, had pretty much no effect on me, I don't plan to buy anymore of this product.

review/summary: Did nothing for me.
review/text: I decided to try this, and bought a bottle since I was up from 8:30am on a Sunday, and had to work a double (4am -Midnight and Midnight - 8am), and wouldn't be home till around 9am.<br /><br />It has a horrible taste.  I gagged and chugged down some water hoping to get rid of the taste.<br /><br />I chugged it around 5am, hoping the "5 hour" energy drink would last till I get home.<br /><br />Felt absolutely zero pick up, zero energy.  Didn't work for me.

review/summary: No effect for me
review/text: I bought a 2-pack of the orange flavor 5 hour energy drink at Wal-Mart.  I tried one bottle in the afternoon, the other 2 days later in the morning.  I drank the whole bottle, but saw no real change.  I don't drink coffee, so I can't imagine I have made myself insensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />The orange flavor tasted fine though.  Kind of like orange drink in elementary school.  It sounds like other reviewers don't like the berry or lemon-lime.

review/summary: It must just be me....
review/text: This seems to work for so many people. It didn't do a thing for me. People talk of their heart racing... I even had soda an hour or so within taking this so-called energy shot, I felt no different. It tasted nasty too. I just took this about an hour ago, I feel like I could just go to sleep. I have 0 energy. Of course I've taken ephedra and it did nothing for me... man I'm just unlucky. I wonder what it's like to feel rested and energetic! I wouldn't know and I guess I never will.

review/summary: best out there, still not perfect
review/text: Of all the energy solutions out there, this is easily the best one.  However, it still has its drawbacks.<br /><br />First, the PROs -<br /><br />Instant energy - Works almost immediately (within 1 minute for me)<br /><br />Not a lot of "jitter" - Many other energy bars and drinks give you that shaky feeling.  This one does not<br /><br />No Crash - Its true, there is no crash.  Though when you come back to your previous energy level, it might feel like a crash.<br /><br />A very positive energy - In addition to the physical energy you also get a very refreshing mental energy.  It can almost be described as a very focused high.  A feeling of clarity and motivation all at once<br /><br />Small amount goes a long way - I like that you dont have to drink a big 16 oz bottle of this stuff.  Most energy drinks have a taste about as appealing as bath water.  So, its nice to only have to drink an oz or two<br /><br />Now, for the CONS<br /><br />Taste - See above<br /><br />Thirst - I get very thirsty on this stuff.  I always have to make sure to have a big bottle of water around<br /><br />Its addictive - The "mental" energy you get from this makes you want to do it all over again.  Probably not for people with addictive personalities<br /><br />Big initial blast - The first 10 minutes for me are almost too much.  I seem to want to do everything all at once.  After that, i calm down a bit and become intensely focused.  But, those first 10 minutes are usually spent just trying not to knock anything over in my office

review/summary: Different effects for everyone!!
review/text: Please be aware that this product, like any other supplement or energy drink you can try, will have different effects for each user. To think that it would react the same for everybody would be saying that everybody has the same exact body shape and health, metabolism, etc. Personally, it works wonders for me. I am 20 and in fit shape, and it does a perfect job of keeping me awake and focused at work. I drink one on days when I didn't get enough sleep the night before, and within 5 minutes I can go from stumbling around with heavy eyes to being alert and productive. For me personally, there is no crash afterward, I simply return to however I was before I took the drink. My only concern is the possible long-term effects, but since I do not use it on habit, just on those days when I really need it, I am not really worried about it. Highly recommended, but do not feel scammed if it doesn't work for you. It simply might not be as effective on your body.

review/summary: Effective!
review/text: My wife and I recently took a trip from San Diego to Great Basin National Park in east-central Nevada. It's about a 750-mile drive and we attempted to do it in a day. On the way there, I was getting real drowsy by the time we got to Las Vegas and we still had another 5 hours of driving. We'd stopped at a truck stop for gas and I noticed the little bottles of "5-hour Energy" drink. I'd seen them advertised on TV but had never tried any kind of energy drinks. Being somewhat cautious, I sipped about half or the small bottle, saving the rest for later. Well, it seemed to work fine.<br /><br />On the way back to San Diego, I was tired and drowsy right from the beginning. I was fighting sleep all the way from the park to Las Vegas, where we gassed up. Remembering the "5-hour energy" drink, I bought another little bottle for the seven-hour drive to San Diego. After driving for about an hour, I consumed the whole bottle. I was wide awake almost immediately. It was amazing! I still felt very tired, but I was awake and alert and remained  that way for all the remaining drive to San Diego.<br /><br />Other than the awakeness and alertness, I experienced no side effects at all. My wife hated the taste and said she would not drink it again, but then she wasn't the one who was driving. The taste seemed fine for me. Somewhat medicinal, perhaps, but no problem.<br /><br />This stuff is effective! I'll now always have a couple bottles in my car for any long drive. It's expensive, but well worth it. The cost by the case, by the way, is substantially less than the cost of single bottles in the truck stops.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: My husband loves this stuff. We ran out of it because I had a pending order elsewhere that fell through(they might have kept my money forever if I hadn't cancelled the backordered order), so, needless to say, I was happy to find a good price on Amazon that actually beat what I had thought was the best deal I could find. I received my product within a couple of days and am very satisfied.

review/summary: True to the commercial, but caffeine amount is questionable.
review/text: As a person who has never consumed a cup of coffee or other energy drink before in his life, I can't say for certain just how effective 5-hour energy is in comparison.<br /><br />I can say that it worked, though -- my God, did it work. Having drunk merely half the bottle, I felt energized and ready to roll in three or four minutes. The product was true to its label in that I was able to study with concentration from 12 o'clock to 5 with no "afternoon slump" or "jitters"(though for a time I did experience a subtle tingling in my fingers). When my five hours were up, I came back to normal and didn't feel any side effects or "caffeine crash". The product is not addictive: I bought a pack of twelve bottles a month ago and still haven't used them all.<br /><br />5-hour energy should be used with wisdom, however -- the manufacturers say that it contains "no more caffeine than a cup of coffee" but doesn't specify the size of the cup. It took me an hour longer than normal to get to sleep when I drank a whole bottle.<br /><br />That said, I have no other complaints to offer of this excellent energy drink. I suggest taking half of a bottle whenever you need a boost of concentration or motivation, as that is usually sufficient. Also, drink these only when you need to -- it's potent stuff, and I wager those little bottles can disappear quickly.<br /><br />5-hour energy is a great resource for workouts, daily business, and the hurly-burly of modern life. I give it 4 stars.

review/summary: Great Long Lasting NRG/ Energy... Take the Right Dosage!
review/text: I picked this up at Costco at a pretty good deal after seeing this here. Best next thing to my old Vivarin fix but better as it is in somewhat of a food form without the crash.  Do NOT take this more than the recommended 5 Hour intervals!  First you'll be wired and more on the EDGE than anything.  Taking two of these in less than 9 or 10 hours was a shock to my system and it actually knocked me out for a minute, but after that I was wired more than anything, almost ready to fly!!  Again great booster, maybe too great sometimes. You gotta remember this is basically a double shot of the regular.  You could probably just drink 1/2 of these and get the same effect of the original obviously.

review/summary: I Love the Stuff - Your Mileage May Vary
review/text: TV commercials like the vendor uses make me skittish. I wouldn't have gone near this with a ten foot pole had I not been behind a woman in scrubs purchasing some in a convenience store. I asked her if it worked, she was very favorable and her doctor/boss was positive about it as well. I went home, did more research, saw that the results ran the gamut, but I saw no one experiencing any severe side effects. I took the plunge.<br /><br />I have Hashimoto's (hypothyroid) that is under control with medication, but I'd been recently finding myself extremely tired from early afternoon to the end of my work day (and beyond). I started out with half a bottle of 5-hour after lunch and am extremely happy with the result. It's not dramatic - it just gets me from "tired" to "not tired" for the afternoon and early evening. I've experienced none of the side effects that others have, but two things that I'm doing are (1) not drinking on an empty stomach, and (2) only using 1/2 bottle.<br /><br />I'm by no means downplaying anyone else's experiences - we're all different, our bodies react differently to all sorts of things, but I would definitely recommend to anyone to give it a shot. Above all - listen to your body.

review/summary: More Like 3 Hour Energy For Me, But Still Better Than All The Other Energy Drinks
review/text: Makes you feel alert without making your heart pound out of your chest.  Doesn't make you feel hyper-alert, it just makes you feel normally awake.  I've taken this on the brink of exhaustion late at night it definitely makes me feel 10 AM awake, without feeling obnoxious.  I'm a regular coffee drinker but this stuff is alot more effective with no jitters.  Works for about 3 hours for me but the 'no crash' thing is a bunch of hooey.  It just means no sugar crash.  If you were tired when you took it, you obviously better be near a couch when it wears off.  Once your body remembers how tired you really are you'll pass right out when it wears off.  Definitely the best out of all the energy drinks out there when used sparingly.  Tastes horrible but it does what it claims to do.  I only use this stuff sparingly, as-needed but has yet to let me down.

review/summary: Best tasting 5 Hour Energy drink yet!
review/text: I consider myself a connoisseur of the energy drink world, and by far the 5-Hour products have been the best of the best.  For various medical reasons, I can't drink coffee or tea because of irritants/acids that naturally occur in them.  However, thanks to many years of moderate insomnia (I wake up a lot, no problems falling asleep, just can't STAY asleep), and not having good reactions to prescription sleep medications, I often still need some caffeine and/or extra b-vitamins to help get me through the day.  I've tried living without it, but sadly all it takes is one bad night without enough sleep (which is at least once a week) and I'm nodding off at my desk at work.<br /><br />I used to drink Sugar Free Red Bull, sometimes as many as 3 in a day to help me stay alert.  However, Red Bull makes me CRASH!!! I loved the taste (even though many people think it's gross), and I liked Red Bull a lot more than the other can drinks (ie. Monster, etc). However, it was almost as bad as drinking nothing at all!<br /><br />Then one day, I tried a 5 Hour Energy drink.  Back then, there was only lemon-lime and maybe berry flavors.  I preferred the Lemon Lime, and I was shocked to find that this product didn't make me jittery, and definitely didn't make me crash!<br /><br />I've been using them ever since!  Amazon.com has a great price for 12 bottles (these can be as much as 3 or 4 dollars each in NYC, if purchased at a small grocer or deli), and they offer all the varieties.  I used to use the extra strength ones, but I am downgrading myself back to the regular ones to try and limit my dependency on them (I only use them now when I absolutely need them, usually around 1 or 2pm).  I drink the whole bottle, and rarely have I ever felt the need for a second bottle during the afternoon if I had my first in the AM.<br /><br />I just tried this new-er flavor, Pomegranate, and I must say, it ACTUALLY TASTES GREAT!!  I will be buying a few boxes of these for sure!!<br /><br />As a side note, I noticed my hair and nails have been growing a lot faster since I started drinking these daily.  I can't say for sure it's a related effect, but it's an interesting coincidence!

review/summary: Varying results for teens
review/text: My three teens (110lb - 125lb) loved the effect of this the first time they tried it (at about 5pm in prep. for an evening swim meet).  Swam fast for whatever reason, too.  Second time around, same circumstances, one still loved it but the others felt tired / shaky / nauseous and frankly looked quite pasty-faced.  Tried a half bottle for those two, for the third time around, and they felt no effect at all (good or bad).  All three times, they had orange flavor and they did not down it on empty stomachs.  So now two don't want to use it any more and one is still interested.  Results definitely vary, therefore, but I'd recommend newbies to try it several times in non-critical situations before you decide to down it to prep for that truly vital meeting.
