review/summary: Nice - If you like Mango
review/text: Mango has a specific scent and flavor - if you like it, this is a nice way to drink coconut juice. A big advantage of coconut water - being alkaline - is wiped out by the fruit acids - giving this mix overall an acidic ph. You still get the minerals from the coconut water.

review/summary: Peach and Mango Vita Coco
review/text: I have tried many flavors of Vita Coco coconut water and this is my least favorite. It truly reminded me of baby food flavors. I did give it three stars because it is healthy and it does rehydrate. Otherwise I will not be buying this again. I will stick to plain or tangerine flavored.

review/summary: hmm ok
review/text: I think I taste more of the mango then the peach but over all I like the Vita Coco water with flavors then just by itself. I am not in the food science world but I think Coconut water is made by taking the coconut milk and separating the cream/ solids from the water part.  What is left is a strong coconut flavored past that is sent somewhere else and coconut water that still has health effects and a very slight coconut flavor.  It also has some weight, or thickness that is heaver then what normal water would be, it reminds me of an egg white viscosity.  Drink it colder the better I say because when warm urp!

review/summary: Only buy if you really like the original flavor
review/text: If you're like me you really enjoy the all around effects of vita coco but you're not really keen on the taste then I suggest you try another flavor this one tastes really similar to the original.  This stuff pretty much tastes exactly like the original flavor with a slight hint of peach and mango but no real flavor.  If like me you're looking for some stuff that tastes better than the original I highly suggest getting the pineapple flavor (pretty much tastes like a watered down pina colada)

review/summary: Don't experiment with this flavor
review/text: I love most coconut water, so I thought I'd try to snab a deal and try out a new flavor at the same time. Unfortunately, I paid the price. The peach-mango flavor is utterly devoid of good taste, and I would not recommend it. If you have had it and like it, Amazon offers a great deal on it. For me, though, it was an unpleasant taste with an even more unpleasant aftertaste. Now I have to find out what to do with the 11.5 remaining boxes...

review/text: This particular flavor of Vita Coco is too sweet for being useful as a thirst quencher.  The mango and peach completely overpower the coconut water.  I think the mango even overpowers the peach, but I cannot be certain as the flavor is very strong and sweet.  It is not unpleasant, but not what I was expecting.

review/text: This isn't something you drink for pleasure - at least I don't.  I drink it because it's supposed to be good for me, and because I'm trying to cut out soda.  The peach & mango is way better than the plain or the tropical, but it's still not something I can honestly say I enjoy.  I'll keep drinking it though, because I keep reading things that say it will do me good, and I don't want to keep drinking soda like I do.  It's better to drink this when it's really cold, and it's easier if you drink it really fast.

review/summary: Clean and tasty beverage.
review/text: I feel like straight coconut water is an acquired taste, but these peach mango ones are just delicious. They aren't too sweet and the mix of peach and mango is more of an accent than a dominant set of flavors. The result is a cool, refreshing beverage in what i consider to be the perfect container size. Where i live, these are priced individually at an average of $1.79, which would be around $21.50 for a twelve pack. So, for the current subscribe & save price of $17.65, you are saving around $4 here on Amazon (if you would have purchased twelve anyway that is).<br />Great taste, competitive price. I am glad to have found these here.

review/summary: I enjoy it, but...no straw?
review/text: As with any type of food, I guess, whether you like it or not is a matter of taste.  I enjoy the taste of this drink, but I think I would not have when I was a child or a teen, but my taste buds then liked heavily processed foods and beverages that were full of sugar and/or artificial ingredients.  Over the years I have come to enjoy eating and drinking more healthy foods that are not always the one that can be found at a convenience store or at a fast food place.<br /><br />Anyway, the one factor that surprised me is that even though the drinks come in a juice box type container that even has writing on it that says "it is like sticking a straw in a coconut," yet there are no attached straws.<br /><br />Anyway, one more positive comment is that that shipping was very fast.

On my vacation to the Caribbean Islands I got to try different ideas from the natives and found that green coconut water was good for hangovers and brown coconut water was good for constipation. Well VitaCoco falls into the hangover category. In fact I find that using VitaCoco as an alcohol mixer works great to balance out the equation.

review/text: I was turned onto coconut water through my yoga studio and Vita Coco is the brand they carry. Is slightly sweeter than I had hoped for, but on the other hand, its flavored varieties have a better taste than other flavored brands I've tried. Personally, the one with peach & mango is my fave flav right now. One 11.2 oz carton after a yoga practice hits the spot! Now I use it for dance class as well & if I am doing too much running around some days. Rather than get dehydrated or cranky b/c of not eating enough, I have one on hand.

I use it primarily for my long runs during my race training (for 1/2 marathons a nd marathons) instead of synthetic electrolytes (i.e. gatorades et al, cliff shot blox, gu-s, etc.).  They do not upset my stomach and have found this peach mango to be delicious (over the plain).  This and the passion fruit are my favorites.<br /><br />Be careful when you are ordering however - I have ordered a couple of cases when they go on "special" and the expiration dates have been a lot sooner (i.e. 3 months out) then I could consume.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: My friend purchased a 12-pack of the Tangerine-flavored VitaCoco and it was excellent.  Really light flavor, refreshing, perfect bit of citrus.  I decided to try a different flavor, so I bought a 12-pack of the Peach & Mango.  The name sounded appealing - how can anyone mess up peach, I figured.  Let me say this - it is honestly one of the foulest things I've ever tasted.  I cannot articulate the taste because it's so uniquely bad - you will have to try it for yourself (which I don't recommend).  I was able to drink half of one container before pouring the rest out in disgust.  Reminds me of when I was a teenager and I was forcing down my first mixed alcoholic drink and the taste was nearly unbearable.  I had my friend try a container and his was awful, too.  I eventually threw out the remaining 9 cartons (note: I used a 3rd one to trick another friend into trying this repugnant crap as a gag).<br /><br />I don't know if I got a bad batch or if this is how Peach & Mango is supposed to taste but I am thoroughly dissatisfied.<br /><br />Update: it's been months since I wrote this review and I stand by it.  My friend bought a separate batch and the taste was identical.  Peach & Mango is the worst VitaCoco flavor, in my opinion.  Honestly, it's one of the worst beverages I've ever tasted - period - next to a can of unsweetened Oolong tea I purchased at Wegman's.  Maybe it's an acquired taste; unfortunately, it's not one I'll be acquiring at the current price of coconut waters.

review/summary: Does anyone know what REAL coconut water tastes llike?
review/text: This product tastes terrible and it also tastes NOTHING like actual coconut water. Anyone who has ever lived in a country where Coconuts actually grow would be and IS utterly offended by this product. It seems that people will buy anything that is prepackaged and overly process as long as it claims to be all natural. Save yourself and your bodies by not eating/drinking "natural" foods bought in a package. The truth of the matter is that anything that is actually authentic has not been processed in factories and put on a shelf.

review/summary: Gluten-free classic white bread
review/text: I have had inconsistant results with this mix.  I made it with a bread maker and it needed at least a half to 3/4 cup more water.  The bread texture turned out ok, but not great. The bread collapsed in the baking process...I'd never had that happen with all the breads I have made.  Taste was not what I was expecting. I tried it again and added honey, butter and about a quarter cup of water.  The result was a nice flavored, white sandwich bread...certainly better than frozen store bought breads.<br /><br />I am not sold on this product as the cost is substantially higher than other products.  Anyone who has to eat gluten-free knows bread is one of the most difficult things to replicate in flavor and texture, like the traditional wheat flour breads.  This mix I feel is a work in progress...as are most gluten-free breads!!

Not this bread.  It's like a wheat based bread.<br /><br />My former 15 yr old bread queen, bit into a slice and said, "It doesn't taste like anything."  She explained that usually the breads taste really funky and gives you a weird after taste.  Not with this bread.<br /><br />The whole family was impressed with how the bread didn't crumble in their lunches like others do.<br /><br />And I made a stuffing using cut up cubes that tasted divine.<br /><br />My hunt for the perfect bread is now over!

review/text: This is simply the best gluten free product around for making bread and pizza. It doesn't contain any nasties and the recipe for making anything is incredibly simple (contents of the packet plus salt and two cups of warm water). Adding small quantities of other ingredients (butter, sugar, sorghum flour, buckwheat flour, etc etc) improves the flavour, but they're not essential.<br /><br />And bread machines are a waste of time - just mix the ingredients, knead a little and place in a bread tin to rise and then bake without opening the oven door.

review/summary: My husband's favorite GF bread
review/text: My husband has Celiac disease, and this mix is his favorite bread.  I was skeptical the first time I made it because the ingredient list is short, and you only add like two things to it...water and oil I think.  Figured it would be either the best or the worst bread ever.  I mix mine in the bread machine (as I don't have an upright mixer) and then make it into rolls using the directions on the box.  He prefers the rolls to making a loaf, and tends to eat more of it.  It's worth noting that you can vary the size of the rolls considerably, and I find that making 12 is about the right size and consistency for sandwiches/munching on.  Much bigger and it's just too much to eat.  The package doesn't tell you how many it yields, so this is from my trial and error.<br /><br />As someone who doesn't have to eat GF, but often does by default, this bread doesn't have a weird aftertaste, like so many breads with tapioca starch in them.  Also, the texture, if not overcooked, is the most like "real" bread to anything we've tried.  Personally, I also like Gluten Free Panty's Favorite Sandwich bread mix, but my hubby prefers Schar.

review/summary: it's so so
review/text: I had high expectations for this bread since we love the Schar classic white rolls.  I made this mix in my Zoji breadmaker, following the instructions on the box (and using the Basic setting, which is 3:30).  However, I found that once the mix began to knead, it was quite dry so I added appx. a 1/4c more lukewarm water.  I think it could have used more though, but it was my first time making this. The bread began to rise nicely but at some point during the bake cycle it deflated a bit.  I've never had that happen with any other recipes/mixes before.  The end result was a very crusty, crumbly bread with a rubbery texture.  My kids thought it tasted very plain.  I think I'll stick with Pamela's - never had a bad loaf with her mix.

review/summary: Schar Gluten Free Bread is GREAT for Pizza Dough, Calzones, Doughboys, Bread
review/text: Hi, 5 people in my family have had celiac for years, we are half Italian and very fussy about bread and pizza.  This bread is great and also makes a fantastic pizza crust, it doesn't have the strong aftertaste that some of the GF breads have.  I've never used a breadmaker, always make it by hand, I wear latex gloves to mix it so my hands don't get gluey, I follow the instructions exactly, and it has come out fine every time.  I preheat/warm the oven to 150 or so degrees for 5-10 mins before I start the dough, then shut off the oven.  Spray Pam in the bowl and on top of the dough, cover the bowl and dough with a wet towel, and let it rise in warmed oven.  After risen an hour I then wear gloves again, cover a pizza pan with E.V. flavored olive oil, and spread the dough as thin as possible in the pan because it will rise when baked.  If anyone would like to see what the final pizza looks like I have it posted on Facebook under Gluten free Professionals group.  I also freeze unused dough, take it out the night before, and it makes great bread, rolls, or pizza and the dough is even more workable when it's cold.  Been using Schar for years without a problem, I have a feeling the folks had trouble due to the breadmakers, I work the dough by hand with gloves and it only takes a few minutes.  Remember the ingredients need to be lukewarm for the yeast.  I also plan to make onion bread and maybe olive bread with the Schar mix.  I have also make a spinach pie roll with this dough, spread it out, layer sauted fresh spinach and pepperoni and provolone cheese, roll it up, and bake, it's great.  I have also made sauted Calzones, and fried dough (doughboys) which are fantastic with a bit of sugar, just saute in a bit of olive oil in a nonstick pan and the dough fluffs up great and they taste fantastic.  I bought and baked every bread mix on the market to determine which was best and Schar came out ahead of all closest to real bread than any others, Schar also has a great website with good tips on cooking gluten free and baking bread.

review/summary: A bad Gluten free bread
review/text: My wife has celiac disease and we are on the look out for good gluten free products. I bought this for her based on the 3 reviews written here.  There are instructions for using this mix in a bread machine.  I have tried twice to make this bread in my machince following to the letter the directions on the box.  The bread turns out with a tough crust and a very rubber like texture. My wife said she felt like she was trying to eat an old rubber rain boot. Maybe I did something wrong but from now on  I will stick with gluten free pantry or using my own from scratch bread.

review/summary: The best white bread we've found so far!
review/text: My wife was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease, which was a hard blow for us... we love our bread and pasta and I personally made a ton of bread from scratch. After many unsuccessful attempts to recreate my favorite bread recipes using mixtures of various flour types, I decided to go the boxed route to see how things stacked up. Schar products have me hooked! I made the white bread last night and it turned out better than any of the others we've tried and don't come across as too heavy on any one type of flour. I do not recommend using a bread machine for the mix. Why? It's a simple matter to throw the ingredients in a mixer and they don't require any fancy treatment. Pat the batter into a greased and floured loaf pan, stick it someplace warm with a wet towel over it and wait. That's probably the most important thing... It doesn't give a time on the box, it just says "until doubled". Give it time... Took over an hour for me, but it was a bit cooler in the house than it probably would have liked. Baked it for exactly the time mentioned on the box and placed the loaf pan on a cookie sheet filled with water. Loaf came out looking like it might be under-cooked, but it wasn't! Came out perfect, works for toast, french toast, sandwiches, etc... Love it! Buying my first five pack through Amazon now!

We first found this item at Walmart, for about $1 per box less than Amazon is selling it for, but very few folk were buying it and the boxes on the shelf all expired (it tastes horrible close to and after the exp date) Despite my requests the store kept restocking the old items and we had no where to buy. I took a chance on Amazon's set of boxes, hoping there would be time to use them before they all came close to the exp date and was happy to see that they expire more than 1/2 year off in the future :) Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: Pretty Darn Good GF Bread + Recipe Adaptations
review/text: I am really happy with this bread. The bread gets a nice crust and pretty good flavor.<br /><br />When I make my bread, I'm more successful in the oven rather than the bread maker.  It's absolutely key that you put a pyrex of water in the rack under the bread pan when you bake this bread - otherwise you get a pretty tough and dry crust.  Be sure to put the pyrex in the oven when you preheat the oven. That way when the bread dough goes in, the oven is already humid.  Obviously you can't do that in the bread maker - so oven is the only way to go.<br /><br />I have also found that adding an extra 1/2 cup of water gives the bread a bit more volume.  I also add 2 tbls of honey - this is not much in terms of sweetness, but it does mellow out any unusual flavors that are always found in GF bread.<br /><br />If you're new to GF, this a great bread to try.

review/summary: A REALLY big hit with my non-gf household!
review/text: Well, this was the first time I tried a bread maker.  I followed some advice here and ended up with the dough overflowing, but maybe I did something wrong...  Anyway, I managed to get the just-starting-to-cook dough out of the machine and into 2 bread pans (that dough had REALLY risen!)and cooked them separately somewhat according to the directions on the box (since it was already partially cooked, and had an extra cup of water in it - and I did not put a pan of water under it while baking in the oven)and they came out looking unusual (very white on top) but were incredibly tasty!!  I'll second that it tastes a lot like a french bread.  Kind of crispy and chewy crust, very moist and fluffy inside.  Nothing like gf bread at all.  No one could believe how good it was!  I really think this would make an excellent pizza dough since the crust is so crispy and chewy.  Of course, these were the results of having it flop in the bread machine first.  I hope I can duplicate my results while avoiding another disaster! EXCELLENT BREAD!  Now, if only they could keep it in stock...<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've now tried this with less water (about 2 and 1/2 cups) and the loaf came out perfect!  I have also had my machine prepare the dough and before it started the baking cycle I took it out, divided it into 4, flattened circles (like pizza crusts), filled it with meat, sauce and cheese, and then folded it over and pinched the edges and baked it at 425 for about a 1/2 hour to 35 mins.  Mmmm.... CALZONES!  Absolutely delicious, crisp crust and very tasty!<br /><br />The main problem with this product is that it does not brown.  It is always white on the outside.  And the longer you cook it, the more rock-hard it gets.  I missed crunchy dough though since going gf, so I don't mind it slightly over-cooked.

review/summary: Outstanding Bread -- BREAD MACHINE DIRECTIONS!!!
review/text: This bread tastes great and is super easy to make. Believe me, it would have to be for me to make it!<br /><br />It's pretty good following the package directions, but what really made it fantastic was adding a full additional cup of water to the recipe, as recommended by one of the other reviewers. (This brings the total to 3 cups of water.)<br /><br />Following the package directions, you really need to eat this bread the day you bake it (so make sure you make it in the morning!). Fortunately, this has not been a problem at my house. Adding the extra cup of water, it was still edible the next day.<br /><br />I did put the bread in the oven to rise for 30 minutes, with the oven temperature set at "warm".<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Since writing the above, I purchased a bread machine. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067REBU">Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker</a><br /><br />After 5 or 6 trial-and-error attempts, all moderately successful, I have cracked the code to making this bread mix work optimally in this machine. Here it is:<br /><br />Instead of putting the wet ingredients in first (as the machine's booklet instructs), put the DRY ingredients in first, then the wet ingredients. Use the settings:<br /><br />1 Basic<br />1 1/2 pound loaf<br />Dark crust<br /><br />While following the directions (of the machine) will work, following my directions leads to bread that rises half again as high. This yields a fluffier texture which, frankly, tastes less gluten-free. (You know what I'm talking about!) The individual slices of bread are then so huge that you can literally cut one in half and make a decent-size PBJ.

review/summary: At last, a TASTY gluten-free bread mix!
review/text: I could not believe the taste - I baked it using my stand mixer (I hate my bread machines both of them ! just don't get good results using them), but I followed the directions EXACTLY for using a stand mixer (the dough was a lot stiffer than the usual gluten-free breads) including placing the pan of hot water in the oven - It did not brown outside, but I baked it for the recommended time - no longer - cut myself a slice as soon as it cooled, and it was so good I wanted to cry - taste and texture very like a chewy French bread.  After 3 days sitting at room temperature, still good, but drying slightly (no crumbling) - after 3 more days in the refrigerator, tastes like a good chewy English muffin, toasted, and STILL no crumbling.  Just don't let the white-ish exterior fool you into baking it longer.  This is one I am glad to see in Amazon's product offerings, I know I will always have it in my kitchen - and the mixing couldn't be simpler (I live at 4,400 ft. but did not adjust for altitude - perfect loaf, anyhow !)

review/text: We have used and enjoyed this European firm's baked bread and hoped that their mix would produce an even better product.  Our first attempt was a near disaster!  The dough was hard to mix, did not rise enough, and came out of the oven unbrowned and tough.  Since I have baked bread for many years, I decided to try some modifications to see if the end product could be improved.<br /><br />I mixed the dough using a stand mixer, rather than by hand in a bowl.  I added one TBS of sugar, and increased the water from two to nearly three cups.  Before putting the bread in the oven I brushed the top with melted butter.<br /><br />The result was a nicely browned loaf which had risen nicely. The texture and flavor was very satisfactory.  Now we can have nice tasting white bread available all the time.

I ordered these for my mother in the hospital 1500 miles away, when I found the online offerings from local flower shops cheesy, substandard and WAY overpriced. A bouquet of daisies and carnations and filler in a cheap vase starting at $45? And you want $20 to deliver it under three miles? Puhlease.<br /><br />Although I was given an estimated delivery date of two or three days, they arrived the next day, just as I specified. And they are GORGEOUS, according to Mom. They arrived just in time to awe my stepsister and stepfather, who had brought a generic bouquet that probably cost just as much as my fabulous orchids. I wish I could've seen their faces.<br /><br />Mom says there are at least a dozen stems. She is just loving telling all the nurses and her visitors that her daughter sent the spectacular orchids.<br /><br />Little-known fact: orchids last longer than any other cut flower. They will still be beautiful when Mom goes home next week, and probably for at least a week after that. They are elegant and exquisite.<br /><br />When you care enough to send the very best, send orchids.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: Through the fault of the delivery service, these flowers were left in a box at the post office for seven days. When I followed up with the friend I had had them delivered to, if she had received the flowers, she said she hadn't and was so sad. No note had been left by the delivery service that an attempt had been made to drop off the flowers. And now whe wasn't looking forward to going to the Post Office to pick up her now surely dead flowers. (SEVEN DAYS!) To her surprise? Perfect condition! Unbelievable! They continued to look fresh SEVEN DAYS LATER. She was ridiculously happy with these flowers -- and I was very, very relieved. I'm back to order again :)

review/summary: Exquisite, vibrantly colorful, totally fresh, and a fast delivery!
review/text: I sent these to my mother for an early Mother's Day gift.  I placed the order on late Friday, and it arrived on Monday!  My mother called me to say that the flowers were absolutely gorgeous (and she is a flower "savant"....she grows them and knows them), fresh, vibrantly colorful, and perfect. Each flower stem was in a vial of water, and was totally fresh and lovely. She was absolutely delighted with my gift. I can only say, thank you, Amazon, and thank you to the seller of these Dendrobium Orchids, who wisely marketed them through Amazon.  I doubt I would have stumbled across them otherwise! I would recommend these to anyone who wants to give a gift of flowers.  The price was reasonable, and the results impeccable!

review/text: Five Star Flowers.  These beautiful flowers lasted almost as long as the fake bouquet in the bathroom.  About six weeks; no joke.  This may not be typical, but my wife was sincerely impressed. On delivery many of the flowers were open but many of the buds were closed and bloomed days and weeks after. Even if they only lasted a couple of days they would still be worth it; absolutely great!

review/summary: Worried about sending live flowers
review/text: I guess I'm like most people when it comes to sending anything that's live. We'll worry about everything imaginable, like if it will even get there and or what it's condition will be when it does get there. And when it comes to flowers, how long will they last? Well, I finally talked myself to take a chance and send these Orchids and I am really glad I did. I sent these to my inlaws in Kansas who we haven't been able to visit for a while, because of health reasons, and we got a call five days later from a very happy Mom. She told us that the flowers were perfect and that they would send us a picture in a few days so that we could see how beautiful thay were. Sure enough three days later we received an e-mail thanking us along with a picture of the orchids, and they were right, the flowers were beautiful and you could see in the picture that only half of the buds had bloomed and that along with the other half, they would probably last an other week. So, yes I am very happy I decided to send these flowers, not only because it made my inlaws happy but also because we now know where to buy our next gift of flowers to send.

review/text: I ordered these flowers from England for my sister who has lived in America for some years.  She has been very ill and has been bedridden for a while.  She was extremely pleased with these flowers.  She says they were like a touch of spring sunshine in her bedroom .  It was a very large boquet so she put the flowers in two vases on the window sill in her bedroom so she could see them, and says there are lots of little buds up and down the stem which are opening up each day.  She was so pleased with them, she has taken photos of them to send me, and also to remember what they looked like when they have eventually faded.<br />I am really pleased with the pleasure they gave her.

review/text: I just put the last stem with two blossoms in a bud vase--from the bunch I received for my birthday on September 21...today is November 10. And we live in south FL--I imagine they would do even better in colder climates. I made sure to change the water every two days (yes, it has been a lot of water changes) and cut the stems a bit every week or so. They are quite impressive when they arrive in the box--even after the carrier left the box in the afternoon sun. I thought they were fake when I first saw them as they were so perfect. I would not hesitate to order these as a gift. My daughter commented the shipping was quite fast, arriving exactly when she wanted them to.

But the reason I'm on here giving a review is because just today--nearly TWO MONTHS after I received them, I threw away the last stem. The orchids came with so many unopened buds that just continued to blossom for me. So pretty, and lasted so long. I assumed she had spent a small fortune on them, so when she told me where she bought them I was very surprised. Great value.

review/text: It took a day or two for the shipment to go out.  But, considering how far they had to go to get there, they were in pretty good condition when they got to my sister.<br /><br />They are coming from Florida, via USPS.  So keep that in consideration as well as the time of year and where you are having them shipped to...<br /><br />The flowers were a tad wilted when they got to Oregon (I'm sure it didn't help that the address I had them sent to was so far in the countryside that it was basically last on the mail-route, so they had been sitting in the hot mail truck all day), BUT they came with directions on how to perk them back up, and that worked really well.<br /><br />If you are going to order during a busy time of the year (i.e. Mother's Day or Valentine's Day), you might want to order them early, or, hopefully, they won't have far to go.<br /><br />Great price, Beautiful product.

review/text: I received the orchids as a gift for Mother's Day. I was going away a few days later and thought for sure they would be dead by the time I got back. Not only were they still alive but continued to last for weeks!  I kept trimming them and pulling off the dead blooms so they did get shorter but they still looked beautiful.  A very unique floral gift.  I then sent them to my Mom for her birthday and she was just as pleased. She also could not believe how long they lasted and thought they were beautiful.  I would highly recommend them.  They arrive with a water tube attached to each bloom.

review/summary: Wonderful flowers!
review/text: I ordered the purple orchids for my mom and she loved them. I order flowers online frequently and sometimes you do NOT get what you pay for. But... this time we did! In fact the price was excellent and so were the orchids. My mom said they each came with an individual tube of water along with the vase. All of the flowers were in perfect condition. Sometimes ordering flowers online can be tricky as the pictures are really not what is delivered. These flowers really were picture perfect!  I trust the amazon reviewing process for my purchases and this time it did not fail me. Hopefully the company will read the customer's feedback and continue their great service.
