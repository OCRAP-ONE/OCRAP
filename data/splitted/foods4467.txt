review/summary: Simply the Best!
review/text: I LOVE Tilda rice! I am not a native of India, but I happened to see a commercial for Tilda on a program. I found some and bought it. WOW. PERFECT RICE, every time! I was born and raised in the South of the US, and we like our rice fluffy and separate. Lots of folks use instant rice (yuck!) or similar to achieve that consistency at the sacrifice of flavor. Tilda simply tastes wonderful, cooks quickly, and is perfectly long and fluffy every time. It is simply superior rice. No need for a rice cooker, either. I thought I'd tried them all, and I do "good rice" with regular long grain, but Tilda makes it effortless. I don't want to do without it, now.

review/summary: A taste of Louisiana!!
review/text: This tastes just as it did when my Grandmother Couvillion made it every morning till the day she died. I have to disagree with the other review -- my father WORKED at the local Folger plant and he came home and drank Community! I will say that this is NOT the darkest Community blend -- those would be the French Roast and Evangeline Blends (also available on Amazon), and the Evangeline being the best coffee I have ever tasted -- dark but not bitter at all. It is more expensive though and so this is my alternative since cash is tight. I COULD buy even cheaper coffee but life is short.

review/summary: Disappointed but . . .
review/text: Amazon offering Community Coffee delighted us; it's been a favorite for years but this coffee is either stale or something's seriously changed in their roasting. No matter how strong we made the brew in our French Press, and in a perculoator, the beans just did not evidence the delights of the past.<br /><br />We had to cancel our Subscribe and Save and tell friends who joined Prime to get this! Sad, but if you don't notice the grand scent of the beans, return it!<br /><br />PS I did not do that, and called Community Coffee instead! My batch was "Best Brew Date" of 1/18/12, and they KNEW what was wrong, and told me to contact Amazon, which I should have done in the first place. Thank goodness, our fav coffee mystery has been solved! If you have that date on your coffee bags, contact Amazon!

review/text: I am a huge fan of Community Coffee.  The company often runs specials, they are very responsive to their customers and their product is good.<br /><br />I've tried most of their flavors now and this one is a very good one.  I buy this any time i find it on sale.<br /><br />I've written the company asking for samplers and they sent all kinds.  It was great.  I also love their decaf and 1/2 caf products too.<br /><br />They will email you when there are large storms (like the hurricanes) to let you know there may be a delay in shipping.  Makes sense.<br /><br />I believe all the beans are roasted here in the US.<br /><br />Huge fan of Community Coffee.

review/text: This is the official state coffee of Louisiana.  Like great food, coffee is considered a right of Louisiana natives.  There is no coffee anywhere in the world that tastes as great as Community.  Make it strong and it still isn't bitter.  This dark roast blend will wake up the sleepiest head and start you out with a morning smile.  Yes, the breakfast blend is also great, but my original love is dark roast.  Thank goodness for a thermos because without bringing my own coffee, I would have to tolerate folgers, maxwell house, or some other less satisfying beverage.  Community coffee, any blend, is a treat to be experienced!

review/summary: Very good red curry sauce!
review/text: I really like the Rogan Josh sauce. It's a great curry sauce if you want a non-cream based curry. This one works well if you're trying to stay away from the heavy coconut milk, etc although the korma is delicious. I do add a little salt to this sauce; but I find it mild and very good. I've been eating this Rogan Josh for some time and enjoy all the Patak sauces. When I started Weight Watchers I switched to this one from the Tikka Masala and the Korma. It's a nice, mild/medium red curry sauce. I keep 2-3 bottles in my house at all times!

review/summary: Buy at the store, if at all.
review/text: I thought that in the age of online shopping, I could pretty much expect any vendor to package their items properly.  That said, I can give this sauce 3 out of 5 stars as a mediocre curry dinner base, and 0 out of 5 stars as a packing material.  Don't expect it to taste like a restaurant's curry: it's more of a ketchup with curry added.  Also, be careful of broken glass when disposing of said packing material.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if half of the jars you ordered shattered en route, because the mixture of cardboard and three square inches of bubble wrap don't quite get the job done.  It's partially my fault, I suppose, for expecting the jars to be individually bubble wrapped, or packed in styrofoam, or for UPS not to have drop-kicked it from its point of origin to my now somewhat soggier mailbox.

review/text: Patak's Rogan Josh Curry Cooking Sauce is disgusting.  I made it for dinner and couldn't force myself to eat more than a few bites.  It tasted nothing like Rogan Josh; the texture, color and flavor were all wrong.  It didn't even taste like any kind of curry sauce.  The jar I purchased indicated "medium", which I expected to indicate the heat/spiciness, but it was mild by any standard. It tasted like warm tomato paste.  (I shook the jar, emptied the entire contents into the pan and followed the cooking instructions exactly.) You'll just have to take my word for it that I would not rate a mediocre product with one star; this was a truly dismal eating experience.

review/text: I have been sleeping horribly for years (my mind doesn't shut down well at night) and I've been taking Benadryl at night to keep going. It works for the most part but I have to take more as time goes on and I wake up feeling hungover and drag through the day. I felt like I was at the end of my rope and wanted to try something new. It didn't seem realistic that a simple tea would help but it was worth a try. To my surprise I have slept better the past couple of weeks than I have in years. It's not a drugged sleep and I was disappinted that it really didn't help me go to sleep but once I am asleep it does help me sleep through the night. One odd side effect is that I have vivid dreams every night. I'm not sure if that's a side effect of the tea or just the fact that I'm finally sleeping well enough to dream. Either way, I certainly recommend trying this tea.

Nothing compares to this perfect balance of elegant olive oil and and just right touch of lemon and ginger. Works great with green salads or with fish. This item and the same olive oil infused with Basil are an absolute must in a kitchen. Cooking destroys the savor, but a slight trace over hot pasta exhumes its full potential.<br />The tin can is not the most practical. The pouring mechanisms will drip all over the tin, so you may want to transfer to a glass bottle.

review/summary: Ultimately refreshing, savor the delicate complexity!
review/text: The aroma of this tea in the box is a light woodsy tea scent. When brewed you experience the same woodsy scent but with a floral component. The taste is subtle. The flavor is woodsy and floral--a fantasy of bamboo and lilac.<br /><br />If you are looking for an intense burst of flavor this tea is not for you. If you have time to savor a delicate, refreshing brew then try this!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 5 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee. This tea is reported as having a high level of antioxidants-higher than green tea. The level of antioxidants and information about them would be a good addition. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface. Here is a poem they put on this box:<br /><br />"Ten thousand flowers in the spring, the moon in autumn, a cool breeze in summer, snow in winter. If your mind isn't clouded by unnecessary things, this is the best season of your life."<br /><br />Wu Men.

review/summary: Delicate Flavor
review/text: White Tea is said to be every bit as healthy as the Green variety.  Celestial Seasonings Decaf White Tea has a delicate flavor and can be enjoyed hot or over ice.  This tea is a favorite of mine because it is decaffinated so I can be enjoy it in the evening without worrying about losing sleep or getting the jitters.

review/summary: Ok, but just not as smooth and good tasting as other teas
review/text: Some teas feel like a chore to drink. This white tea isn't quite that bad, but I definitely don't find myself wanting to brew a cup just for the heck of it. It's mild tasting, not bitter, but it still has that kind of taste that I describe as "knowing you just dropped some leaves in water." Sorry, I don't call myself a tea connoisseur, so take this as a tea newbie's opinion. It is not as hard to drink as some other bitter teas I've had, so that's good. That being said, I really love the teas I've had from TeasEtc.com. If you really want to treat yourself to a flavorful treat, I recommend their Orange Vanilla White Chocolate tea: [...]<br /><br />(I just want to add that I don't work for, or know anyone associated with TeasEtc. I just found them on amazon and wanted to spread the word!).

review/text: First off this is bittersweet dark chocolate and for the most part I don't care for dark chocolate candies, but this drink sounded so enticing I just had to try it out! I myself have a sweet tooth so added a couple of teaspoons of sugar but you can add as much or as little as you want to make it perfect for your own tastes. I only had 2% milk but I do have a milk steamer so I steamed the milk then added the chocolate & sugar & ended up steaming it a little bit more. It was delicious, and you find yourself savoring each sip. I can only imagine how wonderful this will be with whole milk or heavy cream!YUM!

review/text: I am pretty careful about what I eat and staying in shape.  I don't like to take in calories from drinks so I look for low cal drinks that are still tasty.  Other than Crystal Light, the sugar free hawaiian punch products are probably my favorite taste wise. I have tried the red punch, blue typhoon, and found this berry limeade on Amazon which I have never seen in stores.  It do like the flavor as it is similar to the other berry/fruity flavors.  It is really all a matter of preference regarding what flavors you like but if you are looking for low calorie drink packets and like fruity drinks this is definitely an option.

I can't get enough of the Cioppino, it's the best I've ever tasted and it also makes a great sauce on pasta and shellfish. The use of wine, in place of vinegar, is genius and really ads a sophisticated touch to the backyard BBQ. We had a few friends over for a cookout this summer and they couldn't stop raving about the tenderness of the meat and the flavor imparted from these marinades. There is nothing like them that I've found in the grocery store. The finishing sauce explodes with flavor, I put in on everything. My order came attractively packaged so it would also make be a great gift for Father's Day. Try this stuff and taste for yourself...

review/summary: Some of the Best Marinades I Have Ever Tried
review/text: I'm always looking for good marinades to go with chicken and pot roasts. So when I saw this 4-pack for Twisted Vine Gourmet, I decided to buy this. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Twisted Vine packages their products very well. Each bottle came individually wrapped, with enough packing material to ensure safe delivery.<br /><br />I used the Cabernet and Herb Grill Marinade with a pot roast, letting it simmer all day in the slow cooker until my family was ready to eat. Everybody loved it to the point where they had seconds. The Spicy Zinfandel Barbecue Sauce had more kick than we expected . . . a bit too much. Because of this, I plan on using half the bottle the next time I use this sauce for my chicken. I have yet to try it on burgers or steaks.<br /><br />The portabella had a good flavor. I used it for chicken and plan to use it again for a pot roast or burgers. The only marinade we haven't tried yet was the Chardonnay Chipotle. Given how spicy the Zinfandel was, I plan on using this sparingly.<br /><br />I recommend this marinade pack to anyone who enjoys rich, flavorful marinades. These are the best I've found so far.

review/text: Ordinarily I do not drink sweet coffee, and all the iced k-cups I've tried have been gooey and bitter. I tried this one when Green Mountain had a special, and now I'm ordering more for my daughter! It is very sweet, and makes a relatively small amount (the "iced" setting on my Cuisinart brewer is sends only 4 ozs. over the ice, and I wouldn't recommend more than 5-6 cubes in the glass). But brewed that way you get a refreshing, sweet, nutty drink. It's really rather strong this way, and has a surprising caffeine kick, which I don't get from my hot hazelnut brew. With record-breaking temps in Atlanta this year, it's a welcomed treat!

The box of tea I received was discolored and had a dusty residue inside the shrinkwrap.  A closer examination showed weavil molts inside the wrapper.  I sealed the box in another plastic bag (I don't want weavils in my cupboards) and reported my findings to Amazon, asking for a refund.  I am pleased to report that I was promptly refunded the cost of the tea and the shipping.  I think this item must have been old and improperly stored.

Hence, this combination often appeared on our lunch table. Telling left coast friends about my fondness for these sandwiches, the response is almost always, "EWWWW, yuck." Maybe it's genetic, but I love them.<br />Bananas and P.B., too, [hold the mayo for that combo.] My sister even likes her BLTs w/P.B.  No thanks, that one is not for me.<br />Try Laura Scudder's [with or without mayo]. I think you will find it the best P.B.. out there.

review/text: I was hosting a large party and decided to get this bulk package from Amazon - both for cooking and for serving as apps. These were ok, but nothing special. The mix had mostly green olives, quite a few olives were mashed. They were a little salty for my taste, so I soaked the batch which I was serving as an app in clear water to release some of their salt. I probably won't be ordering these again - I didn't care for the taste and they aren't an especially good value: I recently found out that a Town and Country supermarket in my area with a great olive bar regularly has 6.99/lb specials on olives, including Moroccan and Castelvetrano.

review/text: These are AWESOME olives.  In a 5 lb bag there may be a few fragments of pits, but no more.  The flavor is excellent and their look is beautiful.  They are crisp and boast a brilliant, full flavor without being grotesquely salty.  I have ordered them repeatedly and everyone who tries them loves them.  I open the bag and divide it into mason jars, which I keep the refrigerator.  I have never had any issue with them going "bad" or getting soft, etc.  The tail end of the last jar is as good as the top of the first.  These are simply delightful olives, expertly produced.  A single one of these olives will have more gorgeous flavor than a whole can of the brackish olives packed in cans in the grocery store.  Highest recommendation.

The olives were firm and full of flavor, had a nice greek olive scent.  The second one was terrible - they tasted rancid and smelled terrible.  We ended up throwing them all away - we were afraid we'd get sick.  We will not be ordering again - very disappointed that the product was not even edible.

review/summary: Excellent mix for salads, cooking, and appetizers
review/text: We tried out a large number of bulk olive mixes from Amazon, and this is the one that we've settled on.  The olives are pitted, so they are super convenient, especially for cooking and putting on salads.  We also put them out for appetizers for a super simple, fast cocktail snack.  In a pinch we use them in martinis too, amazingly enough.

review/summary: Excellent Bulk Olives
review/text: I was left speechless when I tasted these olives.  They are beyond delicious!  The Byzantine Country Olive Mix, 5 pounds, is one of the most fabulous food finds on amazon!  The olives were whole, firm, not too oily, not too salty, and so fresh.  They are airpacked in a thick plastic bag, and there are about 6 or 7 different kinds of olives from small dark purple to green and everything in between.  The liquid was clear with no added pieces of peppers or stems or extra bits of herbs.  I filled 4 Glad containers with the olives adding a little sea salt and water.  As we eat these olives, I pour off the liquid and give them a quick rinse.  I have heard of adding oil and vinegar but these olives are super without add-ins.  The price is fantastic especially if you subscribe and save.  I am tired of buying rubbery olives in jars at the store or wondering about the cleanliness and safety of the olive bar.  It's a life changing experience to have a big stash of olives in the fridge just waiting for me to enjoy them.  I'm so glad to find this quality item!  And they arrived in 2 days!  SECOND ORDER AS PERFECT AS THE FIRST !!  This time I bought some cans of green olives on amazon.com and added them with their liquid to the Byzantine Olives.  This cut down on the work of making my own sea salt water for storing in containers.  And it stretches the olives too.

I do not know how long they will stay fresh, because they came with a small amount of liquid. But at the rate they are eaten, that should not matter.

review/summary: Olives!
review/text: We have purchased this product three times to date.  The olives are very good quality--firm, not squishy like the overcooked olives in jars and cans.  In a total of 15 lbs of these olives, we have found 3 only pits. I use the pitted country olive mix to make olive salad added to Italian sandwiches (think muffaletta!) or olive p�t&eacute; with crusty bread.  To make the olive p�t&eacute;, toss the pitted olives in a food processor and add a drizzle of olive oil.  Scoop the contents into a bowl.  Very simple to make, and always a hit at parties.  Will continue to buy this product.

review/summary: Green Olives Generally Firm - Darker Varieties often soft/mushy
review/text: The mix I received seemed to have a great variation between the green ones and the black varieties.  I found the greens generally to be in good shape, firm, and tasty.  Most of the darker ones though were a little mashed/mushed and I didn't want to eat them because I like firm olives.

review/summary: Enjoying Wholesome Kefir
review/text: Since I began following <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425204138">The Maker's Diet</a> in order to improve my health, I have been interested in adding kefir as regular part of my daily nutrition.  Sadly, all of the kefir that I have been able to find is both low-fat and pasteurized.  As well, many varieties have undesirable additives (fructose, preservatives, etc.).  Recently, I have been reading more information about the benefits of kefir, so I began to look for a way to make my own.  I am already drinking raw milk from a local farm and have been making yogurt from that, so making kefir seemed like a good idea.  A health food store that I frequent sells kefir starter but it requires that the milk be heated first (according to the directions on the package) - essentially pasteurizing the milk and negating all of the benefits of raw milk in the process.  My search brought me to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2">Milk Kefir Grains</a>.  At first, I was a little put off by the price.  When I learned that the kefir grains can be used indefinitely with proper care and feeding, I decided to place my order.<br /><br />When I received my package of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2">Milk Kefir Grains</a>, I was a little concerned by the condition.  The box was shipped in a cardboard 'sleeve' that had been crushed.  The product box was considerably flatter than it should have been, but the small, sealed 'envelope' containing the dried kefir grains inside was unharmed.  My suggestion would be to revise the packaging or choose a better shipping carton to prevent/minimize any potential damage.  That said, the damage was purely cosmetic.<br /><br />When my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2">Milk Kefir Grains</a> arrived, I immediately set to reading the included instructions.  While I was a little dismayed at having to wait a week (or more) for the grains to be revitalized (by putting them in fresh milk daily until they are ready), I was eager to start enjoying homemade kefir!  I wasn't entirely positive if the grains were fully ready after 7 days, so I gave it another 3 days.  Even though the instructions say to start with smaller quantities of milk (about 8 oz.) for the first batch of kefir and stepping up to the desired amount, I made my first batch out of a full quart.  It came out great!<br /><br />I am currently making my 4th batch.  To store the grains between batches, I simply put them in a jar with about 6 oz. of milk stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days until I am ready to make a new batch.<br /><br />If you are looking to enjoy the health benefits of homemade kefir, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2">Milk Kefir Grains</a> by Cultures for Health.  Be patient - it is worth the wait.

review/summary: Excellent value
review/text: I spent a considerable amount of money buying kefir from WholeFoods (at $3.99 a quart) until I discovered these miraculous grains. Who knew kefir could be made at home so easily?! The insert with the small package of minuscule "grains" is a bit intimidating and you may think there is some difficult process to be followed. But it's so easy. Just place the grains in a cup of milk and put it on a shelf in the kitchen. Pour out the milk (just not the grains) and pour in fresh milk every 24 hours. For the first 2-3 days as the grains start stretching out their legs, growing their muscles, pushing and shoving each other, the kefir may be watery or bitter at first. After a couple of days, you start to get sweet-tasting coagulated kefir every 24 hours or so. You will save and save so much you won't know what to do with your money.

review/summary: fairly misleading,weird packaging,BUT MAKES GOOD KEFIR
review/text: I bought this product around the beginning to middle of May 2011 &, at that time, it showed a picture of the box from the company Cultures for Health LLC.  It also had (& still has) their name on it as "by Cultures of Health LLC" but then further down is says "Ships from and sold by Lifetime Kefir."  I just want to clarify for everyone out there, who like me thought I was buying from a specific COMPANY that sells milk kefir, that this is not sold through Cultures for Health & it is not sponsored or affiliated with them in any way.  I contacted Cultures for Health today and the customer service lady said that they are not affiliated with this "Lifetime Kefir". I also received my kefir grains in a plastic baggie & wrapped in about 5 more plastic baggies, all smooshed up flat, and looking nothing like the cauliflower looking kefir grains you see pictures of.  Needless to say I was a little freaked out.  I decided to just try it out & see if the kefir grew and 'worked'.  -----  THAT BEING SAID ..... the kefir grew wonderfully! and has tripled or quadrupled in a months time.  I also sent the seller a question after working with and growing my kefir for about 2 or 3 days and he gave me a quick, polite, fairly thorough answer. Customer service seemed just good ... and quick.  I started with making about 1c of kefir and it was fizzy, clumpy/watery, weird.  I didn't know what I was supposed to be looking for but I guess this is normal and I just kept working with it each day changing the milk out and making new kefir.  It took about 1-2 weeks before it was producing well and I was making good kefir (not fizzy, but creamy now).  I was slowly figuring out how to work with the product.  I now make a quart jar of kefir daily.  I switch out the grains/kefir each morning and am left with about 3-4 cups of kefir each day.  All-in-all, I think the product is good. *****UPDATE 7/13/11******:  Since the initial review here, I have contacted the seller about some things & have had wonderful, very polite, and very quick customer service.  There is nothing bad to say at all about the customer service with this seller, in my opinion.  He seems to go out of the way to make sure the buyer is fully satisfied with the product.  And the product seems great.  My grains have grown tremendously and I have probably 1 to 1 1/2 CUPS of kefir GRAINS now.  That is all from about 1T of smooshy, yellow looking 'stuff' (kefir grains) that I initially got from the seller.  It took a couple weeks for them to start working "normally" and looking more "normal" but just give them some time and they seem to come through and make great kefir.  The only reason for less than 5 stars is simply because I feel like there still is a little misleading advertising in the product.  It appears this seller (Lifetime Kefir) has a few different kefir grain ads/products on amazon & the one that I bought from ([...]) shows that it is "by: Cultures for Health, LLC" and "shipped and sold by Lifetime Kefir".  I thought I was buying the grains from Culture for Health through a middle-man, so to speak.  When actually it is not a Cultures for Health product at all.  Maybe no big deal to others, but it was for me.  It ended up being a great product in the end though.

review/summary: Very small quantity, poor growth
review/text: I got these dehydrated kefir grains two weeks ago. When re-hydrated there was a very tiny amount of actual grains. I put them in a jar with milk on a seedling mat to keep them the right temperature (our house is cool at night) and was very careful, and yet the milk kept curdling because there weren't enough grains, or just going yeasty. And they're growing very, very slowly. Two weeks later and I have a half teaspoon of grains. So far the milk has never smelled anything like kefir. In desperation I started adding some kefir powder and kefir, thinking that maybe they'd pick up some missing bacteria. Also, the instructions are misleading when they talk about it taking two weeks to "rehydrate". What you're doing is growing them to the point that you have enough to actually make kefir. I'm starting to think that dehydrated grains are a bad idea. But at the very least they ought to give you enough of them, instead of the tiny amount.<br /><br />Because it didn't seem like it was working very well, I ordered two tablespoons of live kefir grains from another vendor. They arrived yesterday, and I put them in milk. Today I think I have almost a quarter cup of grains. They seem to have already grown noticeably.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I'm still going to try to get these grains to work. I'm going to try a much smaller amount of milk so the kefir grains aren't overwhelmed. I'll update this review if it ever works.

review/summary: Great first experience!
review/text: Milk Kefir Grains arrived in a timely manner in great condition. I am a first-time user of Kefir and until recently had never even heard of it. In a quest to achieve optimal health, I came across information about the benefits of cultured milk products, like kefir, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0967089735">Nourishing Traditions:  The Cookbook that Challenges Politically Correct Nutrition and the Diet Dictocrats</a> by Sally Fallon. I was a bit nervous to use this product without actually "seeing" how it was done, so I went to the "Cultures for Health" website to watch the video. It was exactly the support I needed to have the confidence to start something that seemed so foreign!<br /><br />The first day I began to hydrate my grains, I mixed a cup of whole raw milk and the kefir grains in a canning jar with a coffee filter fixed to the top with a rubber band. The weather outside was very cold and subsequently it was pretty chilly on the inside of the house too, so I turned my oven light on and place the jar as far away from the light as possible and closed the door. I repeated this process the 2nd and 3rd day, but by the 4th day decided to leave it on the counter since the milk was separating to curds and whey by the end of the 24 hr period. I had kefir by day 5! It tasted clean and a little like buttermilk, yummy! I'm still learning, but feel confident that I'm off to a great start, thanks to Cultures for Health <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2">Milk Kefir Grains</a>!<br /><br />I'm thrilled to have this product! I save money by not having to buy powders, and my homemade kefir is better for my family than the pasteurized, sugar-filled, store-bought (expensive) version!

I have worked with them twice -- the first time I followed instructions & made successive batches over a 4-day period. The second time I allowed 18 hours. The kefir grains have expanded, but not enough to make a good, thick batch of kefir....and the kefir tastes bitter. It is supposed to taste sour.

review/summary: Inferior Milk Kefir Grains
review/text: The kefir grains were delivered promptly so there was no issue with that. However! The milk kefir that they produce is not what I would consider real milk kefir. I've previously made milk kefir from grains obtained through Marilyn "Kefirlady" and through the local leader of the Weston A. Price chapter. Both Kefirlady's and those obtained through Weston A. Price produced much better kefir. One of the main differences I could tell is that the kefir grains I've received from Cultures of Health do not create the "slimy" casing around the grains as I had experienced with other vendors. This leads me to believe that the grains are lacking some of the bacteria or yeasts that form the kefir grains. The taste is also not as sour as other previous grains. I understood that the first week or so of batches would not be up to par however I'm well past that. Personally, I'd recommend getting them from a different vendor as these are woefully inadequate at accomplishing their intended purpose. Looks like I'll have to be getting some new grains...

review/summary: HIGHLY Disappointed!
review/text: Kefir is SOOOO good for you, and Cultures for Health is a great company to buy from. The milk kefir grains from CFH were great, and my child thoroughly enjoyed the milk kefir. I noticed a calming effect from it (likely the B Vitamins). They helped with our gut and regularity immensely.<br /><br />However, this is NOT a Cultures for Health company product. It is from 'Lifetime kefir." I've never written a review before, and I do buy items very frequently online. I'm usually easy going with how things turn out through the mail. It arrived VERY warm and wet and in a PLASTIC bag. The dried kefir is much more shelf-stable through the mail and arrives in better packaging that doesn't leach chemicals into the product. Shipping was much slower than expected. It ended up shipping separately from my other items and arrived several days after the others. This is questionable whether it is safe to use because of the heat (it's summer here!) and plastic, and I certainly cannot give this to my small immune-compromised child of which is why I ordered this in the first place. For the customer service, I cannot yet say how they handled this issue, but I'm hoping for a full refund, shipping cost in all. I will update on the customer service aspect. Order directly from CFH. It's faster and better quality.

This cereal allows her some texture yet doesn't require her to really chew. It is really had to find foods that are safe and good for her. We use many of Bob's Red Mill foods and love them!

review/summary: My cats love it
review/text: My cats haven't been this excited to eat since the time they were fed day fresh tuna from the Atlantic.  Even my cat who hides when I have company will come running out if they open a can.  He knows my other cat will take it all and he doesn't want to miss out.  There is no odor and no cruddy residue left behind in the can which makes them easy to clean before putting them in the recycle bin.  And if you've been feeding your cats tuna or sardines as a treat, this food works just as well and is nutritionally balanced.

review/summary: Excellent tea!
review/text: This is one of my favorite teas.  It is from Yunnan province in China. It is low in tannin, so, no matter how weak or strong you prefer your tea, it will not develop that bitter "edge" so many tea varieties do. I like it moderately sweetened, with a dash of almond milk.

review/summary: Beautiful Morning Tea, With Caffeine
review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf."<br /><br />Although this tea says "orange pekoe", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones. It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added. It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the "old stuff"!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Numi is  the best tea I have tried so far.
review/text: I am a tea lover, as is my husband. After trying numerous teas including Teavana, we found that this tea is robust, full bodied, and far better than the other black teas we have tried. Numi is organic, fair trade, wonderful packaging and good for the planet. My new years resolution is keeping those qualities in everything I purchase when possible. You will not be dissapointed in this tea.

review/summary: Great value and flavor in organic tea!
review/text: I drink black tea every day and looked for an option that was reasonably priced, a good flavor and organic. Numi offered all of these and the subscribe and save program makes the price even better.

review/summary: Great Tea For Relaxing
review/text: *****<br />Sweet Meadows is a very relaxing high-quality Numi tea. This herbal tea is certified organic and is kosher. The whole organic chamomile blossoms used in this tea have been cultivated in Egypt's northern valley, and are combined with the finest organic lemon myrtle from the rainforests of Australia. The tea itself is caffeine-free, of course, and has a flowery chamomile and citrus-y flavor. I love the taste and I prefer it over plain chamomile--the lemon adds a lot!<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi herbal teas, get it---you won't be sorry.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Better Than Just Chamomile
review/text: Soothing, I ordered another 3-pack.  A 20oz. cup takes 2 bags, we need the extra fluids anyway.  W/traditional chamomile teabag I have to add a peppermint or red clover & they balance each other out beautifully, this one needs nothing.

review/summary: Best Tasting Kashi Bar
review/text: However.....<br />You can get a better price at Target or Walmart....$4.14 for a box of four = Approximately $1.04 a bar.  One drawback to Target and Walmart though is they are frequently out of stock due to being so popular.
