review/summary: Amazing product!
review/text: I rescued a 14 week old puppy the first week of December. They fed him purina puppy at the rescue (who can blame them). After two days he came down with K9 influenza and was on all sorts of medicine. We had to give him water with a turkey baster. After almost a month of pills and force feeding him canned food, he kicked his virus, but because his body was still recovering and he was growing, he needed the best food he could get. I read about Taste of the Wild on a dog food review site and found it at a specialty store near my work. I got him a bag and he went CRAZY! I swear he could smell it through the bag! He now gobbles it down, then drags his dish across the kitchen begging for more! I swear, he can't get enough! This food increased not only his health, but his coat is beautiful, his energy level is back and he is finally acting like the puppy he didn't get to be! I truly believe this food helped him incredible. No fillers, no byproduct, it has everything he needs. Boomer gives it two paws up!

review/summary: Finally a food he will eat!
review/text: I adopted a 10 month old boxer from the pound and learned the hard way just how picky of eaters they can be! When I got him, he was underweight, his coat was just so-so, and his stools were soft-liquid at times. I tried several different brands of food that we had luck with previously, but he just wouldn't eat them. I also discovered that boxers are prone to sensitive stomachs and allergies, especially when it comes to grains. After lots of research, I decided to try TOTW since it was a grain free product with lots of great reviews on multiple sites. After starting him on TOTW, he is finally eating and starting to look healthy! His coat is shiny and soft, his stools are well formed, and he seems to love the food!

review/summary: Best I've found
review/text: When we rescued our shelter dog (a Golden Ret/Border Collie mix), we found he had terrible diarrhea and chewed on himself frequently.  It seemed to be allergies and a sensitive stomach, and he began taking antihistamines and steriods twice a day.  Not knowing whether his allergies were food or environment related, I began to try different foods.  It was more of a challenge because our other dog is a VERY picky eater, and I had been through the food trials with her previously to find a food she would eat, but I had to help the new guy.  After trying a few foods recommended for dogs with allergies, my poor guy broke out in sores, had urinary & anal gland problems, gas, and on-and-off diarrhea.  I went to our local pet food store & spent a couple hours reading tons of ingredients labels & decided to try Taste of the Wild Wetlands formula.  It helped tremendously! The sores he had gotten from lamb, bison, etc. finally started to clear up, he didn't scratch or chew as much, and after about a week, his stomach adjusted and he had the most normal potties he had yet.  I found that he still did chew on himself here and there, so after a month or so, I switched to the Pacific Stream formula and now he's pretty much chew free since then.  During the process, I gradually lessened his medications & stopped them entirely since he's been on this food.  And the bonus is, the picky eater LOVES it and eats a whole bowl every day.  Even better yet, I found this to be very reasonably priced than many other foods, and I would check your local pet store before buying anywhere online;  mine is quite a bit cheaper.

review/summary: Great Dog Food
review/text: I have used this dog food for several years and think that the quality is great being that it is grain-free and uses actual meat for protein.  It is also reasonably priced for the high quality of the food.  My dogs are large breed (90 plus lbs), have great energy levels, shiny coats, and not only smaller stools, but also perfectly formed.  This variety worked especially well for my bulldog who had runny eyes, pretty bad skin allergies on his face and a sensitive stomach which led to runny stools.  While this food did not eliminate his skin allergies completely--it helped enormously with all issues previously mentioned. As for shedding, I did not notice any more or any less shedding using this food compared to others.  Dogs shed and there isn't a complete cure for that:) None of the dogs gained excess weight, keeping in mind that I feed each dog measured quantities per day and usually a touch under the recommended feeding amount on the bag.<br /><br />Love that this food is delivered to my house!

review/summary: Dermatologist Recommended Pet Owner Approved!
review/text: We adopted a 5 year old black lab who was a walking snowstorm of dandruff when we got him.  He had no hair on his belly and a lot missing from the rest of him due to severe untreated allergies.  We started him on this food practically as soon as we got him (less than a month later after seeing our wonderful vet).  First off, he loved this stuff.<br /><br />Otherwise, I could not recommend this more strongly.  My dogs will never eat anything but this again.  We've now had him for almost two years and his hair has returned (he has a bald patch on his belly still, but it is a huge improvement).  His skin is great now and his coat is shiny, he gets compliments all the time.<br /><br />When we were staying with my parents for a while they tried their chihuahua on it, and although the pieces were a little big for him, he seemed to like it more than most foods.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic product at a more expensive price, but I firmly believe it is worth it and that this helped him recover from his allergies (along with proper treatment).  But our dog who was allergic to 33 of the scratch samples no longer requires steroids or any major medication to be our happy and healthy puppy!

review/summary: Very good dog food for the price!
review/text: I know nobody wants to read a wall of text on how good or bad this dog food is, so here is a very brief summary:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Price per pound is very economical. Price is actually much cheaper than lower quality foods such as Eukanuba, Purina, etc. It isn't cheaper than Pedigree, but at the same time it isn't filled with garbage like Pedigree is.<br />2. Dog likes the taste. A lot of my friends feed this to their dogs. I fed it to one of my dogs before. He likes it. My other dog doesn't but he doesn't like any kibble anyways, so it isn't this food's fault.<br />3. Food quality is good. No by-products or corn or any other garbage (like unknown sources of bone and meat meals, etc).<br />4. No more ethoxyquin in any taste of the wild products!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Dogs seem to poop more on this food than other brands such as Orijen or Wellness. Not a lot more though so this isn't really a biggie.<br />2. Made by diamond Pet foods. Not really a biggie either, but diamond pet foods had been plagued with pet recalls problems in the past. Taste of the Wild hasn't had any recalls that I know of, but you're still running a risk, just a really small one.<br /><br />Compared to other brands, this is probably 4 out of 5, but it would be unfair because this brand is much cheaper. Orijen costs almost 2x of what taste of the wild cost.

review/summary: Perfect all natural Dog Food - we pay only $47.00 + tax!
review/text: Priced too high!!!<br />We buy this food at a Feed store and pay $47.00 + tax!<br />Our 6 dogs love this food. We have 3 Chihuahua's 2 Labs and 1 Shepherd mix and they have all done well with it since we discovered about 2 years ago. We've tried other "natural" kibbles but these are the BEST, hands down! Our Chihuahua's like theirs with a little warm water - it really brings out the flavor and they love the gravy!<br />Our Chihuahua's used to have sensitive stomachs but not anymore, all of our dogs have improved skin and they have really soft, shiny fur. You also don't need to feed them as much food as the less nutritious competitor (which contains corn) and they all of them have perfectly formed stools.<br />It's always recommended by your Vet to gradually change your dogs over to a new diet but once you do, you will never need to coax your dog to dinnertime - they'll actually let you know when it's time! We rate "Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food" - especially "Pacific Stream Canine Formula with Smoked Salmon" because it's our dog's favorite as well as ours!

review/summary: Great results for allergies, company said ethoxyquin free
review/text: I have a beagle with bad food allergies, I started a different limited ingredient food and she still had loose stools so I decided to give taste of the wild pacific stream a try. She has no more loose stools and its only been 2 weeks now. This is the first food I tried that helped with that. I can't say how good otherwise because its only been 2 weeks now, but so far so good and I called the company and they do guarantee that it is ethoxyquin free. It is also one of the top foods on dog food analysis. Since she is a beagle and only 25 pounds, I am pleased with the protein amount for a dog her size. The last food she was on was lower protein and some are to high for her size. I made sure this food was ethoxyquin free before I purchased it. She loves it. This is the first time in a year that her stools are formed, and not very loose. I am having her allergy tested in 2 weeks so I will know if its ok for her to stay on this food but so far eliminating grains for her has been great. I won't know the full effect until a few months as far as the itchiness and biting her feet, but so far this is helping her a lot. I will give an update once she is on it longer. I have tried quite a few other limited ingredient foods and allergy formulas and she would vomit and have a ton of itching, but this one she tolerated right away and I weaned her slowly. She is very sensitive to foods.

review/summary: Need to coax dog to eat it, but had no problem switching
review/text: My dog, a half Yorkie half Bichon, recently decided to start being picky about her food.  I tried taking it away when she would it etc, but then she'd end up eating only half her food in a day, and after several days of that (and several months of trying other techniques to get her to eat), I gave up and finally switched foods.  She wasn't happy with anything for more than a few days (dried food, that is), so I decided to try Taste of the Wild's salmon and lamb flavors, since they had lower protein and fat content than the other flavors.  She ate both for a few days, then wouldn't eat it, so I started adding a teaspoon of one of Merrick's canned foods (a super moist one), mixing it all together, and now she loves it (thus I'm taking a star away since she wouldn't eat it plain after a few days).  What I liked about this food is that I was able to switch immediately, no transition period, without a glitch (hey, she wouldn't eat the other food, so I didn't have much choice!).  And, bonus points, her stool is, for the first time in her short year long existence, perfect with this food.  It never was before.  So on the stool count alone, I decided to stick with this. It's been a month and she's still eating it - I give her salmon in the morning and lamb at night, I didn't feel right just feeding her fish and no meat, but am switching the two flavors back and forth hoping the variety keeps her going.  So far so good.  Oh, and I'm not noticing the difference in the coat that others have mentioned, but maybe four weeks isn't a long enough time to notice.

review/summary: shiny coats + no more doggy odors = happy family!
review/text: Our German Shepherd Dogs have really taken to Taste of the Wild (TOTW). Their coats are now gleaming, the perpetual skin issues on one has improved remarkably and our senior dogs are running faster than ever, again. Our eldest had major spine surgery for an injury this summer and has made significant improvements - his mobility returned within a few weeks, which we feel was partially due to feeding him TOTW in addition to some well-researched supplements (turmeric, carnitine, magnesium, alpha lipoic acid, boswelia complex, etc) not normally needed but due to his major injury.)<br /><br />TOTW has totally eliminated destructive chewing / cribbing habits.  The foul doggy stench that developed when we were feeding Purina and Pedigree has now been completely eliminated.  The dogs are happier and we are happier. Thanks!

review/summary: Fine product, but way too fishy smelling!
review/text: I went from the bison formula to this fish one for my 4 month old German Shepherd.  We started at a ratio of new to old being 1:4 for the first 2 days, and then half for a day, and then full out. I thought this transition should be fine since its from the same manufacturer, but boy was I wrong! This was way too fast of a transition and our dog had the runs for many days afterwards. 1.5 weeks later it stiffened up well enough for about 1-2 weeks. However, at the moment she is having the runs again, although I don't think it has anything to do with the food anymore. Out vet claims it is growing pains.<br /><br />Anyway, my biggest problem with this food is its strong fishy smell. Its like you had raw fish sitting out in room temp for a day or so.  Just because this smell factor, I am not going to get this formula again.<br /><br />I'd like to note, I sampled another brand with fish formula, and it had the same problem. So I would assume all the fish formulas do this regardless of brand.<br /><br />I plan to try the venison next.

review/summary: Golden Retriever/Lab mix won't touch it, likes other formulas
review/text: I feed my dog several Taste of the Wild formulas (lamb, bison & venison, wild fowl).  He likes them all except he won't touch the Pacific Stream salmon mix.  If I put one scoop of each formula in four different bowls, the food in three of the bowls will disappear quickly, but the salmon formula just sits there.  The lamb formula appears to be the favorite, followed by bison, then fowl.  Dog is a little over 1 year old, golden retriever/lab mix.  He will gladly eat actual salmon, but not this salmon dog food.

review/summary: Great nutrition and a reasonable price
review/text: I have been feeding my dogs Science Diet for years and finally took the time to research what exactly was in the "vet recommended" (yes, my vet did recommend Science Diet) dog food.  After doing considerable research, I narrowed it down to three dog food brands.  One of which was simply cost prohibitive, the other was Wellness dog food and then Taste of the Wild.  I ordered TOTW for our new Mini Aussie puppy and was very pleased with what I received.  I decided to try Wellness for our three year old Pug who eats just about anything.  After a single feeding of Wellness being mixed into our Pug's Science Diet, he stopped eating and refused to even go near the bowl of food and suffered horrible tummy troubles.  For over a week we could not get him to eat much of anything until I ordered TOTW.  Now he is eating like there was never a problem and loves his new food.  I did some research and apparently others have had similar problems with Wellness dog food.  The ingredients that goes into this dog food, combined with the price that it is offered at, and you have a very good choice for your furry friends.

review/text: My mutt had trouble with dry skin for a long time. We switched to a food with fish in it and that helped considerably, but when we switched to this food it cleared up completely - and she never has any digestive problems with this food.<br /><br />I also like knowing that the food I feed my dog is of higher quality than what I feed myself.<br /><br />If you have a small dog I would be a little careful buying the big bag because I have found that after a while the food can start to smell "off" which I assume means it is going bad. (Which is a good thing! Real food goes bad after a while!)<br /><br />My dog has never had trouble with not liking food, so I can't really say if this is gourmet from a dog taste bud perspective.

review/summary: Loved by my Saint Bernard
review/text: After seeing the energy levels and overall healthiness of sled dogs in Alaska who had a salmon rich diet, I was intrigued.  Granted their calorie needs are off the charts, so something designed for typical canine (or even St Bernard) consumption would be a better route to try.  Thus at first I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QEAV08">Canidae Pure Dry Dog Food, Sea Salmon, 30-Pound Bag</a>.  It was available locally, came with some recommendations (though reading online opinions were all over the map), and I needed to change food for allergy concerns.  Anyway My dog never quite took to it, and we switched to Flint River Ranch.  My dog eats the Flint River food, but he's still loosing weight as he can't eat enough of it.  Thus I'm trying this route, with great success.  He eats whatever he has in front of him, and then he cleans up the crumbs (the smallish and light kibble stick to his jowls and fly out of the bowl).  I couldn't be happier withe behavior like that in the kitchen or the more solid treasures he leaves in the yard.  All in all it's a great food.  A couple other pluses are the nice thick plastic bag and an overall lack of fishy smell.

review/summary: Good for my sensitive stomach dogs
review/text: After learning that California Natural and their company natura had been purchased by proctor and gamble, i immediately went on the search for new food for my 4 sensitive-stomach doberman mixes. All having spent seven years collectively in rescues, they all have stomach issues and after trying 3 other foods for 2 weeks each, Taste of the Wild Pacific Stream Formula was the one they all, but one, have transitioned to. Now after 6 months on this diet, I am extremely happy with their energy level, coat sheen, and they all have a very nice solid pain free movement...and I wish I'd have found this food sooner. This formula was sold as being the best one of their line for sensitive stomach dogs and it has turned out to be true. I like the fact that it is grain free and their stools are much healthier than my one dog who is still on grain food. Good quality food and the price points are great.

I am praying that this continues. . .<br /><br />I did read that anything that has fish meal has ethoxyquin - so I am not thrilled about that.  I have read horrible things about almost every supposed great food though, so I'll keep with this for a little while and then find something w/o fish meal.

review/summary: FOOD RECALL
review/text: Taste of the Wild has recently issued a recall. I ordered this from Amazon and got a tainted bag of food. I am currently on the phone trying to get ahold of the dog food company's customer service. I'll post with an update of what they say to do, and then may contact Amazon. (Hopefully shipping back will not have to happen - the idea of shipping 30lb of dog food does not appeal). In the mean time, hold off on ordering this food until Amazon can assure us that they will not send tainted products. Here is the article about the recall.<br /><br />When Diamond Pet Products recalled their Chicken Soup for the Soul food, I expected a recall of Taste of the Wild to follow. The holistic, grain-free food is made by the same company.<br /><br />And today comes word that, indeed, Diamond Pet Foods has issued a recall of a limited run of Taste of the Wild dry dog food over concerns about possible Salmonella contamination.<br /><br />According to the press release:<br /><br />To determine if your pet food is recalled, consumers should check the production codes on the back of bags. Any production codes that have a number "2" or a "3" in the 9th or 10th digit and an "X" in the 11th digit in the production code should be discarded. The best before dates are December 9, 2012, through April 7, 2013.<br /><br />The recall affects only products distributed in the following U.S. states and Canada. Further distribution to other pet food channels may have occurred.<br /><br />Alabama<br />Florida<br />Georgia<br />Indiana<br />Kentucky<br />Massachusetts<br />Maryland<br />Michigan<br />Mississippi<br />New York<br />North Carolina<br />Ohio<br />Pennsylvania<br />South Carolina<br />Tennessee<br />Virginia<br />Canada<br /><br />Pet owners who are unsure if the product they purchased is included in the recall, or who would like replacement product or a refund, may contact Diamond Pet Foods via a toll free call at 1-866-918-8756, Monday through Sunday, 8 am - 6pm EST. Consumers may also go to diamondpetrecall.com for more information. The company is working with distributors and retailers to ensure all affected product is removed from shelves.

review/summary: Worth it.
review/text: I have a 2 year-old Siberian Husky to whom I fed Eukanuba for her first year of life. She would eat the food but more often than not I had to coax her into it. I would have to add a little something extra to get her to eat, such as: cheese, yogurt, apple sauce, tomato sauce, etc. Even then sometimes she would just lick the extra ingredient off the food and leave the kibble. She would completely miss a meal at least weekly. I eventually learned that the commonly used grains in such foods can irritate a dog's stomach as they wouldn't naturally eat corn or wheat in the wild, so I tried this food.<br /><br />After reading the ingredients label on this product I swear to you I thought: "This reads like something *I* would eat!" There isn't a single ingredient in this food you will not recognize and I was excited to see my dog try it. Needless to say, she absolutely loved it! She likes it so much I occasionally worry she's actually eating TOO FAST. Since I switched she has not missed a single meal in over a year and it takes NOTHING extra to get her to eat. Further, when the bowl is empty she'll spend a good 5 seconds licking it clean.<br /><br />I'm happy to say my 50lbs girl is in excellent health with pearly-white teeth.<br /><br />Now this particular blends main ingredient is salmon but I believe they have others with fowl or bison so you might need to find which one your dog prefers. This food IS more expensive than your standard grocery-store/pet-store food BUT you will have to feed them LESS per meal given the improved nutrition profile. I highly recommend this food for active, medium to large breed dogs.<br /><br />(Edited for typos).

review/summary: Good food (if you hate your dog)
review/text: I love ordering from Amazon, but unfortunately I have nothing good to say about Taste of the Wild dog food. I have been feeding this food to my 3 dogs for several years now, but with the most recent dog food recall affecting TOTW, I am switching to a different brand. Taste of the Wild is made by Diamond, which is famous for pet food recalls. There are plenty of other reasonably priced, high quality, grain-free pet foods on the market, that have NEVER had a pet food recall. No reason for me to continue risking my pet's health by feeding it this garbage. When I contacted TOTW regarding their latest recall, they were rude and dismissive of my concerns. Too bad. TOTW (and all other Diamond products), will no longer receive my business or recommendations. Suggestions: Fromm (never had a recall-in business since 1904), Orijen, Honest Kitchen, Halo, Dr. Harvey's. Try dogfoodadvisor.com when searching for a new food. Lots of reviews and good information.

review/summary: May Have Caused Hives
review/text: I say the food "May" have caused Hives because I cannot be sure it was related to this food but it definitely could have been... My 9 month female boxer first started with tiny bumps which got worse over a period of 3 weeks. Not long after our larger male boxer puppy started getting large Red hives on His face also.<br /><br />The only thing different about their diet was this food. At first we did not think this was from the food (they were on it 2 weeks before any symptoms) and tried every other avenue to locate the cause of the Hives, Bug Bits, Fleas, Recently Washed Bedding Etc...<br /><br />After looking to every other area for the cause and the Hives only getting worse and worse we stopped feeding them this food altogether. It has only been 2 Days since we switched them over to a Natural Balance L.I.T. Allergy Formula and so far the Hives have stopped from getting any worse. Its still too Soon to say for sure this was the cause but at least the Hives seem to be slowing!

review/summary: For a Healthy Dog, Avoid This Dog Food
review/text: One of the ingredients on the label is "Natural Flavors" which is glutamate in hiding.  Glutamate is a neuro toxin which can destroy your dog's health.  The company is very deceptive.  They avoid giving a direct answer.  They call glutamate a vegetable extract which it indeed is, however, when one component is extracted, it creates an imbalance that can be harmful.  I will say this.  My dogs like it, but that is the purpose of glutamate, a flavor enhancer.  Added later:  Why should anything need to be extracted to enhance the flavor of quality food for pets or humans for that matter.  I now make many of my dogs meals from mostly raw ingredients and give them Organix dog food when I need a quick meal.  For those who are concerned about their pet's health, I suggest the book "Natural Health for Dogs and Cats" by Dr. Richard Pitcairn, D.V.M.

review/text: I found this at a local Hannafords supermarket for either $2.50 or $2.70 a bottle, it's hands down the best buy for a bottle of hot sauce.<br /><br />I tried a cap full first, and while it's not the hottest habanero based sauce I've had, it is up there with the most flavorful.  The first time I tried this on some chicken and spanish rice however, I did not think the taste worked out as well on the chicken and rice.  I tried it again on the same kind of chicken and spanish rice, and it was wonderful.  Whether it was something I ate right before or what, I don't know, but I don't think it was a bad bottle as it was excellent plain.<br /><br />I have also tried it on burritos, and that was exceptionally good as well.

Whenever we have pizza this guy is on the table.  Not too hot but the the flavor is great.  This is not a sauce I grab when I am having mexican food or chili.  I use El Yucateco Green Habanero sauce or Dave's Insanity Sauce in chili and usually El Yucateco or Cholula in Mexican food.<br /><br />Having said that, I am a chili head and can't get enough of the heat... this sauce will forever have a place in my fridge.<br />Many have come and gone but this one is a keeper.

review/summary: Yes Yucatan adds Sunshine
review/text: Yucatan Sunshine is the best hot sauce there is in my humble opinion because it gives you the habanero heat yet it's not intolerable. Better yet you get the intensely rich flavor of the habanero pepper and it's sweet, but not sugary and you don't feel the need to add salt either. I grow several varieties of Habanero, chocolates, ghost, heirloom, and Scotch Bonnet Red and Jamaican Giants as well as Tabasco, Jalapeno and Thai chilis. I'm even growing the Bhut jolokia this year. They all go well with Pimiento a mild meaty sweet pepper and make great sauces for pork chicken and fish. Since I never have enough home grown to last until the next season Yucatan Sunshine provides the best alternative for me in heat, in flavor & in fresh taste. Especially on pizza during football season! PEACE.

My husband explained he mixes a cup of regular Breakfast Blend (for the caffeine) with a cup of dark roast (for the flavor), and then he said "Decaf breakfast blend is about as pointless as fat-free ribeye."<br /><br />The Newman's Own decaf and the Green Mountain Vermont Country Blend DECAF (24 K-cups) Keurig were both very good. I can't tell much difference in the taste of those decafs compared to regular coffee.

review/summary: A remarkable product!
review/text: I have been taking care of a stray cat for a little over a year.  Last November ( 2010 ) the cat was attacked by either a hawk or raccoon and its face was seriously wounded and it looked like it would lose its eye.  After reading a book on herbal care I learned that Echinacea/Goldenseal work together as an antiviral/ antibacterial agent so I went on the hunt.  I found this product on Amazon and ordered it right away.  I added 10 drops to wet food twice a day along with 1000 mg l-lysine as per a vet's recommendation.  It was a long cold winter but the cat returned twice a day for its medication.  Eventually after 5 months of regular treatment the wound healed and the cat's eye cleared up.  I do not know if the cat would have survived without this treatment.  I recommend its use to anyone who is working with stray and feral cats that have been wounded or are ill and who do not have immediate access to veterinary care.

review/text: It's almost impossible to find a powder-based blended drink mix that's organic and fair-trade. This one is both, and it works like a charm. You'll need to play a bit with the portioning - in our coffeeshop, we use a single short shot of espresso, plus 2 ounces of milk, and roughly 20 ounces of ice to make a 16 oz. blended drink. Very popular in the 100% mid-Atlantic summers ...

review/summary: No no no no!  How could they go so badly wrong?
review/text: Boy oh boy.  Walden Farms is really a hit and miss operation.<br /><br />I think this stuff is probably my least favorite of their products I've tasted so far.  What makes no sense is that the ingredients that might add alfredo-esque taste, if they would choose to employ them in the recipe, aren't caloric.  Spices and salt would go a long way toward making this stuff edible.<br /><br />I will add that though the sauce is also as thin as h-e-double-hockey-sticks, I can deal with that in a zero-cal food. That's a sacrifice I can live with.  But it's the sickly-sweet flavor and the lack of any sort of savory component that makes this stuff such a startlingly-awful flop.  I suspect there's a whole lotta Splenda goin' on in this stuff.  Give it a pass and just thin out some other bottled "lite" alfredo sauce using fat-free milk.

review/summary: Not truly an "alfredo", but not without merit
review/text: First, this is a zero calorie, diet product.  I think anyone purchasing this product must fully understand that concept before tasting it.  It WILL NOT taste like the thick, rich alfredo sauce you'd get in a restaurant or make yourself.<br /><br />Ok, with that out of the way, the consistency is a bit thin but not water-thin.  Tasted on its own, out of the jar, its oddly sweet and not entirely good, but not entirely bad either.  It has tremendous potential to be improved with spices and some other small additions.  I warmed up the sauce with some sauteed (in PAM) onions, garlic powder, salt, black pepper and a bit of parmesan cheese.  The cheese helped thicken the sauce and bit and the pepper and onions definitely improved the flavor.  I served the sauce over spaghetti squash and it was delicious and fulfilling.  So, 3 stars since its not that great out of the box, but has tremendous potential for a low-calorie sauce option.<br /><br />As a baseline for those reading my review and deciding whether to purchase this particular Walden Farms product, I've tried MANY of their products and LOVE the pancake syrup, strawberry syrup, chocolate syrup, caramel syrup, honey dijon dressing, creamy bacon dressing, thousand island dressing.  I hated the marshmallow dip, the ranch dressing.  I really like the BBQ sauce, the chocolate dip and the caramel dip.  The mayo has a scary consistency but is a good "extender" for smaller servings of regular mayo or when mixed into a tuna salad.  I've tried many other dressings and liked them just fine, but the others weren't "stand outs" in any way.<br />Happy dieting!

review/summary: Eh. It's OKAY
review/text: Alfredo sauce is mostly cheese and cream based anyway so the "zero carb" selling point, while true, does not justify the high price tag in my opinion. Most any Alfredo sauce should be low carb in the first place. The reason why most aren't is because the thickness in Alfredo sauce comes from flour or wheat flour to give it that heartiness we're used to.<br /><br />This product doesn't contain flour so it's a lot thinner than traditional Alfredo sauce would otherwise be and is pretty much cream, cheese, and a bunch of spices. The funny part is that Alfredo Sauce is typically used with pasta which is chock full of carbs so you're really not going to gain any "low carb" points by using a sauce that has 0 grams on a bowl of pasta that has 100 grams.<br /><br />In terms of taste? This product, like many other diet products, tastes "off." You'd probably be able to tell it was trying to mimic alfredo sauce but you'd know something wasn't quite right about it. It's not a bad taste but like other reviewers have said it's kind of a strong, tangy, and in many ways synthetic taste.<br /><br />It's not great, bottom line, and Walden Farms makes some other really good products so personally I would skip this one. That being said it is truly a dieters product with zero carb, calories, fat, etc... so with that in mind it's not a BAD product when you consider it doesn't contain all the stuff that usually makes food taste good :-)

review/text: Like all this food, it doesn't taste like the memory you have of the food in your head. You are looking at this because you want to cut calories. So be ready for food that tastes like the calories are cut.<br /><br />Having said that, if you saute this with some garlic and black pepper, its really good. Tonight I had it with tofu noodles, chicken, broccoli and red pepper. I cooked it with some garlic, an onion and some black pepper. My husband tried it and thought it was great, and he usually doesn't like the this stuff.<br /><br />Use it as an ingredient instead of a stand alone sauce and you will find a ton of uses. But use it as a sauce alone and you will be disappointed. I find that is true with all Walden Food products. But I have been eating this with a low calorie diet and have lost 45 pounds in three months. Give it a try, be willing to experiment. You won't be disappointed.

That's when I decided to do a web search on the company and I found that a news channel in NY had Eat Rite pizzas lab tested, and found that the nutritional info was way off.<br /><br />No wonder these pizzas were so good... it's because they are just "real" pizzas.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

One she wouldn't go near, and the other she would eat reluctantly.  Except the super active, petite 7lb 4oz tortie grew to just over ten pounds, waddled when she walked, because she was horribly obese, and slept 24 hours a day, waking up only to eat, and her coat was staritng ot lose it's shine.  That scared the hell out of me!  So I switched back to Hills.  With a week, she was starting to show interest in toys again, and was already starting to lose that swaying flabby fat belly.  Now she's back down to 7lb 7oz, and very active, healthy, and happy.  I will NEVER switch her food again!

review/summary: Expensive, but it worked!
review/text: I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with "meal" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.

review/summary: Great for pukey cat
review/text: My cat was born in August 2001, so he's almost 10 years old. Three years ago he started to throw up quite frequently. The vet ran tons of VERY EXPENSIVE tests and for the most part ruled out anything that can be treated. We tried changing food but nothing worked. I tried giving him home cooked food as well and that made throwing up even worse. So one day I was in a pet store and the clerk said he had the same problem with his cat and suggested the MOST EXPENSIVE FOOD IN STORE. I was skeptical but I had nothing to lose (but money). Three years later my cat is doing fantastic. He only throw up when I feel bad for him and give him tuna as a pity treat. He's healthy, bouncy and seems to enjoy food. The big bag lasts us for ever. We bought a bag on November 5th and today again on March 19. That's 4+ months for $40 (which is how much the bag costs in pet store). I think I can afford $10/month for my buddy. I have no idea what's in there and I don't really care. All I care is that my cat looks happy and healthy. Food purists who believe in feeding cat organic chicken and brown rice might not care for it.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: stops fecal balls
review/text: My eight month old kitty, Jitterbug came to us eating Science Diet and everything was fine.  I slowly switched him over to Purina indoor, which I've always fed my cats and had no problems with.  Well I started noticing Jitterbug was leaving small little balls of poo all over the house!  Instead of taking him to the vet and paying a lot of money on tests I thought I'd try this expensive food first and what do you know, no more poop balls!  It's too bad it's so pricey, but if I don't have to deal with feces outside the litter box, I'll pay top dollar.  My cat has been on this formula for a month now and I'm very pleased with the results.

review/summary: Worth the money!
review/text: Our cat was a stray that showed up at a friend's farm.  He was in very bad shape...very skinny, lethargic, and his fur was very wiry!  We got him on the mend with a visit to the vet and some antibiotics.  But it wasn't until we started feeding him Science Diet that we noticed the change in his fur.  It made such a vast difference!  He has the softest fur I have ever felt on a cat!  The Science Diet seems to help with the hairballs, too.  It is a bit expensive, but it's worth every penny to me.

review/summary: Helps my cat's teeth
review/text: I'm not thrilled about the fillers and ground meal stuff in it as a food.  I try to look for better ingredients.  However, my vet said my cats had some tartar and sore gums.  I started mixing this stuff in with their regular food, and now (2 years later) my oldest is 4 with healthy teeth and gums.  I saw improvement in just a month or so.  Now looking at several annual visits in a row with good dental health and no tooth brushing.  Kitties seem to like it.  Healthy weight cats with dry food to graze on all they want.  I order from petfooddirect though.  When you consider the shipping costs, it's usually a little cheaper there unless amazon has it for free shipping.

review/summary: Great product, but trust your vet not the hype
review/text: I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.

review/summary: Sickening filler ingredients, high price
review/text: I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to "see the light" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.

review/summary: Science Diet = terrible for cats, it's addictive
review/text: My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because "it's good for the cats and they love it". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to "fatten her up" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.

All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: Just started using this so will update more later, I have an older cat 15 years old, everything she ate she would throw up she pretty much grew up on Iam's Weight Control cat food due to a previous urinary tract infection,and a weight problem (vet recommended) she weighed in at 17 lbs her heaviest the Iams never helped for years for weight control.Later in life she started losing the weight got down to a perfect weight then really started to lose to much then the last bag of Iams I bought her she refused to eat but a couple of kibbles a day, she was starving herself to death because even then she was throwing up,(she went down to 7lbs) I bought the Science Diet Sensitive stomach she is finally eating again, not throwing up so the food is A-OK with me and will spend the price for it, but like I said just starting using it will update on how she does more in to eating the food. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is the price and since I ordered this food online maybe finding the product in the stores around here I live very rural so getting to a store is a chore in itself at times.

review/summary: Nothing else works
review/text: I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat.

review/summary: My cat loves this cat food
review/text: My cat loves this cat food so much that we feed it to her as treats. She has a tendency to get underweight so we feed it to her pretty much on demand (which is frequently). I'd recomend it for fussy cats with tooth tartar problems (the chucks are larger than normal cat food and presumably help to clean their teeth when they crunch it). I usually buy the larger size for economy's sake, but this would be a better size to try out on your cat.

I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet.

I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing.

No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever.

review/summary: Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!
review/text: This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.

review/summary: The only food I give my cats!
review/text: My cats have been on Hill's Science Diet since they came home as kittens. This food is great and keeps them very healthy, it's what the vet has always recommended and I've stuck with for my cats. I get the big bag because it's easier to store it in a large air-tight container near their food and not have to worry about buying food every other week or so. So glad to see this on Amazon Prime now, I used to have to go out of my way to speciality pet stores just to get it as places like PetCo out here don't always carry it.

review/summary: Works Great With My Cat
review/text: I've had several cats, most of which didn't have much of a hairball problem.  However, the cat I have now, has hocked up some epic hairballs. She's the best cat I've ever had, except for this one nasty problem.<br /><br />So, I bought a small bag of this hairball control from my vet, tried it, and it does seem to have had an effect on my cat's massive hairball problem.  In fact, after about a month of mixing this with her other food, I've noticed that she's only thrown up once or twice, and that's certainly not as much as she did before.<br /><br />I found this bag on Amazon for quite a bit less than what my vet charged, so I'll continue to order it here. Based on what I've observed with my cat so far, I would highly recommend this for those of you who have cats with the same problem.

He absolutely loves it and I won't be changing brands or food anytime soon. It seems to be a very high quality dry cat food and it's definitely one that my cat loves. The big bag of food is great especially if you have large Rubbermaid (etc) containers to store it in so it doesn't get stale. I'm very happy with this food and I'm very glad the shelter (and my vet) ended up recommending it. My cat is happy and I'm happy knowing he is being fed appropriately with high quality food that is helping him stay healthy.

review/summary: Thank God I found this food!
review/text: We have 2 cats, one of which started having stomach issues about a month after she traveled eight hours and moved into our house. We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again. So I'll say it again: thank goodness for this food!!!

review/summary: Best for Dental Health
review/text: The vet showed me that my 14-year-old cat's teeth and gums were in bad shape. Her teeth were stained and layered with plaque. Her guns were bright red along the edges. She had Gingivitis. I was facing a $300+ teeth cleaning bill for the cat. The vet recommended I try Hill's Dental Diet first. After two months of eating it, the cat returned to the vet. The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy. The Hill's large nuggets act like a tooth brush that scrapes against the cat's teeth.<br /><br />Pound per pound this cat food is actually less expensive than those little bags of tarter control cat treats you buy in the supermarket. Once you get control over your cat's dental problems you can maintain her by giving her several Hill's Dental Diet nuggets a day. If your cat has no problems yet, consider giving her a small handful of Hill's Dental nuggets to ward off any future problems. This stuff works!
