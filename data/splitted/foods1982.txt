review/summary: My cat goes crazy over this stuff.
review/text: Out of all of the various types of cat food I've bought, the Tuna and Bonito is definitely the best for my cat.<br />He likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken</a> more, but given an equivalent amount of this BFF vs the Chicken, he tends to stay happier longer.  He tends to beg for food, and after eating this, he won't beg for almost the full 12 hours between feedings (vet's orders!), while with many other foods, he'll start begging way before that.

review/summary: BFF is better food than some and not as expensive as others
review/text: I did place an order with Amazon for this particular item, but it was canceled because the supplier at the time was not able to provide it (it was not PetFoodDirect - I have had excellent service from them through Amazon).  I managed to order the 4Eva through another source, and the kitties like it.  It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices.

review/text: After reading the other review for this wonderful cat food,I wondered why the previous reviwer had decided to give it less than 5 stars? She mentioned that her cat didn't care for the salmon in it, however, the concept of the food is excellent. Well, yes, I agree, although, I would have given this excellent cat food the highest rating. My cats, all 5 of them, love all the flavors of this brand. And they are very finicky too.<br />I hope they introduce even more flavors of this ultra healthy brand of feline food in the future.

You can actually see yummy chunks of chicken in the chicken recipes and smell the fish in the fishy recipes. So far my cats have tried the following recipes and they loved each and every one just as much as the other.<br /><br />Tuna and Chicken 4Eva<br />Tuna and Tilapia Twosome<br />Tuna and Bonito Be Mine<br />Tuna and Salmon Soulmates<br />Tuna and Chicken Chuckles<br />Tuna and Chicken 4Eva<br /><br />I highly recommend this to any person that loves their cats.

review/summary: My Cats Refuse To Eat It
review/text: My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment). My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it. One of them ate a bit of Tuna & Chicken Chuckles and threw it up and the other just refused to touch it. My cats are really picky, though. I'll donate the rest of the case of this to my local shelter where I'm sure the kitties will find it a glorious treat and get my feline food critics something else.

review/summary: Nothing but sub-standard tuna from Thailand
review/text: Read the labels before you buy. All the flavors of BFF list the following two ingredients at the top of their lists: Tuna & water. Every can is just low quality, dark gray, shredded tuna.  The company adds a trace of other ingredients so they can claim to have several flavors, but don't fall for their tricks! Rather, when you want to give your kitty some tuna for a treat, just feed him/her some regular tuna--the good kind humans eat.  Not only is it far superior quality, but it's cheaper, too!

review/text: My cat Joshua is 13years old, he has been with me through thick and thin, good times bad times, you name it. When times were hard, he had to rough it with cat food from the ninety nine cents store, no complaints he ate it up. Lately times have been good so I wanted to buy him something special hence my decision to buy Best Feline Friend, Talk about a emotionally based decision!! this stuff is horrible!! it truly smells worse than any cat food I have ever come across not to mention the fact that he will not even come near the stuff, one whiff and he is walking in the opposite direction. This stuff may be good for cats but if they don't even want to eat it, whats the point? Here's some advice save your money and buy your cat what is good for them but at the same time something they enjoy, that's what your best feline friend deserves, not this stuff.

review/summary: Finally a real gluten-free all purpose flour
review/text: With a husband who has been on a gluten-free diet for twenty years, I've tried just about every alternative I could find to substitute for "all purpose flour" in traditional recipes, including mixing my own from a vast array of other flours. Some were OK, some failed in texture, some failed in taste, some were downright inedible.  With Beth's Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour, I've finally found a product that works in most of the cookies, tea breads, muffins, and so on that we all enjoy, and is also affordable for everyday use.  It can be substituted in an equal quantity just about anywhere a recipe calls for "all purpose flour" - obviously you'll need to experiment if you use it for yeast breads.  Oh, and by the way, it doesn't taste "gluten-free".  We had a very merry Christmas at our house!

review/text: This flour tastes great, but doesn't seem to have the best result when used by itself.  I had high hopes after reading the reviews and my first attempt - pie crust - was a flop...the dough wouldn't stay together to even think about rolling it out...so I patted it into the pan and it tasted good - just crumbled.  I then tried it in crepes and added xanthum gum and it seemed better, but still not great.  My best success with it has been using 1/2 this and 1/2 Bob's red mill GF baking flour, along with some xanthum gum.  The results are terrific - great taste and texture!!

review/summary: Decent Flour Replacement
review/text: My little boy has been diagnosed with several very severe food allergies in the last few months.  Gluten is one of them.  I am an avid baker.  I love to make biscuits and breads, cakes and cookies.  These things have been a challenge.  This flour does not completely take that away.  The recipe on the back of the box was wonderful the moment that it came out of the oven, but did not keep well. Although, it may do great if you are able to follow it exactly.  His other allergies prevent me from doing so. He is also severely allergic to egg and milk products.  I have found that I can combine this flour with oat flour and get a really great consistency and make just about any baked goods that I might want!  I highly recommend this product.  With a little experimentation it has become a regular staple in our house!<br /><br />Note:  If you're looking at this product you may have just been diagnosed with a food allergy or have a family member who has been.  I just want to say, you can do this. It can be really discouraging and overwhelming, but there are so many of us out there who do it every day. Believe me...if I can do it, so can you!

You can usually find it in bulk at big grocery stores for $0.60-1.20 per pound. The other listed ingredients: potato starch, tapioca starch, and guar gum can also be purchased in bulk here on Amazon.<br /><br />If you go to this extra effort, your $23 will go from 6 pounds of baking flour to 30.

review/text: I was very excited to see this product on amazon, and it was prime eligible! Many of my family members have a severe gluten allergy and I was excited that this Christmas we could sit down and celebrate with cookies/cakes/pies/etc. However, when the boxes arrived I saw on the bottom, in bold, "may contain traces of soy." This was not mentioned anywhere on the product description or nutrition facts. Many of my family members also have a sever soy allergy, and this "may" prevented us from being able to use the mix and therefore I have 6 unopened boxes that Amazon will not let me return.<br /><br />If the Gluten-Free Pantry bills itself as caring about food allergies, perhaps they should make sure they list every single ingredient on their product page so we can make a clear, educated choice when buying.

review/text: I tried this flour today for crepes.  And they came out fantastic.  The texture is so good that my family and friends did not even realize they were made with gluten free flour.  I read another review here that crepes are not coming out good.<br />Here is my receipe to try.<br />3 eggs, 1/4 cup agave nectar, 1/4 cup vegetable oil - beat on medium until well blended.  Add 1/2 cup of this flour, 1 cup of skim milk, teaspoon of vanilla extract - beat very well until fully blended.  Refrigirate for 30 minutes to let the batter settle and bubbles dissolve.  If consistency is too thick you can add more milk until you get a nice runny batter.<br />This flour has so much rice in it that sometimes your batter will get thicker after it rests.  So it's important to check it after resting to make sure it's thin enough to make thin fluffy crepes.<br />You can also add to the same receipe about 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  They will be even more delicious.

review/text: My daughter has recently discovered that she is wheat/gluten intolerant, so we are very new to the gluten free world.  We recently purchased the Gluten Free Pantry All Purpose Flour, mostly because on the box it says that you can use it in your favorite recipes, substituting 1 cup of GFPAPF for 1 cup of regular flour.  When we tried doing that, with a basic baking powder biscuit, we discovered that the bread came out very crumbly and was difficult to eat.  Today, I made a loaf of yeast bread with one of the boxes, using my recipe, but adding the eggs and cider vinegar.  It came out very nice, although it didn't rise very much.  When it was cool, it held together enough to package it and take it to my daughter.  It seemed to be much less crumbly than the biscuits we tried, I believe it was because we used the eggs and cider vinegar.  This was an all right flour, but I think that we will keep looking.

Granted, I don't do a lot of breads, but for general cooking and light baking this flour is wonderful.<br /><br />I think it makes a wonderful coating for frying specifically. Tastes wonderful as can be! I've done banana bread with this as well that even my non-GF friends beg me for!<br /><br />The price isn't bad all things considered, especially when you subscribe and save! This is the go to flour in my GF kitchen!

review/text: I have been searching for a premixed affordable GF flour for 2 years and have found it! This product made great GF donuts for my son this morning, it was easy to use and the price was reasonable. I have been mixing my own GFF and just dont have great results every time. Now I can whip up a batch of what ever he is missing from the wheat days.

review/text: Recently found this product after finding out I was gluten-intolerant. This is a great way to start if you do like to bake but do not want to take on buying all the ingredients needed to bake gluten-free. The box does not last long but so far this has worked well in all the usual recipes I cooked with when I was using regular flour.

review/text: I've been gluten free for 4 years, and I have a son who has been gluten free for 9 years and another son who has been gluten free for 2 years (we're all celiac disease).  This is the only all-purpose flour I'll buy. You can use it to convert any non-gluten free recipe you have and my non-celiac friends are surprised when I eat what I bring because they would never guess that it's gluten free.  Other flours have made the product crumble, but not Beth's.

review/summary: Delicious, Vegan, GELATIN FREE gummy candies!
review/text: These help make the transition from gelatin candies and other animal-based products soo wonderful!<br /><br />They taste fabulous, not overwhelmingly sugary like regular candies.  There is an excellent balance of sweet, fruit, gummy texture/mouth feel that makes you feel like you are really treating yourself!  They taste more natural and such.  The gummy swirls are these delicious candies shaped like DOTS gummy candy.  They are coloured swirls with a textured coating.  These are firmer than regular gelatin candy but chew quite nicely.  Super yummy!<br /><br />The gummy bears and worms may provide a more similar gelatin candy mouth feel but I haven't tried them.  They look like regular gelatin candy while these look different.  ***The gummy worms (and probably regular bears) are NOT vegan.<br /><br />The sour gummy bears are vegan.  These are really good, too.  Highly recommended!  Remember to check the back of the package.<br /><br />I was hesitant that non-gelatin candy could adequately replace gelatin candy but it absolutely impressed me!<br /><br />There are two servings per bag at 120 calories each.  All in all, if you eat the whole bag, it's not super bad.  Since they are vegan, you avoid all the potentially bad things in regular candy.<br /><br />For those making the challenging transition from using animal-based products and other non-organic, paraben, SLS laced products, this really helps you feel like you are missing nothing at all.  If anything you feel better knowing what you aren't putting in your body!<br /><br />Each small step you take adds up and makes a difference.  The totality of each informed and conscious purchase you make for your food, skin and body is worth it and feels good.  Eventually you won't believe how easy it is to live this way and how much you can still have!  The process of finding products is daunting at first but it truly does get easier!

Overall, it's a good choice when you want something sweet but don't want to kill yourself from  sugar overload.<br /><br />I'm finding that I'll eat about a half dozen (or 1/3 of a pack) and my sweet craving is satisfied - much better than regular commercialized food that encourages you to keep eating!

Not only did Spice my 2 year old devoured it but even my picky girl Sugar ate the whole thing after we cracked it in half... it was like the frosting was something she didn't understand. It made for great video when they were trying to get it off of the roofs of their mouths...this made 4 mini loafs and would have made 8 cup cakes. The frosting set up great when I put them in the fridge on the plates after decorating. Would recommend for anyone who wants something special for their k9 friends but doesn't want to do it from scratch. Note not a real "people" cake... trust me I tasted the frosting and you would need to add SUGAR to both the cake and frosting before you could eat them. lol WHAT like you never tasted dog food!

review/summary: Good Brand - No So Good Cereal
review/text: I like most of this company's line a lot. But this one has some problems. The first reviewer talked about there being little chocolate. Well, I found plenty of chocolate, but it wasn't very good. Poor texture and a sort of waxt taste. More important, there's something in it that feels like large grit. I can only imagine that it's the pears, cut a bit close to the core. I haven't picked it apart to see what it is, because I don't much care, and it puts me off of buying any more. (That's with milk.) So, not their best effort, I'm afraid. Somehow, I don't think it's going to be much of a success. The indulgence of chocolate sure doesn't go with the gritty texture of what else is in there. Probably the #5 is a better alternative if you want chocolate.

review/text: This Muesli brand as a whole is way overpriced IMHO and this flavor, even at the discounted "manager special" price was too darn much for 3 small bags.  It had flakes, oats and these chewy, small, square pear things that were dusted with chocolate but turning white.  Unappetizing and almost revolting.  I don't know if I got a bad batch but as soon as you put on milk it was a brownish soggy mess, very little chocolate (just the dusting on the pears) and well...just..."off". I even tried it as a dry snack and after my first bite, no more.  It's my first experience with this Muesli and probably my last.  I don't recommend at all.

review/text: I love this floral and earth tea experience. I contacted Tea Life to find out how best to brew this tea and was surprised at the friendly expert advice I received from the owner William. He generously walked me through the proper steeping times and pointed me at some equipment that I would want to invest in. I hope everyone does business with this company! I point all of my tea drinking friends to his market place here on Amazon.<br /><br />This particular puer is more enjoyable than some of the older raw puer teas that I've had. It has a potential to become a bit tannic if you don't follow strict rinsing and steeping times, and measure your temperatures before brewing. If you do these things, this tea is IMMENSELY enjoyable. It's even great if you don't! Grassy, hay, horse blanket on the palate, with rose, jasmine and alfalfa on the nose.

review/text: I'd like to start off by saying I love Slim Jims and particularly the spicy varieties. I don't know what happened here, these were definitely not what I'm used to from Slim Jims. First there was no "snap" as you bite into the casing. Instead it was very mushy and I routinely squished the slim jim before I even could get them out of the wrapper. And probably worse still it just didn't taste very good. I didn't find it particularly spicey at all. Not even in the lots of spices, but not burn your mouth, kind of way. And the flavor was just not there. It didn't taste bad, but I would have much prefered regular Slim Jims to these supposedly Jerk flavored sticks.

review/summary: Surprisingly good taste.
review/text: If you like Chamomile tea you'll love this. On Davidson's Website they describe the taste of Tulsi as: "a delicate yet invigorating flavor that is subtly minty, somewhat buttery, and mildly floral with a natural sweetness." I can't agree more. The taste puts a new spin on an already great tasting Chamomile tea. It is fairly strong and a little goes a long way. The picture they have posted shows exactly what this tea looks like. I don't like my tea very sweet and this blend by Davidson's is on the sweet side so I don't add much if anything at all to sweeten it.

review/text: I am a big fan of chamomile tea.  I didn't pick up on the fact that this product also included other ingredients like rosehips and lemon myrtle.  I like plain chamomile so if I'd noticed these other ingredients I might not have ordered this product, but I'm very glad I did try this because it is the best chamomile tea I've ever had.  I make iced and hot chamomile.  This is a wonderful product for anyone who loves chamomile tea and the quanity in this bag is fabulous for the cost.  The shipping was fast.  This will be the place where I get my tea from now on.

review/summary: good but generic fruit-flavor tea
review/text: I admit I bought this because it was on sale (only $9 for 6 boxes!) and because I'd read generally positive reviews of Dilmah teas.  It seemed worth trying, anyway.  It's a pretty good tea with a generic fruity flavor to it that isn't identifiable as anything in particular -- the label says strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry flavors.  I'm guessing it makes a good iced tea although I've only tried it hot so far.  I'm sure I'll finish up the carton but probably won't re-order this since I really prefer my fruit teas with more distinctive flavors.

I have had a hell of a time finding it in the stores is why I had to revert to finding it on the internet. Take my word for it that it is worth it (a little to pricey if you do not get enough for free shipping) but even worth it if you have to pay the shipping as the crap that there selling in the stores is not worth buying at all.

review/summary: not easy to chew
review/text: I like the standardized size of pieces and their great taste. I like how buffalos are protected against hormones, etc and are grass fed on ranges which should positively impact their omega 3 content? The only problem I have, which might be critical to some people, is the need to spit out so much of unchewable bits of each piece. I suppose it indicates minimal processing which is a good thing, but I can't eat them unless I'm alone and near a waste container to spit out the parts that can't be chewed.

review/text: I was trying these as a change of pace from the Turkey Jerky I normally eat.  They taste ok (nothing special), but several of the medallions (in at least 3 bags so far) had 'crunchy' bits in them.  I suspect it was gristle, or possibly small bone fragments.  Not pleasant to eat.<br /><br />I may have just gotten a bad batch (other than the crunchy bits, I'd give these a 4 star rating).

review/summary: Unpleasant
review/text: I gave this product two stars because the minimum is one star (which I consider to be a zero). So, it gets one star for being an okay texture. That's it. It has a sour, bitter, unpleasant flavor. And there's a good reason for this. It doesn't taste like chocolate. Oh, I know it says on the box it's made with Hershey's. That's probably true. But it's Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. This frozen confection tastes like frozen chocolate syrup. Now, chocolate syrup is fine in its place in chocolate milk or an egg cream. But it isn't something I enjoy eating by itself.<br /><br />That said, I try to be fair. I have known one or two people over the years who do like eating pure chocolate syrup. If you are one of those people, this confection is for you.

review/text: Till min stora f&ouml;rv�ning! Wild Swedish Lingon, sold on-line by a company named MexGrocer!  How do you say "bravo!" in Swedish? You say "bravo!"<br /><br />This seems to be nostalgia week among my amazoo friends, with reviews of coffee and soaps and suntan lotions. So what makes me nostalgic? Lingon, of course! Though "hjortron" (cloudberries) will do just as well.<br />Non-Swedes tend to think of lingon only as a jam to spread on bread. In Sweden, lingon are the natural accompaniment for mashed potatoes; you can buy a cone of mashed potatoes with lingon at the late night fast food stands. The Swedes who colonized Delaware and New Jersey were so eager to replace the lingon in their diet that they picked the nasty, bitter wild cranberries, mixed them with sugar, and invented an American tradition. But "believe you me" cranberry sauce is no match for real lingon as a relish for roast meats.

We bought a couple of jars from the restaurant.  When we ran out, I was able to find it through Amazon.  Amazing!  I haven't tried any other brand, so can only recommend this brand.  We love it on hot biscuits, but it can be served with practically anything.  Serving suggestions are on the label.  It's slightly tart - so not over sweet like jam/jelly.  I will continue to buy as long as Amazon will have it available.

The price was a little higher than I paid in the Commissary, but worth every penny. If you like a little less sweet preserves and jams,this is the choice for you.

review/text: As soon as I heard the health benefits on Dr. Oz I went right to my laptop to order. I purchased the 11 pound bucket {Rolands}which was an excellent buy. When it came I thought OMG it's such a big bucket!  Well soon as I tasted it I fell in love with lingonberries.<br />I took ordinary Premium crackers spread a little cream cheese and half a spoon of the lingonberries on top. Once you taste it you wanna have more and more. Love the flavor and the cream cheese was great with it. I had to fill a jar with some and not have to keep taking the bucket out of the refrigerator. Can't wait to taste this with chicken and pork etc.  I live at the NJ shore near the big cranberry bogs. But I am enjoying the lingonberries as they are much more delicious and I get all the added antioxidants which is important to me as a cancer survivor.<br /><br />I have been recommending it to my friends.

review/text: I noticed lingonberries were recommended by Dr. Oz with a number of healthy properties and ordered two different preserves. The other was twice the price of this but the taste was the same and this one had less water; basically sugar juice, in it. I'd be happy with either but given the large price difference I'll reorder this one. The taste was excellent. I always prefer less added sugar and would wish for even less but this is delicious, has a nice fresh taste, too.

review/text: I purchased 2 jars of this jelly after seeing this berry on the Dr. Oz show,  my husband and i loved the taste and used it on toast put it in our cottage cheese etc.  We finished the first jar and started on the second jar when I started having swelling in my hands and then hives broke out over my entire body, I went to the doctor and he put me on prednisone but the hives kept coming I also went to a natural path tech and they discovered that there was a pesticide in the jelly that I was extremely allergic too.  Word of warning if you have sensitive to any food allergies or allergies period I would not recommend trying this product, I am on week two after I have stopped eating it and it is still trying to rid my body.  It was so bad I had pains in my chest and with heart problems in my family I went to the ER just last week thank goodness it wasn't my heart however it might be my gallbladder? I have never wrote a review on anything before but I also have never had a food reaction like this before so i wanted to pass this on to prevent anyone from going through what I did.

review/text: A package of this soup costs almost $4 at our local grocery store.  Being in a pinch, I needed soup and it was on sale.  The family could hardly eat it because the soup was so salty.  To be clear, I bought Williams regular Tortilla soup, which is not currently sold on Amazon, but notice the caption on reduced packages reads as follows, "50% less sodium than an average of regular Country Store Soups."  I could not find this soup's reduced salt content anywhere online, but after taking a mouthful of the regular soup, I had to look at my package--a whopping 1220 mg!  I can only imagine other Country Store soups are equally as high, if not more, in salt content.  50% less than that average still seems over the top and very unhealthy.<br /><br />Had this not been so salty, the soup would have had good flavor, although it is basically a base mix needing additional ingredients to make it look anything like the package picture.  Considering how easy soup is to make, home-made is definitely the healthier and cheaper way to go.  I won't buy this brand again.

review/summary: Beautiful designs for your cakes, cookies, etc.
review/text: All of the Luck's edible images are beautiful, and they work exceptionally well on fondant, gum paste, buttercream, royal icing.  I've even used them on white chocolate.  I've never had a problem with the Luck's Edible Images arriving dried out or broken.  (But you must keep the images in their foil package when they're not in use; otherwise, they will dry out.)  These images don't come with instructions, so if you do not have experience with edible images, you'll have to do some online research about using them on cakes or cookies.  For basic cake decorating, roll out a large piece of fondant, drape it over your iced cake, and smooth and trim the fondant all around the cake.  Then, slightly moisten the fondant using a paint brush and water ONLY at the points on the fondant where the edible image will cover.  (You don't want to get the water on the areas of the fondant that will not have the edible image covering.)  Peel off your edible image, wrap it around the side of the cake or place it on top of the cake, and voila!, you have a decorated cake.
