review/summary: Absolutely delightful!
review/text: The idea of chocolate granola was a new one, and I wasn't sure, despite loving chocolate, that this was going to be a hit, but its perfect.  Small chunks of dark chocolate mixed in the granola at just the right proportion means intense chocolate flavor mixed with the flavor of the toasted oats.  With ice cold milk, it was almost like a milk shake!<br /><br />This is going to be one of those items that frequently appear on our table-its a great treat!

review/summary: Good for snacking
review/text: The granola itself is fairly unsweet but the abundant semi-sweet chocolate chunks provide an overall appropriate sweetness and a chocolate flavor that is not overpowering.  I'm not into chocolate cereal, so I didn't try it with milk, but it quickly disappeared as a snack when left on the counter (I didn't even get to finish it).

review/text: I must say this is some very tasty stuff!!!  I love chocolate anyway and combining it with the "grains" sounds good to me...and it is!!  The only problem I have with the product is that it's too "crummy".  It's like a bag of crumbs.  No "bite size" here...  but it is delicious.  I even sprinkled some on my morning cereal..mmmm!

review/summary: More a snack food than a cereal
review/text: Chocolate indeed! Lots of decent quality chocolate bits mixed with a basic granola. So much chocolate in fact that it's more a trail mix or snack food than a cereal.<br />No 'bad' stuff like hydrogenated oils here either. This is a quality food and the price reflects that. It's a bit too pricey for my wallet, but you get what you pay for. If you can afford it, buy it, you shouldn't be dissappointed.

review/summary: Great enough to eat plain!
review/text: Sure you could put it in milk and eat it like cereal, sprinkle it as a topping on ice cream or fro-yo, but it is perfect enough to snack right out of the bag.  I love how sweet it is.  I am not a fan of dry-barely-sweet granola but the gooey sugary stuff marketed toward children isn't great either (I'd rather eat a cookie or cake).  This hits that midpoint that is perfect when craving a sweet snack (without going for a full-fledged dessert).  The chocolate is perfect and sweet without being bitter like found in many healthier snacks.<br /><br />Nice perk... the zipper closure at the top.  I can never seem to find a "Chip Clip" in my house when I need one though I have bought dozens.

review/summary: Decent as a yoghurt topping
review/text: I'm not a granola eater -- it tends to be too high calorie and processed to be a healthy breakfast for me as I watch my weight<br /><br />So I ordered "Chocolate Delight Granola" to check it out as a snack. The pieces are too little to make an easy snacking food, but the flavor is nicely balanced -- it's not overwhelmingly chocolate-y.<br /><br />I finally found a good use for this granola as a yoghurt topping. My recipe:<br /><br />Stir together these ingredients:<br />1/2 cup plain yoghurt<br />1 tablespoon honey<br />2 tablespoons roasted wheat germ<br /><br />Top with:<br />1/4 cup Chocolate Delight Granola<br /><br />The granola adds textural interest to the yoghurt while not being overwhelmingly sweet.

review/summary: Messy but tasty
review/text: Back to Nature's Chocolate Delight Granola is pretty straightforward stuff -- basically just oat clusters and chocolate chunks, with some sweeteners and oils thrown in. So, if you like oats and chocolate (I do!), then it's a tasty, if not wildly original, granola.<br /><br />However, it IS very messy to eat. The oat clusters fell into tiny bits and the chocolate smeared all over me when I tried to eat it by hand, so I ended up dumping it directly into my mouth from the bag to try to minimize the extent of the damage. (Not the greatest strategy for portion control!) This would be best eaten as a breakfast cereal, I daresay, than an on-the-go snack (especially for kids).

review/text: I was a little skeptical about eating chocolate for breakfast - but this is a very good granola with just the right amount of chocolate.

review/summary: Chocolate lovers cereal
review/text: This granola really surprised me as to how good it is!  I love chocolate, but only darker, less sweet types, and I thought this cereal would be way oversweet but it was not.  I loved it as did everyone else in my family, young and old.<br /><br />It tasted equally as good dry as a snack.  I probably would prefer it this way most of the time.<br /><br />It is very crunchy and does not lose its crunch in milk very quickly.  The taste was fresh and chocolaty, but not overly so, a good balance.

review/summary: Chocolate granola? Now that's my idea of health food! LOL
review/text: I'll admit right up front that I am not the biggest fan of or authority on granola (most of it is too sweet for my taste and I am not a sweet-for-breakfast kind of person).  I used to eat granola on yogurt--back when I was trying to train myself to like yogurt--but I rarely eat it anymore, so I don't buy granola anymore either.<br /><br />But THIS granola--Back to Nature's Chocolate Delight--intrigued me because I am a chocoholic.  I couldn't imagine eating it as a breakfast food, but I did find quite a yummy use for it--I sprinkled it on ice cream.  I LOVE the flavors of coffee and chocolate together, so I thought sprinkling it on my coffee ice cream (or frozen yogurt) was worth a try.  It was quite a tasty combination and gave my dessert a great crunch factor, which I love.<br /><br />This granola, unlike most, is NOT oversweet.  When I ordered it, I thought the oaty part would be choclate too, but it isn't (or, if it's intended to be, it's so mild that I can't tell).  When I tried the oaty part of the granola with the chocolate chunks that come in it, it had just the right level of sweetness for me.  When I tried the oaty part by itself, it was surprisingly low in sweetness.  The chocolate chunks are dark chocolate (my favorite) and are surprisingly rich tasting--no cheap chocolate taste here.<br /><br />I don't have any other granola here at home to compare the numbers, but my guess would be that this is a bit healthier than many granolas.  According to the package it is "made with whole grain rolled oats perfectly sweetened with natural ingredients."  Reading the ingredient list, those natural ingredients would appear to be evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup.  It is high in calories (220 for a 1/2 cup serving), but I think that is true of any granola.  It has 6g of fat, 2 of which are sat fat, and it has no trans fat.  It has 13g of sugar (which I think is probably lower than most granolas), 4g of fiber and 5g of protein.<br /><br />In terms of eating this granola as a snack by itself, the downside to me is that it is not very chunky.  The majority of my 12-oz. bag was loose oaty bits and chocolate chips...chunks of more than a few oats stuck together were in the minority.  Now, as an ice cream topping, that was a positive thing, but it wouldn't be for snack eating.<br /><br />Will I buy this again when this bag is gone?  Probably not.  But not because it wasn't good and not because it didn't make a great ice cream topping.  As stated, I'm just not that much of a granola person and I really don't need one more snack food laying around the house to tempt me.

review/text: This granola is the best granola I have ever had!  The salty and<br />crunchy oats balanced with the dark chocolate was amazing.  It is not<br />a super healthy granola but I did find the chocolate to be high<br />quality.  I enjoyed this granola by itself rather than adding to<br />yogurt or eating with cereal.  Therefore eating it with my hands was<br />a little awkward because there were many small pieces of granola that<br />were not clustered together with the chocolate.  Overall I would<br />recommend this granola to all of the chocolate lovers.

review/text: What a great way to start the day, delicious crunch and chocolate! Yum! I don't know what else to say about this granola, except that it is the perfect breakfast for me. It is not too sweet, and, if it's healthy, too, than that is just a bonus. My oldest grandchild loves it also (age 12), although the other two, who are under 5 years old, have some trouble with the texture, and prefer softer cereals. I don't take that as a negative, as they have the same problem with any granola. If you enjoy granola and enjoy chocolate, then I would definitely recommend that you try this product!

My 87 year old grandmother loved it as much as my 2 year old, who requested it many times over.<br /><br />I think it would be delightful even with milk as a cereal. I will buy this again!

review/text: This is a rather ordinary granola. The chocolate added a nice touch and helped boost this granola to a higher rating than I would have otherwise have given it.<br /><br />It was not overly chocolate, nor was there so little chocolate that you couldn't taste it. There seemed to be a just right amount of chocolate. My children and husband agreed.<br /><br />The granola is very crunchy. The pieces were very very small. I tend to like a granola that is a little bit more chunky; more bite to it. The taste was fine though.<br /><br />This is  a fairly healthy snack with a fine taste. It is not an outstanding item but certainly worth a try if you are looking for a fast snack.

review/text: This was a very good tasting cereal. Nice crunch and did not get soggy in the milk. The only thing I would say is that it had just a bit too much chocolate for me (I know I sound crazy saying that). I took some of the chocolate pieces out on the second bowl and it was perfect. The chocolate seems to throw the sweetness over the top for me and I don't like cereal to be too too sweet in the morning. However, if a sweet cereal suits you, then this is quite nice and the granola nuggets even flavor the milk a little. I enjoyed it and would recommend it. Very very good.

review/summary: A Good Out of The Bag Snack
review/text: I was interested to try Back To Nature's Chocolate Delight Granola because I'm always looking for new healthy snacks or yogurt mix ins.  I was unsure what to expect though, because I've had hit and miss experiences with Back to Nature products before--I've enjoyed some of their cookies, but found most of their breakfast cereals to be too sweet.<br /><br />Like the earlier products, I found this granola to be a mixed bag.  I thought it was good out of the bag--just enough crunch, not too much chocolate--a good healthy-ish snack for kids who get turned off by regular granola that is often full of seeds and nuts.  But then when I added this granola to milk or yogurt I felt like the taste wasn't as good. I don't know if it was the dairy-chocolate reaction or the granola getting a bit soggy pretty fast, but I just didn't like the cereal as much when it wasn't dry.<br /><br />So my verdict is mixed--this is a good snacking granola, but not such a good cereal granola in my book.

review/summary: Great with milk; by itself: not so much
review/text: I've found Back to Nature products to be somewhat "hit or miss."  I LOVE their Classic Granola -- it's probably my favorite "plain" granola, perfect mixed with peach yogurt or eaten with milk.  Their Summer Berry Blend cereal was, to me, wayyy too sweet and the flakes were thick and hard.  I'm sure someone somewhere will absolutely love it, but it wasn't for me.<br /><br />This Chocolate Delight Granola is somewhere in the middle.  It works great as a cereal, eaten with milk.  The flavor is reminiscent of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.  The sweetness level was just about right, and the amount of chocolate was nice.  I'm not sure I'd want to eat it for breakfast, but for a snack, this works great.  I also tried it mixed with vanilla yogurt.  I used a 6-oz carton of vanilla yogurt, and added about 1/3 C of granola.  This worked well, too.<br /><br />Straight out of the box -- this doesn't work for me.  The chocolate chips have a sort of off-putting texture that seems to disappear with milk.  The cereal is kind of crumbly, so you don't have a huge amount of large clusters to grab onto.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a "snacking" granola that you can nibble right out of the box, this might not be what you're looking for.  But if you're looking for a tasty chocolate, relatively healthy, granola to eat with milk or yogurt, this stuff is pretty darned good.

review/text: As the name says, this Back to Nature whole grain snack is delightful -  Tasty, crunchy, with just enough dark chocolate to add a moderate sweetness.  It's difficult to stop once you start munching!<br /><br />The one problem with Chocolate Delight Granola is the consistency.  After a few nice, crunchy clusters at the top of the bag, the rest amounted to tiny clusters or loose grain with a cereal like consistency.  It makes for a messy snack and almost makes you want to run for a cereal bowl, milk and spoon.<br /><br />Still the taste is very good and the crunch remains even when the remaining clusters are tiny.  Plus the added benefit of whole grain makes this a worthwhile snack.

review/text: Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is about as tasty as granola gets.  It makes excellent snack food and tastes very good - especially the chocolate chunks with are high quality and very good.  Made with all natural ingredients, it is healthy - as healthy as natural granola can be, given the high calorie and fat contents of the natural ingredients.  The only downside to this granola product is the lack of large clusters - something that can only be created with artificial additives.  While large clusters may not be organic, they sure make eating granola much easier and more enjoyable.  In a bag like this, all of the granola comes in small, individual grains, so you really need to use a spoon if you don't want to get it all over the place - large, clumsy man fingers don't do so well with this product.

The granola itself is a bit sweet and dry, so it gets a little bit tiresome eating it plain.  That said, it's also a bit too sweet to really enjoy with other sweet things like vanilla yogurt.  Otherwise, I found the granola delicious.  Also, there was quite a bit of dust at the bottom of the bag, which was annoying but overall this product deserves 4 stars.

review/summary: Very Few Clusters, Mostly Loose Granola, But Delicious
review/text: Back To Nature's Chocolate Delight Granola is a great tasting snack, but kind of difficult to eat because it doesn't really come in clusters.  It's more like a loose granola cereal with little chocolate rectangles in it.  Probably the best way to eat it would be by pouring it in a bowl and eating it with a spoon.<br /><br />That said, it has 28g of whole grain and 4g of dietary fiber.  Like most granolas, it has a lot of fat, 6g, but no trans fat.  Each half cup serving contains 220 calories, of which 50 are from fat.  The allergy info states that it contains soy and milk and is manufactured on equipment that processes wheat.<br /><br />I thought it had a very pleasant granola/chocolate aroma and a pleasingly sweet taste with good mouth texture and a satisfying crunch.  If they could just get it to hold together in clusters so that people can eat it without having to resort to spoons, it would be a five star product!

review/summary: Hubby loves it
review/text: My hubby likes granola, and he loves dark chocolate.  Turns out the "dark chocolate" in this Back to Nature flavor is actually semi-sweet chocolate but he didn't mind.  The granola was your usual granola, nothing special about it, but when paired with CHOCOLATE he was thrilled.  Great snack, he had it for dessert last night and tonight he's going to try it with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  This has great potential with yogurt as well, as my husband usually puts semi-sweet chocolate chips in with his strawberry yogurt.  Granola, chocolate, and yogurt, yum!

review/summary: sweet but delicious
review/text: I love granola and I love chocolate, so I couldn't help but like this granola.  The crunch is good, the taste of the granola is quite nice and the chocolate is some of the best I've had when compared to other pre-packaged store-bought items.  However, the overall taste of the granola is just too sweet for me.  It's best in very small quantities, such as on some tart vanilla yogurt or a small half handful for a snack.  I once tried eating the full half cup serving size and by the end of the snack I felt like I'd eaten a bunch of cookies due to the sweetness.  You could never eat this as a cereal, it's really sort of a dessert granola.<br /><br />The ingredients are the best I've seen in a pre-packaged food in a while, although there are a lot of sweeteners of various kinds.  The price on this item is really good, as local stores sell granola bags in this size for $6 or more per bag.<br /><br />If you like sweet, I really recommend this.  If you're looking for something to eat in very small amounts or to add to other things like yogurt, this will also be for you.

review/text: If you like granola and LOVE chocolate, this is for you!<br /><br />The chocolate is a darker chocolate in small chipped squares, perfectly blended with granola, so as to not be overpowering, but a great chocolate granola just the same.<br /><br />Packet are a bit small, thus the 4 stars, as I eat a lot more cereal at a time than the "serving size", and only got 2 bowls full out of one packet, although it will keep it fresh for camping and summer activities, or if you live in an area that is humid.<br /><br />It would be nice to see a larger sized packet, and keep the smaller ones for summer camping, etc.<br /><br />This granola is VERY fresh tasting, unlike many you buy in the stores that taste a bit stale to me.

review/summary: Tastes great, but read the ingredients
review/text: Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is indeed a delicious combination of oats and dark chocolate, both of which are believed to have health benefits.  In addition to the chocolate clusters, which are sweetened with sugar (and also contain milk, if that is of significance to you) there are added sweeteners--evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, and molasses--and also safflower oil.  So, while there are no artificial ingredients, the natural ingredients in this granola are those which should be consumed in moderation.  This is not a daily breakfast cereal.

review/summary: This is the perfect Granola for me
review/text: I ate it right out of the pouch -- it was crunchy, sweet and the chocolate chips (squares) were not overpowering. There were no nuts, no extra crunchy clusters of anything, nothing gooey in it -- just simple and sweet.<br /><br />Then I put some in a bowl and added cold water - little rice krispie-type bits floated to the top but eventually mixed in with the rest of the granola -- it was all very tasty, toothsome, and filling.<br /><br />I put some in another bowl and added hot water -- it tasted more like oatmeal with chocolate chips, and did not have the hot crunchy surprise elements of regular hot granola -- a mild disappointment to me, but no cereal can be all things to all people.<br /><br />The ingredients are simple -- oatmeal, choc chips, sugar, cocoa butter (with 10% saturated fat and 220 Calories per 1/2 cup serving, this is definitely not a low-cal granola -- but Granola has never been known to be low-cal), brown rice products, molasses, Vitamin E.<br /><br />Tasty, and nutritious, and a good source of Copper (15% per 1/2 cup serving).<br /><br />So I like Back To Nature Chocolate Delight Granola best when it is either eaten out of hand or in cold water/coffee/even tea. The pouch is great for long-term storage in a cool place and can go with me wherever I go to give me a good energy boost or just to act as comfort food.

review/text: Back To Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is wonderful, crunchy and great to have as a snack, dessert, or to bring along on a hike.  They are very generous with the chocolate chucks.  For my tastes, it is too sweet for a breakfast cereal, and it would benefit from the addition of some nuts to add protein.  However, it's a delicious snack and highly recommended!

review/text: I didn't know there were supposed to be actual chunks of dark chocolate in the bag, mine melted into the granola a bit making some slighlty bigger granola clusters.  It was fine that way, but I'd be curious if I ordered the granola in a chillier season what it would be like.<br /><br />The granola is fine, the dark chocolate is a fine perk, but it does feel like there's something missing.  The sweetners for the most part are natural sweetners.  Still I can't figure it out, something was missing, it's okay, not great.

review/summary: Tasty snacking goodness!
review/text: I have tasted plenty of granola in my time, and plenty of cereals that suggest healthy food and great chocolate taste (and fail at it).<br /><br />Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola really came though in taste, texture, and nutritional value.<br /><br />It's sweet, it's dessert-y... The nutrition seems well balanced..But with 6g/fat & 37g CHO per 1/2 cup serving, I would probably use this less as a breakfast cereal and more as a replacement for cravings or if I know I am going to be up and active for awhile.  I always hoped for a healthier alternative to straight milk chocolate and this could be it- the dark chocolate chunks are smooth, not bitter, and combined with the sweetened oats the "I'm eating chocolate" satisfaction is there as you actually have actual dark chocolate bits in it (unlike other cereals with chocolate chunks that have the texture and flavor of chocolated ex-lax. Blech.)  The overall chocolate flavor, when combined with the oats and a little milk, is smooth and mellow- not overpoweringly chocolate, just enough.<br /><br />Definitely a good, healthy (the nutrition label includes 5g of protein and 4g of fiber... definite bonuses over a traditional chocolate bar) alternative to straight chocolate and thanks to the taste is one that I could actually incorporate into my nutrition plan without feeling deprived.<br /><br />Also, due to the nutritional values and the recloseable pack, I will be adding a couple of these pouches to our Hurricane/Emergency kit.  Nourishment and a treat, in one package!

Some products try to be more than they are, but this one seems comfortable in its own skin.  The ingredients are of a good quality and taste, and the texture is nice as well.

This was a good granola and one that I'd buy if I saw it in the store.

review/text: It's a tasty, crunchy, relatively healthy (vs, say, candy/cookies/other sweets) out-of-hand snack. It also makes a great sub or oatmeal or other cereals in cookies or bars. And like all the Back to Nature products I've tried, it doesn't sacrifice flavor for more healthy ingredients. No high-fructose corn syrup, and all of the ingredients are things I can pronounce and recognize. Comes in a resealable, recyclable pouch to save space & minimize packaging.<br /><br />I don't like desserty cereals, so I wouldn't eat this as actual cereal with milk, but kids or people who chocolate kiddie cereals should like it that way.

review/text: Tastes good; I am not exactly a fan of Granola but I did like this (my son finished it in 2 days and left me only a little). Right dose of cocoa (chocoloate nuggets) makes it tasty. You can buy these separately from Whole foods or other stores and mix them yourself, may be, but this mix is made of only natural, stuff that it is worth buying this.<br />One con is that it is more powdery at the bottom and is not exactly made up of big nuggets.<br />Do note that this has saturated fat (though no added salt/trans fat etc..) and so enjoy this in moderation.<br />I will buy this again..<br />Only reason to give 3 star is the price of this compared to what you get and the powdery/very small grains in the package.

review/summary: Almost Perfect Snack
review/text: This granola is a perfect snack when craving a good crunch. The granola is hearty and yummy with just the right amount of chocolate chunks throughout. Not sugary, not too sweet either. It reminds me of a hard choco chip granola bar broken up into pieces. There were two issues though:<br /><br />1) It was so tasty, it was hard to put down. There are a lot of calories in granola and you must be able to control yourself or you could eat a third of the bag easily breaking your caloric intake ceiling for the day.<br /><br />2) Mine arrived packed well but the granola clusters were mostly broken up into little granules which made it harder to eat. I couldn't really pick up the pieces to eat after the first few servings. I had to put some in the palm of my hand and kind of dump it into my mouth. Not my favorite way to eat.<br /><br />Other than that, I would recommend this granola.

review/summary: It's good...I like it
review/text: This is the first 'back to NATURE' product I've tried. I appreciate that it is sweetened with natural ingredients & contains no artificial preservatives, flavors or color; it's made with whole oats & has no trans fat. This granola contains 4 gr. of fiber/serving which isn't bad, but at 220 calories, I'd like a bit more fiber.<br /><br />I love the dark chocolate in this mix. It definitely tastes real and not fake like the chocolate in some cereals. There's just the right amount of chocolate...not too much that the chocolate is over-powering, & not too little that you can't taste it. I like eating this for a snack. But, as others mentioned, there are some crunchy clusters along with part crumbly granola. I'll have to have a spoon ready for this snack.<br /><br />Instead of baking cookies for car trips, I mix up some of our favorite, healthy, high-fiber cereals,  add pretzels, nuts, dried orange flavored  cranberries, raisins, & candy coated chocolate pieces. It's good.  I was intending to use this as a snack for long car trips, too. I tested a chocolate piece in my hand & it melted...so guess that idea won't work.<br /><br />I like this granola with milk, too.<br /><br />It's definitely snack-worthy, even if I have to use a spoon.

There is a good balance between the granola and the chocolate and it tastes really good.  (I have a strong sweet tooth though, so for some it may be too sweet.)  I literally sat and ate it out of the bag.  That is how I discovered the negative about it.  It's pretty crumbly and in very small pieces.  It can be messy eating it as a snack then.

review/summary: Super soft and healthy cat!
review/text: I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food. We've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund goes CRAZY over the turkey/chicken grain free canned, but is a little slower with this salmon stuff. Fortunately he will eat anything I give him, so it wasn't a waste for me to buy a whole case of this too :-).<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. Also, we've had zero need for vet visits since I brought him home and his chronic upper respiratory issue completed cleared up within two weeks! I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or 2 of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: At first changing foods can be tricky with cats but after a week or two they stand in the kitchen with excitement waiting for it and love the food.  I like the ingredients in it and feel I am am feeding them something better.  One of my cats had a hard time with other foods (blood in her stool) but it gone since starting this food.  My only compliant is Amazon does a poor job shipping it.  A heavy 12 pack of cans with almost no packaging and thin box arrives damaged or even smashed so hard some of the cans had been smashed open. But they were quickly replaced, just a hassle.

review/summary: Cat loves it! Great consistency, lasts a long time too!
review/text: So far, 2 Paws Up from our cat Marco. Great company with GREAT customer service. They also sell lids to keep the cans fresh.  The food stayed the same quality for a few days while refridgerated.  Will be trying the Chicken/Turkey/Lamb/Fish flavor next!  Very economical for me, and great for our cat!<br /><br />Update 4/7/11:<br /><br />I no longer mix wet and dry together and this is now an even bigger hit w/Marco. He devours it as quickly as Trader Joes or the best Wellness, even eats the peas too. I was hesitant to test a whole case of the Turkey/Chicken/Fish/Lamb formula, but found a singular can of the Senior one and Marco loved it, so i will be ordering a case of the T/C/F/L one asap!

review/summary: my kitty won't eat it
review/text: My cat just won't eat it.  She tried a few bits and sat up for a few moments after each bite and acted like she was trying to figure out what was odd about the taste.  I've never seen her do that.  She wouldn't eat it.  I tried mixing it with some Fancy Feast, but she sniffed it and just sat there and wouldn't eat it. This catfood is very much like very wet babyfood.  It doesn't have anything to "bite" into. It's very mushy and soft.  I suspect that it has too many vegetables and not enough meat and fish in it.  I feel bummed that I have wasted my money on this.

review/summary: My cat loves it, but he loves all other wet foods too
review/text: My cat loves eating this food, but he also loves eating even the cheapest available cat food on the market. I don't see any difference in his health when feeding him this cat food, versus feeding him the cheap stuff. I don't think it will result in his being any more healthy, as my visits to the vet have been just as frequent. My main reason for purchasing this food, was because I was told it was better for gastrointestinal health. My cat still vomits on a regular basis, so giving him this food has made no difference at all.

review/text: I know I was skeptical about buying this, because I feed my cat ONLY WELLNESS food, and kept seeing this on amazon and wondering about it, so I decided to try it. I must say it's very comparable to WELLNESS if you're on a budget!!!! The ingredients look good, crude analysis looks good and my cat likes it...so I guess I will be alternating this with Wellness to save some money!

review/summary: Cats love it
review/text: Cats love it, and it's fairly inexpensive compared to other grain-free canned choices.  Cat poops don't smell too bad either, compared to other foods.  Wet cat food keeps my cats from puking up their food, which they would do almost every day with several varieties of dry kibble.  Cats have more energy than when they were on dry food, their coats are smooth & glossy, and the cats meow something fierce when it's mealtime!  This particular food doesn't get nasty with congealed fat when a can is refrigerated, and that makes my cats more likely to eat it without heating it until it's hot first. I love the free shipping option when enough quantity is purchased.

review/text: This food is one of the best values for high-quality cat food. My cats seemed to love it at first. Now, a few months after I started feeding this to them, they will still eat it (peas and all), but only after it sits there for a while and they realize that there are no other options for dinner.

review/summary: Our cats won't eat it.
review/text: We have been trying to feed our cats organic, natural foods for quite some time now. We normally use Pet Guard canned food products, but Amazon was out of stock when I needed to order, and this cat food came up when I did a search for other organic foods. While I think the ingredients are outstanding and I've read good things about this company (our dog eats the Canidine organic dry dog food..same company), we were disappointed because our cats won't eat it. We've now purchased three different formulas hoping we'd hit on one they like, but out of four cats, only one will eat the chicken formula. Our older three males just turn up their nose to all three formulas. So, it's back to pet guard for them.

They ate this new food for exactly two days and then refused it completely. The food looks good in the can, has lots of what is good for them, but if they won't eat it, it's worthless.

I felt bad giving my cats only dry food after the pup came and he was getting both (they're upset enuf he gets more attention then they do) I went to my local pet shop where I buy my cats Taste of the Wild (we suspect a grain allgery) I was so excited that this food was also grainfree and came highly recommened by my friend at the pet shop. She feeds it to her cats all the time. Now I'm saying 3 stars because its been fine for my other two cats, but Bella has delevoped diarhea. Now i just found out she has been sneaking the puppys food when I wasnt looking (the crumbs he didnt finish) so Im thinking its more that than any kinda of reaction to her food. Im not going to cut corners anymore just to be safe.

review/summary: Where's the mint?
review/text: This product is great as green tea. The fact that it comes from the Carribean lends it credibility that it is the real deal green tea. The problem is that its green tea with mint, but theres not enough mint in it. Even when Im done with my tea, I sometimes suck the tea bag for any extra antioxidants and extra mint flavor (I think I saw that on Dr Oz). Its kind of disappointing how little mint there actually is compared to other tea flavors. Its not a big deal, but if you are buying this product for the mint taste or that Halls mentholyptus feeling when you breathe in the hot vapors, you will be slightly disappointed. Thats what I was looking for. I also tried Bigelow brand green tea variety pack. Much better tastes, and their mint has a bit more mint in it. I guess I'll switch brands once I finish off this box of tea bags, but it sux that I have to add an Altoid or cough drop to my tea to get a strong mint taste.

review/summary: Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality
review/text: I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag "freshness guaranteed." That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could.

review/summary: Five stars for the cheese flavored puffs
review/text: I'd give it three stars for the approximately 50% of puffs that have little or no cheese on them, and five stars for the ones that have a lot (maybe too much?). I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full-flavored to light-flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed-flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other brand that beats them so I keep ordering anyway.

review/text: My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re-ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown...

Unfortunately, WF started carrying their own brand of cheese puffs and stopped selling Michael Season's. Thank goodness for Amazon.com!<br /><br />I like these so much that I ordered a case and had them delivered to my office. Now all my office mates are getting hooked. These taste amazing for being "lite", and they have a decent amount of fiber per serving (and relatively low fat/calories). They are all natural, and highly addictive!<br /><br />I've tried the regular variety of Michael Season's Cheese Puffs, and I do not recommend them because they're too rich. The Lite variety taste perfectly cheesey without being too buttery in flavor.<br /><br />Makes an awesome afternoon snack!

The package has it listed as small breed, and my dog is a boxer and pit bull mix, not exactly small breed, so I was hesitant to buy them but did so anyway.  The treats being smaller actually work better than large treats because instead of feeding him one or two treats and then having to ration them for the next day, I can grab a handful and put them in my pocket and feed them gradually throughout the day.  I would definitely recommend these for your dog.

review/summary: Great for large and small dogs!
review/text: These treats are one of few limited ingredient ones I could find that weren't super expensive, as my adopted dog was just diagnosed with allergies that caused hot spots! He is a golden retriever, so I thought about buying the large ones, but these small ones work great for training and I don't have to worry about the bag being gone fast if I give him a few a day. He loves the taste and they don't even smell that bad to me (:

review/text: These are much better than the regular size treats.  Our dog has allergies and we found that this, in addition to prescription medicine, does help.  It's easily digested and fits perfect in toys. He loves them!

review/summary: Great hard treats, no gas
review/text: Our French Bulldog will eat just about any sort of treat, so I can't comment for those who have picky eaters. We bought these with an eye towards reducing gas and they have worked great. We can give him a handful of these per day without a increase in farts. Great price too for how many are included.

review/summary: Perfect treats for dogs with allergies...
review/text: Upon searching for a dog treat for our labrador puppy who has food allergies, I came upon these Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Venison treat biscuits. We were already using the same brand of dog food with great success, so when we found out that there were treats with similar make-up & limited ingredients, we gave them a try & they have worked perfectly as a treat alternative to the normal food kibble in between meals & for training. They are just a little bit on the expensive side, but there are very limited options in treats for dogs with food allergies, & these are the best. Just get enough volume to take advantage of free shipping.

review/summary: Doggone good!
review/text: We have three dogs, two 23# mini schnauzers and an 8# toy poodle.  All three dogs love these treats and they are the right size for even the smallest dog.  She has no trouble eating them as opposed to a bigger treat that has to be broken up for her.<br /><br />We like the fact that they are made of both meat and vegetable.  So do our dogs.

review/summary: Excellent treat for small dogs on grain-free diets
review/text: Earlier this year we switched our pug to a LID food from Natural Balance (Duck and Potato formula) as he was having some issues with skin allergies and his vet felt it was worthwhile to explore the possibility of eliminating grains from his diet. His skin showed vast improvement but we still wanted to try these as he seemed as bit bored with the Duck & Potato treats.<br /><br />These treats are available in both regular size and the smaller size for small breeds. We got the small breed size, which measures roughly 1.25 inches long and is shaped like a dog bone.<br /><br />I notice the smoked hickory flavor right away. Spanky loves them. The size is perfect for his small mouth and he's able to chew them in one bite without me breaking them in half.  However, they do break in half easily, so if you're doing training with your dog and don't want to overstuff them with treats, you could break these into two pieces.<br /><br />I give him treats several times a day. On a typical day he probably gets about 6 of these, at the minimum, and sometimes a bit more. The skin on his belly (which is where he'd been having a lot of irritation) is still in good shape, so obviously he can do well with sweet potato. His stool hasn't shown any changes, either, so these treats appear to be a good fit for him.<br /><br />We continue to be pleased with the quality of food from Natural Balance. I highly recommend these treats for dogs with sensitive skin or other sensitivities to grain-based foods. 5 stars.

review/summary: Healthy Bones  treats
review/text: My maltipoo really didn't love the L.I.T. sweet potato and venison formula. Maybe because it's hickory smoked, I'm not sure.  He  does loves the oatmeal , chicken , pumpkin and the cranberry , turkey , apple, Natural Balance bones.  Make sure you get the small breed size if you have little guys, the size for any dog is pretty big but the small bones are perfect for little dog treats. My dog has grain allergies and these don't make him itch at all and his eyes don't tear that brown color from eating them either. Good treats for allergy prone pups!

review/summary: Best salsa for cooking
review/text: I discovered this Salsa on a trip to Costa Rica. Many of the restaurants in Costa Rica use Lizano Salsa in the dishes they prepare. It was also available as a condiment everywhere like salt and pepper. I was excited to see I could buy it here in the states. I mostly use in Hispanic dishes I cook but it adds great flavor to just about everything. I recommend this Salsa 110% you will not be sorry.
