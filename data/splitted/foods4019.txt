review/summary: This is my favorite brand of brown sugar!
review/text: I have been using this light brown sugar for a couple years. I just started selling my organic baked goods at the local farmers market and I use this along with the dark brown sugar (also from Wholesome Sweeteners) in my cinnamon rolls. They are fantastic! They are both so soft and they aren't clumpy at all. I don't have to worry about the hard as a rock pieces in it at all. Makes mixing it much easier. I won't use any brand but Wholesome sweeteners for my brown sugar needs. I have not gotten any hard bags yet!

review/summary: Great flour, great price
review/text: This is one of the gluten free flours I have a hard time finding locally. For the price, you can't beat just buying it on Amazon!  It is fresh and consistent, as all Bob's Red Mill products are.  Sweet White Rice flour is NOT the same as White Rice flour, and you can mess up a recipe by not using the right one.  Sweet White Rice flour is from short grain rice, which is much more "glutinous" (sticky), so it will definitely respond differently in a recipe than White Rice flour, which is from less sticky long grain rice.

I find the Bob's Red Mill sweet rice worth the small difference in price.  I trust their products, and the bags are the same as those for their other GF flours - a nice size, and a shape that isn't difficult to handle - I can stand one up on the counter while measuring from it, and don't spill flour all over the place.

review/text: You can't buy Sweet Rice Flour this affordably in stores, and for the smooth texture it brings to gluten-free baking, it's worth investigating.  Blended with other supportive flours, sweet rice flour is likely the one gluten-free flour with a texture as smooth as traditional wheat-based baking.  It has a mild, sweet flavor, and Bob's Red Mill products are consistent and dependable.  Will buy again!

review/summary: Our Schnauzer loves this food!
review/text: We have a 3-yr. old Schnauzer that was suffering from a chronic ear infection and the vet said it was likely related to a food-allergy.  Heeding the vet's recommendation to try a limited-ingredient diet, we researched different food options and ultimately settled on this brand/type.  Since switching her to this food, the ear infection has cleared up completely, and her skin & coat are in great condition!  She seems to really love the taste too (gobbles it up in no time!)  One earlier reviewer had some comments about the smell of the food - which concerned us.  But after getting it, we realized that it wasn't an issue.  It does smell like fish, but it's not an overpowering or lingering scent.  It's definitely there if you stick your nose right down near the food (or if your dog burps on you...), but aside from that, it isn't noticeable.  We'll continue buying this food - it's good stuff.  Hope this review is helpful!

review/summary: Not sure yet but food is stinky
review/text: My boy Cocker Spaniel has really bad allergies. I had been feeding him and his sister the Paul Newman organic food but my baby kept getting blisters on his belly and scratched like crazy. He was on steriods and antibiotics more then he was off of them. My vet suggested he may be allergic to chicken or grains. He said fish was the best protien so I switched them to Natural Balance. With the weening off the other food and the doing the old 75% to 25% then 50% to 50% (you get where I am going) they have been solely on this food for two weeks. I haven't seen a big difference in the scratching in fact the girl is scrathing now. But this food stinks. I have a strong stomach but I gag everytime I have to feed them and they stink. They mostly stay in the house during the day, I when I come home from work and open the door, my house stinks and so do they. They sleep with us at night and their breath reaks and so do they and of course they have to lay right on me.<br /><br />I am going to give it another 30 days but if the allergies do not improve this stinky food may have to go...

I tried brewing two chai disk with one milk to make a stronger cup. Even with two it was still very bland. And the milk gives it an artificial aftertaste. Being able to make chai latte was one of the major reasons I purchased the Tassimo which makes how it tastes all the more disappointing. I really hope they strengthen the formula. And get rid of the aftertaste.

review/text: If you like Starbucks Chai tea stay away from this. It is too sweet and not a good sweet. A 4 year old from far away from me said "I smell Cotton Candy" when I was drinking it. It is just overpowering sweet without the pleasure of the spice taste. So then I tried it without the Latte part and the spices were not pleasing -they had a strange taste to them. My search for at home chai continues. We will not be buying this again. On a side note: I do like Stash Chai Black tea bags they are different than the Starbucks, but very pleasing.

review/text: I gave this 3 stars, because my taste in Chai may be very different from others. The Chai I enjoy is a strong, creamy brew. For example, I usually order Starbuck's Chai tea without the water. With that said, I found that this was the first Tassimo drink that I really don't like. It not only was watery and bland, but I think the Splenda gave it a strange aftertaste. For those who enjoy a strong cup of Chai this is not it. I'm wondering if I can add some other powder Chai mix to jazz this up.

Once upon manufacturers used to have tio highlight artificial sweeteners but not any more I guess.  They are also pretty high in saturated fat like most of the Tassimo late or cappuccino type products.  Also, check the pricing carefully.  For this two pack it is only 16 servings (8 serving in each package) and the price per unit acts as if it is is 32 servings, which it is not.  At the current pricing that is about $2.00/serving - compare locally or on other sites before buying!

review/summary: Very Good Taste & Value
review/text: I was planning on buying a Tassimo machine for the ability to create chai lattes. It's my favourite Starbucks drink and I've been consuming them for over 5 years. After reading the reviews, I was really worried that I wouldn't like the taste. So, with some trepidation I purchased a TAS4514 along with a pack of the Twinnings Chai Latte.<br /><br />Got home, setup the machine and prepared for the taste test. Put in the chai disk and let the machine create the base chai tea. Smell was wonderful. Waited for the orange light, took out the spent tea disk, shook the milk disk, put it in the machine. Pressed the magic button and voila, a hot steaming mug of chai latte.<br /><br />Looked and smelled wonderful. Nice rich colour with a top layer of steaming and foamy milk. But how did it taste? If you ask me, my wife and my brother (who was visiting), very good! A little less spicy than the Starbucks offering and maybe a tiny bit sweeter but very, very good. Very little of the Splenda after taste that some people complain about. It's there but it doesn't affect our enjoyment of the beverage at all.<br /><br />I'm so impressed with both the machine and the chai latte that I bought another one for the office. I figure after about two months of use, the machine will have paid for itself in savings from the chai lattes I buy everyday at the office.<br /><br />One piece of advice, give the beverage a quick stir before you drink it. It really helps to even out the flavours.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />****EDIT****<br />One thing I forgot to add, I'm feeling a bit guilty about the environment. The T Discs come into a foil bag, the discs themselves are good solid chunks of non-recyclable plastic and the left-over contents in the disc are not easily removed for say composting. Tassimo, if you are listening, encourage your beverage providers to go green.

Oh................so good.  I had strep throat this week and this was all that would go down my throat.  Now, even though I'm better, I have a cup every night.  Excellent!

review/summary: Fair Chai - 3 Stars - Read Why!
review/text: Twinings Chai Tea is Mediocre compared to your local cafe, book store or StarBucks, or in Asia. Just about all of the FORMER StarBucks Coffee's,<br />and Cappuccino's were near perfect from the Tassimo Bosch machine. StarBucks is no longer available, so I'm currently trying a Keurig.<br />At least I can still use the Milk Creamer.<br /><br />* The Tassimo Creamer is real Milk that has been 'ultra-pasteurized' which gives it a longer shelf life ... this is what the rest of the World offers, just wished that we could get these products in the US, instead of Powdered Milk!<br /><br />* My Rating is like 2.5 to 3.0.<br /><br />* For Chai, I'd rather drive downtown.

review/summary: Brilliant
review/text: This is one of the best Chai Tea lattes I've had. One word of caution, though: DO NOT add any water to the mix. Normally, with the Tassimo system, you can add water at the end of a brewing cycle if you don't want it as strong, want more, etc. DON'T do it with this. The traditional mix with chai tea is a 1:1 ratio with tea:milk. If you add water, it really tastes watery. If you just leave it, and let it do it's thing: brilliant.<br /><br />My husband hates coffee(I know, and I married him anyway), but has really started to like these. I ordered a small pack just to try them, and will be ordering them in a much larger case from now on.

review/summary: Not for Chai Tea Lovers
review/text: If you are looking for the spiciness of Chai Tea Lattes comparable to those at Starbucks or Coffee Bean, you're not going to get it with these t-discs. It smells wonderful, but tastes very mild in terms of chai spice. Also as some of the other reviewers mentioned, there is a distinct aftertaste from the Splenda/sucarlose that is included in this drink. I don't like artificial sweeteners so this product was not a good fit for me. However, my husband likes the taste of the chai tea latte, probably because he's used to the taste of artificial sweeteners. Bottom line: if you can stand the taste of splenda/sucralose, give it a try; if not, skip this one.

review/summary: Tasty and not overly sweet
review/text: I generally dislike coffee, but we have a Tassimo in our home for guests to use. My wife also enjoys using it to make an occasional cup of coffee without having to make a pot. I've tried the hot chocolate T-Discs but found them to be somewhat wanting in terms of lacking a rich dark chocolate taste. So this time I thought I'd try the Chai Latte as I have enjoyed Chai in the past. While I generally don't add milk or cream to Chai, I went ahead and mixed this as instructed, using the tea disc first followed by the creamer disc.<br /><br />The overall taste is quite nice, with sufficient hues of the various spices and a richness of overall flavor without being too diluted from the creamer. It's easy, of course, to make the Chai stronger by simply clicking the appropriate button on the Tassimo just as you would with coffee, or by ignoring the creamer disc and adding your own fresh milk or cream in the quantity desired. The aftertaste of tea is just right - not so strong as to be overwhelming. There's some aftertaste from the sweetener, so I'm forced to agree with others here that Twinings should leave the sweetener out entirely and let us add our choice of sweetener if desired. I found that I could get around the overall taste of Splenda by adding about 1/8th teaspoon of sugar, but the product doesn't really demand extra sweetening. It is neither bitter nor overly sweet if left alone.<br /><br />I tried the Chai directly without the creamer and found it bitter; it is clear that the Chai mixture is really designed to be mixed with the sweetened creamer provided. Your thoughts may vary on this count. Realize that though you get 8 servings, you can get more if you like. The Chai disc, if utilized again promptly, will generate a second cup very much like the first. You'll need to add your own milk and sweetener as the milk disc works only once. Finally, the overall quantity of Chai generated with one combination of Chai/creamer is sufficient to fill a large mug. Although the Tassimo often makes cups of coffee that seem rather small, particularly if you like yours strong, the automatic settings for the Chai provide a good quantity of drink. So don't put a small mug on the stand and toddle off while your latte is being constructed.<br /><br />Overall, four stars - one deduction for the Splenda aftertaste.

review/summary: Thanksgiving in your cup...
review/text: Honestly, I don't understand the few murmurs here about this product being too sweet.  In fact, I think it is the perfect blend of the savory and sweet delicacies of a Chai Tea.  I have always been a fan of Chai Tea, but I must admit this may be my favorite I've tasted.  The reason being is that, on occasion, you'll order a Chai Tea and the spices used to give it that signature flavor are so overpowering it can take away from the joy of `drinking' something refreshing.  These spices are prevalent yet mild enough to allow the refreshing aspect of the tea to take center stage.  It has everything you'd want in product like this.  I was pleasantly surprised.  If I were to complain at all it would be that the serving size isn't big enough!  The creamer certainly gives this a latte feel, so keep that in mind.  I initially purchased this product expecting more of a tea product, but I immediately engulfed the idea of a latte beverage, so it didn't bother me at all; but if you are looking for strictly TEA then you may want to skip the creamer, or manually set your level of how much creamer you want in your tea.  Still, this product is FAR FROM overly sweet.  It is the right amount of sweet; the perfect winter drink!

review/text: I bought the machine to make coffee lattes. I love chai from the coffee shop but have not found much in the instant mixes I care for (only the one from Tastefully Simple) or the tea bags. This just blew me away. I am a diabetic so I need to keep the sugars low but don't care for a strong taste. This fit the bill perfectly. I think it is just as good as the cofffee shops and lower in sugar. What a win win. The chai alone makes the machine completely worth it. I am not complaining on the coffees but the chai is awesome. Not to mention it makes my kitchen smell really good for a bit. Can't do that from the coffee shop.

Only wish that there was a fat-free creamer option, but tassimo has a long way to go in terms of expanding variety.  Oh...and why hasn't amazon added t-discs to subscribe and save?  I would be ordering these monthly.

I use it in such things as sauteed vegies which I want to add a grilled flavor to, humus where it add a nice smokiness, and pan-frying tofu (I'm vegetarian). It can even add a grilled/outdoor flavor to your salads when used in a vinaigrette dressing.

In addition, like the Chiquilin, the McCormick paprika is made from Spanish red peppers that are smoked over wood planks.  Finally, it is available with Prime shipping, just as the Chiquilin is.

review/summary: Best paprika
review/text: This wonderful piment&oacute;n comes from La Vera region of Spain where five varieties of peppers are grown. Two of the varieties are sweet, the other three have a more piquant quality.<br /><br />The peppers are dehydrated and smoked using traditional techniques, a process that imparts the final product a unique flavor.<br /><br />If the tin doesn't say "dulce" (sweet) the paprika will have a stronger and spicier taste, perfect for dishes such as chili.<br /><br />The paprika "dulce" adds a delightful flavor to tomato sauces, stews, rice pilafs, and any dish containing peppers or eggplants.<br /><br />Only buy smoked paprika in tins with a denomination of origin (D.O.) from "La Vera" or "Murcia."<br /><br />Tip: All Spanish smoked paprikas have a much more pronounced flavor. If you've never used them before, start with about half as much as what your recipe calls for.<br /><br />Be careful not to burn this paprika because it will turn bitter very quickly and ruin your dish. To avoid that, always make sure that there's enough fat/oil in the pan when sauteing.

review/summary: My New Go-To Flavor Enhancer
review/text: I bought this for a recipe. It lent a smoky, tasty, indefinable essence. So much so I sneak it into every savory dish. It never fails to elicit comments like, "This is delicious! What did you put in this?" But I'm not telling. My secret go-to ingridient for savory dishes, rubs, and gravies. No wonder why Ilan from Top Chef put paprika into everything. Although the reviewer who suggested desserts had me thinking, "Hmmm?" I'm hooked.

review/summary: Favorite Treat
review/text: I never see my dogs get as excited as they do about these treats. All dogs love treats, but they have a whole other level of excited reserved for when I open this bag. It's also really important to me that it doesn't have any grains or filler. All of the ingredients are simple words like "blueberries" and "chicken" or they're vitamins that dogs would normally get from eating bones. My puppies have fairly tender stomachs, and I love that these treats don't upset them.<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />- The puppies love them, they go crazy whenever I open the bag<br /><br />- Simple ingredients that puppies would eat in the wild<br /><br />- Takes them a minute or two to chew through it. This isn't a treat that they just gobble down and it's gone<br /><br />- Great as a big reward like when they've pottied on the paper<br /><br />- Not covered in grease or weird fats that my puppy doesn't need<br /><br />- Smells good, not like I'd eat it, but unlike some dog treats that get gross smelling grease all over you these smell fresh and wholesome<br /><br />Cons-<br /><br />- Can't use it as a quick reward. It takes them too long to eat, and you can't break it up apart. I still have to use kibble in training sessions<br /><br />- They always seem to be a little on the pricey side

review/summary: does not tast like coffee mate from the refrigerated section of the grocery store
review/text: I was looking for a non-dairy creamer that's similar to regular refrigerated coffee mate or the little ones you get in restaurants, but that did not need refrigeration. Just wanted regular creamer to keep in a guest breakfast area. Maybe I didn't pay attention to the description, but it is "SWEETENED original". The fist ingredient is SUGAR. This does not taste like coffee mate... more like sugar water. Also, I thought a size this big would last quite a while but the experation date was only 3 months from the date I got it and it says use within 30 days of opening. Guess I'll have to keep buying the small non-dairy creamer packets that do not need refrigeration. This was quite a let-down and I usually love Coffee-Mate.

review/summary: Zoey loves them!
review/text: I've heard how stinky tripe can be, but these tripe treats have about the same "stinkiness" level as the dried beef lung that I've given to my little sheltie.  Not too bad.  Just in case, I do give these treats to my 30 lb sheltie on her "meal blanket" to keep any tripe bits or tripe-scented drool off the carpet, because my dog would lick the carpet for days.  (When I gave these to her on our wood deck, she licked the deck for a few minutes afterward until I pulled her away.... ow, tongue splinters!)<br /><br />So, Zoey gives these treats two paws up.  It takes her about 2 or 3 minutes to eat an entire treat (she chews her food thoroughly, she's not a gulper).  I give her one treat a day, and it hasn't adversely affected her stools at all.  Her tummy accepted it into her diet quite readily.<br /><br />There were 15 treats in my 5 oz bag, each 5-6" long.  A couple were thin (a little thicker than a pencil), but most are quite thick, at least as big around as my thumb.<br /><br />Sitstay.com is a great store, I've always had stellar service from them.

review/summary: Terrible Smell - But Dogs Go Crazy for Tripe!
review/text: I can't understand how something that smells so terrible to humans can be "so loved" by dogs??  I have been using canned tripe and thought that these would be a good treat, especially when we are traveling on the road.  I know that there are tremendous healthy benefits from green tripe (enzymes) and this product is a bulls-eye.  A healthy supplement to a dogs everyday diet.  I particularly like that these treats are stick-like and similar to jerky, which gives the dog some time to consume rather than a small "treat" - although I know I can break into pieces, it's much more effective to use whole.  Product is 100 percent green tripe and nothing else - I noticed that they reduced the price on this product since I placed my last order - much appreciated!  Be warned to keep the bag pointed away from you when opening, otherwise you'll be exposed to the smell......

review/summary: Dogs love this stuff
review/text: My girls love this stuff however, I can't say the same thing for myself. The first time I opened a package I ended up flinging it outside while the dogs fended for themselves. The smell really stung and I lost all sense of purpose for my life. I'm saying this because there needs to be careful preparation on your end before you open a package. You will need some gloves or paper towels and a gas mask or hold your breath. The smell compares to nothing I've ever witnessed. It smacks you in the face (twice) so you should under no circumstances open the package in the house. It will linger! Once you open the package do not reach in with bare hands! That is what the gloves or paper towels are for, but remember you need to be holding your breath. I give this 4 stars because of the various lengths and widths. Being that I have two dogs it's hard to pick two that match and the smell prevents you from looking that long. Other than that, it's an awesome treat!

review/text: My boxer absolutely adores these. The only problem is that they STINK. The smell seems to be one of the perks for my dog as the smell when I open the bag brings him from another floor of the house with drool streaming. As long as he stays off my furniture with them I'm ok with the tripe. He takes about 4-6 minutes to finish a piece. My boxer uses his feet when he eats so his feet and breath smell of tripe for several hours afterward. My dog has a sensitive stomach but these haven't given him any trouble at all. I recommend these to anyone but beware the stinky kisses afterward!

review/text: These are a good wholesome product and dogs love them. BUT they smell worse than canned or frozen "green" tripe that is thawed. They smell VERY, VERY strong and I consider myself quite tolerant of beefy, fatty, fishy, farty smells. They might smell as bad as or worse than a dog who has just expressed his anal glands. Sorry to be disgusting but they smell like a sweaty, dirty butt crack. They must be given outside and handled with gloves. BEWARE.

review/text: Thought I would try a different kind of tripe. I bought Evanger's Freeze-Dried Beef Tripe Treats for Dogs and Cats last time, and boy I wish I'd stuck with it. This stuff is repugnant. I know I know, it's not for me, but I can barely take opening the bag and the smell won't come off my fingers even with dish soap and it lingers on a hot day in the house. I don't have a yard to feed the dog outside, so that's not an option. The dog enjoys it, but the cat is insanely jealous but she won't and probably shouldn't eat it, as it's hard and sharp kinda like a pigs ear. Evanger's Freeze-Dried Beef Tripe Treats for Dogs and Cats is softer, more natural looking and isn't oily and doesn't stink anywhere near as much as this stuff does! Oh it's soooooo gross! Ok for the price and it is gluten free and all that but I just can't take the smell, bleorg.
