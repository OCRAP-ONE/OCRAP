review/summary: Product shrinkage
review/text: Ever feel like you've been ripped off? I received my order today for a bag of 360 Tootsie Roll Midgees.  Thought I did all the necessary research when I ordered but like the old saying "Fool me once "<br />A regular bag of Midgees from a store like Wal-Mart or Publix comes in a 12oz size and contains about 50 Tootsie Roll Midgees selling for $2.50. This bag stated it contained 360 pieces and sold for $10.90 so to me it was a better deal.  What I failed to take into account was the corporate rip-off of "product shrinkage".  I figured a Midgee was a Midgee but the Midgee from the 360 bag was HALF THE SIZE of those from the smaller bag. Buyers beware of this DEAL.

review/summary: Great Taste - Didn't Even Miss the Sugar
review/text: No complaints with this product.  I had a hard time even telling that it was sugar-free.  You have to kind of learn through trial and error how much syrup to use to get the taste to your liking, but once you're dialed in, it's superb.  A bit pricey, but I'll probably buy it again some time as a treat.  Don't know if its required, but I keep the in the refrigerator after I open it, and didn't notice any degradation in flavor.

review/summary: Good product, not good vendor
review/text: This product is a perfect substitute for the syrupy, cloying sweetness used in commercial mocha drinks. It makes a very satisfying home-brewed white mocha espresso drink. I buy it by the case if it is affordable.<br /><br />I purchased this recently from DiabeticFriendly LLC, who advertised a case at a great price, with shipping at an appropriate $29.81. Vendor sent me ONE bottle (@$10+ yikes!!! over twice the cost of Lollicup per bottle) and charged the Amazon shipping rate ($29.81)for a case of 12 bottles. When I contacted vendor, he got nasty and accused me of trying to rip HIM off. I had to contact Amazon repeatedly, before the vendor refunded, but the vendor continued to send nasty emails calling me names. Check out his reviews. . .it looks like he blames the customer when they complain about his high shipping charges. As well they should complain, Amazon has set shipping-by-weight that the vendor is required to follow. IF the product is listed correctly by the vendor, then shipping should not be in dispute or excessive. I would never have purchased from this vendor if he had listed the product correctly.

review/text: This is definitely not sencha to me. I don't know if there's some formal definition of what sencha is or if any green tea that grows in Japan classifies as sencha. But this is possibly one of the worst green teas (and definitely the worst sencha) I have ever tried.<br /><br />The bag has a fine powder inside, nothing that would resemble a tea leaf. As judging from the taste, this powder is swept from the floor of a bad green tea factory.<br /><br />By the way, the photo of product here is NOT what was delivered to me, though the brand and descriptions are correct.

review/summary: Tea for the Middle Class
review/text: I have been a fan of Lipton's tea for more than 40 years.  As other teas have gained in popularity, I have managed to stay with my favorite.  I also admit that I prefer the unsweetened without lemon flavor, but presweetened with lemon is my second favorite choice.  I also prefer the fully caffeinated ice tea mix.  There are decaffeinated versions available for those who are unable to handle caffeine.<br /><br />Thomas Lipton, a native of Glasgow, entered the tea business in 1890, with the goal of making tea affordable.  In 1893 he established the Thomas J. Lipton Co. in New Jersey.  In 1915 Lipton was incorporated with Thomas Lipton as its first president.<br /><br />While it is uncertain as to when ice tea was first invented, it was offered at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, and became an instant hit.  When I was a child growing up in Kansas City, there was nothing like a cold glass of Lipton Ice Tea after being outside in the hot Missouri summer.  Green tea may offer qualities that black tea does not, brewed tea may offer a truer flavor, but I still like good old instant Lipton Ice Tea.  I must go now as I am getting thirsty for a glass of Lipton Ice Tea.

review/text: Summer is coming and ice tea is my favorite summertime beverage.  Lipton has always been my favorite tea and Amazon had a special and I bought these.  What came quickly are two large containers of tea.  I prefer tea over soda in the summer.  Plus, when I am barbequing and getting everything ready, having the instant tea right on the counter, I can make my beverage quickly and still serve dinner at the same time.  Thanks for the quick shipment and good price on a good tasting beverage.

review/summary: Ran out of iced tea mix and needed a replacement!
review/text: My wife usually gets Nestea brand iced tea mix from Costco, but last time she went, she totally forgot to get it for me and it would be another week or two before we would go to Costco again.  So I took the chance of ordering the Lipton brand, plus it came in a pack of 2 so that would last twice as long as just 1 container.  I only paid $10.76 plus I was able to use a coupon too.  In the end the price was better than getting the Nestea brand at Costco.  Taste-wise, I like it just fine!  I definitely love my ice tea and it saves me money with the powdered mix as opposed to pre made tea.

review/summary: Price reduced- again : Price doubled - Great beverage. Refeshing option to canned drinks
review/text: I've been using this product for years and enjoy it very much. I wanted something with less sugar but no artificial sweetners.  The product is much more expensive in the local grocery stores and Costco stopped selling it. I reduce the mixture by 1/3 and it's "just right" taste for me, with reduced calories.  I refill commercial iced tea screw-cap bottles and take this to work daily. Excellent product. Buying the two-pack from Amazon is a good price deal.<br />7-25-12. Well, the amazon.com price I paid last order was very good at $10.76, but it has since doubled.  No longer a good deal. I'll go back to Safeway for $7 each ($14 for two).  Sad to drop to 3-stars.<br />8-1-12.  I see the price has dropped back to $10.76.  Now I'll reorder the product from amazon.com and move back to 5-stars. I'll also check out the regular order process that was suggested.  Thanks.

review/summary: Lipton Iced Tea 74-Ounce Size
review/text: This is the same tea I've been getting through Amazon's Subscribe and Save Program for some 4 or 5 years now -- only now I'm getting the 74-ounce size,as this is cheaper than the smaller 25-ounce size.I would have been getting this larger size earlier,but at the time,Amazon only carried the 25-ounce size.Now that they have this big 74-ounce size,this is definitely the way to go!Many stores do not carry this size.In fact,the only store that I've seen{that is,a REGULAR store,not a 'warehouse' store}that carries this size are the Commissary Stores on military bases{and you can only go to those if you belong to the military}.As for the tea itself,I'll let my review of the 25-ounce size speak here,as it's the SAME tea and everything still applies to this larger size:Been getting this{on Amazon's Shop and Save Program} for 2 or 3 years now. The tea is very good for an instant tea. It is NOT like making tea from tea bags -- that, of course, is the BEST way to get the best tasting tea! But that takes time{and to make enough in quantity} takes even more time! If you don't want to go through all that, then this is a good tea to get. Some have said that it is tart or that it tastes like lemon-aid. THAT IS NOT TRUE! This tea does not taste like lemon-aid! It is tart -- but it tastes good too! It has a good mix of taste AND tartness. As far instant teas go, this is the best I've tasted{and I've been buying this for several years now]. Other instant teas just don't taste as good. If you're looking for a good-tasting instant tea, I know of none better!<br />Just wanted to add something to my original review.I mentioned I get this tea through Amazon's Shop and Save Program.The good thing about this program is that you never have to be concerned about running out of tea.Before I joined this program,you never knew if the store would be out,or didn't order enough or maybe the warehouse forgot to order some.In fact,I always had to keep a 'back-up' tea{another brand that didn't taste as good} just in case the store didn't have the Lipton tea.With Amazon's Shop and Save Program,you never have to worry about this -- they ship it right to your door! No more keeping a 'back-up' tea anymore!And if you're thinking the store's tea is cheaper -- it's not! I priced Amazon's tea and the store's tea{same size here},and Amazon's price was actually lower! Plus too,under this program,the shipping is FREE! You can't afford NOT to get this tea through Amazon! To sum it up,this is a good-tasting instant tea and combining it with Amazon's Shop and Save Program is a can't miss deal!

review/text: I bought this as a gift for my brothers family and they absolutely love it! What a great gift to send to someone. It certainly beats giving flowers! This is something they look forward to getting every month and I can't tell you how much all of them brag about how delicious the cakes are and how happy they are to know they will be getting a fine desert for an entire 6 months. Don't be hesitant about ordering this for yourself or as a gift. Enjoy!

review/text: Gave this to my cousin and his wife the past two years.  They were very pleased with the cakes they received (and would send me pics of the cakes as they received them). Liked that we could send it quarterly, rather than monthly.  Just wish there was a little more variety in the cakes.  Nonetheless, great gift for that "difficult to buy" person on your list.

review/summary: Yummy Versatile Lentil Soup
review/text: This soup is condensed which makes it versatile and it has my favorite flavor for a lentil soup. Many lentil soups taste bland or like onions or one I tried was like bell peppers but this one is just greatt. Common ways I enjoy this soup . . .<br /><br />Regular: I like the 1 can condensed soup with half a can of water = good soup to lentil ratio<br /><br />Hearty: 1 can condensed soup, half can water, add cooked and chopped chicken breast<br /><br />Pasta Sauce: 1 can condensed soup, 1 can tomato sauce, browned ground beef(sauteed in Garlic, salt, pepper), put all in a crock put for 6 hours, flavor with pasta seasonings to your desired taste and cook for another hour.

review/summary: It's not bad as a flavoring.
review/text: Truffle Oil is a flavoring agent. And this inexpensive flavoring product is pretty decent when added to cooking requiring a fungal aromatic.<br /><br />I suppose there could be a real truffle or two or ten added per 100 gallons of olive oil, along with a generous supply of 2,4-DTP for flavor enhancement. Who knows, and really who cares given its price and use? People certainly buy vanillin instead of vanilla for baking, and that totally artificial ingredient works pretty well in cakes. And people also use other artificial flavorings from pineapple to cherry to almond in their cooking. For those dumping on the product on the chance that its been enhanced, were you expecting 24K gold for the price of Grade 2 straw?

review/summary: Actually and sadly, there's no such thing as real truffle oil.
review/text: I too was fooled, but apparently there is no such thing as truffle oil made with truffles.  They are all made with a chemical compound.  See this article from the New York Times:<br /><br />Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles<br />By DANIEL PATTERSON<br />Published: May 16, 2007<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/dining/16truf.html?_r=1&ref=dining&oref=slogin<br /><br />As the article notes, it's not possible to infuse oil with a truffles and ALL oils claiming to be made from truffles aren't. Don't feel too bad, even rather famous chefs fell for the idea.  But all of this explains the "one-dimensional flavor" of these oils.  One might argue if it tastes good then it doesn't matter.  Perhaps, but that doesn't explain why the oils costs so much.

review/text: I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that "truffle oil" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of "truffle oil" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called "Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles." Read it and weep: [...]<br /><br />And if you see "truffle oil" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes...

review/summary: Incredible chocolate for the budding chocolate enthusiast
review/text: I ordered two of these for my husband and self. We went through and tasted each one (over a few days) and tried to make comparisons and then read the labels. This is a great way to get aquainted with Pralus (and varietials) if you cannot afford to start out with the big block. Yes, they are tiny, but there is a lot of flavor and nuance in that little piece  - We're not talking stale milk flavored hershy or nasty tangy godiva here loaded with half or more its weight in sugar and milk powder! If chowing on a bag on hershys is your idea of an ideal chocolate experience, this is not for you - but should be! This small block is enough to really get a taste for it if you pay attention while you eat them, and pick your favorites if you want to order whole bars. Of course there is the matter of preference and maybe Pralus isnt right for you, but its my favorite and this nice little package can get you aquainted with the flavors of the world - the warm cocoay Africans, the sweet cool South Americans, the spicy Indonesians. It is a lot like coffee and if you love the different varieties (Im not talking Hazelnut or Carmel latte here) then you will appreciate the chocolates which do seem to have similar qualities as coffees. Even if you dont much care for dark chocolate (most big brand's dark is even worse than their milk because you can taste how bad the chocolate is) this is a good place to start as it lacks many of the off-putting tastes such as bitterness. Pralus does have a milk chocolate though (melisa) if you would rather start there.<br /><br />Pralus is FANTASTIC!!!!!<br /><br />Im not some wine snob who just gets into this so I can talk about it in The Right Places but someone who really loves chocolate and this IS Real Chocolate.<br /><br />Enjoy

review/summary: A Party for Your Mouth - TINY chocolates with superior flavor
review/text: These tiny one-inch size chocolates are perfect for indulging in for any reason. I have friends who love dark chocolate and I can't think of a better gift I could give them. After tasting these fantastic chocolates I can say I'll be buying them again and will be buying them for the special people in my life. Just don't expect these to last long. You can easily eat all ten squares in a matter of minutes. I honestly can't decide which of the ten chocolates I like the best. They are all perfectly creamy and sensuous. If you buy these for yourself you will not want to share. I'd recommend buying at least two pyramids. If you are buying these as a gift make sure the recipient loves real dark chocolate. These are not overly sweet. I think they are absoutely perfect.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

My niece was so excited to get me, my all-time favorite gift...dark chocolate! And when this arrived, she was so disappointed in the size.  It is VERY TINY (1 inch squares, stacked @ 2 inches high).  She was being so thoughtful to get me something I asked for on my wishlist. The picture is deceiving.  My precious niece kept apologizing to me, as I unwrapped the gift she had so thoughtfully bought for me.  And even I, unfortunately, did not read the reviews before placing this on my wish list, to know how small these chocolates really were.  Though the chocolate is tasty and supposedly from around the world, the cost to size ratio is very disappointing.

Of course, I do believe that if someone asked me to go back to '84 in order to scarf a "SB" cookie, I would probably retch and declare that any straight-from-the-box cookie trying to emulate a chewy, warm, fresh-from-the-oven cookie should be left to disgrace the next generation...which it has. Enter: "Chewy Chips Ahoy!" (come on, what's with the exclamation point?). This whole freshly-baked-tastin'-cookie-from-a-box deal just does not work, folks. I will admit that the chips were luscious, but I can get that from a chocolate bar anyhow. So sweet that it hurts, and so chemically touched that they should be classified as cheap cosmetics. Leave them to the eight-year-olds, before the truth dawns on them.<br /><br />Footnote: Please see my review on "Mrs. Field's" (chewy, soft, something like that) oatmeal cookies with raisins and walnuts for more ouch.

We only slept an average of 4-5 hours a night, and this tea is what kept us going. I can tell you that this product is legitimate - it tastes, smells, and works like the coca back in Peru. However, the leaves are crushed up and put into separate teabags, whereas in Peru we just put the leaves right in there. Still, better than coffee.

Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that "coca leaf" is a schedule II substance and illegal.  http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_12.htm.<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court.<br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com.

review/summary: Tea good, but bags all tangled.
review/text: The tea was really good, which I expected after tasting it at a friend's home.  I was disappointed, though, that the tea bags were all tangled, so it was a real hassle separating them to use.  They weren't in separate little packages like I'm used to when buying tea in stores. I'm ok with that, since package for them seals really well, but am hesitant to buy again because of the untangling hassle.  I would have given it a higher rating except for that.

review/text: Thank you, General Mills, for reformulating your Rice Chex. Same great taste! Same great crunch!  Now safe for gluten-intolerant folks and celiacs! (Specially Marked Boxes Only)<br />Now, if only they'd do the same for Corn Chex...<br />Oh yeah -- it is so convenient to have a case delivered right to my front door through Amazon's subscription service. I tried to find the new Rice Chex at my local grocery store, and they were out.

review/summary: Not Gluten-free.  An "A" for effort, though.
review/text: Edit:<br /><br />In some markets (or possibly all, and it hasn't reached the town I live in yet) General Mills has reportedly taken off the "Gluten Free" label.<br /><br />I'm so sad.  Now I can't sue.  That would have been a really fun class action lawsuit.<br /><br />Original review:  A lot of celiacs get sick from this.  If you are feeding this to a small child with celiac who won't really be able to tell you so, you might want to reconsider.<br /><br />While I applaud the efforts of General Mills, I think they have a learning curve:  various websites have celiacs complaining of 'being glutened' by this.<br /><br />Personally, I actually called General Mills to complain about getting sick after eating this;  they told me they test for gliadin, which is the gluten in wheat.  What they didn't say, is whether they run these cereals on lines of oat cereals.  Avenin, the gluten in oats, cannot be tolerated by 25% of celiacs.<br /><br />So, either this isn't entirely gluten free of wheat proteins, or it's not avenin (oat gluten) free.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />Edit:  STILL not gluten-free.  There are more comments from more and more people on the celiac boards about getting sick from this.  Wow.  I can hear the pitter patter of a million tiny wingtips from here.

review/summary: Back in the box with gluten-free Rice Chex!
review/text: Gluten-free breakfast is tough.  There's controversy about nearly every breakfast ingredient for gluten-free folks -- even oatmeal!  When you're on a pain mgmt restricted diet that remove juice, oxalates (most berries, acidic fruits), sugar, and starches...call breakfast downright impossible.  Gluten-Free Rice Chex have become a morning and snack savior.  They hold up well in almond milk; taste great with either regular, vanilla, or chocolate varieties of almond milk.  They work alone as a snack or can be used as a base for a gluten-free puppy chow with low-sugar peanut butter and stevia.  I'm so excited about these yummy squares that I'm exploring salty options to take on a gluten-free version of chex mix with nuts and spices.<br /><br />Downside?  Like most cereals, its pretty expensive for a box.  But, I've found that the bags are more full than expected.  Earning points via box tops to give back to schools makes the purchases feel worthy.

review/text: This is cereal is the perfect food just before bed or early in the morning. Other "healthy" cereals like Cheerios and Rice Krispies give me sugar headaches early in the morning or keep me up at night and that is never a good thing when you trying to get precious sleep. Crispix, Chex's closest competitor, tastes sweeter than Rice Chex and gives me that same uncomfortable sugar rush. A dry bowl of Chex is a perfectly filling breakfast and right before bedtime snack. It sometimes can even count for a meal for lunch all on its own. Perfect in every way.

review/summary: My comfort food for the last 15+ years
review/text: I don't even know what to say about Rice Chex... everyone knows what they are.  They are probably more famous for Chex Mix than eating as cereal with milk.<br /><br />I've been eating Rice Chex since I was in Jr. High.  Some how I started eating them before swim practice as a snack when practice was from 5-7.  Of course I didn't have them with milk, I had them with peanut butter.  You dip the chex into it and eat them one or two at a time.<br /><br />In college I would eat a bowl of chex with cream cheese for dip while I was reading in bed.  I still always keep some around the house to snack on.  They are definitely my comfort food.  I'm glad Amazon carries them!  Now I can stock up.<br /><br />On a somewhat related note, I just read last week that Wheat Chex are one of the most healthy cereals you can buy.  I guess Rice isn't quite as good, but it's still better than all the sugary cereals out there.

review/summary: Aaaahhhh, Bisto! Can't make a roast or a shepherd's pie without it.
review/text: So, ideally we'd all make gravy totally from scratch using only the pan drippings from whatever meat we're cooking, but... sometimes you just don't get that much in the way of pan drippings, and yet you want LOTS of gravy. And sometimes you're cooking, say, sausages (bangers & mash, anyone??) or something else that isn't going to result in juices you can make gravy from, and yet you still require a big jug of gravy to pour over everything. Lucky for all concerned, the marvellous product that is Bisto exists. I'm English (but have lived in the US for the past several years) and am very happy that this product is reasonably easy to obtain over here. My American husband is an enormous fan and starts to get a bit worried if we don't have at least one unopened tub of Bisto in the cupboard, lest he should want bangers & mash or toad in the hole for dinner and find we're unable to make enough gravy to float a small boat to accompany it.<br /><br />Bisto does come in a few different varieties, but the granules in the red can are the original and work really well as an all-purpose gravy. I prefer to use this version no matter what meat I'm cooking - it works just as well with chicken or turkey as it does with beef or with pork sausages, and it's an essential ingredient in shepherd's pie (lamb), cottage pie (beef), steak "pot" pie (as they call it over here), you can throw a spoonful in the crockpot when making a stew... it's very versatile and adds a lovely rich, deep flavor to all kinds of dishes.<br /><br />When making gravy, you can have a jug of the stuff ready within a couple of minutes if you do it the easy way (boil kettle, pour boiling water over a couple of spoonfuls of Bisto granules, stir quickly) but for REALLY good gravy I prefer to soften some onion and garlic in a little butter (just let it sweat over a low heat in a covered pan) until it caramelises slightly, then dump in the Bisto granules and boiling water, give it a good stir, and you will have some heavenly gravy ready to go. Only takes a few minutes. Even better is if you use the water from boiling vegetables and stir in meat juices from the roasting pan if you have some, but it works just as well without.<br /><br />The downside of this product (if you care about such things) is that it's pretty high on the sodium content and has a few artificial flavorings etc in there. As far as I'm concerned: meh. It tastes great, I'm sparing with the salt just about everywhere else in my diet, and I don't use Bisto in great enough quantities to worry about it.<br /><br />In short: Bisto is a wonderful taste of home, and while I could live without it, I'd really rather not!

review/text: I drink a lot of hoji cha (almost every day) and I enjoy this tea. It is a bit strong with sort of a grainy flavor, but still good. I recommend trying a dual brewing to see if you like it. 20-30 seconds of the tea bag brewed in hot water to bring out some body and then about 10 minutes of same tea bag infused in cold water to bring out the sweetness. A half a cup of each temperate water. Then combine the two. Works fairly well.

review/summary: Crispy and flavorful!
review/text: My sister-in-law gave this and two other flavors of Raincoast Crisps when she visited recently.  I absolutely fell in love with the Fig and Olive crisps!!  Crunchy and flavorful, these crisps make a delightful snack. Because even the smallest bite is full of flavor, I end up savoring each bite and not rushing through them.<br />It's also a guilt-free snack.  Each serving consists of 4 crisps, and is low in fat (2.5g)and relatively low in sugar as well (5g).  I have a dietary restriction that prevents me from eating high fat/ excessively high sugar treats, so these crackers were really a godsend.<br />An added bonus is that they can be stored frozen.  Just take them out, toast them a couple minutes, then voila!  I can imagine these would be really good with cheese; in fact, there are recommendations on the back of the box for the best combinations.<br />Note that they are very dry and crunchy. I would recommend eating them with light flavored tea--jasmine or chamomile.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product!! I will be sending boxes of them to my parents as gifts this fall.

review/text: I had bought these crackers at a gourmet shop in Marin and fell in love with them.  They have a wonderful mouth feel and perfect balance of flavors.  Dab a little soft blue cheese on and it's to die for.<br /><br />When I returned back home, I simply had to order some online even at a high price when you consider shipping.  I ordered two boxes to make it more worthwhile.  What I received were the two cracker boxes set loose inside a shipping box w/o ANY padding.  One box held crackers completely disintegrated into pieces no larger than M&Ms, and the other box had half in the same state.  Luckily they were for my own consumption and not a party, but I was still extremely disappointed that I basically had to eat them with a spoon like a cereal.  Not what you'd expect of a $15 box of crackers!  The seller should handle them more responsibly.<br /><br />I recommend that when you order them that you tell the seller that you insist on them being properly protected in shipping.

[*sigh ...*] at the local stores the 4-stack box is two fifty. this item is currently nineteen eighty for a sixpack. that works out to three thirty per box. eighty cents MORE for one fourth LESS.<br /><br />fooey! [*grin*]<br /><br />what i should have bought is this ...<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E52ZOE">Ritz Crackers, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />it runs to three sixty per 4-stack box. yes, it's a dollar ten premium but not a premium and _less_ product.<br /><br />another way to look at it, the price per stack ...<br />store = sixty three cents<br />this item = one dollar ten cents<br />the item linked above = ninety cents<br /><br />i doubt i'll buy these crackers again thru amazon. not at the 50% premium.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee

review/summary: Where's the fat?
review/text: Like so many products these days the new recipes are not like the old.  Due to the removal of trans fats the bakery products have taken a hit and Ritz crackers was one of them.  The crackers can't seem to hold together.  Try to spread anything on them and they fall apart.  The taste is off and not like I remember and I am no the only person who feels this way. Shortening filled the bill when it came to many bakery products. And the new replacements can't fill the bill. These crackers were so bad the only thing they were good for was feeding the crows. I would give this product zero stars, but since it fed the crows I will give it one.

review/summary: Great with chicken & veggies - add more peanuts!
review/text: I've bought this item a hundred times at my local grocery store so am excited to see it here on amazon (at a much better price!). The package includes the noodles, sauce mix, and a tiny packet of chopped peanuts. I usually add about 6 oz. very thinly-sliced chicken, a cup or two of frozen or fresh veggies (whatever I have on hand), and extra chopped peanuts as the included packet of peanuts is, as I said, VERY small. I've also added shrimp & veggies and that turned out well too. It's a quick, tasty, healthy dinner (with enough left over for lunch & sometimes dinner the next day). Note that the sauce is quite mild (which is fine with me) - if you like spicier foods, you'll probably need to add some sort of hot sauce to it. Overall very easy to make and yummy too!<br /><br />(NOTE, this was my review of the exact same product back in November of 2007 ... I think amazon stopped carrying it for awhile as my old review now says "this item is currently unavailable."  I was bummed until I searched for it and found it.  Maybe the code number changed or something, but it's the same product.)

review/summary: A few little modifications make this product AMAZING!!!
review/text: First of all, the chocolate mix MUST go in before the water.  The water cannot be boiling or it "burns" the chocolate.  Piping hot is fine.  I found that it was not quite sweet enough for me so I added just a little bit of Truvia.  Splenda would probably work too.  But the cat's meow for me was adding a quarter cup of unsweetened almond milk.  It gave it a richness and smoothness that had me practically diving into the mug!

review/summary: Delicious!  Can't even tell this is sugar free!!
review/text: King's Cupboard Sugar Free Chocolate Chunk Hot Chocolate - where have you been all my life?  Whether you want a sugar free product or not, this mix is delicious.  This product sincerely tastes like melted chocolate pieces in your coffee mug.  You would have to do a triple-take to the container to believe it is sugar free.<br /><br />I originally was looking for Carnation Sugar Free Hot Chocolate mix, but could not find it with Amazon Prime shipping -- I found King's instead and am so glad I did.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: King's Cupboard Sugar Free Dark Chocolate Chunk Cocoa is the best I've ever had, including the ones loaded with sugar.<br /><br />It is so chocolatey you can make it with water, instead of milk, and still feel that you are cheating.

review/summary: The best.  European style which has a bite.
review/text: I've been trying to make sugar free hot cocoa for my brother for years that he would actually drink. I bought him every sugar free cocoa I could find in the super markets and several off the internet and he wouldn't drink them and would go back to Starbuck's brand.  Since he drinks a ton of cocoa I wanted him to get some benefits from a dark chocolate v. the milk chocolate stuff that has all the good stuff processed out of it.  He drinks cocoa 5 or 6 times a day and that high of sugar load really concerned me.  I bought high end cocoa, both raw and Dutched, and tried for years to replicate this European Style cocoa he loved.  It has a slightly bitter finish which is more typical of the Dutched-style cocoa, what people drink in Europe and dark chocolate.  I finally found this product which he loves.  I've tried it and I honestly can't tell this is sugar free and it is certainly the best sugar free cocoa I've every tasted.  It isn't going to taste like Swiss Miss or the other American-style hot cocoa which resembles milk chocolate v. dark chocolate.  If you like dark chocolate and its slightly bitter finish you should like this product.  If you like Swiss Miss I would look for something else.  Don't use in the mico-wave as you end up with scorched chocolate chunks on the bottom of your cup.  It is much better prepared on a stove top.  Wish this stuff were cheaper but better than getting diabetes.
