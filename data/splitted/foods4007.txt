review/summary: Fanatastic Unique Sauce!
review/text: Lizano Salsa Sauce, 23.7 Fl Oz<br /> We loved this product since the 1980's when we discovered it in Costa Rica.  It really adds something extra special to your food.  In particular beans & rice (Gallo Pinto).  Now we can share with our kids this delicious treat!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes that add a little more flavor to meats or beans - anything really.  It is not spicy just very flavorful.

review/summary: finally available in the US!!
review/text: I was lamenting the low level of my bottle of Salsa Lizano this morning so decided to 'google' it, and to my suprise it was available on Amazon:) I use it on eggs, rice and beans w/kale, and so much more. Visited Costa Rica 3 times and always stocked up. Now I will have an extra bottle to share with my daughter and one to spare.<br />Salsa Lizano is a tad salty and a little goes a long way. I used to use worchester sauce on eggs but this is so much more flavorful. I had previously thought there was a fruit base to the salsa, but after reading the ingredients, realize that I was misinformed.

review/summary: Awesome food.
review/text: I've been feeding this along with 2 other Natural Balance canned flavors to my 3 cats for about 6 months now and they absolutely love this stuff. I feed the two girls each a half a can in the morning and another in the evening, my 15lb boy I feed 3/4 can twice a day. I also leave them a bowl of Blue Buffalo kibble out to snack on, which honestly they eat very little of and I am thinking of removing it from their diet. They can't wait to dig into the Natural Balance and once the bowl is down they inhale every last bit in less than 5 minutes. Their coats are super soft and shiny and their eyes are bright and shiny as well and they have crazy amounts of energy, annoyingly so at times as they sound like they're going to tear the house down with all the running, jumping and wrestling they do...even my 12 year old calico has developed much more energy and has been participating in the mayhem.

review/text: I have used this for years, especially at holiday time.  Most often for raspberry pie:  Drain a couple bags of frozen raspberries, saving the juice.  Use the juice as part of the water to make the glaze.  Cool slightly and add drained raspberries.  Turn into a graham cracker crust and chill.  Serve with whipped cream.  I have also used fresh raspberries and sliced fresh strawberries.  This makes a thick, beautiful glaze, with a good clean flavor.

review/summary: Totally disappointing
review/text: Having grown up near the French border, I've had my share of wonderful Sauces Bearnaises. And as I don't trust myself in making it myself, I often bought all kinds of ready-made concoctions over in Europe. This brand here though is an absolute disappointment. The structure of the sauce is so pasty, that you can actually cut it with a knife. The taste is of a non-descript mayonaise; if it were not for bits of tarragon and chalots, you wouldn't even make out that this is supposed to be something special. I'll certainly not spoil my salmon or steaks with this; a burger might just cover the fatty taste enough with all its other ingredients. Sorry, I feel my money was wasted, especially so after I had some wonderful freshly-made Sauce Bearnaise by a French chef yesterday.

review/summary: Bearnaise sauce -- not
review/text: I love sauce Bearnaise;  it's not actually hard to make this at home, but it does involve standing over a hot stove while slowly stirring in pieces of butter so the sauce doesn't curdle.  In a very hot summer, I thought I'd just order from Amazon instead.  Unfortunately, because I was looking to save with Prime shipping, I ordered from another seller and these reviews didnt pop up.<br /><br />There's no butter at all in this; instead, canola oil which tastes so stale that this resembles only very low quality mayonaise.<br /><br />There must be good pre-made Bearnaise out there, but this is definitely not it.  After one use we're throwing it out.  Just a pity we wasted a good rib-eye steak by putting this on it.

review/summary: A Whole New Taste
review/text: I suppose a gringo like me would think this is something completely different.  The peppers from which this paste is made are familiar, but you don't think of turning them into essentially a puree and cooking with them.  My favorite is mixing aji with olive oil and basting a good steak while grilling - gives it a whole new dimension.  It seems that even high heat won't break it down or make it bitter.  If you're not into spicy food, this isn't for you.  It's caliente, but not ridiculous.  Yeah, the shipping will probably cost more than the product - but unless you're in a the very big city, you won't find anything like this as your local grocer.

review/text: I live in Georgia, where collard greens and fresh vegetables are eaten and loved by just about everyone. I like trying new things and went to the local Oriental Market and purhcased this product. I decided to put some on some collard greens and WOW, I couldn't believe how good it was on the greens, and from then on I put them on just about all my cooked greens (collards & turnips) and peas, they are especially good on vegetables cooked with okra. This chili paste just brought out the flavor of the vegetables and added some umph to them. If you like spicy foods, then you should try adding some of this chili paste to your vegetables. You can adjust how spicy the vegetables by adding a little or a lot. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO69RY">Huy Fong Sambal Oelek Sauce, 18 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Somewhat Bitter - this company offers better products - I'd pass on this one
review/text: The overall taste of this sauce was a disappointment to me. I love many of this company's products so I was a bit surprised that this chili paste didn't taste any better. There are bitter notes to this sauce which I attribute to chile seeds, vinegar and an excessive amount of salt. Buy some dry red pepper flakes and you'll eliminate the bitterness of this sauce but otherwise replicate it almost perfectly.<br /><br />I much prefer the Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. It is not only hotter but it has a wonderful sweetness to it combined with some pleasant garlic notes.<br /><br />This is a fine company but not every one of its products hits the mark. This chili paste misses the mark by a wide margin in my view.<br /><br />The product label lists (in this order) chiles (with seeds), salt and then vinegar. The vinegar and salt add a lot of bitterness. As I said - I like this company's products but not this particular one. Salt and vinegar do NOT complement chiles all that well - at least in my limited perspective.

review/summary: Great deal, but one container broke during shipping
review/text: This is really a great deal for the amount. I was happy to find such a good deal on Sambal Oelek, and was excited for my package. When it came, I opened it up and saw that one container of the 6 had "leaked" from around the rim. It wasn't packed well at all and the contents were able to move around the box with almost no padding to cushion any jarring the box would inevitably encounter during shipping. It didn't leak too much, luckily, since I also ordered 2 books that came in the same box. The rest of the jars were intact though. Anyway, Amazon just needs to pack this item more securely and away from the "walls" of the box (with some sort of cushion) so it won't move around during shipping, and it will remedy the problem. I'm still happy with my purchase! The quality is great and the price can't be beat.

review/summary: Sambal Oelek Cellophane packaging and shipping
review/text: This chili sauce is wonderful, with a fresh chili taste. It's served in many Chinese restaraunts. The problem is the way it's shipped, not the product inside the (hopefully) sealed jar. I bought a six pack of Sambal Oelek from Amazon. When I opened the box, the six pack had broken out of a flimsy cellophane wrap that tears easily. One of the jars had been jostled around so much from coming out the packaging that the safety seal had broken on the lid and there was chili paste spilled in the box and all over the containers. The six pack packaging probably would have held up if there would have been adequate air packing in the box, but unfortunately there was only one air pillow pack in the box, with lots of open space in the box. So, with the flimsy wrap and the lack of packing around it, it created the perfect environment for the jars to break open.<br /><br />I called Amazon, and they were very understanding and sent a replacement 6 pack of Sambal Oelek right away. Unfortunately, this shipment had the same type of flimsy wrap and not enough packing air pillows. But luckily the jars had just broken away from the packaging wrap without opening in the second shipment.<br /><br />You take a chance of getting open products with the shipping preparations with this order. I wouldn't take my chances with it again. I'll just buy it at an Asian market in town.

review/text: Just wanted to say that my son was premature and had severe reflux and allergies to the milk protein.  This formula was better than any other, even the Neocate.  Just a side note, the liquid formula IS different than the powder.  The liquid formula doesn't contain corn solids and the powder does.  I had my son on the powder and he would arch and pull away after two ounces (his twin sister could take about 5-6 ounces at this point and his weight was much less than hers).  I switched to the liquid and he sucked it down like he hadn't eaten in months.  It's very expensive but totally worth it in our circumstance!  The only reason it doesn't get five stars is b/c, yes, it has a horrible smell... but he likes it so I don't really care what it smells like!

review/text: My son (who is 7 months old now) has been on this formula since he was 2 months old..it was a lifesaver for us! He had colic and acid reflux. The first 2 months of his life were hard. He screamed almost constantly and my husband and I were so desperate to help our little guy feel better. Finally, our pediatrician recommended this over the phone. We braved a snowstorm to run to the store and buy this expensive formula. It took a couple of weeks but we did finally notice a difference! We found this product on Amazon and immediately signed up for Amazon prime to have this delivered straight to our door with 2 day shipping. Imagine my surprise when I went to order it today and the price has gone from $53.94 for 6 bottles to $61.20! It is no longer cheaper to purchase here on Amazon. It now equals about $10.20 a bottle and we can get it at our local large chain grocery store for around $9/bottle plus we can use coupons that Similac sends us! Very disappointed..we loved the ease of ordering through Amazon while also saving money. We've also found it cheaper to buy diapers at the store with coupons as well. Sad day for my family when Amazon lets us down!!

review/summary: PLEASE READ: This liquid is different than the powder form!
review/text: My son was having so many problems with food, we were going to a few different doctors and unfortunately had to keep switching his formula (not by choice, trust me!) I had to stop the breast milk even because he just was not tolerating the milk protein or really much of anything.  I have a super bad stomach and I was so worried I had passed it on to my son even at one month of age.  Our pediatrician gave us a container of the similac alimentum powder form and it did make a small difference however my son was still crying like he was in pain after each bottle.  I read a lot of reviews online and noticed a few people mentioning that their child could tolerate the liquid form over the powder form.  My doc knew nothing of this and i was so discouraged but figured I would give it a try.  Not joking, the first bottle of the liquid form he ate, no crying after.  I cried because I was so happy to not have my son in pain after eating for the first time.  At one point I was up north and ran out of the liquid so I HAD to give him the powder and sure enough, crying and pain immediately after.  My son is now almost 6 months old and has not had one single problem and is the happiest baby on the planet all day long now.  PLEASE spend the ridiculous amount of money for this formula because I KNOW first hand how  miserable life can be when your baby is in pain and you don't know how to stop it.  The powder form does have a corn ingredient in it that the liquid form does not have, please give it a try so you and your child will be pain free.  If it works as it did for me, you really should let others know because it is such a helpless feeling to have to go through.  Good luck!!

review/summary: Great for milk protien allergy
review/text: My daughter has a milk protein allergy and we had to switch to this formula. It's been great so far. Yes, it is more expensive than all the other formula, but there are not a lot of options if your child is allergic to cow's milk. Right now the formula is on sale (about $6.50 per bottle vs. $9 per bottle). I think it is due to the Similac recall that everything is on sale. I would stock up now if you are able! We have tried the powder version and to be honest it smells disgusting. It makes me want to vomit although the baby does not seem to care. I just can't handle it and we only use it when we are out of the house and can't keep a cold bottle with us.

review/summary: Great Product --- BUT BEWARE OF ORDERING THRU AMAZON!
review/text: We struggled to find a formula that would not upset our newborn's stomach.  He would grunt and squeal with stomach issues throughout the day.  We tried Sensitive and Soy... nothing really worked.  This finally did the trick.  We didn't encounter any issues with him rejecting it because of taste.  Although I will say that it smells a little more than the other versions of formula.<br /><br />One thing to beware of - Amazon offered this product through AMAZON PRIME and I ordered it.  They have yet to fulfill the order (almost a month later).  There are numerous vendors who are selling this on Amazon and I have had fast shipping through all of them.  For some reason Amazon just keeps stalling on shipping this product and does not give any reason when asked.  I've never had this issue with Amazon before and I am completely surprised.  The only reason I can think of is that Amazon offered it at a cheaper price and then afterwards decided they did not want to honor the cheaper price.

review/summary: great for babies with milk protein allergy
review/text: We switched our baby boy from the regular similac to this after we saw bloody stool. It is more expensive than other types of formula, but the blood cleared within two weeks like the pedi said, so it was well worth it. Our son also had reflux but this formula did not seem to help any. FYI for anyone wondering if this is cheaper than the powder- yes, it is. However, if your baby eats 32oz a day, you're basically saving $0.80 (yes, cents!) a day using powder($162.79 for six 1lb cans) vs Ready to Feed ($53.94 for six 32oz bottles). IMO I'd rather pay the $0.80 and not have to mix the stuff myself.

review/text: Our son had very very bad congestion until he started on Alimentum and now it is completely gone and we are so relieved.  We used to hear him wheezing all night long and worry all the time about him.  Now he can finally breath.  It took about 8 days for us to see results.  We couldn't get him to take any of the other hypoallergenic formulas - he would gag and throw them up but he liked this one right away.  Our only complaint is the price!  We wish it wasn't so expensive.  But it's well worth it.

review/summary: Baby Likes It!
review/text: My baby was breastfed for several months, but I decided to wean her because I was exclusively pumping. She has a milk protein allergy so we were limited to the type of formula we could give her. We tried the Alimentum and Nutramigen powder and she hated both of them and cried, spit, and choked through a bottle if there was one ounce of either of them in it. I tried the ready to feed after I read that it didn't have corn in it and the first time I gave it to her, it she drank it without an issue. Some reviewers talked about the smell, which hasn't been an issue. I think it smells fine. It is expensive, but we are able to submit the cost difference between this and regular formula for reimbursement through our health care flex spending account.

review/summary: The best formula for reflux!
review/text: After 4 months of screaming, spit up and extreme reflux-- AND 9 formulas later-- we finally found our solution!  Alimentum ready to feed was a life saver!  My baby tolerates this forula VERY well!  There's still some spit up, but it's not projectile.  And, he doesn't cry while eating.  It digests very well too!  Yes, in the beginning we did notice it had a slightly different smell from other formulas, but we got used to it quickly.  And, I don't think it's nearly as bad as many say it is.  Plus, how can you complain about smell when this formula is clearly the only one on the market that works for reflux babies or allergic babies?!?!  This saved our son and our sanity!  Great price on Amazon too!  Oh, and insurance will pay for it if you work with your doctor and insurance company.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!  So grateful it exists.

review/summary: Too Expensive & Little Help From Abbott
review/text: Excellent formula for babies with protein allergies like ours. She must be on this premixed version formula but at about $10/bottle at most retailers (Walmart has it for $6.97 but doesn't always have it in stock), the cost is WAY too high. Insurance won't help, don't qualify for WIC, and when we called Similac to try to get more coupons (already a strongmoms member but coupons decreased from about 4 to 1), they were not cooperative but offered to send a powder sample. Amazon's price wih subscription is excellent, and only .64 cents more than Walmart which is a nightmare to visit and wait on line!!!! With free shipping and Amazons trustworthiness and service, Im glad to pay a little extra to get it shipped right to home! Yay!!! No Walmartians to battle!!!!!

He was just colicky and seemed to have digestion problems with regular and sensitive formula.  Once we switched to this, there was NO spit-up and no digestion pains.  He was a happy baby - and as Similac clearly knows, parents will do anything for a happy newborn!

review/text: Our baby handles this better than any other formula we've tried.  Very little gas and spitups, plus she's growing like a weed.  Her acid reflux went away, she sleeps better, its great.<br /><br />My complaint - this stuff should not cost as much as it does.  Its a scam that they jack the price of the only formula that works for certain children, knowing parents who have no choice will have to pay for it.  Its costing us nearly $500 a month for this stuff.  The businessmen at Abbott Labs who decided to profit off children with special dietary needs should be ashamed.  I'm *certain* it can't cost twice the price to manufacture this.

review/summary: Great Product!!!
review/text: I agree wholeheartedly with some of the recent reviews below.  My son has a dairy intolerance and I had to stop breastfeeding when he was 4.5 months old.  This product was a lifesaver!!  He drinks it happily, and his symptoms, since switching to Alimentum, have subsided (knock on wood).<br /><br />That said, beware of ordering through Amazon. I ordered several cases for my baby through Amazon Prime almost one month ago & have received multiple emails telling me that the product is unavailable for shipment. Meanwhile, several vendors list the product as available on Amazon (including Amazon's subsidiary, Diapers.com). I've contacted customer service several times, but have continued to get the runaround.  I suspect that this has to do with an attempt to avoid honoring the lower list price (the Amazon prices drastically increased recently).  It's a sad sad day when Amazon disappoints.  Notably, when I've ordered the full price product through Diapers.com, it's arrived the next day.<br /><br />In any event, the formula itself has been great!

review/summary: Great Stuff - really helped w/ Fussiness
review/text: Our little man was extremely fussy - our Ped's Dr. thought it might be a milk & soy allergy, & recommended this formula. Within a few days, the hours upon hours of fussiness ended & turned into 20 minutes here & there.  He got so good we thought, "maybe he's not really allergic to soy" - so we tried a dfferent (and less expensive forumla) - mistake - we're back on the Alimentum & the little man is back to his low state of fussiness.  He's also put on quite a bit of weight, seems generally less constipated, & has less spit up.  I think we're hooked.

review/text: We discovered after trying to use a dairy based formula that our daughter had a dairy sensitivity. My sister-in-law suggested alimentum and it worked wonders. I hate having to mix the powder so we use the ready to feed and it's fantastic. We just use a sharpie to mark when we opened it so that we can keep track of the 48 hour limit. I also love that the top has a mechanism to help with opening the foil top.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish it were available through subscribe-and-save through Amazon; I have to remember to re-order every two weeks.

We even had abd x-ray done since the constipation continued to last for 7 days at a time each time, all normal.  After reading I found alot of the reviews were saying powder was different from the ready to feed.  We switched to this and within 12 hours had a pooping nonscreaming baby.  He was happy and not crying or pulling legs up constantly.  The ingredients in powder are different then the ready to feed.  Definetly worth the extra money to make our baby feel well.

review/summary: This formula is a Godsend!
review/text: My daughter has reflux and many, many food allergies. We've tried so many different formulas and this is the ONLY formula that works for her corn allergy. The powdered version contains corn (not much, but it does contain some) the ready to feed one (this one) contains none. She no longer screams when she eats and poops and her tummy is doing so much better! This is truly a formula for the most sensitive of tummies. If a sensitive formula like Nutramigen or Elecare didn't work for your baby, I would suggest trying this one. Hopefully it'll work for your baby, too!

review/summary: Happy in a Can!
review/text: Works awesome for milk-soy-corn allergy in my 4 month old son.  But did take a while to notice a difference:  5 days until colic started to disappear, 2 weeks before eczema started to improve, 2 weeks for blood to be completely eliminated from stool samples given to dr's office.  It does make him more gassy and his poop does smell horrible now, but overall he is so much happier!! :)  And the blood is gone, so that is great.  One downfall is that it is soooo expensive!!!  About $70/week and my insurance will not cover it unless he has a positive blood allergy test, which he doesn't, as the tests aren't accurate in babies so young.  And even with coverage, they would only cover 50% through a medical supply company which charges 3x as much as you can buy it at the store.  So yes, insurance coverage is a pain, worth a try though if your child needs to be on this formula.  Would try Nutramigen first to see if that works, as it's a lot cheaper.... my son had an allergic reaction to it (hives, blood in stool, colic, swelling, etc), due to the high corn syrup solid content and had to change to a corn-free formula. This is the only corn-free formula that you can buy at the store.

review/summary: Not what I had expected.
review/text: We got this formula for our 2.5 month-old boy.  He has been fussy and gassy, although his milk consumption is about 40% formula and 60% breast milk.  We were hoping this would be the solution, as sometimes he cries out in obvious pain before passing incredible amounts of gas.  It is heartbreaking.<br /><br />We immediately tried this as soon as it arrived, and it seemed like it was easier for him to pass, but then he had diarrhea that smelled terrible.  No wonder!  The product is completely foul smelling, and I tasted it and it is probably the WORST thing I have tasted in my LIFE.  I read reviews about it, and believe me, they are NOT exaggerating.<br /><br />After three days of using this formula, my son completely rejected it and chose starvation over this formula.  We had to go back to our previous formula, Similac Sensitive for fussiness and gas, which after three days of Alimentum really didn't seem to cause him much more difficulty than the Alimentum.<br /><br />We thought maybe it would help with the gassiness, but honestly, it is so terrible that I really wouldn't recommend it unless your child has an actual milk allergy and really needs it.  It smells and tastes terrible and is on the expensive side because of the processing required.

review/text: As others have noted, this stuff does seriously reek, even more than the other formulas made from dying cattle.  It does, however, stay down better than the powdered products, even the powdered Alimentum, perhaps because it's thicker.  If circumstances leave you no alternative but to supplement your baby with formula, the ready-to-feed products are handier and perhaps better-tolerated until you can get your baby onto fruits, vegetables, and grains.  If your baby tolerates the RTF soy formula, that's an obvious better choice than this stuff.

review/summary: Good but not as good as I remembered
review/text: I use to get these at grocery and convenient stores when I was a kid living in Oregon and Washington.  I was always a sucker for good peanut butter candy and remembered just loving these things.  I'm not sure if they've changed or if I just got a dryer batch but I thought I remembered the peanut butter being much creamier and this stuff is like a dry chunk.  It still wasn't bad necessarily but I was definitely not as pleased as I remember.

review/summary: Turmeric
review/text: This product is amazing and has a good quality. I have been using it for cooking and to prepare my own curry and it tastes wonderful. Turmeric is very good for our health and has many benefits when one takes it natural than in pills. I added to my milk every evening and helps me to have a relaxed sleep. It helps also to have a good disgestion if you add a little to your tea.

review/summary: BEST ENERGY DRINK
review/text: The drink itself is excellent tasting and potent (which is probably why I can not find it anywhere in my local area!).  I have found (as well as a friend) this drink to be much stronger than red bull and much better than coffee (no shakes).<br />This is by far the best energy drink I have had in a long long time.  Plus its around a dollar a can!? You can not beat the price especially if your like me spending 30 dollars a week on energy drinks from the grocery store.<br /><br />The 8.3oz can are perfect sized - just gives you the right amount (I never finished the larger ones).  Amazon is clearly the best place to find an energy drink (amongst other things).<br /><br />Shipping is fast and free (I usually get my order 2 days  -3 days following order placement)

However,my kids don't care for them-they are used to the ones you find in the stores-fruit by thefoot-types. Sometimes the Joray are drier (which I like better) and sometimes they are soft-its kind of random-these are ones from the same box-same flavor.

So very wrong. Neither myself or son could swallow these fruit rolls. They have a good initial taste and the strawberry do smell sweet but it isnt enough to make it taste good at all.It seemed like it was pureed fruit smeared onto plastic and let out to dry. Like nothing went into it. Very icky stuff (says my son).

review/summary: Best bold k-cup
review/text: After getting a Keurig I did a massive taste test of the 20 or so bold/extra bold varieties from different brands.  This was definitely my favorite - nice smooth taste, with none of the bitter/acidic/funky tinges many of the others had (stay away from Green Mountain 'Espresso').  The only other k-cup to come close was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUGY">Coffee People K-Cup Dark Roast, Extra Bold Jet Fuel for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>. (Green Mountain's other extra bold varieties - Kenyan AA, Double Black Diamond, Dark Magic - were a distant third; didn't find anything good from Timothy's/Emeril.)  If you want to do your own sampling without committing to a whole box, I definitely recommend Keurig's site - you can get 'extra bold' variety packs, as well as 5-cup samples of individual flavors.

I'm leery about trying new things, especially when they come in a case. Based on the positive reviews, I decided to give Raspberry-Lime a try. I am glad I did. I LOVE this flavor! It is now my new favorite. It's not at all strong. It has just the right amount of essence. It's terrific for a refreshing drink. It's a nice change of pace from over-sweet water beverages (even the no sugar variety). I can't recommend this enough! Try it. You won't regret it.

review/summary: Fresh, flavored water that you'll down like ... water?
review/text: I purchased Hint Raspberry-Lime flavored water on sale (~$8 a unit at the time!) to give to my father after he made a very unrealistic request - something healthier to drink at work that tastes better than plain water, without any sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I was surprised that there were any drinks that exist that do meet these standards, and the Hint brand is one of them.<br /><br />If you drink it down quickly, Hint is really expensive water that won't taste or feel any differently than plain water.  If you savor it a bit, you can definitely catch that hint of ... something.  I'm not sure I would pinpoint it as raspberry-lime, but I can definitely taste the additive, and it's not a bad flavor.<br /><br />If you're as picky as my father about what you'll allow into your water, and you won't drink it plain, then Hint is definitely a good alternative.  I would suggest waiting for another sale, though, because it's ridiculously expensive for lightly flavored water at full price. ($1.83 a bottle!)

I cannot understand how anyone could enjoy drinking the Raspberry-Lime flavored water. It's awful. I bought it for half the usual price, and it is still way too expensive for water with a barely perceptible (or "hint") of unpleasant flavor. Do you yourself a favor, buy Fruit20 instead. It tastes much better, and costs 75% less.

His coat is GORGEOUSLY soft and shiny, and these pouches don't give him nasty gas or rowdy bad breath like some other canned/pouch foods. When I first opened a pouch, I saw that it had peas and carrots in it, and I figured those would be left behind in the bowl. Cats just...don't eat vegetables.

review/summary: Single serve snacks
review/text: We like buying single serve foods and snacks because we can control the servings and calories as well as freshness. These are great. We stock up and have a snack on hand that does not taste stale. Love Amazon because of the friendly service and fast ship.

review/summary: Correction
review/text: The person that reviewed below much think that the prices are based on 1 package as in the stores.  Amazon's prices include twice what you receive at the store.  Case in point, the price for 16 t-disks, say Gevalia Signature Blend, goes for $9.99 at the retail store but is $17.62 for 32 on Amazon, a definate savings.  My count my be off per package but the cost savings is real.  If you have a Bed, Bath and Beyond coupon that is the way to go as their prices rival Amazon's.

review/summary: Pink Diamond sea salt, lovely color!
review/text: I purchased the Pink Diamond Hawaiian sea salt because I was looking for a nice pink-salt to sprinkle on caramel, chocolates and brownies for a baker friend.<br />She loved this salt.  It added wonderful flavor and color.  It is similar to the red Hawaiian sea salt but will just a little less red alaea clay.<br />I tried on grilled chicken, also great!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LKXDRM">Palm Island Premium Pink Diamond Sea Salt, 6-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>
