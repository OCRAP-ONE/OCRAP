review/summary: Pretty weak
review/text: Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but in order to make this taste like more than water, I had to steep 2 bags for about 20 minutes.  OK, that's probably an exaggeration--I actually did steep it for 20 minutes with 2 bags and that was about the right strength, but maybe it would have tasted good after less time.  I steeped 1 bag for 5 minutes and it was super weak.  But it's pretty tasty when it's strong enough.

review/text: This might be a good coffee if purchaced fresh, but due to poor packaging I was unable to properly judge that assumption.<br /><br />This coffee is packaged in unsealed (not airtight) bags.  By the time I received it, all aromatics had evaporated off, yeilding an aromaless (and subsequently, flavorless) cup of medium-bodied warm water.<br /><br />Until Camano Island can come up with airtight packaging, it should be avoided.

review/summary: Finally A Good Store Brought Rub
review/text: This is so good I actually brought several bottles to always have on hand. I have tried others that were ok, but not great. Either they were too salty, peppery, or too much of the ole brown sugar, and nothing in between. I made countless rubs at home that were ok, but not like KC. If I could find out the exact proportions via the Internet I would make up a huge batch.<br /><br />I have used this rub on chicken, pork, fish and shrimp and it is wonderful. It is not in your face over powering if you get heavy handed applying the rub. I brought one rub, put it on, and after I cooked the meat, I had to literally wash off the rub.Some rubs work well with say chicken, but not fish.<br /><br />The slight golden color makes the food look appetizing. I have made rubs that turned dark brown, red, and even black, not exactly eye candy.<br /><br />I like to grill and smoke and this takes all the hassle and guess work out of what rub to use on what.<br /><br />My wife isn't keen on rubs, but this one she likes.

review/summary: Best Multi-Purpose Grilling Seasoning/Dry Rub money can buy
review/text: I use this on all meats (beef, pork, turkey, chicken, etc.) when I'm grilling and not using BBQ sauce.<br /><br />I rub it on the raw meat just before putting it on the grill.<br /><br />It also has much less salt than other similar grilling seasonings, but is better tasting than the ones with no salt.<br /><br />I recommend it for both indoor and outdoor grilling.  I think it would work well for baking also, but I have not tried that way yet.<br /><br />My wife and I have tried several different types of seasonings (including higher priced ones found in small specialty stores that make their own in small batches), but we keep coming back to this one because it has the best flavor.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.  We now buy it on Amazon because we can't find it in stores.

review/summary: Tazo Wild Sweet Orange Tea
review/text: I had been buying this tea, one box at a time, in the super market, for a long time. When I saw that it was carried by Amazon, I decided that it was easier to buy the tea in a larger quantity, and have it delivered to me.<br /><br />The orange tea is a light, refreshing beverage, which I find extremely satisfying.  I would have given the product itself five stars, except for one problem. Every once in awhile, the tag or the string separates from the tea bag, which I find very annoying.<br /><br />As for the product itself, I. Think that it Is great tea. Tazo also makes Passion, which is another favorite.

review/text: I started drinking this Wild Sweet Orange tea when I was trying to reduce the amount of coffee (plus sugar) and "boring" teas (plus sugar or honey). This is a very flavorful tea that can be enjoyed without adding sugars and is also great in the afternoon (or evening) for those who are too sensitive to Caffeine. (Coffee in the afternoon and I will not fall asleep until morning.)<br /><br />It is one of my favorite teas and does not have a too "exotic" or overly "herbal tea" type of flavor.<br /><br />In the summer adding a few ice cubes to this makes a great substitute for a plain glass of water.

So, good thing I bought it in bulk!<br /><br />It's not exactly orange-y as much as it is citrus-y.  The licorice is also very noticeable.  Combined with lemongrass, this makes for the perfect sick-time tea.  The aromatics are good for the sinuses, the mint is good on the throat.  I'm also told it's great with spiced rum, cognac, brandy, et cetera in the winter.

review/summary: If you love sweet and salty snacks, this really hits the spot
review/text: I bought these at my local RiteAid to try and am now hooked. The combination of sweet and salty is something I usually crave. This isn't for everybody, but I think M&Ms has really got a winner here. The sweet part of the snack are Peanut MMs and Shortbread Cookies. The cookies are indeed sweet, but not overpowering and have a rich buttery flavor that I think enhances the overall mix. The cookies aren't soft, so they add a good crunch to the mix. The mix tends to settle, with lighter objects (the pretzels) landing on top and the MMs on the bottom, so be sure to mix it before grabbing a handful to be able to fully experience the perfect balance of sweet and salty. I've tried the dark chocolate and milk chocolate mix, but hands down my favorite is Peanut. Milk mix was too sweet and so was Dark mix with the raisins.

review/summary: Great Deal; A Bit Small
review/text: I bought two packs of these candy bracelets for my upcoming 21st birthday party, and on the whole, I'm very pleased. It's a great deal for so many, but like another reviewer stated, they are a bit small and meant for kids. I just tried one to test it, and it did fit around my wrist without being uncomfortable, but there were definite gaps between the candy pieces, and my wrist is the average adult female wrist. The candy itself tastes good, and there are flavor differences between colors which I really appreciate. I was going to give the product 4 stars because they're not really big enough for adults, but considering if they were any bigger then they wouldn't fit on a child's wrist, I'll deal with the gaps (plus they really are very tasty.)<br /><br />PS Like yet another reviewer stated, they are individually wrapped which makes them perfect for pinatas, Halloween candy, party favors etc.

review/text: I have bought this tea wherever I could find it and am very happy to find it available through Amazon.  It has been my favorite tea since we lived in Holland in the '70s.  It is delicious hot or iced.  The real peel in the tea blend makes the difference. The other flavors are also good - I love the peach and my granddaughter's favorite is the strawberry.

If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of "softens" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!

review/text: This is my first bag of chai tea and I have to say, it's extremely strong if you try to drink this straight. I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/text: My adult daughter is "into" saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea "the old fashioned way".  She realized with the first brewed cup that loose tea has a much fresher, intense flavor than teas in a bag. I doubt that she will go back to using tea bags again and will probably research and request more Stash tea products in the future.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

review/text: Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.

review/text: ****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****

review/text: i was a die hard Teavana fan until they discontinued (retired) several of my favorite teas<br />including Assam Gold Rain FTGFOP though i had some left i decided to give this a try and was<br />pleasantly surprised, it is full bodied w slight astringent qualities balanced by sweet notes at<br />the start w a nice malty finish.<br />i drink it straight up w raw sugar &/ or raw honey.<br />it is about the same price as Teavana's Assam was (if you buy it on Amazon) i will be buying more soon<br />my friends and family love it also by the way.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I've only done this tea as a cold brew iced tea. There is no bitterness, just a smooth, refreshing, green taste. The ginger is very strong. I love ginger, so that is no problem for me. A second brew was significantly weaker, so I will stick to one brew per batch of leaves with this one (I am able to get three quality brews from many green teas).

review/summary: weak Earl Grey
review/text: This tea is a disappointment because its flavours are weak.  It takes about double the amount suggested to brew a proper pot.  The packaging is green, but that does not make up for the weak tea inside.  If you do not like a strong, traditional bergamot flavour, then try this one.  You might like it, but I did not.

review/summary: A lovely tea
review/text: After having some incredible green tea with ginger at a restaurant, I began my search for something similar. I eventually decided on this tea, and I'm very happy with it. It's very smooth and has great flavor that's not dominated or overpowered by the ginger or lemongrass. I also agree with the previous reviewer that this works wonders for an upset stomach. The price is also very fair, given the high cost of quality loose leaf teas.

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/summary: Sweet Jasmine
review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

I can brew it, put it in my travel mug, go to the gym and an hour and a half later it still tastes great!  Can't beat the value either at about $5 a bag.  If I recall correctly it is about $7 at the Stash store in Oregon.  This is the tea that got me drinking green tea!

review/text: This has become my favorite Stash tea.  I liked the Earl Grey, but the Double Bergamot Earl Grey is twice as good!  As to whether or not it tastes like 'real' Earl Grey, who's to say?  They're all a little different.  But if you like Earl Grey, this is DEFINITELY worth a try.

review/text: Most Earl Grey teas taste similar. This product has a sense of freshness that reflects Earl Grey at its best, and is reasonably priced. To those who do not regularly use loose tea, the tea bag (Teebeutel, sachet) definitely does not taste as crisp and refreshing as the comparable tea when brewed as loose tea.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.

review/text: I am not a real connoisseur of loose teas, but I do like decent black tea with no added flavors, just loose black tea like indian or ceylon teas or maybe some blends like irish or english breakfast. This is a perfect example - relatively inexpensive but good tasting with full, rich flavor. Perfect for someone who would not settle for teabags, but is also not into exquisite expensive teas.

review/summary: Jasmine Green Tea.
review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx

review/text: I recently started drinking loose tea instead of bags. I was buying the jars from my health food store, but they are pretty expensive. I am always looking for a better deal, so when I found these on Amazon, I decided to get them. I gave one to my mom, and one to my brother. I kept one for myself and I think it is going to last me awhile. Since I don't know all that much about teas, I can't comment much on the quality but as far as I know it is good! It seems comparable to the same stuff I got in the smaller jars. Recommend :)
