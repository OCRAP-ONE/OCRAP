review/summary: Great snacks! My toddlers fav
review/text: These have been my son's favorite snacks since I had first bought them almost 1 year ago. They're great for tiny fingers and for little ones learning to self feed. They fit perfectly into a diaper bag/purse so you can have one on you at all times. They're great with little one's meals or just a simple snack. The ONLY downfall is that they're a bit messy. After eating them I always have to find that I'm cleaning my son's hands of crumbs, but that's with everything. HIGHLY recommended.

review/summary: Better buy a few extra cans...
review/text: My child, in a word, literally inhales these things! They smell & taste great and i would expect them to have a higher sugar content but they're actually a pretty good snack alternative, esp in comparison with fish crackers, cheetos, etc... You may find yourself sneaking a few :)

review/summary: My toddler LOVES these!  I wish they made these for adults as well.
review/text: These may not be the #1 healthiest snack for toddlers, but they are very good.  The flavor is perfect.  It's not too strong, nor too bland.  They have a touch of salt, but it's not nearly as salty as many alternatives.  They are just the right size for little hands.  They're crunchy, yet dissolve easily.  In fact, these were my toddler's first finger food.  I often like to go with store brands to save money, but I've found that the taste of these is quite superior.<br /><br />As my toddler is getting older, I'm not buying these as often as I used to since they are expensive.  However, when she was still in the early stages of eating table foods, these were awesome.  I'm actually a little bummed that I'm not going to be getting them all that often anymore.

review/text: My toddler loves these and she has since she first tried them. She would eat an entire can in one sitting if I would let her. They are also great for teething, which is not something I anticipated. They are not the healthiest snack out there but they work great at pacifying an angry toddler stuck in her car seat.

review/summary: My son LOVES crunchies!
review/text: I bought these for my son to try, and he absolutely loves them! He's also tried the maple flavored crunchies, but prefers the veggie dip. His breath smells a little like garlic after he eats, them, but I'm not a vampire, so I don't mind. Ha ha! I call them baby cheetos, although they are very soft for toddlers learning to self-feed. I signed up for Amazon's subscribe and save program to get a pack of 6 of these every 2 months. I love the program and hope they keep adding more items to it. It's an easy way to keep those constantly used items in the house. I know as he gets older, we'll stop the subscribe and save, but for now, he loves them and eats them like crazy so I'm glad I don't have to worry about running out!

I actually like that they are bigger and easier for my babies to hold.  The puffs were too small and were harder for them to pick up and get into their mouths.

review/summary: Some are too big!
review/text: My son is now 9 months old, he has been eating finger foods for a few months now. We first purchased the Gerber Graduates Mild Cheddar & he loves them! They do just melt in the mouth, perfect because he only had 5 teeth at the time. The only negative I have for these is some of the puffs are fairly large! If I give my son a handful of them, he stuffs them in his mouth, so the larger ones make me nervous. I ususally cut them in half. My new find would be the Target Up & Up brand - they are fairly cheaper & they are all the same size (perfectly smaller) So from now on, I will be saving a few bucks, and using those!

review/summary: DO NOT DISSOLVE-CHOKING HAZARD
review/text: Great in theory...healthy, organic, etc. ... however, this product does not dissolve in babies mouth NOR in Mommy's mouth.  My child, 7 months old, put one in his mouth, he has two teeth, tried to bite it, it did not break...he then sucked one for about 2 minutes then ... just like a kid...placed another in his mouth.  Reminding you, the reader, I was right there when this happened...he began to choke!  I lifted him out of his highchair, turned him around, did the Heimlich maneuver on him...he blew one out and then I pulled the first apple wagon out of his mouth.  On a lighter note, he's fine, prefers the puffs and whole grain cereal...but the dog couldn't even chew these!!!  We do, however, have friends, with a baby girl...same age...and she loves these!!!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBU2CO">Happy Baby Gluten-Free Organic Puffs, Sweet Potato Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: Thank you Gerber, for helping us get our kids off to the right start!  Why should we parents take the time to prepare healthy snacks for our children and teach them to like REAL food, when you have Baby Cheetos in a can for them to enjoy?  One-third of America's children being overweight or obese simply isn't enough -- we need to strive for more.  America's kids need to learn to fill up on empty calories and eat for boredom, not hunger, starting at a year old or younger!  And thank goodness this product "tastes good" -- because that's all that matters, right?

review/text: I tried many, many times to make authentic Hong Kong style milk tea at home, to no avail. My tea cabinet at home overflows with varieties of tea. I read pages and pages of testimony and learned about how Hong Kong cafes have secret 5-tea or more blends, and the practice of adding eggshells to the pot when brewing. I could not replicate anything near my favorite milk tea, until I used Rickshaw. No blending with other teas needed, just boiled Rickshaw with one clean eggshell, added evaporated milk and condensed milk, sugar to taste, and voila! Real Hong Kong milk tea.

review/summary: Mixed Review for Mix Flower Bouquet
review/text: I ordered two bouguets for two different members of my family for Easter.  The first order was delivered promptly and in perfect condition.  Flowers were gorgeous (or so I was told).<br /><br />The second order was also delivered promptly (apparently), but FEDEX did not ring the doorbell or knock to deliver them.  Instead, they left the flowers on a not-too-often-used porch in 20 degree Michigan weather.  They were discovered 2 days later - in poor condition.<br /><br />My parents were home all day - both of them.  If FedEx had tried to notify them of the delivery, someone would have heard them.<br /><br />No refund was granted by the company.<br /><br />I believe the company has beautiful flowers, but the use of FEDEX as the delivery service failed them in this case.  I will not purchase from any flower company in the future that uses FedEx or UPS.  I will choose a company that uses a local florist shop for delivery.  A local florist shop will call if they are unable to deliver.<br /><br />I'm disappointed that Falcon Farms did not offer to replace the flowers or issue a refund.

review/summary: Great company, great flowers
review/text: I inadvertently gave the wrong delivery address for my mom's Mother's Day flower bouquet delivery. The flowers were delivered on the Friday before Mother's Day as promised but were delivered to a house down the block. The fine folks that lived there kept the flowers and made no attempt to get the flowers to my mother. Mom was able to retreive the flowers four days later and she said the flowers were beautiful and still in good condition. Falcon Farms offered to send another bouquet at their expense but mom said the original ones were fine. Falcon Farms refunded the full FedEx delivery charge at their own volition. I will definitely use this vender again.

review/text: I received this very nice bouquet of flowers. They arrived fresh and ready to go in to the vase (after reading prep directions first). Very colorful. Just wish there was maybe one more rose or lilie and or maybe two more gerber daisy's to make it look a little more nicer. Otherwise, very nice. Priced right for what you get.

review/summary: Fresh flowers, look terrific, fast delivery, but be aware of $11 shipping
review/text: I had these flowers sent to my Mom for her birthday, and they arrived right on time. She says they look great, and there are so many, that she made two very large bouquets out of them.  She received them yesterday and a few flowers hadn't bloomed yet, and but they opened overnight, which shows you how really fresh they are.<br /><br />Just as an FYI: be aware of the shipping charge. I had thought these would be 'included' in the 'things that ship for free' from Amazon, but no, since the flowers are from another vendor, there's an $10.99 fee. It's worth it, for timely, beautiful flowers, in large quantity.

review/summary: Yummy, Full of Fiber and a Good Value
review/text: This extra large size of Frosted Mini Wheats is an economical, tasty way to get a whole bunch of fiber into your diet.  Mini Wheats are a great deal like Triscuit crackers, only the biscuits are sweet instead of salty.  The cereal appears to be some kind of extruded wheat threads stuck together into a tiny pillow and baked.  That sounds horrible, but these are among the tastiest of breakfast cereals.<br /><br />One gotcha is that they become soggy in milk in a very short time, but it's an easy matter to eat the cereal dry with milk on the side.  Dunk if you wish.<br /><br />That's about all I can think of to recommend a breakfast cereal that you have probably eaten since you were a child.  Back then, you ate Mini-Wheats because they tasted good, and now you eat them because they are good for you. Pity that there isn't a little plastic toy in the package.  :-)

review/summary: It seemed to choose me
review/text: On a friend's recommendation, I tried one can of Verve.  I was skeptical because it was carbonated, and I've given up sodas.  Simply put, I drank it to be polite.  The taste was refreshing and the carbonation was very light, but still too close to soda for me to be comfortable.<br /><br />The big surprise was that the next day, I wanted another one.  I even felt like I needed it.  This has only happened to me once before, and that was when I juiced carrots/apples/celery for the first time.  I began having moments when I craved carrot juice, usually in the afternoon.  The same thing happened with Verve.  I felt like I needed the vitamins/minerals it provided.  The bad news was I had no idea where to buy it, and my friend was out of town on business.  Because of my lack of curiosity the previous day, I had to get on the phone and calling all over town to find it.  Annoying.  I did find it, and now I keep a week's supply in the refrigerator to drink one every day.  I am a HUGE fan, and feel like it is part of a healthy routine.  It has mangosteen, and that alone is a reason to drink it.

review/summary: Better than the orange stuff
review/text: I give this product four stars because it adapts well to incorporating other ingredients, with very little extra trouble.<br /><br />When made strictly according to package instructions, it's a creamy macaroni and cheese type dish which tastes a bit better than the orange mac-in-a-box which we all knew as kids (seems much less salty, also, even when I use standard margarine rather than the unsalted butter it calls for).<br /><br />However, when you cut up fresh broccoli and throw it in the pot where the pasta is 3/4 cooked, saute minced garlic in the butter or margarine in the pot for a minute or two before adding the drained pasta and broccoli back in, and add extra milk and some grated parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper along with the sauce packet, you get a one-pot entree that tastes very good now and will heat up beautifully in the microwave for your lunches throughout the week (if you make two boxes at once, at least!).

review/text: I have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is my favorite.  The K cups perform well unlike another brand whose name I won't mention (WP) and the flavor is much bolder than every other brand.  Green Mountain used to have a bold one but it was discontinued except in sample packs (with other flavors).  This coffee has a nice taste, too.  I just wish I could find it locally and for less money.  You used to be able to get a bundle of large boxes from Amazon but they're not currently available.  I think this was the best price I could get but was disappointed when I received my 3 tiny boxes - if you overlooked it these boxes only contain 12 K cups each.  I'll keep looking for better value but in the meantime I can still enjoy a good cup of coffee made at home.  I gave it only four stars because of the price but I do recommend this coffee.

You  get what you pay for so stay away from the high costs of the local grocery stores. Shopping online has it's advantages.<br /><br />Just a note: The coffee (taste) is superior to any flavor I've tasted in the past 4 years.

review/summary: Overpriced but delicious
review/text: This is my favorite K cup coffee I've tried so far.  I thought it was over priced and then I had to pay shipping so it won't be one I buy often.  When you add the cost of shipping this is a very expensive coffee.  5 stars for the product, 1 star for the price, so I'll give it 3.

review/summary: Nice cup of coffee - but the price OMG
review/text: I bought this coffee when it was on special on Amazon.  I liked it, my wife loves it. BUT when I went to reorder it  - I balked, the price was a lot more.  I guess I'll just have to use a hazelnut creamer on my regular coffee.

review/summary: Don't Blame Amazon!  (good coffee, BTW)
review/text: I've long been a fan of Millstone Hazelnut coffee. It is a welcome pleasure that it is now available for Keurig coffee makers in a k-cup.<br /><br />I've tried all the other hazelnut k-cups. What I found with them was an almost pungent, smack-in-the-face artificial flavor. These k-cups, however, offer a subtle more subdued, almost creamy, even flavor and taste.<br /><br />To comment on the price:  I too was lucky enough to get it at the .40 a cup price.  Don't blame Amazon on the price/availability increase.  I've noticed a lot of (unfavorable) changes in regards to the pricing and availability of k cups on Amazon.com.  I emailed Amazon customer support and inquired about the changes.  In there words, "Due to a change in the manufacturer's distribution policies..." was the reason for the price/availability differences lately.<br /><br />Too bad, too.  I hope the manufactures get the acts together.  In my opinion, it behooves companies to work with Amazon, not against it!

review/summary: Will now purchase elsewhere
review/text: Great job sucking us in! Great flavored coffee, could become my new favorite. Much bolder and darker roast than most other flavored k-cups. However, I too purchased at lower price (3 packs of 12 cups for $15 - bargain!) but find the new price absurd. Perhaps the marketing plan was to offer the new product at low price to entice the bargain hunters to try it and discover they love it. That part worked! Unfortunately for Amazon & supplier, the 2nd half of plan (raise price to over double $ of anything else) is a FAIL. Will not purchase this product from Amazon until price is reasonable and competitive. Shame too, love buying via Amazon. Love this new K-cup, but someone else will benefit from this pricing disaster.

review/summary: Shin Ramen punches the faces off of hangovers.
review/text: Shin Ramen is by no means a healthy snack. For those without a degree in Food Science (with an emphasis in Junk), I'll summarize the ingredients for you:<br />1. Salt<br />2. Spicey<br />3. Freeze dried vegetables, etc.<br />4. More salt<br />5. Noodles<br />6. MOAR SALT<br />7. MOAR SPICEY<br /><br />Why then would a competing combat athlete and full-time professional such as myself subject their body to the gauntlet of toxins that this delectable soup has to offer? Well, dear reader, this competing combat athlete and full-time professional fancies himself an alcoholic beverage to take the edge of the next 14 alcoholic beverages. You see, I am also a competing combat boozer and although I am Terminator in most regards, even the mightiest of us fall - and how hard do we fall.<br /><br />Now, one could drink water and tea, rehydrate and re-electrolite'ilyze themselves back to health, but that takes too long. Sometimes a dedicated combat boozer has to go all Barry Bonds and take that "vitamin b shot" that makes them hit the ball farther and run faster even though they're ten years older. In this case, Shin Ramen would be the dodgey supplement in question and I recommend the bowl because if you drink like I drink, you will be in no mood to muss with a bag and will want to get directly to fighting past regretting every decision you made for the past 18 hours, which is nearly impossible to do with your gut threatening to evacuate your body through your mouth.

review/summary: Tasty, Easy to Make Treat
review/text: I used to buy these years ago in packet form from an Asian grocery store near Cincinnati and couldn't find them when I moved away.  They are a proper-sized meal, very tasty (and spicy) and just need hot water.  They are quite hot (spicy) and a bit salty:  you can tone it all down by just using less of the included flavor packet.  I like to add some pouch-salmon, tuna, or some sliced hard-boiled egg to make a very nice lunch or dinner.  These are great for traveling or a quick and easy meal with no cleanup.  Cheap too!  These are in no way like the grocery store Top Ramen or Ichiban, these are the real deal.

review/summary: Great Spicy Cheesy Ramen
review/text: With the sodium and calorie content of these, I wouldn't recommend them for a daily meal, but they make a great guilty-pleasure junk food snack or meal, especially if you add a few slices of good American cheese.  The cheese thickens up the soup, and helps to cut a bit of the edge off the spice, but still give your mouth that "I just ate good spicy food" feeling.  Tasty!<br />Other additions besides the American cheese: canned or sauteed mushrooms, diced chicken tenders, sliced lunchmeat (roast beef especially), and stir-fry vegetables.

review/summary: A spicy meal or a large snack.
review/text: Shin Ramen is one of the most popular in the world for good reason.  They contain a very tasty broth mix and dried vegetables.  These spicy bowls come packed with the same contents of the Shin Ramen bags with the convenient instant bowls.  The sodium content in this as well as other imported ramens is high but it isn't as noticable in flavor as it is in the American store bought counterparts(Top Ramen, Maruchan, Smack etc...)

review/summary: BIGGEST bowl of BEEF flavored noodles!
review/text: Korean style, so I assumed (falsely) that these noodles were VEGETARIAN. Who knows what I was thinking? Anyway, this is a BIG (4 oz) bowl of spicy BEEF flavored noodles. Very yummy, but really is spicy with the whole "soup base" flavoring packet. Maybe, as others have said, go easy on the flavoring packet at first til you know what you're getting into? All the flavor is in the packet (spice isn't separate) so it's tricky. These are ramen style noodles, too, so high in fat, since ramen noodles are FRIED. What you get, tho, is a BIG hearty-appetite size MEAL in a convenient take-anywhere bowl. Per bowl: 480 calories, 14 grams FAT, 2600 mg SODIUM, 78 carbs, 4 grams fiber, 10 grams protein. (26% of calories from fat.) Made in the USA,

review/text: This product is like a cousin of the famous college era ramen noodles.  The seasoning packet is spicy so if you don't care for a hot tongue, it would pay you to only use half of the powder or eliminate it altogether.  Also, since it is in it's own container, it is easy to add cooked vegetables and/or meat to make it a more robust meal.

review/text: what can i say? this stuff is great. if you're like me and can't handle really spicy foods then don't use a full packet of the spice that comes in each bowl. i usually only use half of one then give the rest to whoever wants to add it to theirs. a full bag is pretty spicy but if you tone it down some to taste should you choose to do that then it's really good stuff. a friend of mine introduced me to it a few months back and honestly i can't get enough. i would definitely reccomend this to anybody who likes noodle soups in a cup. the spice makes the flavor of it but like i said, you don't have to use the whole packet that comes with it.

This was my favorite, so I was happy to see them on Amazon by the case and with an subscription order discount.<br /><br />These are big bowls, as the name says, and make for a good lunch all by themselves.  They are salty and spicy, so if you're looking for a genteel cup of chicken soup, look elsewhere.  This bad boy will heat you up and set your eyes to watering.

And honestly, you really don't need to use the whole packet to get the spice-kick and flavoring. Start with just half (or less, even!) and find your level of satisfaction.

review/text: I purchased both the "big bowl" and the "bag" of Nong Shim Noodle, both about the same price. However I prefer the bag version. The product is a great soup with much flavor and a spicy hot taste and lots of noodles. I modify a little by adding some cut-up pieces of roasted chicken breast to make soup higher in protein. I usually have this and other Korean soups every day for a great "power lunch".

review/summary: Good for an occasional treat
review/text: This stuff is so so so bad for you and yet, every once in a while (probably when I'm craving salt) I can't help but enjoy one. It has a fair amount of spice to it but it's all in the broth. The noodles when pulled out of the broth are actually very bland tasting so I like to put a dash or two of hot sauce (or a drop or two of sriracha chili sauce) on each bite. This is a nice thing to cook up when you're very short on time or energy but as it is so extremely bad for you, treat it like an occasional treat, not as an everyday meal and you should be good :)
