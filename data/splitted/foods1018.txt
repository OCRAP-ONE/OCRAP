review/summary: Rise Breakfast Bars
review/text: I love these bars. They taste great and have all whole, simple ingredients like almonds, honey, cashews, dates, amaranth, rice, and salt. I eat them any time of the day, not just for breakfast. It's a great snack when you are on the go. Highly recommended!

review/text: I love this variety pack of RiseBars.  They are a little sweet like some other reviewers have stated but I don't think they are overly sweet.  I like each and every flavor (except the Honey Walnut because I don't like walnuts - my sister really liked them though).  By a slight margin the Perfect Pumpkin is my favorite.  I especially like the fact that the bars don't have artificial ingredients in them.  RiseBars have become one of my favorite nutrition bars.

review/text: When this product arrived, I noticed that it said on the label that it is "PACKED BY" Honeytreehoney, but there is no information as to where it is produced. I emailed Honeytreehoney, asking them to supply that information but got no response. If you care where your food comes from (US, China, Etc.),you may not want to buy this. I won't reorder it. And I'm not sure I'll use it, either.<br /><br />The one star rating is simply an indication of my dissatisfaction for the information gap, not the taste/quality of the molasses.

review/summary: Works but tastes GROSS- still worth it though.
review/text: I feel like this product assists me in weight management as well as gives my body a real boost of antioxidents (137x that of standard green tea (wow!) - I feel healthier and feel more cleansed on the inside (if that makes sense). I have not been drinking the 3 cups per day as recommended via the instructions (and via Dr. Oz) but rather drink 1 to 2 "cups," By this, I mean that I consume 1 gram per serving which is equivelant to 1/8 tsp (it is a powder, not a tea bag or loose leaf tea). It tastes gross, unless you like the taste of grass, so I just slam it quickly. You want to use hot water because it tends to be clumpy, and the hotter the water, the more mixed it becomes. I suppose the clumpiness doesn't matter, other than it's harder to consume. I will be purchasing again. Hope this helps.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: As the reviewer before me said, this seller is shipping a can of original Cocaine and not the cut one. I was actually hoping I would receive the original version as I have never tried this energy drink and I wanted to sample it before buying a package. My overall impression was decent. The flavor was surprisingly good, a little sweet but not overwhelmingly so. It did have that tangy characteristic that most energy drinks have but I would say the cocaine flavor was definitely unique. Given all the hype I was expecting a massive burn with my first sip, but I was rather disappointed that it wasn't as intense as I had hoped. As far as the energy boost, there was a noticeable impact but it was disappointing as well. Really, I saw no discernible difference with a can of red bull.<br /><br />If I saw this drink in the store I would definitely grab a pack, it was tasty and the energy was decent. If you want to try it out ordering 1 can for around six bucks here is not bad. However, I don't think the modest energy boost was worth the cost of shipping.

review/summary: Not Cut
review/text: Of course you wouldn't usually hear people complain their Cocaine isn't cut, but "cut" in the case of Cocaine Energy drink is supposed to be the one that didn't burn. I didn't personally care as it was still drinkable and I just got the drink to try it and since these ones are individual instead of a 12-24 pack or whatever. Not sure if it was a mistake that it wasn't the cut one, or if they're just selling the regulars, but that might be relevant to people who are specifically seeking the cut version.

review/summary: Very good dark chocolate
review/text: Product: Hersheys Kisses, Special Dark Chocolate (12 oz bag)<br />Rating: 4 of 5 (above average)<br /><br />If you routinely prefer Milk Chocolate over Dark Chocolate, you can stop reading now, because this is NOT the product for you.<br /><br />Likes:<br />* Good Cocoa Percentage: Hersheys isn't very forthcoming about their exact cocoa percentage for their entire product line, but if I had to guess, their milk chocolate is probably in the range of 20-30%, and their "special dark" is probably somewhere 40-55%. Flavorwise, the cocoa content for this product is very noticeably higher than for their milk chocolate, which gives it a pleasant purity and intensity of flavor, a nice edginess, and a subtle but well balanced and lasting bite.  My personal favorite brands tend to fall in the range of 50-74% ... anything below that lacks the intensity I crave, and anything above that tends to get a little too acrid and astringent for me.  I'll go out on a limb and postulate that this range is probably the ideal cocoa range for "dark" (non-milk) snacking chocolates.  Anyway, the Hersheys Special Dark (henceforth "HSD") is right there in that ideal range of cocoa percentage.<br /><br />* Good Texture: Callebaut has a nice system for classifying the amount of cocoa butter in chocolate ... one kiss for soft chocolates that melt rapidly and are best suited for sauces and flavorings, and 5 kisses for slow-melting hard chocolates best suited for enrobing and coating, and 3 kisses for a firm all purpose body that can pretty much do everything.  I'm guessing the HSD would probably be a 3/5 on their cocoa butter scale ... a very firm chocolate, but not hard enough to be brittle.  By comparison, Herseys milk chocolate would probably score 1.5/5 (soft).<br /><br />Caveats:<br /><br />* Price: Higher cocoa content usually brings with it a higher price, in the same way that stronger coffee (like espresso) generally costs more per serving, because there's more of the key ingredient. However, fans of stronger chocolate (read: higher cocoa percentage) are used to this.  However, Hersey's price point for this product currently seems a tad high, but it will probably drop with time and increasing sales.<br /><br />* Packaging: Personally, I'm not really a fan of individually wrapped "kisses" - I generally prefer to buy callets or chunks, in bulk (ex: Callebaut sells 2.5kg sacks), which have the advantage of being good for both baking and snacking.  However, that's just my personal preference.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you like dark chocolate, and don't mind the individually wrapped kisses format, this product is definitely worthy of purchase. It's surprisingly good for a mass-market brand - a well balanced dark chocolate, with good intensity, and a nice long finish ... and at a fairly reasonable price.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/text: I have tried Natural Balance Limited ingrediant, which is supposed to be grain free; Nope.<br />I was wondering why my dog was still getting a little stomach upset after each time he had eaten.<br /><br />Then I saw this brand on Amazon, and the label loudly stated GRAIN FREE. Just what we were looking for. Since my dog has started on this regimend; 9 months he has had no stomach upset after eating this brand. However he does get a little drowsey, but I kick him into second gear by going out side, to play in the back yard.<br /><br />He also has grass allergies that got extremely irritated only after being outside for a few minutes. The red rash showed up everywhere the skin is exposed; eyelids, paws, especially his belly.<br /><br /> In conjuction with changing his diet, I also started giving his belly a rubdown of Palma Christi castor oil mostly once a week; and definitely after each bath. No soar itchy red belly in 2 years. So now with this combo of aids, I allow him romp in the grass all he wants; and he loves it.

review/summary: I buy these every year
review/text: Two and a half years ago I was searching for unique, inexpensive stocking stuffer presents and I ordered these just because the label was attractive.  I was unexpectedly astonished by the superior qualities of these peanuts.<br /><br />I'm going into my third year of ordering these peanuts for myself and hubby.  I've tried other brands of Virginia Peanuts (Virginia peanuts being the most tasty of the different types of peanuts), and what I love about The Peanut Shop brand is that when they say "lightly salted" they truly are lightly salted. The ingredients are: Super Extra Large Virginia Peanuts, Peanut Oil, and Sea Salt.<br /><br />They taste perfectly roasted, neither undercooked nor overcooked.  And you don't get that sea salt brine aftertaste like you get with edamame (boiled young soybeans and sea salt), because the peanut taste is rich and very faintly smoky.  Do a side by side comparison of Planters cocktail peanuts with these, and you will find that the Planters are not only an inferior peanut, but they taste burned and much too salty next to the Peanut Shop Virginia peanuts.  If you love peanuts and want to spoil yourself, then order these.

review/text: I discovered these almond, pecan, cashew clusters about a year ago while shopping at Sam Club's. They were sampling them with yogurt. OMG ... one bite and I was hooked! I LOVE these. My kids love them. They are PERFECT by themselves or in yogurt. A serving size (~5 bite-size clusters) is 170 calories w/12g of fat (as is expected from nuts). They are very addictive ... almost like eating candy.  Unfortunately, it's not hard to find yourself eating more than 1 serving. :)<br /><br />These are are 100% natural and the only other ingredients outside of the nuts are brown rice syrup, organic sugar, sea salt, and sunflower oil. I paid around $8 for a 24 oz bag at Sam's Club.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have been trying to reduce the amount of sugar in my diet, so I have switched to just eating raw/plain almonds, pecans, cashews and walnuts. :)

So, use discretion when you order these.<br /><br />These are not the Snickers of the candy world, but they should be.  I always found these to have a perfect mix of chocolate, caramel, and crunch.

Although I am breast-feeding, nothing is worse than a super hungry 3 month-old at a time when I cannot immediately feed him.  So, I carry a bottle and a pack of formula just in case.  I have also measured formula into ziploc baggies, but it is not nearly as easy to pour and is less convenient.

review/summary: Not bad not good.. in between
review/text: When these products were offered as the deal of the day, I read up on them and started salivating at the prospect of all that bacon taste in a jar. I also researched the J&D website to check out the nutritional info and found that all the other bacon salts except the natural one contained MSG. So I went with the natural.<br /><br />The product has a very smoky aroma, but underneath it all you can still tell it is salt - lots of salt. I think the paprika must add a lot to the sensation of bacon, as well as the smoky smell and flavor.<br /><br />I have tried this on a few things and it does give food a bacon flavor although of course it is no substitute for the real thing. It's healthier, though; while it still has lots of sodium at least it has none of the other bad stuff. It is good to use as a condiment to sub for bacon when you have the craving but don't want to spend the time making it or eating it and getting fat. I give it three stars. It is good to have around and serves a purpose, but it is nothing fantastic.

review/summary: Baconless Flavoring Powder
review/text: What a disappointment! First, this product should not have the name Bacon Salt. If you are familiar with the infused salts made for gourmet cooking with flavors such as thyme or rosemary, you will notice that this is a flavoring powder and not a salt at all. The predominant flavor is sort of a yeasty garlic and paprika with a small amount of smoke. There is practically no bacon flavor whatsoever. I tried the so-called natural product since I am allergic to monosodium glutamate. This product makes the claim "No MSG Added", but fails to inform the consumer that they have added autolyzed yeast extract instead. As anyone who is sensitive to MSG should know, autolyzed yeast extract itself contains free glutamates. It is a not so clever ruse to add MSG while claiming none has been added. Even the FDA is aware of this deception and has gone after a few of the larger offenders with truth in labeling claims.  [...]<br />My recommendation is that unless you cannot eat bacon, you might try preparing your own bacon salt at home. There are some great recipes for making things like bacon jam and spreads using real bacon and I am sure making a true bacon flavored salt would be a simple trick. The product concept is great, but the execution is horrible.

The flavor is very smoky and the salt clumps together in the bottle soon after opening. I admit that it made my home-fried potatoes taste a little spicier but I would not buy any of these products again. Instead, I'll keep bacon on hand.

review/text: I heard about this salt on a forum a while back.  Many people said it was the real thing.  So I ordered it from Amazon.  It was shipped quickly by Amazon.<br /><br />I love bacon. I like it well done and crispy.  I often add the fake bacon bits to salads or pasta.  The flavor is okay, bacon like but not as good as the real thing.  I have started using the packaged crumpled bacon by Plumrose, or Oscar-myer.  That gives a very nice real bacon flavor to anything you put it on.<br /><br />So when I received the package, I couldn't wait to open it and try it on some food.  What a disappointment !  It tastes like salt and MSG with yeast flavoring... not close to a nice bacon experience.  I tried it on a sandwich, veggies, etc.... still a far cry from a nice bacon taste.  Just salt and MSG...

He used 3 different liquids - water, Mountain Dew, and a generic cola. He put a balloon on each bottle with the Pop Rocks in it, with held the candy until it was released all at once into each liquid. He hypothocized that the Mt. Dew would produce more gas than the others. So he released the Pop Rocks into the water 1st, then the Mt. Dew, then the cola, and ...................................<br />what do you think? Ah...he was wrong. The cola produced the most gas!

review/text: I agree with some of the other reviewers (for the NON-Classic syrup). I have been buying this product, mostly to add to coffee, for several years. At some point, I noticed that the flavor changed, and (to my palate at least), it was a change for the worse. After noticing some of the recent reviews, I made sure to order the "Classic" flavor when my supply started to run low. When it arrived, I taste-tested vs. the "non-Classic" syrup that I still had on hand, and (again, to my palate), the "Classic" tasted far superior. I suppose other people may prefer the new flavor, but for me, the Classic is the one I'll order from now on.

I am seriously considering putting this product on auto ship. It is that good. I get nervous when I start my last bottle! One thing that I recommend, find salt-free club soda. The salt adds nothing to the taste and, perhaps it is my preference, I do not need more salt in my food...yes this is a food to me.

review/text: I have had many different green teas but I am now solely drinking Twinings Green Tea everyday for it is easy to find and to prepare and most importantly it tastes good.  But it takes a little bit of practice to brew it just right.  For example the water should not be scolding hot and the tea bag should not be in the water more than a minute (you will find a better direction in the box).  If you brew it right, the tea gives a beautiful Spring green color that is so clear and pleasing to eyes and also your taste buds.  It's no secret that green tea is so good for your health.<br /><br />And I am so glad to find that Amazon is carrying the 50 counts of this tea.  And I have now 6 months supply with the subscription plan. It is nicely packaged at an affordable price.

review/summary: My favorite green tea hands down
review/text: The Twinings green tea has what I call an American taste i.e., not too Asian or adulterated in any way.  It seems very pure and clean to me, similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PS0">Lipton Green Tea, Mandarin Orange, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (the very good flavored version that I mix with this) but a bit finer.  I look for it in the stores and often cannot find it.  Get it here by subscription with your Amazon Prime free 2-day shipping for about $2/box.  Also, this one is available in the 6-box lots while the Lipton Green Tea is only in a 12-box lot.  It will become a staple for you with lemon and honey (lime, orange peel, etc.)<br /><br />Green tea is also an extremely healthy drink with all the special polyphenol antioxidants that it contains.  It may even prevent Alzheimers disease.  (Black tea is dried which destroys a percentage of the antioxidants.) Although green tea also contains a small amount of caffeine it has another calming effect that is almost a high in itself.  Over a year ago, we quit coffee in the AM to go to green tea and have never looked back.  Now we only have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H6UX0Y">Senseo Douwe Egberts Colombia Blend Coffee Pods, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> (with some Starbuck's cocoa powder or carmel sauce) in the afternoons a couple of times a week and our nerves are perfect.

review/summary: Light flavored green tea
review/text: Twining's can usually be counted on to put out a decent tea.  They aren't really top grade, but nor are they bottom shelf and make for a fine daily bag tea.<br /><br />However, I found their Green Tea to be a bit bland.  Indeed, it is the "light flavour strength", as it says on the box, but I wasn't prepared for just how light the flavor would be.  Supposedly, the tea used here is sencha, but I have had many, many cups of sencha and it generally has a bolder, grassier flavor.<br /><br />Because the flavor is so light to begin with, you can't really pull more than one cup out of a bag either.  The next cup is just pretty much colored water, which is disappointing.  A nice strong tea usually yields a few cups, and that saves you some money in the long term.<br /><br />People who don't really enjoy the strong, grassy flavor of green tea might find this a nice balance.  It is easy to make, easy to drink and will probably suit many people.  I was looking for a decent bagged Green Tea to keep at work, but I think I will keep hunting as the flavor was too light for me.

review/summary: Annoying, "Minty" Taste
review/text: As I continued to drink this tea, I became annoyed by a distinct "minty" taste it has. One of the bags tasted so minty I thought they slipped a bag of their 'Green Tea -- Mint' into the box. It really is that noticeable and is not a quality I look for in an everyday green tea.<br /><br />I won't be buying this again. Only a few bags are in the box now, and I'm struggling to finish them.<br /><br />I'm going to go back to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AG7Z4C">EDEN� ORGANIC SENCHA (GREEN TEA) 16 BAGS</a>, which I've found to be the best bagged green tea for the price. Tazo Tea makes a good bagged China green tea -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUCKF4">Tazo China Green Tips Green Tea, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> -- but it costs much more per box than the Eden brand where I shop.

review/summary: My new "everyday" green tea
review/text: I've been bouncing around from one brand of green tea to another for some time now, everything I could find in the budget priced range, from supermarket brands to specialty offerings from Costco and Trader Joes. Yes there are some wonderful and exotic greens out there, but I'm talking everyday stuff that won't make me feel *too* guilty while my husband enjoys his own favorite: Lipton's Eu De Ubiquitous Yellow Box.  (Because even the cheapest green costs considerably more, ounce for ounce, than "default" orange Pekoe.)<br /><br />Anyway, I think I've finally found the stuff.<br /><br />Twinings Green has a bright quality that is maybe a *bit* strong on the tannins, but doesn't have that vegetal taste that green teas can.  I'm no expert -- for all I know, this translates to "something missing" to a connoisseur, but my less educated palate perceives some greens as "mown alfalfa" -- not my favorite flavor.<br /><br />And the tea is smooth.  Newbies should know that you want to steep green tea in water that is only just getting hot; boiling water will give you a nasty, bitter taste that only gets worse as it cools.  I'm ready to try the Twinings as an iced tea -- even at room temperature, I'm detecting nothing but green-y goodness.

review/summary: Consitent Green Tea
review/text: I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep their freshness.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>:  At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.

Of course you can but they likely weren't grown in the US and are probably a couple of years old.  These peas are far superior to the bag of peas in the grocery store.  These are grown in Washington, packaged in Washington and shipped from Washington.  It is worth it to spend a little more for a far superior product!

review/text: I have made homemade split pea soup for many years.  I recently resumed doing so after not for about a decade.  I bought organic split peas at my local market, they were tasteless.  Chicken broth was used to make that soup, too.  But these split peas were much more flavorful.  They cooked up much better as well, meaning that the first brand's peas must have been old, bcs after an hour or more they were still tough.  So, that tells me these are fresh, and superior.

Just some natural sea salt and a little brags amino acids. Plus I put in a few garlic cloves and it was so heart warming soup. Usually, with ordinary peas, you have to put bacon and other spices in to make it good. Not with these peas. They were delicious on their own. Also delivered timely. Thanks again.

These peas are some of the cleanest and of the highest quality I've ever purchased.  I always rinse and sort me legumes before I cook them and usually find something to sort out.  Not with these.

review/text: It would be very hard to purchase any other brand of split peas after having had the pleasure of tasting these. Each pea is perfect; no imperfect ones to toss out. The final result is mouthwatering. I made a big pot, threw in some vegetables, and can barely keep myself away from having too much now and not enough left for another day.<br /><br />And, being organic and GMO free, wrapped very carefully in gunny sack material inside a plastic bag, it is a healthful contributory to the diner, not a questionable one.<br /><br />I'm really glad I discovered these split peas. I can't imagine anything better.

review/text: These are the best-tasting green splits I've ever had.  I love creamy soups, split pea being one of my favorites, but it's not usually easy to make a delicious creamy soup without adding some sort of meat flavoring (I don't eat anything that used to have a face). These peas are delicious without having been cooked with any sort of meat/chicken-based flavorings.  Nice and fresh-no more of those gray colored little things sold in plastic bags at the grocery store. These peas even smell fresh in the bag (which is a nice drawstring muslin).

review/summary: Just what I wanted
review/text: I ordered the fruit punch and the lemonade.  I was attracted to them because they have 5 calories and use Splenda instead of Aspartame, which seems to cause me joint pain (a by product of a misspent youth).  The instructions say to use a 16.9 oz bottle of water, which works very well for the fruit punch.  For the lemonade, I found it a little strong and use a 20 oz bottle with 18 - 19 oz of water in it.  I used to drink 2 - 4 sodas a day, a mix of regular and diet.  With this stuff, I feel better and I am saving a bunch of calories from both the soda and from not feeling as hungry because I am drinking more water (albeit flavored water).  I have several friends deployed over to the sandbox and, while Army water is purified, it suffers in taste.  These are a huge hit over there.  They seem to be as favored, or more so, as Crystal Light.  Best of all, they cost less.

review/summary: A new favorite
review/text: I have enjoyed Twinings teas for, oh, more than 20 years now. I was immediately suspicious of this new blend, if only because Twinings seemed to be attempting to capitalize on people's renewed appreciation for the tradition of afternoon tea. Too often, especially in America, this meal is referred to as "high tea" to make it sound like a fancy event, even though high tea and afternoon tea differ in ways that have nothing to do with elegance. English Afternoon Tea sounded a little quaint, and Twinings already offers so many varieties of tea that it was hard to believe there could be anything new that would be worthwhile.<br /><br />As it happens, this tea is my new favorite. It doesn't have the dainty flavorings or fragrance of Earl Grey or Lady Grey, my former favorites, nor does it contain the thundering levels of caffeine in English or Irish Breakfast Tea. Instead, it includes elements from both ends of the spectrum. Like the Lady and the Earl, it has little enough caffeine that I can toss back cup after cup without getting jumpy. And like the breakfast teas, it has more of a bold black-tea edge that in this case isn't masked by bergamot or citrus notes. But with English Afternoon Tea, this edge is mellower and more refined than in the breakfast teas. It has more interest and character than a simple orange pekoe (the baseline for black tea) but without resorting to bitter or acerbic flavors.<br /><br />Any tea drinker should enjoy English Afternoon Tea. It's surprisingly good, and despite the name, it's a fine way to start the day. I only wonder why Twinings didn't come up with it sooner!<br /><br />One final thought: Adding a little milk to tea--never cream, although at afternoon tea, it's properly called cream--causes the tannins in the tea to attack the milk proteins. As a result, the tannins are neutralized and won't attack your tongue. What this means for you is that the tea will cause less of the dry, mouth-puckering sensation you might have encountered eating walnuts or drinking dry red wine. If you've never tried milk in your tea, I recommend adding just a little.<br /><br />For a fascinating little blurb about how tea led to urbanization (who knew?), click here. This brief book excerpt is interesting, and not only because it includes the wonderful phrase "microbial holocaust"!<br /><br />http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2007/07/did_tea_drinking_lead_to_urban.php

review/text: This is available in many grocery stores too, and is partway between the cheap and fancy teas, price-wise.  The freshness and flavor are top-rank, though. It has all the good points of an afternoon tea: strong enough to easily take milk or cream, a floral topnote that doesn't evaporate in a few minutes, a rich fresh-kilned-wood middle, a dry flat base that isn't bitter, and incredible sustain on the after-taste (great with shortbead, poundcake, etc).  The freshness on my box was great, considering the individual packets let some flavor out. Not watery or wimpy like a Tetley or Bigelow, but not hard or bitter either.  Only St. Dalfour had more top aroma, but it didn't have the nice middle wood this tea has.  This really exceeded my expectations, and I didn't even dump it from the bag to bump flavor.

It was divine to find it, because it takes me down memory lane, and I love the taste.  Don't get me wrong, I still drink the Twinings English Breakfast and Earl Grey, amongst others, and Chai when I feel like it, but this tea is just lovely, and is authentic!<br /><br />Incidentally, I've never liked any tea sold in the US better than Twinings for flavor on all the types of tea save Chai teas.  Twinings chai is kind of weak--Celestial seasonings does a better job, just at chai, if your looking for something you can get in most places in the US.

review/summary: Best Tea Ever
review/text: I have been a fan of Twining's English Afternoon Tea for several years. It's a robust tea, but doesn't have the edge of or cause the heartburn of English Breakfast Tea. Add a little cream or half & half and it's a satisfying treat in itself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, English Afternoon Tea is hard to find.  Only one grocery store in my area carries it and because it is so popular, is often out of it.  I am delighted to be able to order this tea from Amazon (and at a much lower price -- about $3 per box from Amazon vs. $4.69 per box at my local store!).

review/summary: My all time favorite!
review/text: Awesome tea blend.  Typically, I am a Lipton drinker.  This blend seems to have a smooth taste, without that after bite some dark tea blends have.  I like my tea dark, but this sometimes gives that after bite.  Not so with this tea.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: my favorite tea at all times of the day
review/text: I used to prefer any Ceylon or orange pekoe tea when drinking black, until trying this "English Afternoon" tea by Twinnings. It just has a distinctive flavor that I have not tasted anywhere else. It's difficult to describe, so I would suggest trying a single box somewhere before committing to the case of 6 here. I have this product on subscription now due to my 3-cups-a-day habit! It's not too bitter, and it has this well-rounded flavor and full bodied mouthfeel (for a tea!). I love it!<br /><br />It also seems to have a natural sweetness to it (especially compared to Ceylon), and I highly recommend it with milk and sugar. Enjoy!

review/text: This is my favorite tea anytime of day.There is a hint of sweetness to the tea, and a depth of flavor. It's a great blend, but hard to find. I'm so glad Amazon carries it!

review/summary: Twinings Teas
review/text: I love tea and the best teas I have found are by Twinings.  The English Afternoon Tea is very good.  It's very<br />soothing and relaxing.  I have a hard time getting certain selections of their teas in the stores.  Since I can get exactly what I want on Amazon.com, I have been ordering the Twinings varieties I love.  It is well worth the money.<br />I haven't bought any tea in the stores since I started getting them on line.  It's the only way to have your tea.

review/summary: LOVE THIS TEA
review/text: I'm about to order more of this Twining's Afternoon Tea that I just tried recently.  They recommend it with milk - I use it plain as an iced tea and it is delicious.  I add 2 bags of Bigelow's Mint Medley to the pot since I no longer live where I can pick fresh mint.<br /><br />This tea has a good flavor, strong enough to know it's tea, which is important if you are serving it over ice, no bitterness, a tinge of sweetness to it.  No doubt I'll enjoy it  hot in winter.<br /><br />I sweeten my Tea with Splenda to avoid too much sugar.  Works great.  All of these products can be purchased in quantity at good prices on amazon.  I hope Twining comes out with a larger box so I can get even a better price.<br /><br />Order this one and enjoy!

review/summary: A really lovely brew
review/text: I had never heard of English Afternoon tea until I ordered an array of teas to enjoy this Fall and Winter. This is not a brisk, strong tea at all but very satisfying, nonetheless. It has a mellow flavor while retaining the basic character of black teas that I enjoy so much. I will be reordering when supply begins to dwindle. Friends and coworkers have been pleased when I share, too.

review/summary: Very good, smooth tasting tea
review/text: I've been looking all over for this tea. (I am actually the wife of the "good guy from Texas.") I really like it with half/half and sugar, it is wonderfully sweet.  I first tried it as part of a Twinings variety pack.  The grocery does not carry it; and the variety pack stopped putting in in their mix of teas.  Waaa...I'll continue my search for it.  I hope that Twinings did not discontinue this product!
