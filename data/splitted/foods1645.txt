review/summary: It works
review/text: After following Geoff Klos's instruction, got the first mole in two weeks.  Thanks for sharing the technique.  This product works, but patience is the key.  It's a bit difficult to set, but in order to provide the clamping force and speed required, I guess it's necessary to have such strong spring.

review/summary: Best mole trap I've found
review/text: I've used two other types of traps besides this one: the plunger style (stabbing death from above) and the scissor style with foot activation (cut 'em in half). Neither worked very well--the scissor/foot style frustrated me the most because you have to compress the springs using your foot after the trap is positioned, and if the soil is somewhat damp, the whole trap will just squash into the ground.<br /><br />After the snow melted I discovered that the moles had been hard at work in my yard. I set the Victor trap on what I believed to be one of the mole "highways" and caught a critter WITHIN 6 HOURS. He was a big one too, almost 6 inches from nose to tail.<br /><br />PROS of the Victor trap:<br />* I like that you can set/compress the trap before you place it. This makes it easy to position it exactly how you want it in the ground.<br />* The safety catch is a nice feature. If you hit the trigger lever by accident, you won't hurt yourself.<br />* Trigger lever is VERY sensitive. This has been one of my frustrations with other traps--I can sometimes tell by the soil movement that moles are passing under it without tripping it.<br />* Price, $10 is cheaper than most other traps.<br /><br />CONS of the Victor trap:<br />* The instructions stink. Even disregarding the placement issue (see next point), it took me a few minutes to figure out how to compress the trap using the "setting levers" and trigger lever. It's a good design, just not well documented.<br />* Don't use the instructions on the box for placing the trap. I followed the advice of several other reviewers here who suggest cutting notches on either side of the tunnel for the trap blades to rest in. This turned out to be easier and more effective.<br /><br />If they just improved the instructions on the box, it'd be a five star review from me.

review/summary: Caught one!
review/text: I don't care what anyone else says about this trap because I just caught one and I've been trying for years. First day I set it out it worked. My area is very sandy and I consider the spear/plunger type traps a total rip off, for me anyway. Never caught one til I got this trap.. These moles are very destructive to my plants. I've read all the mumbo jumbo from the go green guys about how moles just eat grubs and help aerate the soil. Yeah right! They have killed fruit trees and plowed down whole rows of my vegetable garden.. By whatever means they manage to kill my plants.. So I hope to kill more with this trap..

review/text: I have been battling moles for over 3 years. They have completely destroyed our lanscape. I tried everything I could find and was recommended to me. My brother had a Victor Trap he would lend to me when he wasn't using it. I got 4 in 2 weeks. I've looked everywhere for these traps but couldn't find them in stores. I found them on Amazon.com and bought 2. If you have mole issues I promise you this product will work.<br /><br />Happy Hunting!

review/summary: Mole elimination
review/text: Moles were devastating my lawn and I had tried the grub killer which had little effect on their havoc. I ordered 3 victor traps, when I opened the first trap I struggled to set it. I thought as hard as it is to set this trap I won't be using them. Then I opened the second box and found it easy to set, the first one had the latch fabricated on the wrong side. Within a week I had caught three moles now I am moving on to other sections of the lawn. Return of the defective trap was also a very painless task.

review/summary: Worked for me!!
review/text: I live in upstate NY and I had a mole destroying my lawn with zig zagging tunnels. I went online, did some research, and ended up ordering one victor out of sight mole trap. I could not locate any straight tunnels so i had to put it on curvy tunnels. I did what reviewers had said, and i flattened the tunnel, put two slits across where the claws rest and set the trigger at ground level. I got nothing for about 3 weeks, even after moving the trap around tunnel to tunnel. I started to lose faith in the trap. So one day I tried a different method, more of what the instructions say...i openned up one of the tunnels(6 inch length) and stuck the trap inside and put the trigger just above where his head would be in the tunnel. I then covered the base of the trap and hole back up with dirt. Within two days the trap was sprung and to my amazement I had a large dead mole in the trap!!! I couldnt of been happier!! I am not sure if the new way I set the trap was how I got him, or if that was just coincidence. Either way it works. I just ordered another trap, as I think if you have two or more your chances of getting them is much better. After you kill one, new ones will move in shortly after, so you will use the traps over and over...

review/summary: The ONLY trap you need!!!  Simply AWESOME.
review/text: This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap, you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.<br /><br />What you need to do:<br />1- bend the trigger down a little<br />2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.<br />3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.<br />4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.<br /><br />Once I figured this trap out, I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!<br /><br />***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are "leghold, steel-jawed traps".  I will be going to court soon...

review/text: I ordered 2 of these traps in the spring.  The mole runs tend to show up only in the late summer/fall where I live, and I finally opened them up to use them.  One of the traps did not have a trigger pan, so it is useless.  I have just set the other one, but would sure like to get the other one replaced, but it would appear that due to the passage of time, I am no longer able to get a refund/replacement for the defective on.

review/text: After 4 years of sprays, grub insecticide and plunger traps I finally found a product that works.  I never caught one mole in 4 years even though the old traps had been set off dozens of times.  I had tried the castor oil spray and treated the lawn for grubs and my lawn looked worse than ever.  I purchased 3 of these traps and caught 4 moles in the first two weeks.  I used the above ground method described by other reviewers and only one time was the trap tripped with no mole in its jaws.  An excellent product.

review/summary: Misses a 5 star rating because it can be difficult to set
review/text: This trap is effective.  It misses a 5 star rating because it can be difficult to set.  The Victor 0631 works well if you are willing to take 5-10 minutes to clearance the blade slots in the soil yourself and then set the trap "just right".  It may go off on you the first few times after you set it in the ground, so be prepared to set it multiple times.  It has a safety catch so it won't alarm you too much if it goes off when you place it in the ground.<br /><br />The Wire Tek 1001 is double the money but is set by simple foot operation which expands the blades, thus self-clearancing the soil blade slots.  The Victor 0631 is made in China which does not please me.  The Wire Tek 1001 is made in the USA and is more rugged.  Its clamping force is double as it has two springs which allows it to close very quickly and with authority.  Grass and roots will not interfere with the Wire Tek's effectiveness.

review/summary: These traps work BUT you have to set them right
review/text: I have tried using these traps from time to time for over a year unsuccessfully.  But, after reading some of the reviews here for the other Victor Out O' Sight trap, I realized I wasn't setting them right.  And, I caught one mole yesterday, and another today.  So, I'm excited that I've finally come up with a way to catch them.<br /><br />I'm sharing my technique for setting them in the hope it will help you:<br />  1) Find an active tunnel.  You can just walk around the yard and step down on raised areas, then come back later and see if they get raised up again.<br />  2) Cut a couple of scrap pieces of wood that are 3/8" or 1/2" thick by four or five inches long, by say, five or six inches high. You'll use these to hold the grooves you cut for the trap legs when you push down on the soil.<br />  4) Get a garden tool that can cut down through any roots, like a hatchet, or a flat-blade tool with wooden shaft and a handle (don't know what you call it, but that's what I use).<br />  5) Get a tool you can use to find the center of the tunnel.  I use a discarded mop handle that I drilled a hole in the end of and glued in a six inch nail.<br />  6) Probe the tunnel to approximately locate it's center, and just leave it sticking in the center for now.<br />  7) Set the trap on the ground along the tunnel near where you will place it so you can see how far apart to cut the grooves for the trap legs.<br />  8) Cut the first groove for the trap legs as clean as you can; then, feel down in the cut line to locate the tunnel. Use a finger to locate the tunnel.<br />  9) Stick one of your scrap pieces of wood in this groove, and tap it down firmly.<br />  10) Then cut the other groove so the other legs will go in it.<br />  11) Again, run a finger down in this cut to locate the other end of the tunnel.  You do this because the tunnel may turn some, and you'll need to turn your trap too.<br />  12) Stick the other scrap piece of wood in it.<br />  11) Now, step down with your heel between the two pieces of scrap wood. You want this dirt to be very firm.  I do this, then also tap down with the end of my flat blade tool to get it extra firm.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.<br />  12) Next, wiggle the two pieces of wood back and forth, and in and out to open up the two grooves a little, them pull them out.<br />  13) Set the trap into the two grooves while observing the clearance between the ground and the traps bottom lever. You don't want it to contact the ground or you'll spring the trap.  Incidentally, you should have the trap safety ON at this point.<br />  14) Now, use a finger to feel the clearance between the ground and the lever; and, push and/or tap the trap down slowly until it is only 1/16th inch or so from the ground.<br />  15) Release the trap's safety.  I repeat: Release the trap's safety.  I seem to frequently forget to do this.<br />  16) Take some loose soil or leaves and just drop them around the trap legs to prevent sunlight from getting down to the tunnel.<br />  17) GOOD LUCK!

review/text: This trap is VERY powerful. Easy to set, but needs improvement to trip lever. It needs wide flat piece on it, to prevent mole from slipping by. I have yet to nab one. Srarted using small, thin piece of wood, placed right under trip lever, bending lever did no good, dirt was just pushed up around it. Takes some practice getting it placed in position, need a sharp shooter that has been flattened out on the end. Great idea, just keep improving it.

review/text: I bought this at the same time I bought the Wire Tek "EasySet" Mole Trap here on Amazon, and after trying both products I have to say that the Victor "Out O'Sight" Mole Trap is not only 1) much more difficult to operate but also 2) less effective than the Wire-Tek one, not to mention 3) tears up your yard more.  With this Victor brand one you actually have to dig a hole by hand vs. with the Wire-Tek one all you do is push it in to the ground and step on it to set it, easy as pie.  That one has caught 2 moles for me so far, the Victor trap has caught 0 moles.  If it wasn't such a hassle to ship stuff back, I'd return this one and buy another Wire Tek brand mole trap.  Don't waste your time on this product here!

review/summary: Don't buy this trap
review/text: Unless you have the strength of superman, it is impossible to set this trap.<br />The jaws need to be pulled apart by using pry bars. I could not do it, and I am not a weak man. I did manage to set it once by using a vice, but even that took some doing because the pry rods would slip out of place.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I had a friend who is a martial arts expert specializing in grabbing things and holding on (yes there is such a specialty). The normal adult male has a gripping strength of 80-100PSI. Dave J has a gripping strength of 350PSI. He struggled and struggled, thought he could do it, but I took it away from him before he hurt himself.<br /><br />The design is bad. The trap is almost impossible to set without using a vice.<br />If I had ever gotten it in the ground it might have worked (it definitely would kill if tripped appropriately) but the thing is just too hard to set.<br /><br />PS I got on the victor customer support site and requested help. They sent me a pdf that was exactly the same as the diagram on the box....no help.  A second email to them has gone unanswered for 3 days.<br /><br />I shipped it back today

review/text: After placing an order for items noted as in stock, not receiving any notification from the supplier of the order:<br />- The estimated ship by date passed without any action<br />- First Email to supplier went without acknowledgement<br />- Second Email to supplier went without acknowledgement<br />- Final date to expect the order passed<br />- Email sent to cancel order with all info provided and no acknowledgement<br />- Still awaiting the confirmation of the cancellation as of this writing.<br /><br />This could be isolated but was enough to prevent me from ever doing business with Northern Tool & Equipment in the futre.<br /><br />Ended up going with BIC Superstore and placed the order on a Monday and received the order on Thursday of the same week!!!! Life is good again unless I get caught in limbo with the apparent open order that caused all of this grief.....

review/summary: Does not work in sandy soil
review/text: Live in Florida and bought 4 of these traps based on the reviews here. This trap seems rather large for the size moles we have here in Florida. The tunnels which I could find are no bigger than 1 inch. The soil is so sandy that the trigger gets covered up and the tunnels collapse when trying to set this trap. I did as suggested and leveled the fist size mounds to see where the active tunnels were which showed up the next day. Not one trap went off.<br />As far as placing the trap with the trigger above the ground (as suggested by some reviewers here) this makes no sense as the tunnels are NOT RAISED and there is no way the trap will go off. The traps were placed with the trigger in the tunnel so the moles would go under it and trigger the trap.<br />Anyone living in a hot sandy soil area who has found a trap that will work please post.

review/summary: Did not work for me
review/text: I'm hesistant to give the product this low rating but it simply did not work for me. I tried on 3 separate occasions and actually saw the critter go past the trap and trigger it. Only thing I can figure is the trap is too large for my moles. I also followed the preferred method of setting these out. I plan to try again but the next time I'm going to be prepared to take care of this critter with a pitch fork if I'm lucky enough again for him to drive by while I'm laying the trap out!

review/text: I bought two of the traps last month. I tried to get them set and in the ground. I spent about an hour trying to get the trap set, but it would not stick. I haven't taken the time to try and get them to work since then b/c the Grubex I put down seems to have slowed down the mole activity in my yard.<br /><br />I'll definately try to get them set again if the mole activity picks back up, but right now they are just collecting dust in my shed.

review/summary: Extremely hard to set!!!
review/text: This device may work, but I have spent hours trying to set it with little success.  I finally got a large set of channel locks, got the trap to set, and attached the safety pin.  I set everything up for a few days with no results.  When I wanted to move it to another location, it closed so I had to start the process all over again.  As I said earlier, it may work but unless your superman you will have a difficult time setting this trap.

review/summary: Use grub and insect killer instead
review/text: We had mole tunnels throughout our lawn.  We first tried the non-lethal castor/garlic oil water spray method (twice).  It didn't work. Then we tried laying two of the Victor Out of Sight Mole Trap out.  That didn't work, either. Finally, my son spot movement in the lawn and he stomped on the tunnel.  The mole was dead. It was small, only about 4 inches.  But, it was amazing, that was the end of our problem.  Our entire lawn - which isn't small - was destroyed by ONE tiny mole.  Best advise, look for the movement of the mole in the late afternoon, than stomp on it or use a flat end of a large shovel. Moles have thin skulls so apparently they are easy to kill. One mole can do an incredible amount of damage.<br /><br />5/31/10 update:<br /><br />New season, new mole appears. Instead of using the mole trap, I tried a new approach--- kill his food source. One application of grub and insect killer and the mole is gone, probably to the neighbors yard. Everything I read on the internet suggest that you have to kill the mole but that has remained elusive except by luck. Getting rid of his food source though worked immediately. We never saw another tunnel after the grub and insect killer was applied over three weeks ago. We'll see how long it lasts but this was much easier than trying (unsuccesfully) to trap the mole.

review/summary: Don't follow the directions
review/text: Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those "pockets" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...

review/summary: The trap works if you DO NOT FOLLOW DIRECTIONS
review/text: This type of trap is highly effective IF you do NOT follow the directions about how to place it. If you bury it (which the directions will tell you to do) it will simply NOT work. If your "out o sight" trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.<br /><br />When the very expensive exterminator (who we now refer to as "Mark the Mole Man") came to our house, I showed him our "out of sight" mole trap. He tried to be respectful but finally just said, "Ma'am, that's too deep. Ain't gonna kill nothin'." As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.<br /><br />He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don't give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.<br /><br />Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.<br /><br />It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience. Go get your nasty little critter with this trap, but don't follow their directions. Listen to reviewer Geoffrey Klos.

review/text: This is an excellent product. I had to play with the sensitivity of the trigger a bit before I used it. Once set, it worked very well. Trapped a couple of moles in 24 hours and problem has gone away now.<br /><br />I did not like the manufacturer's instructions. I had to find out how to set it myself. Here is what I did:<br /><br />1. Armed the trapped with the safety clip on.<br />2. Found a straight area on the mole's runway<br />3. Flattened a straight part of the runway a couple of inches wider that trap by stepping on it<br />4. Used a putty knife as wide as the trap jaws and cut two lines perpendicular to the run. I widened the cuts a bit for the jaws to push trough the cut easily<br />5. I pushed the trap jaws in the cuts until the trigger tip just touched the top part of the grass.<br />6. Removed the safety clip<br /><br />You can protect the trap if you are like me and have neighbors with kids and/or dog by covering the trap with a large bucket and a heavy weight on top of it.

review/summary: They work but can you bring yourself to use them?
review/text: I admit it - I'm very, very ambivalent about harming any creature, even one that tears up our lawn the way moles do. But after one of our kids fell and nearly broke a leg in one of the numerous mole holes in our yard we (reluctantly) decided to cut down on the mole invasion. We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor's office. We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.<br /><br />  Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.<br /><br />  Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes. I admit...if we'd only had an occasional mole hole, I would have stayed away from traps. We are animal lovers. We have pets.<br /><br />  But the situation was becoming dangerous. I didn't want anyone  to get hurt walking across our yard.

Before setting the traps walk on top of the raised tunnels to find the most active sites to know where to set the trap.  I have killed 5 moles in my yard in the first week.

review/summary: Caught in 3 days
review/text: I've had at least one mole terrorizing my landscaping for about 8 months now.  I initially let him go, since he wasn't actually damaging plants.  In time, though, he'd separated enough roots from the soil that I nearly lost several plants, and my 20 ft crabapple was dropping half its leaves in June.  Something had to be done.  I'd read the reviews here early on, but decided to try some control methods that I could get locally.  This trap was not one of those.<br />I used three of the Victor harpoon-style mole traps, and managed to get them triggered successfully, but the mole escaped.  The design is simply flawed--in pushing the harpoon downward, the trap tends to force itself out of the ground.  To help prevent this, the trap has very long stakes that need to be driven into the ground... if you have much gravel in your soil, like I do, this is nearly impossible.<br />Several states' university extensions have tested the relatively new gummy-worm style baits with reasonable success, so I decided to try them.  Because my moles "highway" tunnels were right next to my house under plastic, I was able to peel back the plastic and drop them right into the tunnels (the plastic made up the roof of the tunnels).  I checked them each day for two days and my mole was actually eating them.  I had to leave town for a week, and when I got back there had been no new mole activity, which was not normal for my busy guy. I figure the gummy worms did him in.<br />Unfortunately, another mole invaded about 2 weeks later--completely different habits, though--this one preferred the lawn over the landscaping beds.  I'd ordered these traps the same day I placed the gummy worms, so I set three Out O'Sight traps per the instructions given by other reviewers (NOT THE ONES PROVIDED).  In three days I had my new mole.<br />One additional method of locating active tunnels that I like to use is to poke a stick through the top of an existing tunnel that you suspect might be a "highway".  Place a stone over the hole to block out the light.  Check under the stone daily--if the hole is filled in, the mole has passed through again.  Set your trap there.<br />Given the choice, I prefer these traps over the baits for two reasons--no poisons in your yard to accidentally get your neighbor's cat, and there's a little mole body to confirm that you actually got him.  Just be prepared--the little critters are actually kinda cute.<br /><br />Familiarize yourself with their habits, follow the instructions given by the others here, and be patient, and you'll have your moles.

review/summary: It Worked for Me
review/text: As many other reviewers, I had tried pellets, castor oil repellent, giant smoke bombs (two packages), and a sonic mole chaser to no avail. Every morning during the summer I would surely wake up to fresh mole hills and pebbles on our front yard, and I was losing the war. Then I purchased the Out of Sight trap on Amazon based on reviews and because it was available through Amazon Prime. Also, surprisingly no mole traps were available at my local Home Depot and OSH stores.<br /><br />After placing the trap in three different locations over the span of a week, I finally nailed the bugger. Here are some tips that I learned on my own or from various sites on the Internet:<br /><br />(1) Many of the reviewers on Amazon said that they encountered only shallow mole runs that were visible on the surface. They cited a good technique to set the trap for the shallow runs. However, my mole burrowed only deep runs. No runs were visible from the surface; only the mole hills. To set the trap for the deep runs, I followed the directions on the box, which called for digging a hole along a main run. I had to dig around 6 inches to get down to the run. Then, just as the directions say, I created a "speed bump" and filled the hole with some very loose soil. Then I placed a large 39 oz coffee can on top of the hole and trap. In fact, the coffee can made for a good template to carve out the hole, which should not be much wider in diameter than the length of the trap.<br /><br />(2) I found out on some website (I don't recall which) that when you first get the Out of Sight trap that you should stick it in dirt for a couple of days so that the odor of the freshly machined trap metal, which the mole can apparently smell, gets diffused. I don't know if that is fact or fiction, but my first unsuccessful experience with the trap seems to support that theory. The mole kicked dirt into the hole where I first placed the trap and also plugged up the runs leading to the trap. Smart little critter!<br /><br />(3) I found that a good tool to locate the main runs was a weed remover. The tip of the weed remover is thin enough to poke into the turf, but thick enough to have you sense whether you are still poking through dirt, which may be loose, or have discovered a run. Keep in mind that the main runs are still only around 1-1/2" in diameter. The key to placing the trap is to find an active, main run.<br /><br />(4) If you have deep mole runs (like I experienced), a good way to locate them is to draw a straight line between adjacent, new mole hills. There is a good likelihood that there is a run that connects the mole hills. Place the trap between the adjacent mole hills, but more than 18 inches away from either mole hill. If you place the trap within close proximity to a mole hill, you will invariably just get dirt thrown into the trap by the mole.<br /><br />(5) Once a mole is trapped, you may get another mole (or some other critter) moving into its place. Moles are individualists. They stay away from other moles, but take over a territory when there is no other mole present. Moles do, however, get together in the spring when they mate. So, even after a kill, stay attentive to your lawn.<br /><br />In conclusion, I attest to this trap and its quality. It should last a long, long time. I would not allow my wife or a child to use the trap, however. As others noted, the spring is heavy duty and takes a fair amount of strength and courage to set. Also, it can be dangerous, and a set trap needs to be handled very carefully and with the safety latch on.<br /><br />Now that I got my mole, I can wake up without the anticipation of me having to rake over mole hills and replug grass. Also, now that I am confident about using the trap (I have one kill under my belt!), I am assured that if another bugger shows up (and one surely will), I know how to effectively deal with it.

review/summary: Worked the First Night!
review/text: I have recurring mole problems, lost count how many years now. Tried many things, but only this "Out of Sight" worked. This is my story:<br />1) First encounter years ago, surprise, what's up with these bumps?<br />2) Just tidy up the surface. Never mind that.<br />3) Ran water down the tunnel until water came out the other end. Very satisfying, but just a waste of water. Made the whole place muddy and the creature liked it even more.<br />4) Invested in a plunger type trap. Expensive and reusable, sounded good. Not quite. I was excited the first time it triggered, got my gloves on and plastic bag ready. The spikes went down a couple inches, but no catch. Tried a few more times with the same result. Even tied bricks on the top half, but the trap became unbalanced and did not plunge well. Trashed it.<br />5) Poison "peanut". Do not like poisons, but maybe just for this one. Carefully dropped nuts into tunnels as directed. No noticable result, but creature was gone late fall. Used it again early next season, at which time I concluded that it did not work. The creature likes worms and bugs, not deadly smelling chemical.<br />6) Wire type trap (like a rat trap). It fits inside the tunnel. Hard to use - the trap is directional and the tunnel must be disturbed for the deployment. My creature ran over or around it, never triggering it. The creature probably hit trap's frame and changed course. Would have been better if the trap is narrower and fits into a 1.5" tunnel.<br />7) Saw it digging undergroud once (just once). Drove a pitch fork down mercilessly. Missed.<br />8) Lastly, the "Out of Sight". The size of the spring alone is impressive - WARNING: bone crushing spring force! Even my normally curious coworkers refused to play with it when my order arrived at the office. Set trap as directed the first night. At 3:30AM, a snap woke me up; continued to sleep, but with a smile on my face. The next morning, voila, face to face for the first time.<br /><br />I have a video of this last episode, may upload it later.<br /><br />Hints:<br />1) Creature likes wet area. It is most active right after watering. For the purpose of trapping, you can make a tunnel "flavorable" by keeing it moist between watering.<br />2) Creature works day and night, just not when you are looking.<br />3) Size your creature. Mine (I live in SoCal) turned out to be small like a fresh sausage. It explains why my pitch fork missed and the wire trap was too big.

review/summary: Simple, effective and durable trap
review/text: First of all, do not follow the instructions in the box. Instead read some of these reviews for very good tips.<br />I got two moles in about five days. It took me a little bit to learn where and how to set it. I pretty much followed the good advise given in other post, I recommend you do the same, their method works.<br />Before this trap I tried a bunch of less-aggressive methods but to no avail. It is really hard to get rid of moles in a nice way. Finally I got fed up and went for a trap. Also, with a trap you can see the body of the critter and know for sure that you got it.<br />The trap has a simple-but-effective design, it is built of solid, black-painted iron and it is bigger and tougher than what I thought it was going to be from the product pictures, but it is not huge. The spring is very strong and I have to put my weight on it (using the provided levers) to set it (remember to use the locking hook).<br />The triggering mechanism is simple and reliable, although I used a file to round the edge of the holding "stick" to make it slide out easier of the trigger piece (added sensitivity) but be careful not to over-do it! or it will trigger by itself.<br />The trap stays out-of-sight in my backyard because it lays low and it is black. I added a bunch of tree leaves on top of it to make it invisible. The leaves don't interfere with its functioning.<br />The most difficult thing about setting this trap is placement. I'm still learning where is the most likely tunnel that the mole is going to use. I'm using little construction flags to mark tunnels that I step on to find out which tunnels are the most active.<br />One if the moles that it caught was still alive when I checked the trap, so bring a shovel with you in case you need it.<br />Also the price is very good compared to other very expensive traps.<br />I highly recommend this trap.

review/summary: It does what the reviews said
review/text: Our yard was COMPLETELY overrun with moles this year.  The lawn was dead and the trails were everywhere we walked--literally.  We tried sulphur bombs (the Giant Destroyer), spring traps, castor oil (lots of it), Talpirid (80 worms), sonic molechasers (13 of them on 3/4 acre--way more than was suggested), and finally a professional mole guy which cost us $450 to place poison bait (all we got from that is a sick cat and a $150 vet bill), but no dead moles.  Killing grubs doesn't work because their main love is earthworms and you definitely don't want to kill those.  Everything that you read says that trapping is the only way to truly rid yourself of moles.  They only reproduce once a year and usually have litters of 3 to 4 pups--and half of them die.  The only reason we get overrun by them is from not trapping them and using deterrents that only work for short periods of time, allowing their numbers to increase (from what I've read). I read about this product and all the great reviews and I chose to *believe* one last time, so I ordered 6 of them. We went outside this afternoon to set 2 of the traps and within 1 hour we had our first mole!!!  He was huge and very well fed, he lived a good life. RIP.<br /><br />Initially, we did get completely frustrated and we each threw one across the yard, then we calmed down and figured it out. The reviewers all had great tips and I re-read them.  The thing to remember is to set the trap and put the safety on BEFORE you try and put it in the ground (sounds obvious, but it seemed easier to place it in the ground first and it wasn't). The spring is VERY strong, but the metal bars they put in the package make it easy enough to open the trap with both hands, then hold it open with one hand, and keeping the plate near the ground for leverage, engage the pin on the striking plate and flip the locking pin over.  The only other hard part is finding the right type of tunnel!<br /><br />I'm convinced there is no "natural* way to get rid of moles--I wish there was--but the only thing that is ultimately going to work is trapping them.  Be patient and don't give up, it really is easy to set this trap once you get the hang of it.  GOOD LUCK!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/2009:  Just caught another one this morning!  The trails are dwindling...<br /><br />UPDATE 5/2010:  Our grass finally grew back in after the moles killed every square inch of the lawn last year. We ended up getting about 5 moles. Just got the traps out again for the summer season as we noticed a small area being dug up.  We found a straight trail, set the trap and caught him within 4 hours!

review/text: I have 3 different kind of traps -  plunger, choker and Victor out of Sight.<br /><br />I have never caught anything with the plunger but have had great success with choker and out of sight.<br />Geoffrey Klos' review is great but I had success burying the trap and here's how:<br /><br />1. Take knife and cut top off straight mole run the size of trap and set aside to replace turf later.<br /><br />2. Dig section out a little deeper than tunnel.<br /><br />3. Mound dirt up in center where trigger mechanism will sit on without setting itself off.<br /><br />4. Lay turf and spread loose soil around trap to fill in gaps<br /><br />5. The key is to put a bucket over trap so that there is no daylight.<br /><br />This method is a little tougher on your turf but if you cut it clean and use the bucket you should be able to put back with little damage.<br /><br />Best of luck.

review/summary: Success In Five Hours
review/text: Update June 3, 2011<br />More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap. I had set two traps and the second one didn't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.<br /><br />Original review<br />Five hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole, the trap had done its job perfectly.<br /><br />I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.<br /><br />I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive. I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.<br /><br />The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.<br /><br />My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.<br /><br />It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me. It does take some pressure to set the trap; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.<br /><br />I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil. Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.<br /><br />I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything of interest happens. In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole.

He brought two of these traps over and within two hours of setting them we caught our first mole!<br /><br />Our yard has been terrorized by these beasts and  we have tried many things: different traps, poison pellets.....even our Airedale Terrier. She's really good at digging huge holes in the yard....but not actually catching anything.<br /><br />As one reviewer wrote, "You are looking for long straight runs. Long straight runs are like mole highways. The curvy short runs are hunting roads. The curvy runs are less traveled. Hunt the highways." This is so true! Listen to his advice and you can't go wrong.<br /><br />UPDATE - 6-25-09 - Four moles in less than a month.  And that's only because we haven't been too diligent in resetting them.

review/summary: Woo Hoo! Something finally works!!
review/text: Let me start this by saying I'm a huge animal lover, but when it comes to moles, f*** them! I've hunted these bastards for years, trying everything, until I came across these traps. As other reviewers have said, they work great...as long as you DON'T follow the instructions. Please read the review marked "most helpful" explaining the right way to set them. I started setting them 3 days ago, and once I got the hang of it, I caught two in one day!  Bought three to corner them.  It's also nice because even though the product pic looks like it cuts the mole, it actually crushes it, so no mess.  They are hard to set. You need pretty good arm strength, but worth every second and penny.  Don't spend more either. I was tempted to buy more expensive ones, thinking, how could a $10 trap compare?  But no worries.  Just buy more to increase your odds.  I can't explain how excited I am right now.  I'm off now to save the rest of my yard.<br /><br />5/27/11 UPDATE:  Got 2 more in the last 24 hours, so I'm up to 4 moles killed by these traps.  Number 5 will be dead tomorrow.  I will have a new nickname soon: "The Mole Hunter"<br /><br />6/29/11 UPDATE:  Now 7 moles dead in less than 2 months with these traps.  Enough said!

review/summary: Awesome Trap
review/text: This trap really works, if you disregard the printed instructions that come with it. Caught two within a few days!!! Now I can finally begin repairing the damage these buggers did to my lawn. Read what Geoffrey Klos posted in his review and follow these instructions instead, then it's really easy to catch it (or them). Highly recommended item if you have a mole problem...<br />To find a good spot to set your traps, stomp everything down and wait a day. Watch where the earth is lifted up again, these are active tunnels. Try to find straight runs, these are called "runways". Anything else are feeding tunnels and they come through these only infrequently. A good indicator are actual mole-hills. This is where the deeper tunnels start (their living room, basically). The runways often extend from these mounds. Runways are also often found in parallel to obstructions, such as foundations, driveways or lawn edging. Those are also good places to set your traps.<br />Good luck hunting! :-)

review/text: These traps work. I started out with two and recently bought 4 more when I bought a bigger house on 1.5acres. I've got 8 moles in two months. The trick is find the straight runs (highways) and to open up the run completely as wide as the trap is using a small garden trowel, set the trap down in the run and then pile all the dirt back over the trap. Last thing I do before walking away is flip the safety back onto fire using the tip of the trowel. If I haven't got one in 5days I move the trap. I learned how to set them from a local pro that uses these traps.

Also, according to package directions, which we followed, one has to dig up a bit more of one's lawn to embed the device than the mole has already dug up.  Still, for the price and a bit of patience, it gets the job done.

review/summary: Success with the Victor 0631 trap
review/text: I purchased 3 of the victor 0631 traps. They got to my house promptly.  There was a mole that troubled my lawn and flower beds for 3 months. I brushed aside conventional wisdom about mole behavior and the need to put traps only in frequently used main runs. I seeded the most recent activity with a total of 6 traps.  I carefully installed one of the new victor traps in a feeding run. Making sure the blades were free, and placing a mound of dirt in the center of the run to cause the mole to push through it and resulting in a trip of the trap. I poured fine dirt to close off light.  I also wore washed rubber gloves. I was also careful to set the trip on the very edge of the trip pan catch for hair trigger action.<br /><br />Next morning I came back and one of the purchased traps was sprung. The jaws of death closed on the neck of a huge mole. He was dead, the jaws of this trap are so powerful that they kill without fail. This was my first KILL with a victor trap.<br /><br />THEY WORK.  Just be careful with your fingers when you set these traps. Follow the basic steps outlined above and exercise patience, you will get them with this trap.

But, to this point, the moles are having the last laugh.  The trap has failed to catch a single tunnel builder.<br /><br />The "trap" has sprung once in the weeks I've had it set. I could barely contain my excitement as I wrenched it from the tunnel, only to find that all it contained was a large clump of bermuda grass.<br /><br />My wife is belittling me for my purchase of this device.  I promised my young neighbor I'd bring her a mole, as she's never seen one.  Looking over the fence and repeatedly telling her, "Not yet" is getting embarrassing.<br /><br />It seems the moles are on to me.  Each time I set the trap they alter their route(s).  As soon as I move the trap, they return to their old tunnel(s).  It's becoming a game to both of us.  I WILL WIN THIS GAME.<br /><br />I ain't giving up.  I trusted the glowing reviews of this device that I read.  Yes, I have considered that the review was written by either the inventor of the trap...or by an employee of the trapmaker's company.  But I will persevere.  While my friends await the reportage of the first dead mole; while my neighbor awaits her first ever eyeballing a mole; and while my wife continues her laughing at my empty mole trophycase...I continue the battle.  I will not toss this "trap" into the pile of failed mole-stopping gear.<br /><br />I will report back when the first mole meets its demise.

review/summary: Very Effective with practice in setting
review/text: This trap has been so effective that it has almost taken the challenge out of trapping moles in my yard.  I had tried other types of traps and was disappointed with the results. I've put my other experiences at the end if you are interested.<br /><br />As with any trap, it must be set in an active tunnel and it took a couple attempts to learn to set the Out O Sight.  However, once learned and active tunnels found, I have a 100% tripped trap/dead mole ratio.  As several others have said, following the directions sets the trap too deep.  On the other hand, the method described in other reviews here was too shallow to work for me.<br /><br />I have a recently re-graded yard with new topsoil trucked in so the soil is still fairly loose.  The top of most of the mole tunnels are about 3-4" deep.  Pushing the tunnel down and setting the trap on top without digging down proved too shallow.<br /><br />The technique that has worked for me is similar to that on the box, but not quite as deep as described.  Carefully excavate a section of the tunnel as wide as the trap and as deep as the bottom of the tunnel without disrupting the structure of the bottom half of the tunnel ... the bottom half of the walls and the floor.  Then take a few clumps of the dirt (it has been very wet here since starting to trap) and put them in the tunnel between where the claws of the trap will go.  Don't pack it tight, just drop them in.  Set the trap with the claws slightly deeper than the bottom of the tunnel by pressing it in.  The trip pan should sit on the clumps you put in.  Put the remainder of the soil back around the tunnel opening you made and around the trap to block out the light.  Do your best not to disrupt the tunnel leading up to the trap's jaws and don't pack it too tighly.  You want the mole to be in the jaws before encountering blockage.<br /><br />I have been holding the trip pan down while pushing the trap to the desired depth so I don't accidentally set it off and then making sure the release side of the trip pan is not tight against the soil which would possibly prevent it from springing.<br /><br />Since starting in November, the count is 10 with 3 of them in the last week.  Most of the time I have my quarry within 12 hours of setting the trap .  The time it will take is directly dependent on finding an actively used tunnel.  I patrol my yard almost every day and get the trap in immediately after finding a new tunnel.<br /><br />I have docked the device one star because the jaw of one of the first two traps I bought inexplicably cracked.  Also because I think it could be easier to set, but practice makes perfect. (use caution)  Despite this, the trap has been so effective and much less expensive than the alternatives that I have purchased 3 additional traps to replace the broken one and the other traps I have purchased that were not effective.<br /><br /> Plunging spear type:  Anchoring seemed to be an issue as well as spring strength to reach the mole in the heavy clay soil here.  The trap would be tripped, but no mole under it.<br /> Trapline in-tunnel wire trap:  A device that is genius in its simplicity and would likely do well in dryer soil than I was trying to trap in.  My experience was the moles digging around the device.  Perhaps I just didn't master setting it.  I also didn't like having to dig up the trap to see if it was tripped.<br /> Poison pellets:  Not sure if the moles took them or not.  Worked too slowly to stop the damage, so a worthless approach in my mind.

review/summary: The best answer I have found for moles
review/text: Another mole hunter from St Louis here. I have tried everything: pellets, smoke bombs, different poisons, flooding the holes, a pretty useless trap sold in Lowes and Home Depot (I did get one mole last year with this but it's very weak and flimsy. I think I was lucky). A friend of mine told me she was fed up and was going to pay a professional to catch her moles. He caught 2 of them in a couple of weeks and she hasn't had a problem since. I asked her if she could figure out what kind of trap he used. Well, this is the one!<br /><br />Since I bought these traps a few months ago, I have caught 5 moles (that includes 1 for my neighbor). Despite having caught 4 moles in my front and back yards, there is still new  activity from time to time. I think they cover the whole neighborhood. I have some traps in my yard and a couple in my neighbor's across the street. I have purchased 6 traps (they are a great price and VERY sturdy) and I'm about to purchase 2 more to send to my in-laws.<br /><br />The way I have found these work for me is as follows:<br />1. Try to pick out a tunnel that looks like a common route or "freeway." For me, it's usually close to a path or driveway where they have hit the "wall" and work their way along it. Don't stomp all the raised tunnels down unless there are so many you need to find a place to start.<br />2. By keeping the tunnel open and just pushing down the dirt in the area you intend to place the trap, the next time the mole comes by he will just start digging his way right into the trap. I like to keep the soil pretty loose where the trap is going to be placed so when the ground gets hard and baked, the trap will still be able to spring shut quickly. Just make sure the holes on both sides of the trap are covered. The dirt in the compressed area is usually about an inch or less below the rest of the ground.<br />3. Remember to use the safety catch when placing the trap in the ground. You want to make sure the flat base of the trap, (the part the mole will push up when he tunnels to trigger the trap) is well set in the ground and the four spikes in the ground are on either sides of the tunnel. It may be a little difficult to set the trap but it's not THAT hard to do. Come on!<br />4. Be patient. The first time I set a trap I had a mole in less than twelve hours. The last one I caught was in a trap in my garden which I had set 3 weeks earlier. Of course if you see new activity in a different area, you may want to move the trap. Trial and error.<br /><br />****Somebody else claimed these traps are hard to set. Yes, the springs on them are very strong and it takes a little elbow grease. The trap does come with tools to help you set the trap. If it wasn't this strong I may as well use the useless trap from Lowes.

review/summary: Difficult to set and use
review/text: This trap does the job, but nearly as well as others I have.  THe trap is difficult to set and requires the use of special tools that come with the trap, but are not part of it.  Even with the tools this trap is a pain to set compared to others. Once you get is set and placed on an active run it does the job.  Another issue I have with this trap is that it's design and color make it difficult to see from a disance and impossible to tell if it is sprung.  You have to remeber where you put it and check it periodically.  I recommend poking the tools into the ground next to the trap so you will know where they are.

review/summary: So far so good..
review/text: I commenced Molicide 2010 this week. After reading all the reviews here and on Northern's website last month, I was very excited to try this trap.  I planted my first trap today at 11:00 a.m. and it cleanly killed a mole by 12:30 p.m.!  After only 1.5 hours, I shouldn't have even been checking the traps... but there one was!!  No one believed me until they saw the proof.  There was no blood, but the mole was dead as a door nail.<br /><br />We run a 35 acre condo complex and have had VERY little luck with spear traps and poison worms.  I'm just hoping this mole wasn't beginner's luck!  We have at least 22 different mole activity areas and I swear some of the areas are too much for one mole.  So we bought 5 of these traps for starters and will get 5 more if the moles start piling up.  I have yet to try the method near mound activity, we'll see how that goes.<br /><br />Just follow the reviewer instructions and be diligent about making sure runs are fresh.  Good luck!

review/text: I've tried the solar beeping to scare the moles away, I tried a harpoon type trap for months, and I've tried capturing them live with no results for about 1 year.  I searched internet on traps and noticed some professional trappers used this kind of trap.<br /> My first attempt got no results but on my second attempt my trapped got sprung but I thought it was due to a heavy rain since the trigger is very sensitive and ignored it, but when I went to move it there was dead mole. It only took about a week. I got another one a week later. I did follow other reviews by not burying it like instructions say but to place it over a stamped down tunnel. I also used a lid from a tuna can under the tripping arm to increase the sensitivity. If want to get the moles use this.

review/text: Follow the directions of others on this site by placing the trap on the surface of the ground and you will trap moles.  2 moles in the first week.  Make sure the track is active.  I found it best by pressing the trip lever down with my finger to make sure it was flush with the ground (be sure to place the safety lever in position while setting the trap).  The traps works as advertised.  Very strong spring action so keep pets and hands out of the way of a set trap.  I placed small garden buckets over the traps to help avoid pet interaction.<br /><br />Update: 10/7/10 -- I've trapped 4 moles with this trap.  It continues to work very well.  Use at first sign of mole activity and you can be sure run is active.  I've trapped moles within an hour of setting the trap.  The only sure way to eliminate moles from your yard is to kill them with this trap.<br /><br />Update 9/28/11 -- "Mole season" again.  Saw a new track this afternoon; set the trap and in 45 minutes dead mole!  This is the only mole control I've used that works!  You're wasting your money on the gadgets -- this continues to work year after year!

review/summary: Finally, caught a mole!
review/text: I've had a problem with moles for just a few months, but they have done quite a bit of damage to my yard in that short time.  After reading the positive reviews, I decided to try the Out of Sight trap.  It took me a few weeks but I finally caught one mole (I'm sure there's more out there).<br /><br />I tried following the directions on the box as well as the directions in the reviews here.  I didn't have much success with just cutting slits for the blades and leaving the trap at ground level.  I eventually dug up a small area and I noticed that the hole runs were actually a little deeper than the blades would go if left on top of the grass. The cool weather may have something to do with the moles digging deeper; or I simply chose a bad spot. However, it was the most active area so seemed to be a logical choice to set the trap.<br /><br />So, I basically followed the included instructions and finally caught my first mole.  As others have said, you may need to finish off the little diggers yourself so just be prepared for that...I guess a shovel is the best tool for the job.  The traps do require a bit of strength to set and you need to be careful with them as the spring is very strong. At first glance it looks like some kind of medieval torture device.<br /><br />Another thing to remember is that often times moles are simply a symptom of other problems - mostly likely lawn grubs. I'm certainly not an expert, but it sounds like moles feed largely on these grubs. So getting rid of the grubs may prevent future moles...that's next on my to do list.

review/text: This trap is far superior to the Victor "harpoon" version. The spring is extremely strong and will close on any dirt or sod. Thanks to a previous review, you need to ignore the directions on the box. Flatten a small area of the mole run the width of the trap and use a spade or garden shovel to make a slit to allow each jaw of the trap to fit easily in the ground. Don't forget to use the safety hook while placing the trap and to remove after the trigger is set. I had the mole in two days and it did not evade this trap.

review/summary: Finally, the solution to my mole problem.
review/text: I have a little less than half an acre of yard, which is right against a wooded green space. Moles have been a problem for us since we moved in three years ago. Poison pellets, poison worms, spike trap, smoke bombs, scoot mole...All of these I've tried and, if they worked, it sure wasn't noticeable to me. At my wit's end, I called a professional service two months ago to control the mole problem. For $180, for one month of service, they placed 6 of these very same traps. The problem is, they came every week to check on the traps. So, one month later and one mole later (an additional $35 for removal of the dead mole), they yanked the traps. Well, one dead mole was better than my previous record of zero and I couldn't possibly justify spending another $180 + $35 for each dead mole for this service, so I ordered four of my own.<br /><br />The day I received them, one month ago, I placed all of them out along runs that, of course, magically popped up when the service had terminated. That very evening, while out on the patio, we heard a snap. The trap I had placed on the main run coming from the woods had caught one heading in the direction of my yard. The next day I removed the traps and stamped down all the runs. Around a week later, I spotted more runs so I placed the traps again. The next morning, I had another one. I waited a day or so, pulled the traps and stamped down the runs. The next time I saw runs was this past weekend. I placed all the traps again around 3pm. About 2 hours later (no, I'm not exaggerating), I had another mole. I pulled that trap, but left the others behind. The next morning another trap was full. For $53.72 I have trapped 4 moles and have been able to keep the moles from devastating my yard.<br /><br />To say I am completely satisfied with this product would be an understatement. In my opinion, this is the best solution out there to keep moles from destroying your yard. The advice I have regarding these traps is to make sure to buy enough traps to cover all the runs and increase your odds of trapping a mole. Additionally, be sure to be vigilant for the runs. At first sign, deploy your traps as you will likely increase the odds of trapping a mole in a run that was just made versus a run that is days old. Lastly, to deploy your traps successfully: 1)Find a relatively straight run (not those windy, loopy runs) 2)Stamp down just over a trap-width of the run with your foot 3)Set the trap and push it into the ground straddling the stamped-down run until the catch touches the ground 4)Enjoy the satisfaction of knowing, after you pull out your first sprung trap and the bane of your existence is dangling from the claws of the trap, that you just saved yourself years of frustration (and money!) by simply buying a few of these traps. Good luck!

review/text: I have trapped almost 100 moles with my fleet of 12 traps (now down to about 8 traps along with 2 new lawn mower blades). The first year I trapped around 30 moles and the population has been dropping every year for the last six years...only two so far this year. I followed the instructions for setting the trap and haven't had a problem - maybe they have changed the instructions in the last 6 years??? The nice thing about these traps is you can set them deep or shallow depending on the depth of the moles trail. I even managed to trap two moles (head to head) in one trap a few years ago - I'm sure the odds of this happening are similar to winning lottery. They are a very powerful trap, so make sure you caution your children. I borrowed one of my traps to a friend of mine and his kid pulled it out of the ground, brought it to him, and asked what it was. The trap was set, but fortunately, never went off in his hand.

review/summary: Best mole trap but needed a little tweaking
review/text: From my reserch, this is the best mole trap out there.  It does work for me but took lots of trial and error to figure out how to set it correctly.  I bought two, one worked perfectly, but one had too much powder coat on the trigger pan to release properly.  Don't be afraid to use pliers on it to adjust the release/ trigger pan lip to set the release force.  And make sure the legs pass each other when released, one leg was slightly bent striking the other on one. What I found works best for Pacific NW moles was to dig the trap hole just barely large enough for the trap.  No loose dirt on ends of trap.  Clear the mole tunnel of all loose dirt with a spoon and pack the bottom solid so he doesn't dig around in the soft dirt. I used sod to cover the trap with NO dirt back fill in the hole like the instructions say. Once I found a main tunnel to set it in, its deadly!

review/text: A very well built mole trap that works great when set correctly.  The safety latch is a nice feature that prevents accidental tripping while setting the trap. I don't follow the box instructions but rather set the traps on the surface.  This works well with a lot less effort than trying to bury them.  I've found that a person needs to be very patient.  The mole may not use the tunnel for several days.  In fact I've caught some after five or six days.  Picking the best tunnel is the hardest part of trapping moles so spent your time there rather than moving traps around every two days.

review/summary: I feel strongly BOTH ways!
review/text: Thanks to Mr. Klos and a lot of other people who have added to this forum, I am now the proud owner of 5 of these mole traps with no more moles to trap (for now).  Mr. Klos' method probably would work best if I had not spent the summer smashing down the mole runs. They just dug deeper tunnels. Common sense and a little exploration told me the Klos method would put the squeezers ABOVE the tunnel.  But, other reviews told that, once they figured out that the poor instructions on the package were for deeper tunnels, they were successful. All my tunnels were too deep to use the Klos method.<br /><br />So, I dug up each main run and cleaned out each end of the tunnel to find the common middle ground.  I built a hard mound in the center of the open space.  I loaded the trap and put the safety on.  I placed the trap directly on top of the mound, with the spring barely touching the mound.  It was good I kept the safety on until I buried the trap because a couple times I put it so far down the spring sprung.<br /><br />So, which way is best?  The method that puts the bottom of the trap at the bottom of the run. Don't smash the tunnels down; then, the trap can be placed on the top of the ground merely by inserting two slits in a main run.  I followed the seller's instructions and it worked for deeper runs. Next year, the runs will be trapped without being stomped down first.  Happy hunting.

review/summary: It works...it really, really works.
review/text: After 2 years trying various sprays, beepers, fake worms and inferior traps to no avail, I've finally found an effective means of mole control. The first week I trapped two moles.  Hallejulah!  I believe this trap is what the professionals use.  It's a little tricky to set because the spring is so strong but the effort is worth it.

review/summary: Perfect product!
review/text: Watched the previously mentioned videos and did some other research, then 4 hours later.... I had my mole. Worked perfect! Even though I bought 2, only needed one! I would have bought 5 to get rid of the mole that ruined our yard! I would give it 6 stars if it came with some grass seed to patch all the places the mole killed the grass!

review/summary: It works
review/text: Although I read lots of reviews and many said trapping those little pesky moles was the only way to get rid of them from your lawn, I was not totally convinced.  Ordered two of these traps and within 24 hours I had my first little varmint.  Second one shortly after.  Hitting a main run is a key, but darned if this trap doesn't do exactly what is says.  It works !!!!

review/text: This product will eliminate your mole problem.  If you place it on a path frequented by the varmits, it will KILL them.  I had tried everything from sprays to poisons to grub control, and nothing worked. Purchased this trap and the sucker was dead 2 days later.  Thanks for a real way to get rid of moles--scum of the earth critters!!!!!

review/summary: Bye Bye Mole!
review/text: First tried the sonic spikes and poison since that was what was available at the local Home Depot but after two weeks, the mole was still alive and I was frustrated. When the mole decided to move into my garden, it was the last straw. I got this trap along with the more expensive Wire Tek 1001. Set the Wire Tek out in hopes that I could just use one trap and return this one. But after a day, I hadn't caught it yet so I decided to deploy both. Moved the Wire Tek to a new location and put the Victor in it's place. I followed the instructions that came with it and within 12 hours, the Victor had a dead mole in its jaws. Easy to use, effective, and permanent solution for moles!

review/text: I'm looking forward to using this trap on a illusive mole that I just can't kill. I haveuse repellants, poisoned peanuts and a spike trap by Sweeney that was worthless.....so I put my trust into the reviews here and to the youtube videos on this trap......I'll post an updated review soon.

review/summary: Broke before it saw first use
review/text: Strong trap, but perhaps too strong. The spring bar bent under the spring's weight very early. Afterwards it was impossible to set and would snap before it was even set in the ground. Eventually the jaw cracked in half at the top.<br />Going to need to try something else.

review/summary: not useful in CA
review/text: I tried using this product for about a year with no success. I'm sure this works great in loamy lawns but I have plants, not grass, and live in suburban California, which means lots of clay! It is extremely difficult to find mole runs except in winter when the rain softens the clay. For my particular situation, i've found the Cinch mole traps to be extremely effective - they worked in a week. I did modify my method to try to match what other reviewers and youtube videos show, but if you don't have a nice soft lawn, there are better tools to catch moles with.

review/text: Worked exactly as described.  Unit is well built and inexpensive.  I had to wait a week for a mole to return to the run I had it installed in, but when he did return...he didn't leave..!  It was helpful to watch some YouTube videos on how to best install and use the trap.

review/summary: Even a Caveman could do it...
review/text: I am a newer homeowner - last 6 months or so and I noticed some dirt spots in the back yard from the previous owner. Not too sure/concerned about it I just let it be and was going to take measures in the fall to fill in the spots.<br /><br />Early spring rolls around and I have moles. I sprayed the yard with the oil stuff... didn't help, grub/worm stuff - either didn't work or i'm not patient enouh.<br /><br />I read the reviews and ended up buying 2 of these. I put them on what I thought were active trails/tunnels and after a day had no movement so I moved them again.<br /><br />Next day - BOOM! Got on and it pinched it's back, so it was still living to I relocated it to a field a few miles away. Put the trap in the SAME spot and next day BOOM! go another one - this one not so lucky...<br /><br />They work great - make sure just like the reviews state to cut two slits to fix the "claws" and to step down the ground even - remove the safety and you are good to go.

review/summary: Set it the way others say and it works great.
review/text: I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.

review/summary: Caught the mole within 12 hours!
review/text: I don't have lawn so I thought I could live with moles peacefully, as long as they don't destroy my landscaping. After two years those moles start popping up anywhere they want and dirt piles here and there. They are out of control. I have tried many baits and that ultra-sound thing, none of them work! I can't live with the moles anymore because my landscaping is being turned up-side down by them.<br /><br />I first bought one trap, after two weeks nothing happened. Then I bought another three. With all of these, I can make a trap field. I planted them last evening and this morning I went to check. Wahoo! One trap was triggered! I haven't looked at that it caught, but I am so sure there is a mole caught. I am so happy to write this review right after I saw the triggered trap.<br /><br />I think the most important thing is that, since mole is hard to track, you should use several traps together. Also on YouTube, there is a very nice video shows you how to set this trap up - build a dirt bridge, use some fresh tree leaves, etc. Carefully designing the trap field that was also contribute to the success.<br /><br />>>> I went to dig the mole out, this is my first experience on how a mole look like. It is very....YUCK!

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Bought 3 of these mole traps after a lot a research and reviews from others about this product.  Follow the suggestions of other users and caught a mole within an hour of setting the trap.  Have had the traps for about one month now and have caught 11 moles.  I can't believe the product works so well.  Would suggest you give them a try if you have a mole problem like I do.

review/summary: Caught my first mole yesterday
review/text: The trap caught him on the arm. He was still alive flopping around on the ground when I got home, so I beat him in the head countless times with a trowel. I imagine it looked like that scene from A Christmas Story when Ralphie beats up the neighborhood bully.<br /><br />I still have quite a few more to catch though. I have 5 of these traps I got from Home Depot for $9.99 all set out in my yard right now. Mole hunting is like a deadly game of chess.

review/text: After years of mole problems I finally bought this trap.  After trying several different tunnels, I finally found the correct one.  I caught the mole, but I did feel kinda bad.  I gave him a proper funeral, and said a few words. Don't try poisons or other crazy solutions.  Buy this trap and take the war to the moles.

review/summary: Finally, a trap that works
review/text: As many other reviewers have suggested, the best way to use this trap is NOT to bury it, just simply tamp the ground over the tunnel and make 2 slots for the jaws of the trap. It never misses, when it trips, you have one less critter ruining your lawn!
