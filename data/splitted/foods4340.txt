review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KFZ3LQ">Stephen's Gourmet Candycane Hot Cocoa, 1.4-Ounce Packets (Pack of 24)</a> is fantastic hot chocolate. It is a smooth chocolatey pepperminty treat... unlike cheap hot chocolate the Stephens Gourmet Hot Chocolate completely dissolves in hot water- with the exception of a few candy-cane chunks. To me it tastes very much like the peppermint hot chocolate from Starbucks - but at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Is there a drawback to this treat? Well year... you need to watch out for the 170 calories , 3g of fat (2.5g of saturated fat), and 26g of sugars. So despite the great taste you probably don't want to indulge in this treat more than once or twice a week.<br /><br />Final Verdict - The best hot chocolate that we have ever bought - a must buy for anyone who loves hot chocolate .<br /><br />5 Stars

review/summary: Subliminal Advertising .. at its Finest
review/text: This is review is not about the quality of the hot cocoa, which I am sure is top notch (hence the 5 stars.. as to not affect average rating of the product).  This review, however, is on the seemingly innocent bear with the strangely flatten head that grace the cover of the box.  Take several steps back from your monitor (or, just zoom as far out as possible using your browser), and you will notice a whole different creature adorning the box (or you may not).<br /><br />The whole bear, along with the darkened cup, if viewed cursorily at a distance, transforms into the lower half of the human torso.

review/text: I bought this hot chocolate from Walmart, but I can no longer get it there. I was happy to find Amazon offering it, and at a great price. I love the chocolate taste, but I am just tickled pink with the bits of peppermint in my cup. Everytime I go for a packet, I feel like its my special treat. Now, my two boys are completely hooked on it. Seems like every night their requesting now they want a delicious Stephens peppermint hot chocolate. I highly recommend this product. I am going back to try their other flavors too.

review/text: Love the Riedel glasses and had ordered them in the past from Amazon. Unfortunately, the Amazon shipping department seems to have difficulty packing delicate items: The first shipment included a couple of heavy books which shifted during mailing and broke the glasses. The replacement box had the glasses jammed against one corner with air packing around three sides. Those arrived broken, also. Guess we'll purchase the glasses at a wine shop! Love Amazon and this is the first time we've had a shipping problem with you!

review/summary: Beautiful, functional, lead-free
review/text: I chose these glasses over the crystal Vinum glasses as I use these every day and did not want to have more contact with lead than necessary. The Wine series strikes a fine balance between varietal specific bowls and the lead free glass at a very reasonable price point. I have received many compliments on these glasses both from people who "know" wine as well as people who have never had wine from a varietal specific glass before. My only word of advice is to check the glasses as soon as you get them, of the 16 glasses I ordered of various styles, 2 glasses from 2 different shipments arrived with shattered stems as amazon did not pad the boxes of glasses enough and did not mark the boxes in any way as fragile.

review/summary: Same as from the grocery, but cheaper
review/text: If you buy smoked oysters, you know this brand already. Its probably the most common one out there. I find Amazon's prices beat the local grocery, it's always packed well, and the expiration dates are over a year away. I eat a lot of these as I tend to run Iron poor in my blood, and the doc said that oysters are probably one of the best (read most easily digestible) sources for Iron. While there are pills, studies have found you're MUCH better off getting it from a food source

review/summary: Oysters are great food, but cottonseed oil is bad for you.
review/text: These oysters taste good, no question, but cottonseed oil is unhealthful. If you want details (you should), google on, for example, "Dr Weil cottonseed oil". I'll quote a tiny bit: "[Cottonseed oil is] definitely not [OK]. [...] in my book, [...] one of the first things I ask readers to do is to go through their pantry shelves and throw out anything made with cottonseed oil. I regard it as unhealthy because it is too high in saturated fat and too low in monounsaturated fat. What's more, cottonseed oil may contain natural toxins and probably has unacceptably high levels of pesticide residues (cotton is not classified as a food crop, and farmers use many agrichemicals when growing it)."<br /><br />So there you have it.<br /><br />When buying oysters (or sardines, or tuna, or whatever) in oil, I use the following heuristic: either olive oil, or no oil at all (go for water, or tomato sauce, or similar). If you want oysters, go with Crown Prince oysters, which are packed in pure olive oil and can be had from Trader Joe's for two-twenty-nine a tin (I'm not affiliated with them in any way, shape, or form: this is my personal opinion based on direct experience with the product that I bought myself with me own good money).

review/text: I have eaten Reese's Smoked Oysters for years. I am sorry to say that their recent cans have not been as good tasting as they used to be. I started looking at where they are from, and suspect that the source of the oysters may have contributed.  In general we have been avoiding eating foods from Thailand, China, and some other Asian countries. With all the problems with items from China in particular, we prefer to eat USA produced foods and buy locally as much as possible

review/summary: Small, perfect snack packs
review/text: First, if you don't like seaweed, be forewarned, you won't like these. They have a strong seaweed taste. Think like the seaweed that is used to make sushi, only since it's dried, its flavor is intensified. There is a strong 'fishy' scent to the seaweed snacks too.<br /><br />My first reaction wasn't positive, to be honest. They were super, super thin and brittle and the scent of seaweed and fishiness was a bit strong upon first opening the package. I took a tiny tentative bite from the edge and did not taste any wasabi or heat level at all. I finally broke down and put the whole thin crisp in my mouth and wow! The wasabi was nice and strong, but not super hot hot. There was a good crisp flavor and yet the crispy snack sort of melted in my mouth too.<br /><br />Each package is individually wrapped, perfect for packing for a lunch or taking somewhere for a snack, storing at the office, etc. Great for a healthier snack alternative. I like the flavor, once I got the wasabi kick. Seaweed is supposed to be really good for thyroid health and other phyto and micro-nutrients too. I was really pleased with these snacks and I think I'm going to buy more of them and maybe try some other flavors. They were surprisingly good. I've been considering ways they might be able to be used in cooking, as I think they'll reconstitute well too. I will update my review if I happen to give that a try.<br /><br />If you like seaweed or have enjoyed the sushi seaweed wrap, these are flavorful and you'll probably enjoy them too. I don't think they are for everybody (my son hated them), but sushi lovers will probably enjoy these quite a bit.

review/summary: Truly strangely addictive
review/text: I discovered these in a local health food store when I began searching for seaweed products as a way to add some iodine to my diet. The store carried lots of products, but most were processed with nasty canola oil which I try to avoid as I do all the high-PUFA oils. Then I found SeaSnax which use olive oil!<br /><br />I bought some and the rest was history. Now I buy them in bulk from amazon because the price is much better. Yes, they do have a slightly fishy odor and flavor - but I *like* that. You may not like them as much as I do if that bothers you. But for me they are the perfect snack - great taste, a nice crunchy mouth-feel, low in carbs and calories. No matter what your eating goals or eating style - low carb, low cal, low fat, vegan, etc. these snacks can fill the bill, but you *must* like that slightly fishy taste and scent. However in my case I do!<br /><br />The wasabi flavor has a small bit of "bite" but I would not call them overly spicy. Just a faint hint of something extra there, but it does add a little extra dimension to the taste above and beyond the plain.

review/text: So far I have tried the original and the onion, so I tried this one because it came with the lot I bought. Well, got to say, It is spicy and it hits your mouth right away, no building up to it. Surprisingly, I just don't see my self "warming up" to these. The good news is though, it does not leave that horrible hot feeling in your mouth. Once the sea weed is consumed the heat goes away.

review/summary: Great for dipping and marinating/basting
review/text: This is an interesting product that is made from grape must (the same base for grappa!) and balsamic vinegar. I am a vegetarian, but also eat fish, so I keep this on hand mainly for friends for whom I cook or entertain. For personal use this is wonderful as a flavor enhancer for fresh strawberries. A drop on a fresh, ripe strawberry comes close to the same exquisite taste that a very old Acetaia Reale would draw out. Well, not close, but in the same ballpark.<br /><br />For friends, especially those who insist on mixing balsamic vinegar, olive oil and spices such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAWHPM">Alessi Dipping Spice Grinder, 0.76-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> as a bread dip, I use this instead. First, it actually mixes with the olive oil, giving a more uniform dipping sauce, and second, it has the balsamic vinegar flavor. Personally, I do not understand the need to mask the nuances of a good extra virgin olive oil with the heavier flavor of a balsamic vinegar, but I do endeavor to be a good host so I accommodate.<br /><br />Many of my friends prefer their fish to not taste fishy. To me that defeats the purpose, but since nobody elected me to dictate how fish should taste I use a little of this as a marinate (along with lemon juice) as a marinate before cooking the fish. Apparently it does the job because even friends who normally dislike fish seem to enjoy it when prepared that way.<br /><br />For basting, this is ideal with vegetables such as zucchini, peppers, eggplant and similar to be grilled over a charcoal fire. I usually mix a little of this with some olive oil, which as I stated above, it blends with perfectly, and a little crushed garlic. Baste, grill and enjoy. Conversely, you can grill the vegetables plain and use the mixture as a dipping sauce ... or just a few drops of this balsamic glaze as a flavor enhancer directly on the vegetables when they are served.<br /><br />I have not explored all of the possibilities with this product, but am glad I stumbled across it at my local market was was curious enough to give it a try. I am on my third bottle! One final use is to make gift baskets consisting of this, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTR41G">Gia Russa Olive, Extra Virgin, 17-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> (a high quality olive oil), and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00759NNKI">Balsamic Vinegar of Modena</a>.

I work on board a ship where we don't get to eat dinner much, but we do have a Microwave in our work space so Easy Mac becomes dinner.

review/summary: It doesn't taste like the original mac & cheese... I couldn't eat it.
review/text: I love the Original Easy Mac because it tastes just like the boxed Kraft mac & cheese.  So, I decided to try the Extreme Cheese variety thinking it would just have more of that same cheesy taste.<br /><br />It doesn't.  It tastes.... different.  Unfortunately, I'm one of those people that generally doesn't like new foods.  If I'm eating a food that I grew up on, it needs to be very similar to what I ate when I was growing up (for example, my mom's beef stew has a gravy-like consistency, so beef stew recipes I try now that has red wine in a brothy-type liquid, I'll end up not liking it, because it's not like Mom's!).<br /><br />This Extreme Cheese variety tastes like a different cheese... a swiss-like flavor, maybe?  I think that's best how to describe it, a strong bittersweet flavor of Swiss cheese that's been aged a long time.  But I don't like Swiss cheese, because I was raised on cheddar.  I've tried two packets of this Extreme Cheese stuff, and I simply cannot bring myself to eat it.<br /><br />Oh, well, I gave it a shot.  Those who aren't as picky as I am might very well like this variety, though.

review/summary: Gross Don't Buy It
review/text: My three kids liked eating the old fashioned kind. Now that they changed it my kids won't touch it anymore, and when I tried it I have to say it was the most awful taste ever. Sorry but I won't be buying this anymore unless they bring it back the way it was before. There was no need to change it let me just put it that way. Healthy or not if people don't like it they won't eat it. If that is to hard to understand than your just going to lose alot of money. With three kids we used to buy this all the time but not anymore. I also noticed the price inched up a bit as well on this.

review/summary: CONTAINS MSG
review/text: The "Natural flavor" in this product contains processed free glutamic acid, the active ingredient in MSG.  This and dozens of other terms are allowed to be listed as a cover for MSG.  Manufacturers know we don't want this in our food so they call it something else, something we don't recognize.  In addition, "Maltodextrin" is a synthetically created super-sugar and is very bad for your health.  If you care about your health or just want to avoid MSG, don't buy this product!

review/summary: Definitely much better than bouillon
review/text: The non-organic version of this chicken base (available for around $4 at Wegmans' grocery stores in NY/NJ/PA) is a staple in my kitchen. I also use the beef, clam, and (vegetarian) vegetable bases and will never, ever go back to bouillon cubes.  The taste is less salty than bouillon cubes and free of either the oxidized off-flavor of bouillon cubes and low salt bouillon powder packets, or the metallic "tin can" off-flavor of canned broths.  Is one bouillon cube too little and two too much? With these you can add exactly what you need.  The bases are very good on their own and especially good for extending, salting and "filling out" the fresh but uncomplicated taste of homemade stocks. Note, refrigerate after opening.

review/text: I have used this product for years and would be lost without it.  It not only works for any and all recipes that call for chicken stock, but it is also great for adding chicken flavor to things like mashed potatoes, rice, etc.  It is very handy for the "flu" season when you just want to hunker down with a cup of chicken soup.  For those times, I make a cup of chicken broth using this product.  Sometimes, I add leftovers from the fridge... rice, vegies, chicken.  The other flavors are also very handy... adding distinct flavors to your cooking repertoire.

review/summary: No MSG, No Soy, no garbage chemical soup, and tastes great!
review/text: I purchased this after it was recommended to me by my mother who is a fantastic cook.  However I didn't want the other garbage processed food that you find with so many things in the stores these days.  We have recently been removing processed foods and questionable ingredients from our diets so we have been doing without a lot of things while we learn to adjust and make things ourselves.  I looked at the conventional Better Than Bouillon in the store and sadly it has some of those same characteristics with ingredients I was not happy with so I decided to pass.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was an organic version of this product so I was hopeful again that maybe there was a healthy alternative.  So I looked it up, the ingredients looked healthy for my family so I took a chance and ordered it.  It is fantastic!  Works great and I can once again make my homemade soups and recipes that I would normally need bouillon seasoning without worrying about what is in it.  Give this a try and I think you will like it too!

(I also used my Amazon Credit Card Points and Super Saver Shipping.)<br /><br />I will be using it in soups and more but today I made fried rice.<br /><br />I put a small amount in the water for the rice, with just a bit of soy sauce.<br /><br />Used just a bit in a small amount of the water I used to cook up the mixed veggies.  I added a clove of garlic and a little chopped onion.<br /><br />I poached chicken in a small amount of water with a little soy sauce.<br /><br />In a big pan with hot oil I added all the ingredients and stirred a couple minutes.  I then added 2 scrambled eggs.<br /><br />For something like this I never use measures, it is to taste.<br /><br />I made an extra big batch and froze it.  Yes, rice freezes as long as it is not reconstituted rice which I am not even sure what that is.<br /><br />Next time I make beef and brocolli with nuts using the beef paste.

review/summary: Delicious, but misleading nutrition information
review/text: I enjoy this product immensely. Good clean flavor, not at all chemical or artificial tasting, and feel-good organic, to boot. BUT, But I must say that I am quite puzzled by the nutrition information on the jar label. According to my label a 1 teaspoon serving has 11 calories, 4 g fat, 1 g carb, and 42 gr protein. This is impossible. 1g fat=9 calories, 1 g carb=4 calories, 1 g protein = 4 calories. So, this product, if it does indeed have the quantities of nutrients that the label says it has, should have 36 fat calories, 4 carb calories and 168 protein calories, with a total of 208 calories per teaspoon. As you see, the label must be incorrect, either with the calorie count or the nutrients count.<br /><br />I took a look at the organic vegetable base and it has a similar disparity in its nutrient/calorie count.<br /><br />So which is it? 11 or 208 calories? It makes a big difference to me, as I am watching my fat and overall calorie intake.<br /><br />To make matters more confusing the Amazon add says "naturally fat  free. Now I'm even more flummuxed.

review/summary: Great stuff, organic at a reasonable price, simple to use
review/text: We regularly use chicken stock in recipes, and usually buy an organic version from the grocery store.  It's a bit pricey, but we like to reduce our exposure to non-organic chicken as much as possible.<br /><br />However, we got tired of the high price of such stock, and went looking for alternatives.  We found this base, gave it a try, and LOVED it.  It's a concentrate, so it takes up much less cabinet and refrigerator storage, and it dissolves quickly and easily in hot water.<br /><br />Also, this is one of the few products that we don't buy via Amazon Prime even though it's available, but it's currently available for half the Prime price from other vendors, and you can get multiple jars for one flat shipping fee, which makes is significantly cheaper than both the Prime version and also cheaper than the stuff we get at the grocery store.<br /><br />Put it all together, and this has now become one of the staples in our kitchen - love it.

review/summary: Over priced for the taste...
review/text: Firstly, I love all Asian (Indian to Chinese to Indo-Asian) foods and frequently eat in restaurants serving such cuisines and I use all spices from those regions in my cooking. I've tried and have many Asian sauces, pastes, spices, etc., and this product tastes in the middle range for flavor and cost 3x too much.  The first thing my taste buds noticed is salt, green curry, ginger, a hint of lemongrass and everything else was too faint and didn't interests my taste bud to discern.  Some reviewers mentioned  you only need to use a little, for me I had to use one full table spoon to two-three measure cups of water to get the kind of rich flavor I am used to.  My curiosity has been settled and I will not be paying this PRICE for this product again.  I might consider a second purchase, if I find it on the shelf for $3.75.  You could buy 4 different brands of similar sauce in an Asian store and mix them to get more interesting flavors and a richer taste result than from this one product.  I gave it a 3 star rating because it has a 'decent'--I could take or leave it flavor, but will never buy it again for ~$12. (I'll list my one favorite sauce/spice paste later.  I have to find the empty bottle I kept for reference because it is so hard to find in stores.)  I just wanted to get this comment out first because the price to flavor ratio was very disappointing to me.

review/text: This snack is, frankly, to your taste.  If you like the combination of raisins, nuts, and M&M's, you'll love it (as I do).  Its a good snack, healthy, balanced, but again you need to watch your portion sizes (if you're watching your waist as well).  My daughter, tho, doesn't like salt on her raisins, so she picks them all out.  In fact, she separates each item and eats the nuts separately from the chocolate pieces.  Go figure. This is personally my favorite combination of trail mixes, and there are a good amount of chocolate pieces to satisfy your sweet tooth too.  The nuts and raisins help balance this out to a nutritional Plus.

I did not necessarily like it, therefore, was not so happy. I am looking for a nutritional snack but I do not care much about diet (I'm okay with getting all the bad stuff as long as I am also getting the good stuff). My first issue was the lack of salt. Yes, great for most who care about that, but I do not (give me my hypertension). The second is a lack of the chocolate pieces. The overall characteristics seem disproportionate to me as they use chocolate raisins and chocolate peanuts on top of the already added raisins and plain peanuts. I just becomes peanut-raisin overkill.

review/summary: Good Ranch Flavor
review/text: This seasoning has a good ranch flavor. I tasted it right out of the container and it seemed a bit harsh, but once it was on the popcorn it tasted really good. I used about a tablespoon of seasoning for one bowl of popcorn. I think that was a little on the light side; probably 1.5 - tablespoons would have been better, but that's a matter of taste. Use less flavoring than you think you want and just add more if necessary.<br /><br />My husband also used this on some potatoes and I think it would blend nicely with sour cream or yogurt for a good dip. So, it's versatile. The price seems a little steep, but a little of the seasoning goes a long way. Based on my experience with this flavor, I'm going to try some of the other Paragon seasonings.<br /><br />Oh, and there's no monosodium glutamate (MSG) in the product.

review/summary: Phenomenal Tamarind-based Pad Thai Sauce
review/text: I have used this sauce for my Pad Thai for over 10 yrs and it is one of the best I've tried.  Added to the very end of your stir-fry, the sauce keeps its thickness and imbues the lovely sweet flavour that Pad-Thai is known for.  For even more authenticity, you can add a 1/2 cup of smooth peanut butter to the sauce and warm it together over the stove.  Be sure to whisk them together well and you'll get very close to the sweet/peanutty flavour of an authentic Pad Thai sauce.  This is an excellent product.

review/summary: Thai Kitchen means No Thai in the Kitchen
review/text: I have been really disappointed with some kind of change in the Thai Kitchen line. All the sauces, curry pastes, some of which I used to use about a decade ago, have been turned into tasteless muck.<br /><br />So it's also true of the Pad Thai sauce. This sauce isn't even the right color. I made up their recipe (which was more or less right except it added the peanuts at the wrong point) and I got a brown mess (should have been more reddish in color) that tasted vaguely sour--only because I added lime juice. It was as flavorless as milk and water. The same is true of their red or green curry paste. Totally taste-free.<br /><br />I suppose they mixed up new recipes to suit "American" tastes and the mixtures that passed a broad taste panel had no taste; not everyone likes Thai food. But this Pad Thai mix is absolutely garbage.<br /><br />Go find a recipe--it's not that hard to make and skip this sauce. It's bad. I tasted one forkful and the entire batch went directly into the garbage can.

Of course you have to drink responsibly and mixing a great tasting energy drink with alcohol can be dangerous.  With that said!  I recommend it!  It's blue and tastes like a berry slushy.  So good!

review/text: I don't know why CornNuts are so hard to find in stores around Dallas.  They are my very favorite thing to snack on.  So I was pretty thrilled to see them available from Amazon.  They are very good!<br /><br />I like this package, because it gave me a variety of flavors.  It comes with 10 original, 6 ranch, 4 barbecue, and 4 chile picante in 1.7 oz bags.<br /><br />If I could change anything at all about this package, I would put an equal number of each flavor in it, instead of so many original, and so few barbeque.  And I'm not a big fan of the Chile Picante flavor, so I would have replaced that with Nacho flavor instead.<br /><br />CornNuts are very crunchy toasted corn.  The "original flavor" ingredients are corn, corn oil, and salt.  (It tastes a bit like Fritos, but instead of a flat chip, it's a crunchy corn shape.)

review/text: I haven't eaten cornuts since the 90s, those were the golden days yes they were, things were so innovative and tasteful. One of the many things I ate as a kid in school was cornuts, friends would share them, trade flavors for other flavors it was just something everyone had in their sack lunch, and if they didnt they tried trading there most valuable lunch food for a bag or a small handful of these gems. Today you don't hear about them at all, they rarely sell the assorted flavors like they have online, I was surprised to say that the cornuts I recieved were not rotton, spoiled, or taste bad in any way, (well except for the originals which I dont care for anyway). The pack comes with original,ranch,bbq,chili picante. They all taste good, but there are more originals in the pack and very few ranch,bbq,chilie picante.

It does make it a little more difficult to spread.  However, if you leave it out for just a little while, it makes it easier to spread.  Try it on plain bagels, celery, apples--basically anything you usually use with peanut butter.  Great new product.  Also try the nut butter with pretzels and honey.

review/text: I bought this in an effort to reduce my sodium intake and replace ketchup on everything I eat.  I've put in on eggs, cauliflower, cabbage and some meat dishes.  Tastes great!  Very happy with this and will try some other flavors.

review/summary: A flavorful blend
review/text: This adds plenty flavor without salt.  This product is good for those with high blood pressure and those who do not want to get high blood pressure in the future.  Garlic is good on everything. :)
