review/summary: They should call this oatMMMMMMMMMMMmeal.
review/text: I am really happy with the switch to steel cut oats. I find it to be a much heartier and tastier option over the more common rolled oats. The tradeoff is the cooking. I haven't tried cooking it in my Zojirushi rice cooker on the porridge setting, but I did make a batch in my Fagor pressure cooker, and boy was it GOOD. My last serving prepared I added some of the McCann's Oat Bran toward the end of cooking, too, with a fresh diced apple and some walnuts. I wasn't hungry all day and my glucose levels hardly budged.

review/summary: There Is No Better Oatmeal Around
review/text: I'm biased, I'm Irish and overall I think everything is better if it comes from Ireland.  This includes whiskey, beer and now oatmeal!  The oatmeal, of course, is the healthiest of the three!  I know that Oprah has recommended steel cut oats for their health benefits, and while I'm not big into listening to Oprah it appears she's right on target here.  I started eating these right after a cholesterol test, the doctor wanted to put me on medication and I asked if I could come back and take another test in two weeks.  I changed my diet to include Irish oats for breakfast every morning and in two weeks the doctor said "hey, whatever you're doing just keep it up" as the numbers were much better.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there's nothing that is a miracle here, but they are definitely a healthy choice for breakfast that will leave you better off than sugar filled cereals or bacon and eggs.  The oatmeal's taste is fairly bland, as you'd expect from oatmeal so I like to make mine with cinnamon and raisins or with either a little honey or sweetner added.<br /><br />Amazon has always been a better price than any of our normal grocery stores so it's a great place to get them if you're local club store doesn't carry it!

review/summary: Family loves McCann's Steel Cut
review/text: We all love this oatmeal.  We usually use the overnight method because the time at the stove is less.  We follow the directions with two slight changes:  1)  We add two tablespoons of dark brown sugar, and 2)  We cook for 9-10 minutes the next morning so we get the more 'nutty' texture.  McCann's is hard to find in grocery stores, so we order it this way and it seems to store well in the pantry.  We have purchased this before through Amazon and we recommend this to anyone who likes really good oatmeal.

review/text: After being introduced to this unique textured oatmeal by a friend, I knew I was never going back to rolled oats again.

review/text: What can you say about oatmeal? B-O-R-I-N-G.<br />But also F-I-L-L-I-N-G.<br /><br />A good source of dietary fiber, steel cut oatmeal is more interesting than the mushy Quaker Oats kind. McCann's has sort of a nutty flavor, and the texture is much more palatable. If you're going to eat oatmeal go for the steel cut variety. I've tried another brand, and McCann's is on par. Add some fruit or brown sugar to make it more interesting if you must...<br /><br />FYI - Your local Costco might have something comparable

review/summary: steel cut oatmeal
review/text: My husband had a bowl of steel cut oatmeal at a restaurant  a short while ago and he came home raving about how different and good it was.  We then decided to "google" steel cut oatmeal and then went to Amazon to see if it could be purchased, as we could not find it in any store.  The McCANN'S Steel Cut Irish oatmeal is just like the restaurant according to my husband, and he has been making it every morning for breakfast along with a bit of brown sugar.  We will be giving a tin out to friends as a little Christmas present, too!!  It is a great product and  by the way, it makes great "crunchy" cookies as the texture is that way.

Much more satisfying because you have to chew a little and that makes you feel full more easily and keeps you satisfied longer.  I'm not picky about brands, but I really like this brand because once I've finished a tin, I can put a label on it and use it to store stuff like flour, sugar, and chocolate chips.

review/summary: Delicious; nice texture; causes lots of gas
review/text: McCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal has a very rich flavor. The texture is very "whole grain" and chewy, which you may not like. It requires a lot of chewing. This oatmeal is way too fibrous for me, so I ground it in a coffee grinder, as someone else suggested, which eliminated the flatulence and reduced the cooking time to 5 minutes from 30 minutes while retaining the extremely filling nature of this product and its fantastic flavor. [By the way, it is cheaper at W-M.] Unfortunately, I won't purchase this product again because oat bran cereal tastes just as good and is higher in fiber and requires no grinding.

review/text: I bought this as a special lightning deal price.  McCann's makes steel cut oats that are among the best...and I have tried many different ones over the years. Steel cut oats take longer to cook than traditional oatmeal, but the result<br />is vastly superior...a chewy nutty hot cereal that tastes great with sugar or (better yet) maple syrup. You can<br />prepare it ahead of time and reheat it for a faster breakfast. It "stays" with you, and you will be much less<br />likely to get the mid morning "hungries" that tempt you to go after that hi-cal donut or muffin between 9:00-10:00am!!!

We have enjoyed these with mangoes & blueberries, brown sugar and blueberry flax granola, and many other combos! We definitely recommend these. Amazon offers a great price per can, as compared to my local co-op.

review/summary: Not your regular oatmeal!
review/text: This stuff sure is tasty, however it's pretty much nothing like your Quaker standard oatmeal. They are more pellet like bits instead of flattened oatmeal, and it seems to have a little bit more of a nutty flavor.  (More like buckwheat)  It's important that you know it will take longer to cook than your standard oatmeal so if you're looking for a quick breakfast you'll have to cook it up the night before.  I just boil water in a pot and then add in the oatmeal. (As the directions state) It will take about 30 minutes to make with some stirring.  Once it's done cooking I'll add a splash of milk, and brown sugar and it's delicious.  The texture is definitely more firm than the "standard" oatmeal.<br /><br />I took one star off since all of the cans in the 4 pack I bought were dented, two of them pretty badly and they don't easily close.  There is a seal on the inside so this doesn't affect the oatmeal you'll just need to put it in a different container if you want it to stay fresh.<br /><br />Yum!

review/summary: Best You Can Buy
review/text: My brother turned me on to McCann's steel cut oats about three years ago.  I have a bowl every morning.  I've tried some of the short cuts but I find it best to cook it for 30 - 35 minutes rather than any pre-cook or microwave method.  I use a small rice cooker I bought at Target. It's electric with a 4 cup pan, steamer stage that sits on top of the pan and a glass lid.  I put a spoon through each handle to weight down the steamer stage, otherwise, the boiling oatmeal will push it off the pan. I've also learned to not use the glass lid to keep it from boiling over.  When I get up I start it and it turns off when it's done.  In the meantime I get ready for the day. Best with a real nutty whole grain bread and coffee.  I've tried several other brands and nothing compares.  Amazon's price is cheaper than Walmart.

The cooking time is quite a bit longer than regular oatmeal but if you have the time to devote to the cooking then its well worth it. My suggestion would be if you are a diabetic, try it at least once testing your blood sugar 2 hours after your first bite to see what effect it has on your blood sugar.

review/text: First time I've ever cooked and eaten real oatmeal.  I was expecting it to be the same old same old; not at all!  Great texture and flavor.  Had it for breakfast and as snacks, too!  Made a big pot of it on Sunday, so I could eat it for breakfast all week: Yeah, right!  It was gone by Tuesday morning.

review/summary: Love these oats
review/text: So like a lot of people out there, I love these oats!  I've been eating the standard Quaker oats for a long time but after Amazon had a special on Mcann's oatmeal, I tried them and I'm hooked.  The standard oatmeal is more mushy and soft and sometimes made me gag if I ate a lot (I still liked them, go figure..) but these oats are different.  More nutty and texture and flavor.  I make them the Alton Brown's way (3 cups of water for 20 minutes, add 1 more cup of milk for 10) and they're delicous.  I originally bought 8 cans (the special) and wasn't sure if I would go through them or thought it would take a year to finish them, but they are almost gone 3 1/2 months later!  I'm buying more as we speak (or I type)...

review/summary: Wow, what a difference
review/text: between this and the oatmeal I have been eating all my life. I love this stuff and so do the kids, which really surprised me. I mean they liked the regular oatmeal I would make, but they tend to dig their stubborn little heels in whenever I try to introduce something different in food. But one bite and they were instant fans. I haven't cooked it in a crockpot and truthfully I don't find the cooking process to be that tedious or time consuming. Basically spend five or so minutes until it thickens then put a lid on the pot, turn the fire down to simmer and pretty much leave it alone while I get coffee on, the kids chivied out of bed...etc. Then a little butter, a little brown sugar and we are eating the best oatmeal in the world. And I don't think you can find it cheaper. Actually in my part of the world I can't find it at any local market. I would have to drive 100 miles to Tulsa to find a store that carried it. My order arrived before it's estimated date, the cans were not dented. Couldn't be happier with the product and will continue buying it here.

review/summary: Oatmeal, it's what's for breakfast!
review/text: I love this oatmeal for both the taste and texture. True, it's not refined enough to just soak overnight without much cooking, like you can do with "quick" oats (which I also love).<br /><br />Don't kill me because I bought it for the reusable containers! Yes, they came with a few dings, but that's ok. I bought them last year when on sale here for less than now, and think I got a great deal.<br /><br />I eat them with butter, salt and pepper, or berries, sugar and cream. Their website also has ideas about precooking http://www.mccanns.ie/preparation.html<br /><br />The worst that can happen is that you reuse the can to hold trail mix, a candle, or bath salts, etc.<br /><br />Warning, you do have to gently pry the lid off--every time!<br /><br />I bet they'd be great as a crunchy topping, but I'll have to search around for how to do that without breaking a tooth! (Excuse me if someone has already mentioned this--I haven't read all the reviews.)

I've had no problem with them sticking to the pan. I stir them maybe three times during the cook time. I also cooked a double batch and refrigerated them overnight. They were just as great tasting as when first cooked. I then tried freezing some and a few days later had them for breakfast and they were still great tasting. I don't know if refrigerating or freezing them makes them less healthly but it was quicker if you don't have the time.

I've seen McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal in the stores at $6 to $7 per can, so I've always left it there on the shelf. Then I saw it on Amazon for a very nice price, I thought I would splurge because all the other reviews said this is great stuff.<br /><br />Well, although shipping seems to cause dents in the cans (but they remained sealed), I heartily recommend this oatmeal to anyone who likes a hot cereal. This is simply amazing stuff. It takes a LONG time to cook, but it is well worth it! Make a bunch and put the leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator - reheating doesn't take long at all in the microwave!<br /><br />The different texture and great taste will blow you away! Five stars!

review/summary: The health benefits had me intrigued....the taste has me SOLD!
review/text: I never thought I'd say I love oatmeal, but here I am saying just that. This stuff is just fantastic!  I hadn't heard of steel cut oats, but when Amazon offers a great deal, I *have* to check it out  (bargain-hunting... it's a gift...and a curse). I did the research and was amazed at all I found about the health benefits of steel cut oats. I was greatly encouraged by the rave reviews on Amazon, but I admit, a bit skeptical. I mean, really, it's JUST oatmeal, right?<br /><br />Wrong! I bought this product and the quick-cooking variety as well. I am hooked on this product!  I am usually NOT one to plan ahead, but I make a big batch of this at the beginning of the week, portion it out into covered bowls and have it for breakfast everyday. I love the chewy texture and nutty flavor. I've made it with water, milk and organic apple juice. My favorite is half water, half apple juice with pecans, dried cranberries and cinnamon. SO delicious and filling! However one of the things I love about buying this "basic" product is being able to mix it up however I like.<br /><br />Yes, the cans arrived dented, but the oatmeal was intact, so it didn't bother me a bit. I did find the same product at my local Publix for $4.99 a can, which is  cheaper than the Amazon price, however, since I have Prime the shipping is free AND I will probably subscribe to the auto ship on this product, which does lower the price to less than my local store, plus, NO TAX (and Tennessee DOES love their taxes on food items). But if Amazon offers another amazing deal on it, I won't hesitate to stock up (and get ONLY the long cooking version this time)!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product and will be pestering my mom and sisters to get some too. I know they will love it, and it's so good for them!

review/summary: Doesn't get much better
review/text: Long time Oatmeal eater here.  I usually bought McCann's in the store, but it can get pretty pricey.  Amazon is a great deal, and you get free shipping.<br /><br />FYI, medium- to long-term is it unhealthy to consume steel-cut oatmeal UNLESS you soak it in warm water with something acidic between 12 to 24 hours, preferably some fermented milk product like yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, etc.  Reason being is that oatmeal contains in its hull enzyme inhibitors that have a chelating effect on your body, i.e., they remove metal from your body.  While short-term this may be beneficial (meat eaters stockpile extra iron, copper, etc. over time), medium-term this could lead to deficiencies in essential metals.  Soaking the oatmeal at least overnight neutralizes the enzyme inhibitors.  Additionally, it allows you to cook up the oatmeal in about five minutes, versus over 30 minutes when left unsoaked.<br /><br />This recipe follows the recipe in Nourishing Traditions, but basically soak one part oatmeal with one part lukewarm water.  Add a little bit of yogurt to create the acidic environment: I use one TBSP per 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of warm water.<br /><br />Oatmeal should be eaten with some fat (many of the vitamins are fat soluble), so I add butter or cream.  I also add shredded flax and coconut, increasing the healthiness of my breakfast.  I then top it off with plenty of raw honey (also from Amazon), which sweetens my porridge and thus makes me look forward to breakfast in the morning.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Why do these taste SO good?
review/text: Oats is oats, right? Well, apparently not. These steel cut oats have a toasty, nutty, wonderful flavor that is distinct from steel cut oats grown elsewhere. The tin is of course wonderful; it keeps this slightly oily grain fresh and it can be used when empty for holding coins, treasures buried in the backyard or any other number of things.<br /><br />The oats take longer to cook than standard rolled oatmeal, but that's not a problem if you soak the oats, use a pressure cooker, rice cooker or plan ahead. We love these oats in winter with a dab of butter and a teaspoon or two of local wildflower honey. Good with salt and cream also.

review/text: BE CAREFULL!<br /><br />How much you pay for this will depend greatly on how you order it from amazon...  the way I ordered it was for a four pack that qualified for free shipping.  Otherwise, you're better off trying to find this locally.<br /><br />I used to have gloppy "instant" oatmeal for breakfast.  Not anymore!  I make this THE NIGHT BEFORE with a four to one ratio of oats to water, bringing the water to a boil and adding the oats, along with some cinnnamon and vanilla.  It takes five minutes.  I let this sit overnight, and when I get up in the morning I add a little milk and have the best damn breakfast you can imagine.  The cinnamon and vanilla allow me to use splenda instead of sugar for sweetener, and I have a healthy breakfast!  I eat this five or six times a week!  I can't recommend it highly enough!  Make sure you order the four pack that qualifies for free shipping!  Guys will find many, many uses for the tin that the oats come in!  Swanky!

review/summary: Dee-licious! (And healthy)
review/text: I hate instant oatmeal. I thought I hated ALL oatmeal until I tried Steel Cut. This has a great texture and is much healthier for you than that instant paste!<br /><br />When I make this I add a bit less water than most recipes call for. I make a big pot in my RICE COOKER which means I don't have to stir or watch a burner...so really no extra WORK than the instant.<br /><br />AND I make mine "instant" too! See, when I make a big pot (about 8 servings), I scoop out individual serving sizes into little Gladware containers. I add a little vanilla extract, half a packet of Splenda, a few apple slices, a few banana slices and....some dark chocolate chips. Then I freeze it! (Also nice because you don't have to have a fresh apple or banana on hand every time you want the oatmeal)<br /><br />When I go to work in the morning I grab one out of the freezer, zap in the microwave for about 3 minutes and voila! "Instant" oatmeal with great flavor, texture and toppings!!

review/summary: Simply Outstanding!
review/text: Wonderful product. "Instantly" puts all "instant oatmeal" (except McCann's) products in the trash heap. It does take 30 minutes to cook, but following the directions on the can (4 cups water, 1 cup oats) this makes four breakfasts (just under 1 cup of cooked oats each) for me; it might make 5 for smaller appetites.<br /><br />I make it in the evening by starting with the water and oats, with just a touch of salt in the water. Stir the oats initially, then set a timer and leave it be on very low heat (just barely bubbling). At the end of 30 minutes, stir well, then I divide the oatmeal into 4 equal parts (usually just under 1 cup each) and put it into those little Glad Serv-n-Saver type containers (the "Tupperware" you don't mind losing!). Into each container ("bowl") I like to mix a handful of raisins (or other dried fruit, but raisins are my personal favorite), a dash or two of cinnamon, about a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of ground flax seed. I then mix each thoroughly and cover; then all 4 "ready to heat and serve" bowls go into the fridge.<br /><br />Each morning, then, I pour about a tablespoon of skim or soy milk on top of the oatmeal, then microwave for 1min 20sec (your oven may vary, of course). Stir, and enjoy; I eat it right out of the Serv-n-Saver bowl, which cuts down on washing, too! It's a wonderful tasting, quick and HEALTHY part of your breakfast. It's high fiber, so it's filling, which tends to cut your overall caloric intake and it goes a long way toward the American Heart Association's recommended daily fiber serving; most Americans are woefully below this in their usual diet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as a part of a healthy, low-fat, low calorie, low glycemic and high fiber diet. It helped me drop my total cholesterol level over 40 points (as part of a comprehensive diet plan) WITHOUT drugs.

review/summary: Simple RECIPE
review/text: Perhaps some of you are like I was... wanting to take advantage of the health benefits of oatmeal, but uncertain how to prepare it so that you and your family will actually eat it. After experimenting a bit, and reading lots of recipes, I've come up with a simple, yet tasty way to prepare McCANN's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Give it a try, and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your breakfast menu.<br /><br />Recipe:<br /><br />- Start by bringing 3 cups of water to a boil (about 3-4 minutes in the microwave).<br />- In a medium saucepot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats. Toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes.<br />- Add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes. Don't stir. It should get to a soft bubbling simmer.<br />If it boils to hard, you stove is set too hot, so turn it down or it will burn.<br />- Add 1 cup of milk (or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk).<br />- Cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br /><br />Makes 4-5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency. It thickens once it sits a little bit. You can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired. You can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste. Just store in small sealed bowls. Each can of McCANNs oatmeal makes about 16-20 servings.<br /><br />Everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently (sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisins, etc.). Only add the toppings when you're ready to eat it, not before storing in the refrigerator. For my serving, I like to add 2 tsp of brown sugar, 2 tsp of maple syrup, a sprinkle of cinnamon, about 1/2 tbsp of butter, and then top with chopped pecans. I know it's not particularly healthy, but it is very tasty. Hope you enjoy!<br /><br />Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful.

review/text: Steel Cut Oatmeal is a great way to start the morning. Not only do the steel cut oats taste better than instant but they also are slower to digest. You don't get the rush of blood sugar followed quickly by a return of your appetite like you do with the instant oatmeal. One caveat, all 4 of the cans I received were bent fairly badly. This was not a big deal to me because I figure one of the advantages of the cans is that it helps protect the product during shipment.

review/summary: Irish porridge
review/text: I just ate my first bowl of Irish porridge, as the can refers to it. It was chewy, nutty, dense, filling and delicious, just like all the reviews said it would be. It was easy to cook, the directions on the can advise to boil 4 cups of water and then add 1 cup of oatmeal. Simmer for 30 minutes exactly and it turns out perfect and serves 4, with 150 calories per serving. Each can contains 20 servings. Storing 4 cans was not an issue, considering each 28 ounce can is about as big as a quart of paint. My only gripe is that all the cans I received are badly dented, but if that's the trade off for the bargain price and convenience of purchasing from Amazon, I can deal with it.

review/text: If you've never eaten steel cut oatmeal, you are in for a surprise. This does not look like the Quaker products you may have been raised on, but it is wonderful. I kept reading in multiple sources how steel cut oats were better for our health, so I tried this product. It is great. Yes, it takes longer to cook, but it is well worth the wait. One of the best ways to cook this is to substitute apple juice for 1/2 of the water and then cook. Excellent!

I've tried for years to choke down Quaker's rolled oats...uggghh..I know it's good for you but yuck...I hate oatmeal.  But, I found this stuff a Trader Joe's one day and thought I'd give it a try.  IT IS AMAZING!  It's definitely the texture/nutty flavor, unlike the typical rolled oats from Quakers.  I used to drink a protein shake for breakfast every morning..it's quickly been replaced by 1/4 cup of steel oats + frozen berrries + protein powder + touch of brown sugar...fantastic stuff.

review/text: Yes, this is good old fashioned porridge.  Order it in the UK and this is what you'll get.  It's oatmeal - NOT oats!  I throw a big handful of raisins in the pot while this is cooking and it adds to the taste.  When it's cooked, I add diced apples, walnuts, milk or yogurt, and sometimes a tiny spoonful of sugar for a breakfast that keeps me full and satisfied all morning.  If you are eating this as it comes right out of the can, you're eating the same oats that horses eat and even they like molasses with it!<br />You can 't get a better breakfast - cook it the night before and warm in the microwave if you don't have 45 minutes in the am!  It's great warmed up.<br />ps.  ordered this when it was on sale - and every can but one came dented!  What a shame because the cans are quite nicely made and great for storing other things after the oatmeal is gone.

It is whole grain (You can tell because its partially crunchy when full cooked), it regulates my hunger for hours, and last but not least, it has improved my regularity.<br /><br />If you don't mind the 30 minute cook time, this stuff is worth a try.  I make a batch and keep it in the refrigerator for a few days, so I only have to cook it a few times per week.<br /><br />It is great with Smart Balance and Agave nectar sweetener, which by the way is a sweetener with a low glycemic index so it will not spike your blood glucose - good for diabetics and non-diabetics.<br /><br />Enjoy

I do care about my health, however and I know that oats are very good for heart health and many other things. I first encountered the term steel cut oats in an article and immediately rushed out to buy some, hoping for a miracle. Well, my husband fell in love with them. I still sat on the fence...I later discovered the McCann's in the grocery and the price was a real eye-opener (8.00 US) per can, but I splurged. We have never looked back. The quality is perfect. I can even eat them now and enjoy them. The price at Amazon is the absolute best. I am thinking of subscribing! McCann's rules!

review/text: The fact that I'm willing to cook oatmeal for 30 minutes in the morning is an indication of how good this stuff is.  We buy 4-6 tins every two weeks and there are only two of us at home.<br /><br />It's rich nutty texture tastes great on it's own.  I add a little brown sugar and sometimes a little cinnamon and nutmeg, although it certainly can stand on its own.  I don't add any milk, I don't think it needs it, but my husband likes his with milk.<br /><br />I wish I had discovered this in my youth.  I had hot cereal and eggs and toast every morning before school.  If this were the cereal, we could have skipped the eggs and toast.  The great thing about this, is that you are filled up and because it is natural, you are not hungry for hours.  No matter how hard you work, this keeps you going until lunch.<br /><br />I love this stuff and will buy it forever.

review/text: I love this oatmeal. If you want to capture the nutty texture, I'd recommend undercooking the stuff a bit (cook it for 20-25 min, instead of 30 min). I add some nutmeg and cinnamon, along with brown sugar & it's fantastic! I take breakfast leftovers with me to work & eat it as a snack during the day (this helps keep me away from the donuts).<br />Oh, and another thing- go to the mccann's web site- they've got interesting recipes that you'd otherwise never think of, such as a savory oatmeal rissoto, which, I'd imagine, would work really well with this type of oatmeal.

review/text: Two orders, both arrived dented, some worse than others.  Regardless of the poor shipping that also destroyed other items because of the weight of these cans, the oatmeal is the best and I encourage all who like oatmeal to try.  I've been eating this oatmeal for many years!

review/summary: Eat Helathy
review/text: This was featured on the Opra Show and the Doctor told how much better it was for you to eat the steel grain cut over the over processed oatmeal.  It is pkg in a can and is very fresh...This is the way to go for great health.  Will buy again
