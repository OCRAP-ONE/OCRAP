review/summary: delicious & addicting
review/text: This is one of my favorite Indian sweets & this brand is as close to a homemade taste as you can get without making it yourself. For Americans unfamiliar with Indian sweets, the best analogy I can give you for soan papdi is that it tastes & feels similar to the inside of a very soft, very fresh Butterfinger... except the nuts used for flavoring are pistachio and almond instead of peanut. It also has about 1/10 the calories and melts in your mouth. Loooove it!

If you are "new" to Indian Sweets and like the inside of a Butterfinger Candy bar, than you will love this. Not too sweet, and yet crispity, crunchity, delicately sweet with complex flavors of heaven!<br />I will for sure be ordering this regularly.<br />Warmly,<br />Jackie

review/text: If you like Earl Grey tea, then you will LOVE this tea.  A friend of mine used to own a tea shop, and got me started on this tea.  It is mellow, and absolutely perfect in every way.  The leaves are large, so you know  are getting a very good quality tea.  Since it is in bulk rather than in tea bags, you can make your beverage as light or potent as you would like.  Enjoy!

review/text: What a great product for dogs. My mini doxie just loves these chew and to top it of, she loves the peanut butter favor. The day is  complete when she is given one. If she doen't eat it at once, she will hide it for later or carry it around with her. This flavor is the only one that she eats. I purchase the mini size because it is not too big for her and she can handle it for eating or carrying it around.

review/summary: These are a MUST!!!
review/text: My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!

review/summary: cooking, haircare, skincare and more!
review/text: Our family avoids chemicals as much as possible, so we use coconut oil for cooking, haircare, skincare and more!<br /><br />We use coconut oil as a moisturizer in place of skin lotion (add a couple drops of a good quality essential oil!) We use coconut oil to saute or steam saute foods; I use a spoonful of coconut oil in our stainless steel cookware so foods NEVER stick! We also use it in our microwave popcorn popper with sea salt for the healthiest, tastiest popcorn around!<br /><br />Coconut is a solid at cooler temperatures, it will turn to liquid when warmed "slightly" to the mid 70s.  Hence I store this bottle above our stove / microwave so it's usually a liquid. To make it MUCH easier to use, I have a wide mouth glass jar that I keep refilled.  When the jar turns solid I can still scoop the oil paste out with a spoon.

I could barely get any out.. even after warming it up a tad, Also I think the one that I got was rancid, it did not smell pleasant. I will not by this brand again.

review/summary: BAD Smell, WORSE Packaging, not virgin
review/text: I've been buying other brands of coconut oil from Amazon such as Nature's Way and Nutiva. Those are good brands. I ran out and I saw this brand at my grocery store so I bought it. First of all, the packaging... it comes in bottle that is just like a shampoo bottle, cheap plastic and not at all appetizing... and then the most ridiculous thing of all is the teeny tiny spout for dispensing the product--coconut oil is a SOLID at room temperature! How are you supposed to dispense a SOLID out of this teeny spout!?!<br /><br />I had to do as others did, I warmed the bottle until the oil melted and I poured it all into another more practical container, a jar. But immediately the oil smells BAD, it has a burnt smell. And unlike the pure white virgin coconut oils from the other suppliers I mentioned, this has a brown tint and some brown gunk that settles to the bottom of the jar. Yuck! This oil is NOT extra virgin, or even virgin coconut oil like the others. It seems very cheap and impure. For all I know they used solvents to extract it. It's very suspect.<br /><br />I used it for cooking until I could buy a better brand. It's OK for on your skin, but that's about it. I will never buy this again.

review/summary: Life Changing!
review/text: I bought this to use on my hair, because I had heard it does wonders and it was only about $7, so why not try it? My hair is curly, and naturally dry and delicate. I've dyed and flat ironed it too many times, so it was pretty damaged and breaking off. I'm getting married in 8 months and really wanted to get my hair healthy again!<br /><br />I have used this as a deep conditioner, by wetting my hair and applying a liberal amount of the oil all over my head, concentrating on the ends. I then put on a plastic shower cap and let it sit for at least 2 hours. When you shampoo, make sure you use a clarifying shampoo and wash it at least twice to get all the oil out. It leaves my hair so silky and hydrated! And it's not like some deep conditioners out there that only give you results the first day and after that your hair is dry again--this stuff really works!<br /><br />I also use it as a leave in conditioner in my hair, especially when I'm wearing my hair curly (I let it air dry). I have also used it as a styling product (for shine or pomade) and plus it conditions your hair all day. Works great! My hair is so infinitely healthier in only a month!<br /><br />The oil is kind of a solid, but as long as you keep it in a warm room you're fine. Rub it between your hands for about 2 seconds and it is liquid again. Not a problem at all. It smells great, kind of nutty, I love it. Best "hair" product I have ever found, and I've tried many.

review/summary: Great quality and price
review/text: This is excellent quality pure coconut oil at an incredibly good price! It works very well used in lieu of damaging, petroleum based anti-chapping agents. When cold it will harden but can easily be returned to its liquid state by inserting the bottle under hot water(it does work equally well in its hardened form.) We transfer a portion to a small container and carry it with us in lieu of petroleum "sticks" when we hike, climb or ski. It goes on smoothly without a greasy feel and more importantly, does not block healthy lip tissue regeneration. It also tastes and smells good.  We were very pleased with the manner in which the seller communicated with us to assure that our transaction went smoothly. This seller and his product rate an A+ in our book!

This seems to be the only brand that India makes. It's not organic or extra virgin but I wanted to try it anyways. It is tan in color not like organic coconut oil and it smells like used grease from a frying pan. It smells that way too. I will not purchase this again.

My only concern is the bottle expires 15 months from the date of manufacturer date, so this bottle is good for another month.<br />I'm glad it was  a small bottle.

review/summary: it smells so bad I could not use this + THIS OIL IS NOT EVEN A BARGAIN!
review/text: I ignored the other reviews for this oil, and purchased because I thought the price was good.  There were two things wrong. First, you will notice it says to put in hot water to melt the oil so you can get it out of the bottle.  This packaging is appropriate for warm weather locations.  Seattle is not a location that works for this product.  2.  The smell gagged me.  You do not want to put this product in your mouth.  I might use this on my hair, before washing it, but that is about it.  It stinks!  I have purchased other brands, from this website and from vitamin websites and they were cheap and lovely to the nose, mouth, and body.  I honestly do not know why this smells so bad. I have edited my review.  The reason I purchased this oil over others was that I thought that it was a bargain.  When I got the container I found that it was no cheaper and in fact more money than some oils I have been purchasing.  If you are using coconut oil for eating or putting on your body,  I urge you not to buy this oil.  It stinks really really bad, is no bargain and you cannot get it out of the container.  I should have returned it to amazon immediately upon receiving this.

review/summary: Solid mass of Coconut Love
review/text: Coconut Oil, as I found out, remains a solid when it is not in its native tropical environment (70+ degrees or so). I also found out that this oil is rather less expensive at international foods section of the local supermarket. This means a) it must be melted to be used, and b) you could save a few bucks by shopping around. However, for the convenience factor, getting it sent to the house was a plus; I used it to make no bake cookies (it added a nutty flavor) and plan to also use it in making chocolate covered pretzels and raisins. No complaints about flavor.

review/summary: Great natural product with Multi Beauty, health and wellness purposes!
review/text: I only give it a 4 because at times there is difficulty extracting the product from the small opening at times, but its perfectly suitable when the bottle is warmed by the surrounding temperature.<br /><br />I actually brought this particular product back with me from when I traveled around India.  It was the natural home moisturizer and beauty treatment there.  Ask any Indian woman how she has such long, strong beautiful hair and she'll tell you its because she conditions her hair and massages her scalp with coconut oil.  I'm not Indian but I'm a girl who has been trying to maintain long hair and suffering from split ends, but reluctant to trim too much and I admired the healthy state of their hair.<br /><br />Its a great moisturizer and also its healthy for you if you want to cook with, its very good for digestion and provides healthy saturated fats.  I know it sounds counter intuitive, but certainly do your own research and don't go against doctors orders.<br /><br />Don't go overboard with consumption or cooking with it, but I was informed having a tablespoon with each meal is beneficial, just be careful not to consume after your meal if you want weight loss.<br /><br />I personally use coconut as a hair conditioner, moisturizer, in place of butter and cooking oil.<br />I use Parachute for only beauty/moisturizing reasons because I find that the opening does not make it easy to extract the oil for cooking because half the year the temperature makes the oils solid and the opening is for the oil in a more liquid state.<br /><br />The coconut oil solidifies when the surrounding temperature is cooler.  This particular bottle makes it difficult to squeeze out if the temperature is too low.  I'd recommend placing the closed bottle it in a bowl of warm to hot water to help melt it a bit.<br /><br />This product is very inexpensive.  Avoid other products that are not 100% pure coconut oil.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: I  have used this brand of coconut oil in the past and I was never disappointed by it.  It tastes good and smells heavenly.  I also add it to My homemade skin and hair care products.  I have tried other oils.  Even Nutiva organic oil and I didn't like that oil at all.  It lacked the deep coconut taste I like and also the rich coconut smell.  I had to go back to Parachute and I will not buy anything else but Parachute from now on.  To scared to try anything else out of fear I might get a product like that organic stuff I brought. If you truly have a love for coconut and know how to appreciate the true "taste" and "smell" of coconut then you will appreciate and "love" Parachute.  Parachute is better than Nutiva hands down!!<br /><br />Now I am going to use it for coconut popcorn also.

review/summary: Kinda iffy about this.
review/text: When I ordered from Amazon- I thought I was getting the container pictured... but I got a short, squat version, which was okay... then I tried to use the oil as a "lotion" for my hyper (skin) sensitive newborn daughter- maybe I don't know how coconut oil is? If it's ALWAYS "frozen" and you have to warm it to apply... nonetheless, when I tried to use the spout with the container it came in, it was a MESS. It got ALL over the container, and all over my hands. Complete mess! I was very upset with the construction of the bottle- it simple doesn't work. I have to open the lid and just pour it without the "easy pour" lid. All in all, I do like the oil inside the container!

review/summary: Oaracgyte 100% Coconut Oil
review/text: Comes in a blue plastic bottle which at first seems ok.  However, if you leave it standing in a cold room the oil solidifies in the bottle and won't come out. So I had to put it under hot water to get it liquify.  The quality is good, it tastes great, and can be used as a lubricant or eaten.  I am moving the contents to a glass jar that has a wide opening so I don't have to deal with squeezing it out of this plastic bottle.  Good product.

review/summary: nice light oil
review/text: The product was shipped to me quickly. And yes it did arrive in a solid form but after doing a little research, I knew this was normal and I am pretty used to heating it up in a bowl of warm water before using. My hair is in a transition from relaxed to natural state so I use this product to "seal" moisture in my hair every couple of days. Honestly because of the point I am at with my transition, I can't really say if the product is helping me but I know it hasn't definitely not done any harm to my hair!!! I didn't give the product 5 stars because while the product says 100% pure coconut oil there isn't an ingredient list for me to be sure. And I don't like the smell but it is not a bad smell, just not to my liking. I would say this is a good buy even if it does not work on your hair...it will probably be a nice moisturizer for your skin.

I usually hold the bottle between my thighs when I brush my daughter's hair then my body heat makes it softer and I can pour it into my hands and into her hair.  I will never use anything else for conditioning.  It is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Have not tried eating yet.  Just cant find it in me to try yet!  But will submit review when I do!

review/summary: Great Hair Product
review/text: This bottle was my second purchase of coconut oil for my natural 4c hair. It (coconut oil, in general) doesn't do much in the way of moisture for my hair, but it's a great sealant. It also moisturizes better when combined with other oils. I loved this particular brand over the other one because it smells so delicious. I used it on my hair, skin, and lips when I ran out of chapstick.<br />The only downside to my purchase was that the seam at the bottom of the bottle burst when the coconut oil hardened from the cold. That wasn't a huge issue, though. I just ran the bottle upside down under some warm water and moved the liquid coconut oil to another container.

review/summary: Great for detangling and deep conditioning!
review/text: I use Parachute Coconut Oil as a pre-shampoo detangler/deep conditioner for my kinky coily, Afro-textured hair. I purchased a 16 oz jar for $5 at a local Indian grocery store.<br /><br />Parachute Coconut Oil has a thick, creamy, lush, velvety texture when solid, It has more slip for finger-detangling than the brands of organic coconut oil I've tried (Nutiva, Vitamin Shoppe, Emerald Laboratories, Trader Joe's). It smells slightly of roasted coconut but that's fine because I top off the coconut oil with a layer of natural conditioner.<br /><br />From now on, I'll use Parachute Coconut Oil for hair and organic coconut oil for skin (via my DIY Body Butter).

review/text: I factually ordered this in to mix with neem oil for my son's acne. Didn't realize it was also edible. lol!  Works great with the neem to take out the stink.  I've been looking for natural handlings for his acne and these are working for him.<br /><br />Anyhow, I used it to whip up some scrambled eggs; delicious! I will use this for other cooking!!!<br /><br />I also somehow acquired a spider bite on my forehead and I heard coconut oil is good for that so I put a little on that and voila, the pain was gone and it shrunk down and disappeared faster than I have ever had a spider bite disappear.  Tried it on a mosquito bite too.  Took the itch away (I get quite the reaction from mosquito bites) and the swelling disappeared, as did the mosquito bite by the next day.<br /><br />Quite happy with the product.<br /><br />Seriously, if you are looking for cocnut oil to cook with, this is it.  Tastes great and is, apparently from what I have read and heard, much better than using animal product or plant based (canola, soybean) oil (GMO).

review/summary: I smell like a girlscout cookie!
review/text: I bought this product to use an as alternative to lotions (I have pretty bad eczema) So far it's working well, and it smells like Samoa girl scout cookies (It smells MUCH better on your skin than it does straight out of the jar, so don't get turned off by the smell until it's on you).<br /><br />It hardens at room temperature, so be prepared to soak the bottle in hot water for a few minutes to get it out. I poured some into a little mason jar for easy access, Now I'll just use it like one of those lotion bars.<br /><br />Recently read that you can even use coconut oil as a deodorant. I don't really need an antiperspirant So I'm going to try this as a deodorant and see how I like it.<br /><br />Great product, will definitely purchase again for skin care.

review/text: Like everyone else, when my coconut oil arrived it was completely solid. But that's how it's supposed to be--it is only in liquid form when it's warm. I actually left mine right on top of a heat vent for a couple of minutes to get it to liquify. If it were summer, I would simply leave it outside for a while.<br /><br />Problem solved.<br /><br />This is a great product for a great price, and I used it as an ingredient in homemade lip balm.

I will never ever buy this brand again.

review/text: My name is ________, and I'm a cappuccinaholic.  I admit it and being hooked on the International Coffee's sugar-free French Vanilla is so easy with the subscription orders.  I love this and wish there were more.  I was down to my last can at home and my last can at work...and along comes UPS today with my automatic reorder...&lt;sigh>...I must go now...my cappuccio is getting cold.  :)

review/summary: Coffe and something special
review/text: French vanilla International Coffee has become a real favorite of mine.  I put it in the blender with soymilk, ice and whatever to make a different tasting smoothee.  I put it in soy milk and have it mornings and evenings in place of hot chocolate, but the best use so far is to fix old coffee.  I make a pot of coffee in the morning.  The coffee sits all day and I warm up the leftovers in the microwave.  I  add French Vanilla Coffee mix to it and it turns a not so fresh cup of coffee into something kind of special.  I also add it to things when I want a vanilla coffee kind of taste.  I haven't added it to cereal yet.

review/summary: Finally!  Great Pasta
review/text: Being Gluten intolerant, eating in a restaurant is a challenge.  Recently I visited a restaurant that specializes in pasta dishes and was amazed to see that they offered a gf option.  I took a chance (gf pasta can be really pasty and gummy even if cooked properly) and ordered the shrimp scampi.  I was blown away by the firm, aldente texture and fabulous taste of the pasta and asked the waiter if the cook would share the brand of pasta he prepared. In short order the waiter appeared with a package of the Heartland pasta.  I can't say enough about this great product.  I have since purchased several packages of the spaghetti, fusuli, and penne pasta and can finally enjoy italian food again!  Even my very picky boyfriend who detects even the slightest off-taste that gf products can have likes this product.  If there was a higher score than "5", I would give it!!

review/summary: Best GF pasta I've eaten...
review/text: I was served this pasta at a local Italian eatery because the owner wanted my opinion, since I had asked him about gf products in the past. I was blown away! The best gf pastas I have had up until now were just "OK" and the worst were just downright nasty - slimy, sticky or rubbery - and tasted weird compared to regular pasta.<br /><br />The Heartland penne was fantastic in taste, texture and appearance and I do believe that with the way he fixed it, with marinara sauce and cheese baked on top, I would not have guessed it was gluten free if I had not known. He now plans to keep it on hand for customers who require a gf pasta.<br /><br />He showed me the brand, and I just had to rush to Amazon to order some to use at home. I honestly do not believe that you will be disappointed if you buy this pasta. I have also ordered some of their spaghetti and if it is as good as the penne, I will never need to buy those other (more expensive) gf pastas again!

review/summary: Tuna oil?
review/text: If organic truly matters to you the fact that tuna oil is added to this puree is truly offensive. The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.  This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic.  Garbage, complete and total garbage.

review/summary: Product is good, packaging needs improvement
review/text: The packaging is rather painful to open.  They should design these with parents of new babies in mind.  Most food products with peel tops have one corner which is indicated as the side to open and the hard plastic has a crack allowing for the user to easily bend and peel the top.  No such luck with these tubs of baby food from Gerber.  It's not clear which side should be opened by the packaging and whichever one you choose will be equally stubborn before you can finally peel the top and feed your hungry baby.

review/summary: Baby likes it enough to eat it however, I just found out it's plastic #7
review/text: I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.

We used these to help our baby feel "more comfortable" if she was having issues with going to the bathroom.  This worked like a charm.  We ended up having a regular rotation where we made sure she got this in the morning every few days to prevent any problems.

This case has 8 of the packs, making it a total of 16 tubs.  It's a lot of prunes but she eats them often and loves them.
