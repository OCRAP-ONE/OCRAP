review/summary: Glad I got 3 boxes
review/text: I really like the idea of the K cup coffee maker. You make it the strength that you want and no wasting a half a pot of coffee. I DID NOT like the horrible price for the "pre-made" K cups. This is a great compromise. The only thing that could be a bit of a problem for some is that they will leak if you don't puncture them fully. This is easily corrected by lifting the open/close lever once and closing a second time. Now, if they would make them out of biodegradable cardboard or something else I could compost, the rest of the planet would love them too.

review/summary: disposa cups & filters
review/text: These work fine. All I really wanted to try were the paper filters, the plastic is not environmentally friendly. I have a reusable Keurig filter but it is messy to clean after use. The paper filters work great in it & I can use my own coffee, which is not available through Keurig.  I've asked if the paper filters could be bought  separately but never got a response.

review/summary: Keurig DisposaKups
review/text: I have read mixed reviews on the DisposaKups, so I had no expectations.  I would like to say that the product has worked perfectly.  Maybe the issue with some users is that they are not pressing the lid on tight enough or are not allowing the filter to hang over the edge and be sealed in place by the lid.  There was NO leaking at all and I have used 10 cups already.  I also read that the coffee does not seem to be as strong as regular brew.  That is true, probably due to the type of grind.  My resolution to the issue is to have a regular coffee cup in place, but choose the smallest cup on the Keurig, which gives you roughly half a cup of coffee.  Lift the handle as though you are going to remove the kcup and just push it back down and brew a second tiny cup into the already brewed cup.  Viola!  Perfect.  I definitely recommend and will certainly purchase again.

review/summary: But Don't Use for Teas
review/text: I have given this product five stars because it works very well for coffee with the filters that come with it.<br /><br />But my five stars come with a warning: don't use these little cups without using the little filters, especially with teas or tea-based coffee substitutes (like loose "Teeccino").  The tea-leaves swell to a far greater extent than water-logged, ground coffee beans.  They also swell much faster, which tends to clog the small, unprotected puncture at the bottom of the little cups.  So, not using the filter is a very, very dumb idea.  If you put less tea in the little cups, the tea still clogs the system without the filters!<br /><br />So.. Be wise, and use the cups with the filters.<br /><br />For what it's worth, though, the Solo "My K-Cup" works perfectly with all types of contents, with or without the little filters.  It's ridiculously expensive, however.  Happily, for me, who am not flowing with dough, the plastic cups (with the little filters) are an answer.

review/summary: Makes a great cup of Joe
review/text: It is just like a k-cup...no ground left in the bottom of my coffee.  Makes a strong, hot cup of Joe.  The cup melts to the shape of your coffee maker.  It works wonderfully, but when i did the math for saving a few bucks...the whole reason i went looking for an alternative...it is just about the same as buying the prepackaged cups (i try to buy the K-cups around $28), except you can choose your own coffee and YOU have to measure it out.  Now i have not used all 50 cups yet so i will see if some of my coffee is left over and then it might be a little cheaper. The breakdown... $18 dollars for the disposable cups (shipping included), and $10 for my favorite coffee + time to fill the cups + environmentally wasteful = We need a better solution.  The reusable filters received mixed reviews, but i might give it a shot.

review/text: These K-Cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made K-Cups. I now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the K-Cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. I think the material in the disposable K-Cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom.

review/summary: a must for anyone who thinks K cups are too expensive
review/text: I purchased these on a whim, and after researching for other disposable products. I have the single mesh filter plastic re usable one, but the "convenience" factor of a disposable is not there. you have to then clean it and all that mess. with this product, simply pop a filter (included_ into the cup, (included) fill it with 1-2tsp of your own blend, or folgers starbucks, anything. and use the included cup holder to pop a lid on (which are also included) I bought 50 and am now so happy with these I'm ordering 200 more. why?? because for the 12-15$ you spend on these cups you can make 50 coffee's  if you have some regular coffee in your fridge, use that. you can even say a bag of starbucks breakfast blend ground is around 10.00, so your at 22.00 , thats only 2 boxes of 12 Kcups coffee's and you can fill 75-100 on a single 1lb bag, a 1.5lb tub of folgers can fill about 400 of these refills for 9.00 for the tub  so go for it, you won't regret it...<br /><br />one thing i want to point out is the included filters DO hang out the edges a bit, nothing wrong, it just adds to the seal, and depending on your brewers strength you can see "seepage" AFTER brewing a cup, but who cares, they are disposable. if you are a total cheap wad you can pop the lids off and use the cups again if you don't mind a whole in the bottom from where the brewer pops it. but your Freshness won't last with a re used cup.  Hope this review helps!!! thanks!

review/summary: Finally, an answer to the expensive Keurig cups
review/text: So glad that someone came up with these.  We had experimented with several ways to make a filter for the "fill your own" kup that came with the Keurig and nothing worked.  These are great and we like the coffee we use much better than the kups from Keurig.  The only problem with the DisposaCups is that sometimes the folds on the paper filters prevent you from securing the lid.  To remedy this, I spread the folds out a little more, then the lid snaps right on.  Great product, saves a ton of money.  And, we reuse the cup and only replace the lid and filter!

review/summary: Patience is the key!
review/text: I was looking for a simple and inexpensive way to provide my own supply of "home made" K-cups. This product is all that it is described to be;fairly easy to use and does not adversely affect the cup of coffee. Clearly, the cups and lids are in fact reusable albeit a little messy.<br />I have used all 50 filters so I am at a point where I need to decide if I want to continue on with this regimen or go to plan B.<br />I am electing to try one of the reusable style cups that don't require the use of a filter. My hope is that it will be a little quicker and less messy to use.<br />However, if plan B does not meet my expectations I can always order another supply of filters and continue on with this DisposaCups system.

They are great because you don't have to change out the holding tray and there is no mess, u just toss them like you would a k-kup, no washing out of the filter every time.  It would be nice if there were not 3 parts to the process (filter already in cup).  I just load up 10 at a time and am set for the week.

review/summary: Not very good for me
review/text: The basic problem with this product is that unless you load a VERY small amount of coffee in the filter, the filter clogs.  This causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess.  My son and I spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat.  I suspected the filter but I used filters which work perfectly fine in my EZ Cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter. Even worse, coffee grounds in my coffee!  However, if you like your coffee very weak, this will work well for you.  I hope they can fix the design issues.  Until then, I will stick with my EZ Cup.

review/summary: Good and bad, be aware, read reviews carefully
review/text: Good, easy to use, somewhat hard to get the caps on, but at the end you can easily dispose of these disposable Kups after using.<br /><br />Good that you can use your own coffee.  Fresh coffees.  I personally like coffees from Spain, Puerto Rico and other countries.<br /><br />The bad, sometimes is messy.  Coffee grinds seem to leak, creating a slight mess and the need to clean the machine.  This leak is more in the area of the Kups lid and cup.  And some times these grinds even get in your cup of coffee.  Just read other reviews about this.  Not sure if it could be related to how fine are the grinds of coffee.<br /><br />On the other hand, with disposable Kups you don't need to keep cleaning wire filter baskets.  That's a very plus.<br /><br />All considered will probably buy again, but wish a better lid/cup seal that will not leak.  Hope down the road they will offer improved DisposableKups.

review/summary: Very Positive Experience
review/text: We have had a Keurig Mini Brewer for over 2 years and the family really likes it!  We all have different tastes and we like the idea of preparing a cup of our choice, without wasting an entire pot.  We enjoy hot chocolate, hot tea, iced tea, and, of course, coffee - but, even then, we like a good cup of "morning" coffee, flavored coffee during the day, and decaf at night - so the pot is in use constantly and with a variety of goodies.<br /><br />I was given a gourmet assortment of ground coffee, and it has been sitting on the shelf for quite awhile.  But, now, thanks to the disposable K-cups, I am finally able to experiment with some lovely new flavors, while the "stuffy die-hards" in the family can stay with their favorite brew.  As soon as I saw the disposable K-cups and filters I knew I had to order this product. It's easy to use - disposable - and it's just as fast to make a cup of delicious coffee in this container as it is to stand over the two-drawer rack trying to decide which flavor to choose.  We are very happy with this product!

review/text: We have a Michigan-based coffee cafe (now renamed "Biggby's") that stomps Starbucks. (Biggby's was originally named "Beaners," a name that encountered resistance as the franchise spread.) Their<br />dark roasts are to die for --- none of the K-cups come close (except possibly for G.M. Espresso). So this build-it-yourself K-cup is a near perfect solution. The downside is that the brewing takes much longer and there is a bit of splatter. Also the caps are a bit difficult to snap down. Recommended.

review/text: The DisposaKups are great because I can use my own brand coffee and adjust the strength of it. The only thing that needs to be improved on is that the edges of the filter need to be trimmed down to prevent leakage.

The price is a little steep for me but much less than buying the already filled K-kups.

review/summary: Disposable K-Cups for Keurig Brewers
review/text: These disposable cups are great!  The simple, clean method of a portion pack but with your own grounds.  Now I need to see if they pack them in larger quantities.  The seller was also great. I got what I wanted and ahead of time also.  No issues to report here.  Anyone with the K-Cup system needs to get this product from this seller.

review/summary: K-Cups, disposable
review/text: These were just what I was looking for, however, when using in my Cuisinart they leak and back up water which spurts out in different areas of my K-Cup area. I don't want to ruin my machine, so I'm trying different things with this disposable cup, i.e., smaller amount of coffee, packing it looser, and smaller amount of water for cup size.  Still leaks some, but it's getting better as before I had about 3 to 4 areas of dripping water/coffee, some hitting inside the coffee cup and several outside of coffee cup.

review/summary: Good idea, but material is not strong enough
review/text: I purchased this item as an alternative to traditional K-cups in an attempt to save money; however, this product did not work well in my machine. I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively. Maybe I am not doing something correctly, but I'm sure there is also an issue with the product itself. While I do like the idea, I would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out.

review/summary: SOOO GOOD!
review/text: My family has been enjoying Bug Bites organic chocolates for years.  I highly recommend both the milk chocolate and the dark chocolate varieties.  They are very smooth and rich, and not the least bit "waxy" tasting like some of the more popular American chocolates.  Each individually packaged bite is the perfect size for an adult and maybe a little more than a mouthful for a young child. Each tiny package contains a special treat- a tiny insect card which features a color photograph and interesting facts.  If you have a budding entomologist on your hands, these are the perfect treat! The Endangered Species company is environmentally conscious too, and dedicates 10% of their net profit to support species and habitat preservation.

review/text: The candy is ordinary milk chocolate, but I was very glad to have an organic option to hand out for Halloween. I love the idea of including a little nature education with it, but I was a little disappointed in the text on the insect card I saw, which was not well written and had almost nothing to do with the moth that was pictured. But it's more than you get with most candy.

review/summary: My favorite chocolate covered raisins
review/text: Over the years, I have become an expert on chocolate covered raisins. For something so simple, it's surprising how difficult it is to find one that is truly exceptional. In some, the chocolate is too waxy and tasteless. In others, the raisins are too small or dried out. Kirkland chocolate covered raisins are just right. The raisins are large and moist, and the chocolate is high quality. I used to think that brach's made a good one, until I had these.<br /><br />If you or someone you know is a chocolate covered raisin fan, this is one you must try. The tub is huge and the price is less than boutique chocolatiers want for a small bag of theirs. It is an outstanding value and I doubt you will be disappointed.<br /><br />I have no affiliation with Kirkland or anyone else. I'm just a chocolate raisin fan who knows when he has a great raisin...and these are truly wonderful.

They're sold at big discount warehouses and also on Amazon.  Perfect.

review/summary: My Dog Loves it!
review/text: This dog food is a keeper. I have to buy special dog food for my dog because he has allergies to chicken and brown rice.<br />My Vet prescribed an Iams brand food with kangaroo meat in it. My dog didn't really care for the taste but he ate it.<br />I wanted something more natural, so I looked up Flint River Ranch Fish & Chips. What frustrates me, is how you have to wean your dog off of the old food<br />to gradually get used to the new. He liked the flavor so much, he ate around the old dog food and only ate the Flint River Fish & Chips. Fortunately, his tummy handled<br />the new food really well. We have no problem getting him to eat and I like that he doesn't have to eat a larger serving to get the same nutrition. I will definitely order<br />Flint River Ranch Fish & Chips again, and soon. I recommend it highly.

review/summary: V E R Y......T A S T Y....!!!!
review/text: These SAHLEN'S SMOKEHOUSE HOTDOGS are "Totally Yummy".  They have a lighter flavour than the all-beef hotdogs I am used to....and are NOT as unduly salty!  The delicious smoked taste is there, all right -- but it is NOT overpowering, and will NOT burn your tongue!  Just a nice, subtle flavour.  And this all means not only are they delicious, but also that you won't go looking for gallons of water, (or soda, or whatever), after you eat a few.<br /><br />These are BIG, substantial hot-dogs.  If you want yours in a hot-dog bun, it will probably not only fill the bun, but some of the hot-dog will stick out at either end!<br /><br />If you wnat to take the "wrapping" (skin), off the hot dog, this is NOT easily done -- but then, it's not easily done with any of the OTHER hot dogs I've ever tried, either.  BUT -- it is EASIER to take off at least PART of the plastic wrapping -- and JUST the plastic wrapping, leaving the hot-dog itself, totally intact -- with thes Sahlen's Smokehouse Hotdogs, than it has EVER been my experience with any other hot-dogs.  (Maybe if I had more patience, I would indeed have been able to take more of -- or even all of -- the plastic wrap off.  But these hot-dogs are SO yummy, such will, I fear, never be the case!)<br /><br />These hot-dogs are conveniently wrapped two together -- so you will NOT be taking the entire contents out, when you want just one, or two.  At least, you won't do this inadvertently.  But -- once tasting these delightful hot-dogs, you may be sorely tempted to do this deliberately....<br /><br />................>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>...................<br /><br />On one of Oprah Winfrey's earliest programs, she and some guests went to a very<br />elite restaurant -- SPAGOS.  I'm sure I'm not the only audience member who had never head of Spago's before then.  Recently, I learnt that "pizza" at Spagos is<br />filled with SMOKED SALMON!  This makes Spago's pizza the "non plus ultra" of pizzas, I'm sure!<br /><br />For "non plus ultra", (absolutely NO better) hot-dogs, SAHLEN'S SMOKEHOUSE HOT-DOGS, just HAVE to be the ones.  Sahlen's has been making, (and probably, perfecting), hot-dogs, since 1869, (140 years).  So, for THE ultimate hot-dog, on a par with Spago's pizza, (for pizza), Tetley's Classic Blend, (for tea-bags), Maxwell House Arabica Blend Decaf Instant Coffee, (for instant coffee), Guylian Chocolate Sea Shells, (for chocolate), and other such top-of-the-tastebuds-foods, it's SAHLEN'S SMOKEHOUSE HOTDOGS, for hotdogs.<br /><br />Yes....they ARE that good!

review/summary: Ahmad Tea Pleases
review/text: For any Tea lover, (we became fans in England) Ahmad Tea pleases immensely. I/we have sampled tea from quite a few vendors but after our son brought a pack of Ahmad Tea back with him (from Jolly Old..) as a gift, we were sold. We found the flavor splendid. We loved it. It is fully flavored and needs NO sugar/milk/sweetener at all. (And I usually needed sweeteners with the other brands of Earl Grey, so...)<br />Buying it from Amazon is a very economical solution and delivery was expediant. I HIGHLY recommend, if you enjoy hot tea, try this brand!<br />MAC,<br />Please excuse any spelling errors, that may have occurred in my haste, and NO spell-check help. Heheheh. Ta-ta.

review/summary: Inconsistent in my experience
review/text: I am attracted to reliable consumables which do not vary much from batch to batch. I expect the single malt scotch I purchase this month will be similar to the one I bought six months ago, all things remaining the same. In my experience, I have had Ahmad Earl Grey Tea that's knocked off my socks with a rich flavor, filled with the bergamot that attracts me to Earl Grey. The box I'm currently drinking is so full of tannin and void of essence of bergamot that I don't know if it will actually be drunk. All boxes I've had contained tea bags with an ample amount of tea and each produces a satisfactory little teapot full of caramel colored tea, but I am having difficulty drinking the second cups from this box because the tea powder residue remains. Instead of enjoying an afternoon of relaxation, I develop a stomach ache, so I'm now skipping the entire second cup.  The tea was recently purchased, so staleness is likely not an issue.

review/summary: Good
review/text: My Experience:<br /><br />It's very translucent, with just a light golden color. It smells like you'd expect a peach to smell, but the taste hints of a white grape juice, though it has no grape in it and tastes more peachy over time, especially as it warms up. It's tingly on the tongue, but doesn't foam up. It's slightly drier than your average juice, with a hint of bitterness, probably from the carbonation.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Yes, though not as much as their offering in Pomegranate-Apple, a 6 out of 10. My wife doesn't like it so much.

review/text: I love Kristian Regale Black Currant sparkling drink- so thought I'd try the peach.  I never know if I'm going to get a syrupy sweet flavor when I get peach flavored items, but this was really good- somewhat tart, and tastes like fresh peaches.  The bubbles are tiny- so not like regular sodas, but a 'grown up' sparkling beverage.  I will order this again, and would have no trouble giving this as a gift- if I didn't drink it all first !!  I hope Amazon gets the pear flavored (not the listing for 50+ bucks, either.  I'm sure that would be good as well... but the peach and black currant are definite winners !!

review/summary: Not my favorite Izze flavor
review/text: I love izze sprarkling juice, it is amazing.  My favorite flavors would have to be apple and blueberry.  I was curious to try the grapefuit one though because someone told me it tastes like fresca, and I love fresca.  I tried it and in no way does it taste like fresca, its much milder then fresca and not a very strong grapefruit flavor at all.  I found it to lack in the grapefruit flavor but more of a peach flavor to be honest.  I have not tried the peach one yet but I am guessing it tastes like the grapefruit one:D lol  Oh well, I am just not a big fan of peach drinks.  If you are someone who likes a milder taste of grapefruit then you will love this, its very smooth.  I dont like very smooth so this is not my favorite, I like my drink to have a bite to it.  It is ok, but I will stick to blueberry and apple from now on. The really awesome thing about these drinks though is they are lower calorie then your normal juice, all natural and no added sugar, and each glass bottle has 2 servings of fruit, you cant beat that.

They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.

review/summary: Like Fresh Grapefruit Juice, But Better. Lighter, Sweeter, & Refreshingly Fizzy.
review/text: I'm not much of a soda drinker, but I enjoy a good natural fruit soda in the summertime. Izze describes their sodas as "100% Pure Fruit Juice and Sparkling Water". That's an exaggeration, as there are a few more natural ingredients beside fruit juice and water in these drinks. But the description is apt in that Izze's drinks are more sparkling fruit juices than sodas. They are lightly carbonated, not super-fizzy. And the best of them taste like fresh fruit. The Sparkling Grapefruit will be a fast favorite of grapefruit fans, because it tastes like fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice, but lighter and a little sweeter. It's a little tart. A little sweet. A little fizzy. Very refreshing. It's like drinking fresh grapefruit juice, only better. There's never any trace of sourness. No refined sugar, artificial ingredients, or caffeine either. 12 fl.oz. glass bottles.<br /><br />Ingredients: sparkling water, grape juice concentrate, grape fruit juice concentrate, lemon juice concentrate, natural flavor, gum acacia (from acacia trees), ester gum, red cabbage extract (color). One serving (which is 8 fl.oz.) contains 10 mg sodium and 25 g total carbs.
