review/text: I bought these for putting in my ice tea and I did and they didn't dissolve. I waited and waited and they didn't dissolve. So next I thought I would put them in a small bowl and put hot tap water in to melt them, I did and it took around 4 minutes to dissolve completely. That's just to long for me.<br />If you're not using them in piping hot coffee I would suggest getting Stevia in either liquid or granulated. This I would pass on.

review/text: This product is a must have amoung your kitchen staples. Ever wondered how a Chinese restaurant makes their great chicken broth for Egg Drop soup? Here's your solution! A little goes a long way and may take some experimentation on your part, but it's a great flavor enhancer to vegatables, a pot of beans, even the base of my beef stroganoff (I add it to the beef, onions, and bacon that I cook slowly as the base of the stroganoff). Try it!

review/summary: Deceptive advertising on Amazon
review/text: I am very, very unhappy with Knorr, which I have always thought made great products. The online Amazon product description states that there is no MSG other than that which occurs naturally in the hydrolyzed protein and autolyzed yeast extract used in creating the soup base.  I never buy products that list MSG as an ingredient, but the idea that it was simply a naturally occurring  component in the yeast and protein used seemed innocent enough.<br /><br />When the package arrived from Amazon I simply put the containers on the shelf ready to use because I had read the ingredient list on Amazon before purchasing the product.  The first time I pulled a canister out to use I scanned the ingredients again and was shocked to find that listed right after the first ingredient-salt-was MSG.  While there was a disclaimer in the Amazon ad by Knorr it seems dishonest to me for them to minimize the presence of MSG in that ad and then list it as the second ingredient on the canister itself.  Many people react to MSG, sometimes quite frighteningly (facial and tongue swelling, rashes, etc.)  Restaurants are generally quick to let customers know if they use MSG. Many no longer use it to enhance the flavor of food.  I never add MSG to any  food I prepare.<br /><br />Knorr has lost a customer.  I will never recommend their products to anyone again.  I am also writing a strong complaint to the company.  I hope others will do the same if they, too, feel that Knorr misrepresented their product.<br /><br />Just another reminder that advertising can be dangerously misleading.  This was an expensive lesson for me as both cans are being disposed of in the garbage.

review/summary: Fair taste, but strange aftertaste
review/text: It definitely has some variation of caramel flavor, but I found it also has a strange taste that goes along with it that I can't really describe except for an extreme sugar soda aftertaste.  Unfortunately, it's this strange taste that dominates as the aftertaste, which makes it only fair as a product.<br /><br />Compared to Torani Sugar Free Caramel, it is not as good, but it is not so bad as to throw out by any means.  That award goes to Torani Sugar Free CLASSIC Caramel.  Avoid that stuff at any cost.<br /><br />Also, note that you can buy it directly from the "Monin Store" cheaper than here on Amazon if you buy a "case" which is 4 bottles (same as here).  You also get free shipping on anything else you may want to try along with the "case".  I also tried the O'free chocolate which was comparatively good, although with a bit malty taste.  It also has some of that weird aftertaste.  I also got one of their sampler packs, but in general, was not really so impressed with their line.  Torani is really hit-or-miss, especially with their reformulations.  I found DaVinci sugar-free syrups to be the top syrup, but they are expensive and fairly watered-down.<br /><br />Hope you found my review helpful.

review/summary: Monin Sugar Free Syrup
review/text: A truly delicious sugar free syrup with a real caramel flavor...and no aftertaste. I was initially concerned because of the crystallized residue that collected around the threads at the top of the bottle, very similar to sugar crystals. However, I called the 800 number on the bottle and the Monin representative assured me that this residue results from the sweetener Eridex, the product is indeed sugar free and safe for those of us who must avoid sugar. This is a wonderful alternative if you are looking for something to add to your coffee!<br />This 4 pk has the larger 33.8 (1 liter) size bottle. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001228R8M">Monin Caramel Syrup O'free (Sugar Free, Calorie Free), 33.8-Ounce Plastic Bottles (Pack of 4)</a> VERY good value.

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: I don't find this applesauce dry at all.  It has a great consistency, very moist without being watery, and the apple flavor really packs a punch.  Amazon has very few natural applesauces available for subscribe and save -not necessarily organic, just pure applesauce with no added sugar etc.  I first bought a case of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UOHEI">Musselman's Natural, Unsweetened Applesauce</a> and found it terrible.  It was VERY dry and mealy.  I forced myself to finish one jar and I'm still using the remainder for baking.<br /><br />Santa Cruz applesauces are delicious and actually fresh-tasting.  I keep a pack in my fridge at all times, and eat them as snacks when I crave something sweet or cold and refreshing.  I also occasionally eat one for breakfast if I'm in a hurry, and they're great to have on hand when you're sick or feeling a little nauseated etc.  The combination of chilled, smooth texture, and bright fruitiness has settled my stomach many a time.  I cancel many items after getting through an entire case but I'm on my third delivery of this applesauce and it's a staple.

review/text: These actually cost the same as the cheap local grocery brand do here. $4.00/pack, no tax, free shipping. However, the local brand has sugar and/or high fructose corn syrup, and I have to pay tax. I bought these to have an easy and healthy way to fix my toddler breakfast. I can mix it with infant oatmeal and viola! Instant breakfast! These are probably more expensive than where most people live, but for us it was a very good value. The applesauce itself was a little thicker, so it's best to have a utensil nearby, but the flavor is OUTSTANDING. We all love it.

review/summary: Best available apple sauce
review/text: I believe this to be the best-tasting organic apple sauce available currently. It has just the right balance of sweetness and tartness - - - at least to my taste. If you find it too dry (which I don't) just add a little water and stir - - - problem solved. I like to add a spoonful of apple fiber and a spoonful of organic oat bran to increase my daily fiber intake. Maybe that means I find it (and other apple sauce brands as well) a little too moist to my liking.

As a Dukan dieter one of the side effects can be constipation due to lack of fiber in the diet, I thought this would help move things along.

It does do what it is suppose to do, but with a painful price to pay. I tried this on 2 different occasions with the same unfortunate result. I won't be purchasing this again.

review/summary: My quest for the best sugar free chocolate
review/text: I have tried every piece of chocolate sweetened with Stevia known to humankind. I was on a quest to find the best. I tried this sampler and loved it. I then ordered 12 bars of milk chocolate... though every flavor is great, especially mango.<br /><br />This milk chocolate gives you 100% of the pleasure without the sugar and without nasty sugar substitutes like Maltitol. The only problem with this guilt free chocolate is stopping before you have devoured an entire bar and start in on second. It is expensive but if you have a sweet tooth for chocolate and value your health, it's a small premium to pay. This milk chocolate is highly recommended. I would give this chocolate six stars if I could.... and the customer service is GREAT!<br /><br />UPDATE: I realized these bars are NOT sweetened with just stevia. I looked at the label and wondered what in the world is erythritol... A little work on google gave me my answer. Erythritol is Maltitol-lite. Needless to say I am disappointed and changed my five star rating to four. For me Erythritol is about 50% better than Maltitol with regard to digestive issues. So I can eat more of this chocolate than I could Maltitol sweetened chocolate but eating more than a few bites is not good for me. Your personal mileage will vary :-)) My quest to find the best stevia sweetened chocolate bar is not over.

Since this is a half kilo package (and for only 6 bucks) do not try to be skimpy with the amount of tea you use per cup. It won't turn out well. Another problem with this tea is that the leaf is very finely crushed. When I tried brewing the tea in a teaball, a fair amount of it leaked out through the teaball's holes. That being said, I recommend this tea for the price even if it has some problems.

review/summary: Full bodied tea.
review/text: I am a tea drinker- never coffee. I am always looking for new teas to try and prefer black teas. I drink this Rize tea black and without milk or sugar. It is ground very fine and brews up quickly. It does not however get bitter, as many fine ground teas do.<br />It has a great aroma, full, almost smokey, flavor and a decent caffeine kick. My lady, who is a dedicated (to say the least) coffee drinker, loves the smell and flavor of this Rize tea enough that she bought herself a bag from Amazon.<br />This is a good tea, quite different from the Indian, Chinese, Ceylon etc. I usually get. It has become a regular in my tea "rotation".

review/summary: Enjoy Turkey from home
review/text: My boyfriend when to Turkey this week without me. It took him several days to get there because of tornados and cancelled flights but hopefully he is safely there with his family.<br /><br />I couldn't go this time. We did lots of research before he went and I discovered this tea. Everyone drinks tea there, all the time, and I enjoy a good cup of tea every day at lunch so I thought I would try something new. I am very pleased. Its different from the English tea I am used to. It has its own unique flavor and the more I drink it the more I like it.<br />I like that its grown without any pesticides and is a natural product.<br /><br />Next time maybe I can go to Turkey with the family, until then I am enjoying this tea very much.

review/text: I have been drinking this tea for years and I am happy with the exquisite taste that comes from naturally grown Black Sea region tea. No pesticides/chemicals have been used in growing this tea, it is pure, it is natural, it is rich in taste and above all it is healthy.<br /><br />It is loose tea so you need to have a set of two teapots, one at the bottom for boiling water and one at the top for brewing tea.

review/summary: Fantastic Conserve
review/text: I have purchased the St. Dalfour brand of preserves almost exclusively for the last ten years? Why? Because once you taste them it is very hard to enjoy anything else. They are made with very fresh, ripe, flavorful fruit, no corn syrup, usually no sweetening whatsoever other than fruit juice. Very basic recipe. Great taste, attractive glass jars. These small items would make great gifts or additions to a fruit basket or breakfast tray of hot rolls. The only brand I find is equal is Frog Hollow Farm - an enterprise in Northern California.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: These are an absolute rip-off at over $12 a bag.  I spotted them for sale from Amazon for about $4 a bag, and brought one to try then.  I'm glad I didn't spend more.<br /><br />These are nice, but I was expecting something a bit "special" and they did not deliver.  The apple flavor is very subtle---although my husband claims he could taste a slight hint of apple, I couldn't taste any at all.  The caramel was nice, and there's a generous amount of it, but overall, the product is nothing remarkable.<br /><br />My husband is not normally a picky chocolate eater.  But he will NOT eat these at all.  He cannot stand them.  I find them enjoyable enough, (although they are a little sickly sweet) although I wouldn't bother to buy them again.  I prefer the normal fun-sized milky way packs.

Personally, I was not at all impressed with the flavor of these.  They were very sweet and the flavor was not appealing to me.  I'm glad I only purchased two bags of these.  I knew the quantities were low when I ordered.  I thought if these were as good as I had hoped, I would wish I had ordered more before they were all gone.  I'm so glad I didn't.  I will be adding the reminder to the trick or treat bags for the kids on Halloween.

review/summary: These are good, but nothing to faint over
review/text: Well, we were immediately drawn to these, since they have a caramel apple flavor.<br />We ordered them from Amazon, and quite frankly, a lot of the small bars arrived a bit<br />mushed. we put them in the refrigerator to firm them back up, but that wasn't the problem.<br />I'm not sure if it was from the cat toy (something for them to rub their faces on) in the same<br />shipment box could have done the smushing, or if they were improperly stored at the warehouse level.<br />We haven't found any that didn't have the actual bar cracked, making the caramel stick to the paper.<br /><br />That being said -<br />I love regular Milky Ways, so didn't think this could be too horrible.<br />It isn't. But, it also wasn't worth the price we paid for them!<br />I have included a photo of the inside.<br /><br />The taste is pleasant, for sure. I think it was the relative cost-to-candy ratio and the condition in which<br />they arrived which was annoying for me. The caramel is just like a regular Milky Way and tasty.<br />The apple part is the bottom nougat - it is a white shade, and tastes like a candy apple more than a<br />caramel apple. So, you have a candy apple bottom with the caramel on the top.<br />Again, good, but nothing to do a city-wide search to find.

review/summary: Very strange taste
review/text: I was so excited to get these. Caramel, apple, nougat and chocolate.. what's not to love? Unfortunately my expectations were not met with what could have been a great candy. The first time I ate one I was shocked with how strong the flavoring was. It was like the flavor was too concentrated or too artificial. It also did not taste like sweet caramel and apple. I could barely taste the caramel and I wasn't sure if I could make out apple either. It was just... odd. Second time I ate one I ate it in layers and figured out what was going on. The layers of chocolate and caramel taste like the original Milky Way. The nougat layer tastes spicy, kind of like fake cinnamon. It is so overwhelming it's hard to taste any apple. It's what I would imagine biting into a apple cinnamon candle would taste like. If they would have just added some natural apple flavor to the nougat, maybe add some extra caramel, and left out the spice I think this would have been a great idea. I hope they reformulate this and try making these again next year because Caramel Apple Milky Way's have so much potential.

review/summary: Blueberries and Coffee Combine for a Tasty Beverage
review/text: Flavored coffees are a vast improvement over the bitter, standardized coffee from the past. Manufacturers have created some tasty concoctions with their coffee, and Green Mountain is one of the recent pioneers in this crowded field. This company makes many different coffees; some more traditional in flavor and others a combination of fruit and other taste sensations. Wild Mountain Blueberry is one of the fruity blends and it ranks as one of my favorites in the fruit/coffee section of the market.<br /><br />Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry Coffee sounded unusual when I first heard about it. I wasn't so sure the flavor of blueberries would match the taste of coffee. But this product easily exceeded my expectations and I can now see why so many people rave about this coffee. The scent alone is very enticing, with its blueberry muffin- like nose and caramel undertones. The taste is also very nice, with flavors of blueberry, coffee, caramel, and a touch of butter. I appreciate that Green Mountain decided to go easy on the blueberry flavor when they formulated this coffee. Too much fruit flavor would take away from the contributions from the coffee. The balance here is very nice.<br /><br />This coffee product is sweeter than the average brew and it would make a great beverage for a hot breakfast. My experience with this flavored coffee has been confined to the workplace, but I have sampled a cup or two in the mornings when breakfast has been served at my place of employment. The taste is perfectly compatible with most any breakfast food and it made my breakfast even better than usual.<br /><br />I like coffee much more today than I did in the past, and the main reason for my newfound interest is the plethora of flavors offered by so many different manufacturers. Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry Coffee is one of hundreds of flavored blends and it offers a tasty alternative to the average brew. I love blueberries, and this flavored coffee offers a nicely balanced hot beverage that tastes good with food or all by itself.

review/summary: Smells one way, tastes another, but thankfully both are pretty good!
review/text: My boyfriend really wanted to try this blend as he has always enjoyed blueberry flavored coffees in the past. We picked up one of the sample packs of this blend from keurig's website to give it a try. I was skeptical about how a berry flavored coffee would translate when being brewed in the Keurig. Fortunately, though, the end result is very good, although not at all like either of us expected.<br /><br />From the moment this coffee begins brewing, the blueberry scent is unmistakeable. Very nice, but that had me worried that this coffee would have some sort of artificial sweetness to it. Thankfully, however, that isn't the case. While the scent may overpower you with the fragrance of fresh blueberries, the taste is a whole different thing altogether. The taste of this coffee is incredibly woodsy with a bit of a hint of cinnamon (very subtle in the latter). It's quite pleasing although totally unexpected.<br /><br />All in all my boyfriend even prefers this to the coffee shop blends, which speaks volumes in my book. I think it's great and I'm sure we'll restock it when our current supply of pods runs out.

I didn't like French Toast, Cinnamon Pastry or Peach. Kahlua and Hazelnut are just okay to me. I haven't tried a K-cup chocolate yet, but I like some different chocolate coffees I've tried. I have a bottle of Raspberry syrup and I like that added in some of them. I'm going to try the Raspberry K-cup now that they have one.  French Vanilla is good, and with Raspberry syrup added in too!

review/summary: Awesome Blueberry aroma and flavor
review/text: I received this sample with my Keurig B40 along with other 17 samples. To give a perspective, I am coffee wimp who likes Half & Half and a sugar substitute in my coffee; now with that establish.<br /><br />I like to drink using my 12.7 coffee mug (using filtered water which I highly recommend)in the morning, usually two of those. My old (which I still have) Cuisinart with a coffee grinder has a flat bottom basket for the grinds. Being single and the only resident here, I use two scoops of conventional drip grind coffee which barely covered the bottom of basket so I decided to "retire" my coffee maker and purchase a Keurig B40.<br /><br />Back to the review. This morning I had the G.M EXTRA BOLD SUMATRAN RESERVE first, which will be the first last and and only EXTRA BOLD coffee I'll ever drink. My second my second cup-mug was the Wild Mountain Blueberry. I used the 9.25 mug setting and as the coffee started to drip in the cup the aroma of fresh blueberry's rose from the steam and, by the time the machine have finished brewing the whole kitchen was filled with the aroma of blueberries. Now I am not a fan of coffee flavored blueberries; in my pancakes and muffins yes, but not in my coffee. I was amazed how pleasant the kitchen smelled. It was a very pleasant sensation.<br /><br />After the first taste, the coffee had a mild and rich and smooth texture with low acidity and bitterness; well as best as I can tell. The Sumatrans bitter after taste is still lingering.<br /><br />After finishing my coffee I removed the used K-cup from my machine ( I don't like the odor of stale coffee to permeate into the K-cup holder) and the spent k-cup STILL smelled of blueberries.<br /><br />I am very impressed with this flavor; to bad I'm not a fan of blueberry coffee; if I was, I would have given it a five star rating. If you are a fan of blueberry coffee, get this one.

review/summary: Great! One of my favorite flavored coffees!
review/text: If you like other Green Mountain flavored coffees, especially if you like the other seasonal light-roast flavors, you will probably like this one.  It seems like a great fit for the summer.  The blueberry flavor and aroma are subtle, but seems perfect.  It tastes more like coffee than blueberry.  It is definitely a coffee, not a blueberry drink.  This is a light roast.  At first I thought light would mean weak, but it seems like the perfect match for the flavor.  It is nothing like a starbucks.  So if you want a strong coffee taste above all, then this isn't one for you, but if you want a nice flavored light coffee, I think it is great.<br /><br />Like other flavored coffees, you should only brew this on the normal default coffee cup size (6oz) on the Keurig brewer or you will water it down if you use the mug size or larger.

This k-cup now has a permanent place on my k-cup carousel and is a favorite in my household as well as with my guests.<br /><br />For a super delicious cup, stir in some french vanilla creamer ... mmmmmmm!<br /><br />I will put this one caveat out there: if you enjoy a very dark roast or strong cup of coffee, then you will probably not enjoy this coffee.  It is best enjoyed by coffee drinkers who typically enjoy their coffee with a medium of mild roast and sweetened.

review/summary: Not My Cuppa Tea... Luckily, it can be exchanged!
review/text: While many people on the K-Cup Exchange (an excellent Yahoo Group) like this blueberry flavor, I have to disagree. Fruity coffee just doesn't work for me. I can see how some people would like it, though. I drink Coffee People Donut Shop for the most part, and use it as a base to test all other k-cup flavors against.<br /><br />If you don't like a particular flavor or roast k-cup you've purchased, you can exchange it on the K-Cup Exchange. You can also learn tons of tips on brewing and where to buy k-cups cheap. There's often deals from vendors, contests, and giveaways fro the group. Find it here;<br /><br />(you'll need to change the "DOT" to a "." with no spaces)

Order direct from Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (the people who make it) for $26 for the 2 of them ($13 each) plus shipping.  Whoever priced this so high must be smoking something!

I've poured it on salads, used it in marinades, sipped it out of a teaspoon, sprinkled it on rice...really, it's just wonderful. I don't know about Amazon's price, I bought it on clearance at T J Maxx. However, the large bottle of this is a GREAT price and I'm going to order it when I run out of this. I also bought their cherry vinegar, which I didn't like nearly as well.

review/summary: Not bad if you like bland chili
review/text: Although the title of this review might sound as if I didn't like the product, that isn't true.  I did like it, mostly because I DO like my chili to be very mild due to a stomach disorder.  Which, of course, means that I can't eat most commercial chili products.  And most non-meat chili's try to make up for their lack of substance with an overabundance of veggies.  They taste more like vegetable stew than chili.  But this one is different.  Although the "bite" is almost non-existent and the taste is delicate, there are some interesting flavors hiding in the background.  For Supertasters like me (people born with ten times the normal amount of tastebuds), the taste of most foods is too strong.  If you like foods that shout out their ingredients, then this isn't for you.  But if you like subtle flavors, you might appreciate this unassuming little can.

review/text: Tons of flavor and I have average taste bud count. It's got a little kick but not mild and not hot. One thing to note is the bell peppers in it are crunchy. I like it but some people don't care for that. Another thing I question for Eden,IS THERE IS 42g of carbs and only 3G of sugar. I find it hard to believe there is that much Spelt? Something else that tic's me off is the ingredient,"Spices" I know the FDA,"Discourages" that word but companies can and still do use it. High fiber,high protein,tastes great.

review/summary: Great treat that my picky dog loved.
review/text: When we got my dog from a shelter 3 weeks ago she would barely eat or drink anything we would give her.  She had been in the shelter for 7 months so was pretty stressed out when we brought her home.<br /><br />On the advice of our vet we picked up these treats as a 'sure fire' treat that she would love.  And sure enough she did.<br /><br />The disks are a bit large about the size of a silver dollar but break apart easy enough - and they were a home run with my dog.

review/text: I've used smoked mussels for umpteen years, and these are quite fine. I love them. But just beware that smoked mussels have a distinctive taste, and not everyone likes it. It's a different flavor from smoked clams.<br /><br />I like them as a snack straight from the can, and they can be whipped into a really tasty dip with sour cream, cream cheese, and/or mayonnaise (I prefer a combo of any 2 of these for best taste) with worcestershire sauce, soy sauce (to taste for saltiness), and optionally a touch of liquid smoke.<br /><br />I also like that these are a good source of iron.

review/text: I used to buy Pemmican brand jerky, and it was great.  Then they were sold to a different owner, and now the stuff is HORRIBLE.  I have tried other "store" brands, but it is all really nasty.  SO I decided to try Buffalo Bill's.  I went with the safest version, the mild country cut.  At first, I wasn't sure how I liked it.  Then I noticed half the bag was gone!  I would describe the jerky as very moist, and almost pepperoni-like.  After you are done eating, you notice a mild "burn" in your mouth.  I am not into hot food, but I could handle it. Every piece was tender, none were bad.  So I would say give it a try.  I will most likely purchase some more in the future.

review/text: As the title says, consider this a "4.5 star" review, if such was possible here.  I do very much like their jerky, but I found this flavor to be the weakest of any of the ones I've tried so far.  (I've tried the Barbeque, Teriyaki and Honey Pepper in the country cut line, finding the Teriyaki to be my personal favorite, and also their vennison jerky).  I also found this jerky to be just a tad tougher then the other flavors, I don't know if that's due to the marinade used on the others or not.  Still, this is a very good product, and I can easily see this being a 5 star product for those who prefer their jerky to not have a slighty sweet taste.

review/summary: Outrageously good!
review/text: I grew up in Kansas City, MO, so Wolferman's English muffins were for a long time a staple in my home.  I've tried a lot of different muffin brands, from cheap store brands (not worth the money) to higher-end commercial brands.  NOTHING beats these Bays muffins!<br /><br />They're not fork split -- they're actually sliced, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  They still have plenty of "nooks and crannies" for the melted butter due to the high-quality yeast they use.  Pop 'em in the toaster, and you'll get a nice crispy exterior and a chewy and flavorful interior.  The flavor is wonderful -- just the right amount of yeastiness, but no "sour" taste.  Great for breakfast with butter and a little marmalade or jam, but they also hold up well under heartier accompaniments or in sandwiches.  The flavor still comes through.<br /><br />I made room in my refrigerator's freezer for these, even giving up some ice cream room!  The sacrifice was worth it.

review/summary: Excellent and totally different tasting than other brands
review/text: We went to St. Thomas USVI and this was the only brand of english muffin that was sold in grocery stores.  Thinking they would taste just so-so, we were very surprised.  Just delicious and unique tasting.  There wasn't a sour dough taste to them which most expect from english muffins but when toasted and buttered...they melted in your mouth.

review/summary: Muffin Heaven
review/text: These English muffins were on sale at my local grocery, so I tried them and OH MY GOD, they were so very delicious. Once you have tried these, there is no way you could go back to Thomas's or , heaven forbid, store brand English muffins. They simply don't stack up to the flavor and texture of Bay's English muffins.<br /><br />I am now ruined for regular English muffins, which is terrible because they are more expensive, but awesome because they are so delicious.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: Bay's are so good, it's not fair to compare them to any other brand.  They are in a class by themselves.  Buying them here by the case is a smart choice if you have the freezer room.  They will stay fresh for well over 6 months - not that they will be around that long because you will have eaten them all before then.  Plus, even with the shipping cost they are a good deal.  No other brand is allowed in my house.
