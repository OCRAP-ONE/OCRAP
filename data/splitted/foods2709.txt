review/summary: Interesting Combination
review/text: When I first tried this shot, I was surprised by the bitter initial taste.  The aftertaste, though, has a very nice mango flavor.  I did feel more awake without feeling jittery.  I don't think that it will replace my coffee, but it might be a great thing for an afternoon pick me up.

review/text: Not for me.  Taste is pretty strong....coffee-like.  Couldn't taste any mango in it.<br /><br />I drank 1 ounce, and that was 1 ounce too much.<br /><br />Will not try again.<br /><br />Do enjoy the other products/juices in the Jamba Juice category.  As stated in my other reviews, they were delicious.<br /><br />This is just not for me.

review/summary: Tasty little pick me up
review/text: This is a tasty (sort of mango/coconut) drink.  You only take a shot and it gives  you a little boost of caffeine.  (It was in the fridge and my husband drank a glass without knowing about the caffiene content and was up unitl 1 a.m., so beware!).  If you use as directed, a nice little pick me up.

review/text: I really liked the ingredients of this drink and the taste reminds me of the tropical islands.  The mango taste is strong and flavorful and the shot is easy to take in the morning for a great way to start the day.  The drink is thick and almost smoothie like, but has a great tropical taste.  It gave me a little energy to start the day and had a refreshing taste.

review/summary: Vitatlity shot
review/text: Anytime I am flagging, I take a capful of this vitality shot. It has a nice pick-me-up effect, but without the shakiness that coffee often provides. It is not as strong as coffee, which makes it perfect for a mid-day boost when you don't need a full jump-start.

review/summary: Ugh, this stuff looks and tastes nasty, could be I got a bad batch?
review/text: Ok, I bought this from the Amazon warehouse so it is possible that it was not stored properly (well within date though), however I have nothing to compare it to but the pic on the label, and it is a bit darker than that and more brown.  That said this stuff looks and tastes nasty (I tried a bit before dumping it).  It is hard to tell sometimes with fruity energy drinks, but I am pretty sure this would not be something most people would want to drink, more like hold your nose and chug it.  Given all the glowing reviews I have to wonder if I got a bad batch or Amazon did not store it well.  I will try and post a pic of the stuff so maybe somebody who has bought it at the store can say if it looks different.<br /><br />Update - Amazon came though with a refund on this which I am grateful for.  I am pretty sure that the batch I received was either stored improperly or was just not right given all the positive reviews, but it is something to watch out for.  Note that I ordered from the Amazon Warehouse deals site.

review/text: Like everyone else I need an extra boost in the AM to help me get through my work day and I've never been a huge fan of coffee (the shakes, the calories, the sugar) you get my drift. So when I saw this Vitality Booster hit the market I gave it a shot and LOVE it!  It gives me energy throughout the day - no shakes, no pee breaks, only 20 calories, 3g of sugar and I stay so focused! And best of all the caffeine is natural = no funky chemicals or artificial stuff.  I'm a life time Vitality shot fan!

review/summary: GREAT ORANGE TASTE
review/text: I bought a 2oz bottle of this at my local whole food's store, for $5.39. I've recently been experimenting with baking my own cupcakes. I'd found a good cupcake book with lots of nice frostings.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0848734378">Presented by Southern Living Big Book of Cupcakes: 150 Brilliantly Delicious Dreamcakes</a><br /><br />After I bought this at the store, I found the same orange Flavorganics extract here for $21.96. I realized what a good deal I'd got at my local store, I went back and bought two more bottles!<br /><br />Last week I made a batch of gingerbread cupcakes, from my new cupcake book, I've been making them quite often because they're so delicious. I'd been using a frosting I made with cream cheese, butter and powdered sugar. I decided to use some of this orange extract, I also used a tiny amount of red and yellow food coloring gel, the color turned out great.<br /><br />I wasn't sure how much of this orange essence to use as I'd only ever used almond and vanilla essences before and I never needed much. I kept putting a couple of drops in at a time, I used more than I expected. Next time I'm going to use more drops at a time.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the orange taste, it tastes just like real oranges, but come to think of it, It does come from oranges, so it's not such a surprise!

Thank goodness for Amazon! I've also used it on beef, chicken, and pork. It's a pantry staple.

It's thinner than most creamy Italian dressings but it helps coat the salad evenly without overdressing it.  Rated 5 stars not because it is the most delicious salad dressing I have ever had, but because it tastes exactly as you would hope.<br /><br />This dressing can also be purchased directly from Olive Garden restaurants.

review/summary: The best sunbutter ever!!!
review/text: I love this stuff!!! It is so much better than any other brand we have tried. Probably because it is roasted and has sugar in it, while the other brands are mostly raw. I'm sure the raw versions are healthier, but in this case, I consider it an indulgence! Another reason that we prefer this over any other "sun-butter" is that it comes in a glass jar, while all the other sun-butters seem to come in plastic jars. I like the flavor of this even better than almond or cashew butter. When I could find the Once Again Sunflower Seed butter locally, I would stir in coconut oil and that made it even yummier!<br /><br />Unfortunately my local grocery store stopped carrying it a while ago, and the shipping is rather expensive to order it direct from Once Again. I wish Amazon would start carrying it (not just through a sub-seller).<br /><br />Update: I originally wrote this Feb 2011, and now Once Again is labeling their sunbutter as Gluten Free!  I knew that it was GF, but I'm glad to see it on the label too!  Still hoping Amazon will offer it with a Subscribe and Save option however, and bring the price down!

I will give four stars this time because of the mislabeling.  BUT, this is, in fact, excellent oil.  Now that I know the origin and quality of this EVOO, I will repent and order another bottle.  The country of Chile produces very good agricultural products, and this is one of them.

Since now I have paid the money and never received the item, and basically have found no direct route of getting refunded, I am not happy. I will be reluctant to purchase from Amazon again because there was no way for me to get hold of them for a reimbursement. I contacted UPS and they said Amazon likes to handle these things directly. And from looking all through Amazon's website, it says to contact UPS directly. And when I try to put in for a refund, the product not arriving is never an option---and there is no phone number or way to email otherwise. I guess I am out $30 for this purchase. I am disappointed in both Amazon and UPS for their service. I think if the product arrived, I would have likely been happy with it.

review/text: I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.

review/summary: Awesome healthIER snack option!
review/text: I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.

review/text: Our local TJ's used to carry these, but no more.  There's a Costco 30 miles away, but that seems too far to travel for a bag of chips.  I finally did the subscribe & save to get them on a more regular basis.<br /><br />I like these chips very much, they have good texture & flavor.  They hold up to dip as well.  I've tried the salt & vineger and the cheese flavors, but plain is still my favorite.

review/summary: A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored
review/text: The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of "there must be something better".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per "serving"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word "puff" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed "all natural". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.

The other flavors weren't so great (salt & pepper and cheddar aren't too bad) but this one rocked.

review/summary: Great Chips Less Fat
review/text: I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of "regular" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Best "healthy" salt and vinegar chip out there
review/text: I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary.

review/text: I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.  I love them in the afternoon when I get home from work, or at lunch with a sandwich.  Of course since they are "salt and pepper", there's a lot of salt.  I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.  Would be great for someone who absolutely loves vinegar.  It would also be nice if you could create your own variety box with the flavors you most prefer.  It does get a little boring eating 24 bags the same flavor.

review/summary: All-Natural, Now only 100 calories!, No "diet" taste...all good!
review/text: 1. All natural. Nothing artificial in 'em. No artificial colors or flavors<br />2. Low calories for a lot o' chips<br />3. Uber addictive taste-wise<br /><br />What more needs to be said? I'll be the first to admit, in spite of my being a weight loss coach in the evenings; I am not a big fan of diet food. I am a foodie. I love good food...love to cook it, love to eat it. Yet these, to me, are totally addictive. No fake diet food taste, tons of flavor. In fact, I HAVE to get them in the small bags or I will eat a whole large bag...it's one of those. Hickory, salty, hint of sweetness.<br /><br />They aren't fried or fake baked to taste fried.  They use a pressure cooker and the potatoes pop into a chip according to the bag.<br /><br />I got the automatic shipment of them from Amazon because it reduces the price by 15%and if I get 2 per month it allows for free shipping and, with the no tax, I can't get them in the stores that cheap and they are delivered automatically to my door this way.<br /><br />Also, these have a lot less salt than the old chips I used to eat...but they don't taste like its missing<br /><br />Negatives: These are still hard to find in some grocery stores.

review/summary: LOVE THE POPCHIPS!
review/text: I am totally addicted to the POPCHIPS!  They are very good and don't taste greasy at all.  One bag has a lot of chips in them and can be filling.  They are only 100 calories and around 3 grams of fat and they don't taste like you are eating something healthy for you.  I love Cheetos and can't have them anymore and now love these chips.  The flavoring is not very strong but strong enough.

review/summary: "Un-sinfully" Lip Smackin' Good
review/text: Love these pop-chips.  I've tried some other flavors too but found salt and pepper the best so far.  Original comes a close second for me.  Salt and vinegar is a very close third. Garlic is too strong for me (I love garlic in other forms though).<br /><br />I was hesitant to try these initially because I'm not a big fan of pepper flavor in chips, but am I glad I did!  The pepper flavor rounds up the chip rather than defines it, so it doesn't feel like you're eating pepper in it's raw form.<br /><br />It's a good thing the fat content is low because these are quite addictive.

review/summary: I wanted to love these...
review/text: I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- lower-calorie, baked-not-fried: this is definitely a huge plus!<br /><br />Con:<br />- I was expecting something more potato-ey. Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying "chip" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere.

review/text: These chips are excellent! They stopped carrying them at my local Costco, but I was so happy to find them here!<br /><br />I guess they ran out of the plain kind because it said they were available when I ordered them... they are listed on my order sheet and Amazon invoice as "Original"... and lo and behold, I received "Sea Salt and Vinegar", not "Original".<br /><br />Still a good product, but wish I had a courtesy e-mail or something to tell me they ran out of "Original". I'm not a huge fan of salt/vinegar chips, but at least it keeps me from eating them quickly (it lets me nibble).

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I was really hoping to get a really great nutritious & delicious snack for my family when I ordered this product.  I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The packaging is really good looking and I had high hopes, so when I opened the package to my chips, I expected something great.  I ordered the Chili Lime flavor and, since, I have had higher-fat chili lime chips in the past, I'd knew that I would love them.<br />First, they don't really look like what they appear to be on the packaging (no big deal though).<br />I took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor.  So, I looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and I was pretty surprised--it had a LOT of chemicals in the product.  Also, AND THIS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT, the main ingredient is not a sliced potato, but, "potato ingredients (potato flakes, potato starch)".  In other words, it's made of instant mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious.  However, there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips (that's why I gave it 2-stars).<br /><br />All in all, I would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of Lay's or Kettle chips than give them these chips.<br /><br />All The Best.

review/text: Popchips are ok.  However, these snacks are made from potato flakes, similar to "Pringles".  If you have ever eaten "Funyuns" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try "Grandma Utz" potato chips, a true potato chip.

review/text: Not greasy or salty like a traditional chip, these actually tend to be more satiating as a sweet snack than a salty one, at least in the sweet potato chip variety. A handful of these is a sufficient pick me up and relatively wholesome, with just around 100 calories. The sugars are low too so even though you feel like you are having something slightly sweet it's really not going to spike your sugars (I think around 3g per serving). Overall these are a great little snack that you can feel good about eating.

It has a sweet spiciness, but nothing is overpowering; just the right balance of smoke, sweet, and spice, they're all good, but the barbecue has the most robust flavor.<br /><br />Popchips are a good choice for those who are trying to trim a few pounds. They're tasty and filling, but relatively low in calories compared to traditional chips. I parcel mine out into sandwich-size reclosable bags to help with portion control, and still manage to have a satisfying snack that fits in my program.

review/summary: Best Popcorn-type Chips of 6 Brands I Bought & Tested!
review/text: I wanted to have "sized" portions of chip-type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor

They are not as healthy as eating fruits and veggies, and are still chips, but they are a much MORE healthy alternative to your regular chip.  And they do still have an excellent taste!

review/summary: Great Taste and Not All the Calories/Fat
review/text: This is the first time I've tried these and I'll be getting them again. Great substitute for chips while following Weight Watchers - plus they taste good too. Going to be substituting these for my fries w/a hamburger every time. Definitely Buy Again - and Will.

review/text: Pop Chips are delicious, light and tasty. I bought a box of the Parmesan Garlic and it almost dissapeared before I had a chance to eat some of them.
