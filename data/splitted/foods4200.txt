review/summary: $35.25 shipping?
review/text: Molinari salami is the best, I would give it 5 stars.<br />But $35.25 shipping???<br /><br />Dry salami is cured product. It can remain at room temperature for many months!<br />So, vendor should offer slower (much cheaper) shipping options.<br /><br />Shipping comparison between 2 cured meats I ordered from Amazon today (June 4):<br /><br />1) This salami:<br />  Weight = 4 lb.<br />  Delivery estimate = June 6, 2012 - June 11, 2012.<br />  Shipping = $35.25<br /><br />2) Salted cod ("Salt fish", 1 lb, ships from and sold by JamaicanGroceryStore):<br />  Weight = 6 lb (6 units).<br />  Delivery estimate =  June 8, 2012 - June 13, 2012.<br />  Shipping = $11.20.

review/summary: Really Yummy...like corn and rice Chex with salt added. :)  But expires in August 2012
review/text: I ordered these due to good reviews and being gluten-free. While I've pretty much given up bread/bread products, sometimes, I totally crave crackers with cheese. So, got these to try.<br /><br />Very crispy. I love the texture. The flavor is reminiscent of Cheetos sans cheese, or Corn and Rice Chex mixed and toasted. Salty, a bit of corn taste. Great with cheese, so hey, I got what I wanted.<br /><br />My only quibble is that it's a day before June 2012, and these expire in August 2012. A bit over 2 months. That tells me this is not a fresh batch, as bagged products tend to be good for many months to a year. So, well, be prepared to eat em up pretty fast. I don't like to eat starchy-carby stuff in large quantities or often, just as an occasional treat. I will have to eat these a bit more frequently than I had planned. Fortunately, the bag I sampled did not taset stale and were nicely crispy. Yum.

review/summary: Yummy Ninteno gummies!
review/text: These i think are the most awesome gummies, and i love the videogame theme. There is no weird after taste, and they are like eating gummybears just shaped different. If you get these with the gameboy advance game cases(shaped like the system) for the cases, you will be disapointed however. Not in the flavor of course, but the cases do not hold the games securely and they flop around in the case. So i'd recommend just buying the boxes, you get more anyways.

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I have to order this online because our grocery stores don't carry it -- probably because it's more expensive than Smuckers.  I notice Smuckers has copied Bonne Maman's packaging by placing a plaid cover on Smuckers jelly jars. We love these Bonne Maman products because the flavor is intense and delicious. For me, the degree of sweetness is perfect. I don't mind paying extra for such a fine product, and we use less of it because the flavor is more concentrated.

review/summary: Decent jam but definitely not the best for me.
review/text: Hi everyone,<br /><br />So, I've been living in France for a bit and have noticed this jam everywhere at the regular supermarkets.  I've also noticed it in Whole Foods back at home, though it is not sold in France at the bio co-ops or natural grocery stores.  It's also sold here in France for a fraction of the price in the states of course.<br /><br />A friend bought this one and I had this on toast.  It was good, but overly sweet!  I could taste too much sugar, which overpowered the raspberry flavor.  I do not think it was horrible, but the sugar was definitely too much for me.  As for spread and consistency, that gets 5 stars.  But again, I've tasted better jams in France and this one was just mainstream for me.

review/text: Shipping was quick, the packaging was nicely done in large bubble wrap, and no broken containers. The product is absolutely the best I've had yet. There is no High Fructose Corn syrup and the berry flavor is outstanding. I had the opportunity to talk to a customer service rep when I had a question about the preserves and the jelly. This woman explained things in a relaxed complete discussion about the product as though I was the only customer that she had to talk to that day. I ordered a package each of the Raspberry and Blackberry and each respective flavor is as distinct as it is tasty. In an age of artificial flavors I do highly recommend this establishment to everybody who wants quality preserves, jams, and jellies.

It's Lard!<br />Actually, I bought a medium sized home fryer to make stuff I cannot get anymore due to the liberal food do gooders who won't allow me to buy decent tasting fried foods, like Onion Rings and French Fries, that are worth eating... The lard need not be refrigerated and comes in small enough containers that happen to be perfect for the fryer.  Good quality and taste, Armour makes the best Lard, in my opinion!  The "Pack of Three" is a convenient way to purchase and Amazon packaged and shipped the containers nested in bubble bags and kraft paper to keep the containers from bumping into each other.  Good Job, Amazon!

review/text: I love this drink. I would rather drink crystal light beverages than just about anything else, and they're also much healthier than just about anything.  I like to mix half crystal light lemon iced tea and the other half crystal light lemonade. It's like a sweet and tart half and half.  As per the instructions one packet makes 2 quarts of beverage, however  I find this to be a little too sweet for my taste.  I use four packets (eight quarts) in in five gallons of water, I put it in a five gallon water jug and put it on one of those stand alone water coolers with the filter removed. Ice cold half and half on tap, mmm, mmm, good.  Amazon has about the best price on crystal light that I have seen, and I can assure you as a crystal light connoisseur I have shopped around. Try it I'm certain you'll love it, although I hazard a guess you'd probably want it sweeter.

I prepare several batches of these frozen treats ahead of time and store them in gallon-size plastic storage freezer bags.  We live in the desert and I want a large supply ready for our desert summer.

review/summary: Insanely good
review/text: This has positively frightening potential for addiction. Spicy, crunchy,  and with enough protein (20% by weight) that you can rationalize it as "not really junk food" despite the fact that it's salty and fried. It has a cayenne tang that I enjoy, but that won't suit all munchers. And, if it matters to you, none of the ingredients have laboratory names.<br /><br />If you like the flavors of Indian food, this could become a serious snacking issue for you. There's only one way to find out - if you dare.

review/summary: Nescafe Clasico is pretty good
review/text: I disagree with the two previous reviewers. If brewed coffee is not available, Nescafe Clasico is my choice. It's smoother than Nescafe Taster's Choice and less "instant" tasting than most American instants. Anyone who has traveled extensively in Latin America has experienced the same problems as the reviewer who was visiting India. With a few local exceptions (such as Antigua, Guatemala) brewed coffee is seldom available. You usually get a small metal pitcher of super-strong instant and a big pitcher of hot water for mixing. My solution is to use a Clasico stick with the hot water. -- John

review/summary: Starbucks Via Columbia much better
review/text: I rarely drink instant coffee, but sometimes go to rural India on medical trips. Outside of Starbucks cafes and large western style hotels (in all cities, but not in rural India) it is nearly impossible to get brewed coffee in India. Ask for coffee, and you get instant, everywhere in India (except as noted). Anyway, to get a coffee fix on the go, I've tried the Starbucks Via Columbia packets, and (for instant coffee) they are wonderful, won't fool you into thinking you've got a good cup of brewed coffee, but better than common western office coffee, and much better than the instant served in rural India. The Starbucks packs cost 75 cents to $1 each, and I was hoping the Nescafe packs would be nearly as good, at 1/8 the price. Unfortunately, not. If you want something that reminds you of brewed coffee, bite the bullet and pay for the Starbucks. The other reviewers that say the Nescafe is nearly as good as Starbucks Via must have had a cold or some other problem when they were tasting it.

review/summary: K-rations for the broke and weary
review/text: When Amazon prices this at $12-13, it's tough to argue about this being a good deal. At that price, it's a VERY good deal. And my girlfriend loves this stuff. She would give it five stars. I'm a bit less generous, so I'm giving this four stars. More importantly, we will be buying more of this so long as Amazon holds the price down.<br /><br />This version of canned spaghetti is most suitable for three groups of people: kids who like its sweet and somewhat bland taste; parents who are desperately seeking a quick and easy way to put something in front of the kids; snd seniors who are trying to stretch their Social Security payments. As my title suggests, these cans are really K-rations for the broke and weary. They aren't going to win any gourmet contests, but they will keep you alive so long as you can operate a microwave.<br /><br />Here are some more specific comments that are a bit more critical but not meant to take away from the overall value of this spaghetti:<br /><br />1. Spaghetti sauce should have a tart, tangy, and tomato-y taste. This version is on the sweet side, probably because Chef Boy-Ar-Dee knows that that's  what kids want.<br /><br />2. Spaghetti sauce should also, in my opinion, have distinctive spicing from things like garlic, basil, onions, bay leaves, and whatever else a chef finds lying around the kitchen. The Chef Boy-Ar-Dee version has very little spicing, probably because the company knows that kids don't have adult palates and are more likely to go for something a bit bland.<br /><br />3. Spaghetti noodles should be cooked al-dente (some degree of firmness). The noodles in these cans are more along the lines of al-mushy. But they're about as good as you're going to get in cans.<br /><br />4. The meatballs that come in this product are fairly decent. Actually, if The History Channrl is to be believed, Ettore Boiardi introduced meatballs to his spaghetti sauce not because Italians made it that way (they didn't) but because he discovered Americans couldn't cope well with the idea of a meatless entree. You really don't need meatballs to be authentic, but if you (and the kids) want them anyway, this is about as good as you're going to get in canned spaghetti.<br /><br />The people who complain about this product should probably treat it as a base and add in some more tomato sauce along with garlic, onions, basil, and so forth. And sprinkle parmesan cheese as a topping. It's not that hard.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a very good value right now, and it's a whole lot better than discovering you're broke because of spending your Social Security on gourmet spaghetti meals. I hopes this helps some.

review/text: Most of the sellers I've looked at on Amazon are selling this stuff(all flavors) for three bucks a can or more including shipping.  Anyone that pays that kind of money is nuts.  The local supermarkets almost always have Chef Boyardee 15 oz. cans on sale for a buck a can.  And the local Big lots usually stocks a few flavors at the same price. As far as flavor, I'll paraphrase Henry Hill at the end of Goodfellas - this stuff ain't pasta. It's noodles and ketchup.

review/summary: Organic, Caffeine free, and Tastes Great...perfect low calorie afternoon Treat.
review/text: Davidson's Lemon Ginger tea is a good blend of both flavors.  Neither the lemon nor the ginger overpowers each other and blend well to make an enjoyable tea.  I have found with a lot of ginger mixed tea, you can not taste the ginger because it has been over powered by another flavor.  I am not a huge fan of ginger, but I like the flavor of the ginger mixed with Lemon in this tea.  It is considered a desert tea and works well with cookies or your morning breakfast.  It has only 3 calories per serving so add some no calorie sweetener for an afternoon treat.  This tea is organic and caffeine free. Ginger is good for upset stomachs, so if you are looking for a natural way to sooth the stomach, this tea works great.

review/summary: A really good way to spice up your diabetic cooking and treats!
review/text: If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />My wife loves the flavor of peanut butter and she uses this one in muffins and diabetic cookies. It helped her curb her cravings for peanut butter and it makes some tasty low calorie snacks.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!

review/summary: Worth the effort
review/text: Enjoyed this olive oil several times at a restaurant before I finally asked about it. Thought I could buy it locally and was surprised to learn that it wasn't available. Took down the name and found it on Amazon. One supplier came thru a year ago, but when they were out of stock I had to order from a second. No response. Months went by. Tried another (more expensive) brand available close by and was disappointed. Finally reordered from a third supplier and received this wonderful olive oil. I plan to order more for family gifts.<br />Be aware that olive oil can be an acquired taste. This one is distinctive and full-flavored but not intense, sharp or overpowering. Also note that this type of olive oil is not for cooking -- use it only for dipping bread, plain as a salad dressing, or drizzled over hot dishes and grilled veggies as a finish, for an added mellow and smooth flavor. Amazing in combination with a good balsamic vinegar. Holds it own when used with a little bit of roasted garlic and fresh basil.<br />If you like this olive oil, you will definitely wish you had ordered more than one bottle. You can buy far more expensive extra virgin olive oils, but I have found this one the most versatile for the price, and the one my guests give the best reviews.

review/text: Starting to feel a cold coming on?  Don't feel like or have time to go to the doc?  Keep a box of Echinacea Plus in the house for just those times.  It's got a soothing taste, a soothing smell and it a great beverage anytime, not just when you are sick or on the way.<br /><br />Some people think this stuff works to help head off a cold, some don't.  It has worked well for me since the Pitt Student Health Clinic Suggested it years ago.  Sometimes it succeeds 100% in heading off a cold at the onset of symptoms when consumed as soon as the scratchy throat and runny nose start but sometimes it still takes a little extra help.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals makes great products.  They are kinda pricey but generally worth it (especially this one).  Go buy this at the local grocery or health food store.  You'll be able to buy it one box a time and the bulk price on Amazon is equal to or more expensive than the single unit price in a store.

review/summary: Amazing tea to help you heal
review/text: This is one of those crazy testimonial stories.<br /><br />I suffered a bad case of bronchitis about two years ago, it lasted for three months and my doctor was a little baffled because the antibiotic treatment and vaporizer weren't helping much.  I picked up a box of this tea on a whim, desperate to try anything that might help.  I drank the max dosage per day, and within a week, my symptoms began to fade.  I believe this tea helped boost my immune system to fight off whatever was attacking my lungs.  In one month, I was able to stop drinking the tea all together and breathe with ease, my doctor was surprised. What has shocked me even more is that I've not had a recurrence of lung infection or bronchitis (which I am prone to getting even after the most minor colds,) since taking this product at first sign of a cough.<br /><br />The taste isn't entirely pleasant, but can be helped along with a helping of honey, I prefer blueberry honey and a little bit of milk added to my tea.

review/text: I really trust Traditional Medicinals as the absolute best for herbal tea bags. When I don't buy in bulk, I buy this brand.<br /><br />This particular tea is very popular in my household and with guests. One night, I hosted my usual poker game even though I was sick. I was drinking this tea in an effort to comfort and heal myself. It was snowing out so all my guests asked for a cup and now they rave about it.<br /><br />For me, it's just a tea I make sure I drink when everyone else is sick so I can stay healthy. But my guests love it so I have to keep a couple of extra boxes on hand for them too.<br /><br />TIP: Make sure to pour 8 oz. of boiling water over the tea bag, then cover it so that it can steep without cooling off. Steep for at least 10 minutes. 15 minutes makes a more medicinal brew.<br /><br />Happy sipping!

I'm now able to fall asleep easily within 30 minutes of drinking this tea. I let it steep for 14-15 minutes, and the flavor is very pleasant. I add just a tiny bit of sugar to sweeten it. Soon after I finish it, I'm yawning and ready for bed! I'm sleeping through the night again, and even if I wake up, I'm having much less trouble falling back to sleep than ever before. I have not taken anything for my insomnia other than melatonin, and I think this works better than that!  Couldn't be happier now that I'm getting some quality shut-eye! I highly recommend this product!

review/text: I have found this tea to be AMAZING! I can usually sleep very peacefully, but there are some nights when I have an issue with restlessness secondary to anxiety and stress.  I have spent many nights tossing and turning for hours with a knot in my stomach and a racing mind.  I had tried a couple of other teas but did not get the results I was looking for.  My brother-in-law recommended this tea and I instantly fell in love with it.  After one cup I can physically feel my eyelids getting heavy and can usually fall asleep within 30 minutes.  I always wake up with a clear head and feel extremely rested.  I have heard that if you have more than 2-3 cups it can make you feel groggy, but I've never personally had to drink 2-3 cups to feel relaxed and ready for bed (therefore I don't have to wake up to go to the bathroom a million times as some reviewers may say).  All in all, I have been very pleased with the product and would highly recommend it to others with similar issues as I have had.

review/summary: Works for me!
review/text: This tea is great!  I have been under a lot of stress lately, and this tea has definitely helped me get to sleep.  I have been drinking it for about a month now as needed.  I feel like I sleep a bit more deeply when I drink this, which I have attributed to being more relaxed at bedtime.  It is not a miracle, but I think that the tea itself along with the routine of having it before bed really helps me to relax.<br /><br />Make sure you steep it as directed for 10-15minutes.  I have noticed that if I do not cover my cup to keep the heat in the tea does not come out as strong.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because the flavor is not my favorite.  Its nice for sure, but a bit mild for me.  It is a better and more complex flavor than any other nighttime relaxation tea I have tried.  I prefer to either make a strong cup or sometimes I steep it with a bag of chamomile tea as well which makes a very nice flavor.  I typically have one cup an hour before bed and another while I sit in bed and read right before I go to sleep.  After the first cup I feel more calm, after the second cup I feel drowsy and ready for sleep! I bought the case of six because I have enjoyed this product so much!

review/summary: Great product. It works~
review/text: I have used prescribed medicine for insomnia. Because of pregnancy, I replaced the pill to massage therapy but it was too pricy. My mom in law recommended this product and it really helps!. Even now I am taking it. The reason I take one star out is because it makes me to go to bathroom in the middle of night when I follow the direction of use.

review/summary: Gives me a minor headache...
review/text: I tried to like this... It tastes great and it can give you a good nights rest. However, every time I take it I end up with a slight headache. It starts shortly after I take it and I can still feel it the next morning. It is only a minor headache, but a headache nonetheless. I was able to sleep through it. I recommend making a trip to your local grocery store and buying a single pack to try it out, instead of purchasing a pack of 6 from Amazon.

I used to purchase this from my local grocery store (yay Wegmans!). Unfortunately I just relocated for work and can't find this at any of the stores nearby (life is not the same without Wegmans!). Thanks for Amazon, I can still get the same tea and even better price.

review/summary: I love this tea
review/text: At least one of the ingredients in this tea has clinical evidence that it can help with anxiety.  You can look it up online, it is the passionflower.  Chamomile also has some clinical evidence but not as strong as passionflower.  So this isn't just a "feel good" tea--it is actually medicinal even though Traditional Medicinals can't say that or the FDA would land on them like a ton of bricks.  That's fine, just type passionflower in your favorite search engine.<br /><br />Beyond that this tea is a perfect addition to your nighttime ritual.  Having a bedtime ritual can help you fall asleep faster even if the tea itself does nothing at all.  I like to use the tea as a signal to my body and mind that the day is over and it is time now to relax and go to sleep.<br /><br />But please don't expect this tea to knock you out like an Ambien--it doesn't work that way.

review/summary: An Answer to our Prayers!
review/text: We are so glad we tried this formula!  My 11 month old daughter was having horrible diarrhea from antibiotics, so much so we had to change her clothes 6-8 times a day.  With the diarrhea came awful side-effects, such as severe diaper rash to the point where every diaper change was a screaming disaster.  We were all miserable until we found this.  After just 2 days her stools started firming up and came about half as frequent.  She had no problem making the switch, even though she had never had soy formula.  The only downsides are that it is a little more expensive than regular formula, only comes in ready to feed, and is somewhat hard to find.  I was able to find it in my local drugstore, but I noticed it was hit or miss as to if every chain carried it.  The ready to feed is not something to turn you away, as this is only meant to be a temporary formula during the diarrhea.  Once the diarrhea stops, you are suppose to transition/taper off this to the regular formula your infant/toddler is on.  Also, I noticed it gave my daughter some gas, but that was easily fixed with some gas drops.  FYI, I was able to purchase it for less than it is sold here, so I would look for it locally before committing to this price.  Overall, we are very satisfied customers and recommend this to everyone whos little one is suffering from persistant diarrhea.

Of course along with the diarrhea came the diaper rash, it was open and bleeding by the time we were sent to the ER by our pediatrician.<br /><br />The ER doc told us about Isomil DF, and gave us a 6 pack sample.<br /><br />Within 36 hours my son's stools were firming up and the diaper rash was beginning to subside.<br /><br />This stuff REALLY works. Now we use it whenever he goes on an anti-biotic as they give the little ones horrible diarrhea as well. It even works for this!!

review/summary: Works instantly
review/text: My three month old had been having severe diarrhea for over 2 weeks. Several tests were done at the ER (he also had some other issues) and we still had no answers. His pediatrician wouldn't even look at his diaper-- he said it was normal. No infection, no cold, no apparent cause. LO had been on Similac Advance since birth, and we had not changed it. His diarrhea just started out of the blue one day. We tried lactose-free, soy, organic Earth's Best, all with no results. Finally, we bought this stuff and gave it to him, hoping it would work, and it did-- instantly. The next poo he had was soft and yellow instead of brown water. Guessing it's the added fiber. The only problem is, it says on the bottle not to give it to infants under 6 months. I'm guessing that the nutritional value isn't the same as the other formulas? Also, we noticed that after 2 days of feeding him only this stuff that the tips of his poo were hardened. So now we were facing constipation. Tried half diarrhea and half advance in his next bottle and it worked like magic. His next poo was not too soft, not too hard. It's all a big experiment, and I'm slowing giving him less and less diarrhea stuff and more and more advance with each bottle. We will see how it goes.

review/text: My 6 month old had diarrhea caused by antibiotics for two weeks.  I could not find this in any stores so I bought it online from diapers(dot)com and it was at my house the next day.  One day after using it, the BMs were normal.<br /><br />I normally use Similac Advance (not Soy).  My son had no issues or complaints with switching.  I was surprised by the first three ingredients - water, corn syrup, and sugar - but I suppose that made it taste better.  I would be more concerned if this was his regular formula, but it was temporary and it did what it advertised.

review/text: I used it when my son caught a stomach virus and within two to three days, his stool was firm again. Right on the heels of that, though, he got an ear infection and had to go on antibiotics, which caused diarrhea and a terrible diaper rash.  Within few days of Isomil DF and some balmex, the diarrhea is not as bad as it would be without it. And my 9 month old (who was the biggest fan of breastmilk) LOVES the taste. I highly recommend.

review/text: I've been buying ribeye steaks at a nation-wide store which will remain nameless.  A steak is a steak, right?<br /><br />Hubby was dying to try Omaha steaks, so I bought him a box as a present.<br /><br />I cooked up two steaks - both ribeyes, one Omaha and the other from the store.  I cooked them both with steak dust, for the same time and the same temperature.<br /><br />The Omaha steak was like butter.  The difference was so obvious.  I can't believe that both steaks came from the same species.<br /><br />This is now a once-a-week dinner in our house.  It's not cheap, but it's still less than going out.  Add to the steak the Omaha stuffed potatoes and a nice salad and you've got a dinner that's every bit as nice as the average restaurant.<br /><br />Yeah.  They're worth it.

review/summary: Beware...this is not Pancake Syrup, despite the label!
review/text: My sister is diabetic and loves pancakes.  Most sugar-free pancake syrups are made with sorbital, which can cause extreme digestive system problems.  I found this product and thought we'd finally found something she could use, as it was made with splenda.  Watch out folks...this is not pancake syrup, despite what it says on the label.  It is a liquid flavoring that is added to coffee drinks.  It is watery, slightly sweet, and doesn't taste like maple syrup.  We were able to get a refund, but it was because the bottles we got were out of date, not because of the false advertising.  The seller, Beverage Gourmet, was absolutely disappointing in their handling of our problem. (The manufacturer, to our surprise, was very helpful but ultimately we had to deal with Beverage Gourmet).

review/text: This is in response to the previous commenter's complaints. I worked in a grocery store that sold spices and herbs in bulk and Frontier was our supplier. When you order 1 lb of any spice or dried herb, you are ordering in bulk. And that silver, non-resealable bag is how it is sold in bulk to stores. That is how they save money and those savings are passed down to you. Spice jars are easily purchased at most stores and you can re-use them many times. Frontier is a wonderful company and I have never had any problems with their products. The quality is outstanding and the taste cannot be beat.

It's a little spicy but not too hot.  It doesn't seem to get hotter the more you add.  It works great for chili.<br /><br />After pouring some of the seasoning out of the package into a seasoning dispenser using a funnel we fold the package over tight and close it with a close-pin.  The remainder stays fresh quite well that way.<br /><br />Overall my family is very pleased with it.  A dish that includes beans just isn't the same without it.

Pro-tip - if you go to the grocery store and get one of those precooked whole chickens - place a couple of thin slices of butter on top of the chicken and then sprinkle on this seasoning. Set oven to 375 - and the chicken will get crispy and brown and taste a way better than just eating it from the grocery store.

review/summary: greatest stuff ever
review/text: This seasoning is great.  I use it on chicken on the grill and it keeps the meat juicy and tender.  It has a wonderful taste.  I even use it on other meats, not just chicken.  But with chicken it is the best.  Would recommend this to anyone.  try it you will like it.  I use it on baked chicken in the oven as well.  almost like a shake and bake but better.  LOve it!!!!!!

review/summary: suits my purposes but not perfect
review/text: these diapers fit my pug perfectly. she was able to get out of them twice but for the most part it's not a problem. she doesn't mind wearing them. she barely acknowledges them. she is in heat; they are not as absorbent as they should be: i put a maxi pad in there and that problem is fixed. there's no way that, as they are, they would be sufficient for a dog with incontinence or who isn't housetrained. using a maxipad makes them practically reusable not disposable - i just change the pad. so if your dog is in heat, this is the product for you. if you need something more absorbent, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Saved our sanity
review/text: We have an incontinent 12-yr-old doggy and tried all kinds of solutions until we found these wonderful diapers. Although when full of pee these do slide off, we solve that with a second, cloth diaper (Simple Solution Washable Diapers) on top of the disposable one to hold it in place. The washable diapers couldn't handle a full load of pee, they leaked badly, whereas the disposable Wee Wee diapers just soak it all up with no leaking, so the combination is great.

review/summary: Save Your Money
review/text: I bought the medium size for my dog, picking the size recommended by the maker. It is a waste of money. The diaper often becomes unfastened, and it is not leak-proof. It provides no safety for your floors.

review/summary: Tim Tam dark chocolate cookies
review/text: Tim Tams are an icon in Australia.  Great cookies (they call them biscuits) now available in the US.  Do the "Tim Tam Slam" by biting off a tiny bite on each  end, dipping one end in coffee and sucking like a straw.  The coffee is absorbed by the cookie and the taste is wonderful!

review/summary: So yummy! Won't be disappointed! :)
review/text: I haven't been to australia, but I have heard of this from a youtuber "itsjudytime" and she reviewed these which got me to want to try these out because she made them look that good! Luckily i read a comment that they are sold at "cost plus world market"! I remember passing by one but never really had the curiousity to go check it out until now. Found one near by, and tada...there they were! Wasn't called Tim tams but arnott's was the one i found and to my surprise...3/4 of the boxes were gone, only 3 left so that tells me..it must be delicious! They were about $3.99 at the store and lucky I found them there or else pay for big fee of shipping (but then again, i suppose these would be worth the price for how deelish they are!) so check em out at your nearest world market! I made some hot chocolate and shabam....i was in heaven. I could only eat two in one sitting but if i could..i'd eat the whole thing :) I'll forsure am going to buy some more!
