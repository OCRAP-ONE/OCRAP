review/summary: HUUUUUUUUUGE!!!
review/text: This thing is gigantic!  My dog is 35 pounds and I thought this would be a good bone for her to last a while.  She can't even lift this monstrous thing!  She still likes it though.  Been working on it for about 3 months now and it is still the same size as when we bought it.  Recommended for very large dogs only.

review/text: I love Baby Ruth candy, but you won't catch me dead eating one of their monster bars (well, you might catch me dead after attempting to eat one).  Which is why I thoroughly enjoy BABY RUTH MINIATURE CANDY BARS.  Crunchy peanuts, nugget, chocolate, all rolled into a bite-size snack.  And best of all, no bloated feeling afterwards (unless you eat several, which is less than smart).<br /><br />It's the candy named after a baseball icon, and it darn sure stands the test of time.  And now it's made all the more enjoyable in miniature size.  BABY RUTH MINIATURE CANDY BARS. . .a great bite-size snack to satisfy that sweet tooth.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

If you find something they want to get it away from you fast and give you a small amount of money.  I didnt like how they handled it.  Customer service is really unsatisfying so dont bother.

My local store charges $3.99 per package so Amazon was a better deal, I didn't really need 6 packages of them, but I am sure my kids will eat them.  I left an open package on the kitchen counter and the next time I walked by my kids had eaten them all, they really love them too.

review/text: I love Stacy's Pita Chips- buy them all the time at grocery store so I know what they should look like and how they should taste. Unfortunately Amazon shipped them in the display box which was open when I received it. All of the chips are in a million pieces. (I also have to give kudos also to the FedEx guy who literally tossed the box on the front porch). Although the expiration date is two months away they taste stale- which makes me wonder how they were stored. I will continue to buy them at the grocery- fresh and whole! It's not Stacy's fault.

review/summary: Eight O'Clock French Roast Coffee and Amazon's Subscribe and Save a Winning Combination
review/text: We've enjoyed Eight O'Clock French Roast Whole Bean coffee daily for about ten years.  We love its bold taste and aroma, and, although we're not coffee connoisseurs, we've tried many different coffees and have not found any we like more at any price.  The only dilemma was when we moved we were unable to purchase the 36 oz. bag in our new location.  No store carries it in the 36 oz. size, only the smaller 12 oz. bag which was inconvenient since it would only last about a week, and was costly.  I had located on-line vendors, but they charged a premium price to what we were used to paying before we moved, and added shipping on top of that.  When traveling on business I used to buy a 3 to 4 month supply at a time to keep us in coffee.  Then I learned of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program and found it at a lower price than we've ever payed, and shipping is free.  So far we've received three shipments, two regularly scheduled monthly orders and one extra shipment that I ordered because we were going to run out before our regular order shipped.  Amazon even emails me to let me know when my regular order will arrive and allows me to delay a shipment or place an order early if running low. We couldn't be happier with the coffee or with Amazon's Subscribe and Save program.

review/text: While I love a good and robust Starbucks as much as the next guys, the Eight O'clock Coffee French Roast is my coffee of choice for the daily brew.  It has always arrived fresh and bold in the whole bean variety.  I grind it to a sufficient espresso roast, and then load up the coffee pot.  It makes a consistently good, smooth, and bold cup of Joe every day - at about half the cost of higher end brands.

review/summary: Wife exclaimed "You made really good coffee!"
review/text: I had purchased this brand at a local canned food warehouse store in the past, but not this flavor of beans.  I wanted to see if I could save money on Amazon for some coffee I could tolerate.  When I recognized the brand, and saw that the price was very good, I purchased the Eight O'clock French Roast Whole Bean, 36-ounce bag.<br />I'm pleased to say that the result was beyond my middling expectations.  These beans make a great cup of coffee.  We use a high quality burr grinder to get an even grind and a nice French press for some stronger coffee. The first day I made this in the morning, after weeks of a different brand, my wife said "You made coffee really good this morning!".

By using the subribe and save and grinding the beans myself then mixing a more expensive brand with the EIGHT o'clock that I ground at a ratio of 3 scoops to 1. I am then able to come up with a delicious cup of coffee at a fraction of the price that you would pay for a gourmet brand. By mixing the 2 I'm able to make my 36 ounce bag of coffee last from 1 arrival date to another. I am always asured of a great cup of coffee in the morning.

review/text: I read the 4+ star reviews and bought a bag, looking for a lower cost source for flavorful dark-roast coffee.  The coffee contains unripe beans, recognizable by their lighter color.  These 'quakers' (as they are known in the coffee trade) impart an off-taste to the coffee. It does not have a full-bodied french (dark) roast flavor.  The coffee beans are not well-selected, nor are they sorted after roasting to remove the unripe beans.  Overall, the beans do not exhibit much 'oily' character, and lack the full flavor I want in a dark-roast coffee.  Sorry, this was a disappointment and I will not be buying more.

review/text: I ordered this by mistake, as I have no grinder.  However, I was still able to use it all up (by beating the beans in a thick envelope with a rubber mallet each morning), good thing I don't have any neighbors!  The coffee was delicious.

review/summary: Tastes like the bag it came in
review/text: First off, I am not a coffee snob. I will drink a cup of gas station coffee as long as it doesn't taste like dirty dish water. I bought this product knowing that Eight O'Clock is not a high-end, artisan coffee. However, I was hoping that once ground, it would be somewhat palatable despite it's low price. Unfortunately, that was not the case. This coffee has no flavor, just a plastic, stale aftertaste. I'm not sure if there is an issue with quality control at Eight O'Clock, or if the beans are just extremely low quality. Either way, I would suggest spending your money on something else; there are other inexpensive brands that don't taste like a grocery bag in liquid form.

review/summary: Lacking
review/text: In the never-ending search for an inexpensive but really good coffee bean, we gave this a try. I read a lot of the reviews from people who said they weren't connoisseurs, but thought it was pretty good. I'm not sure if I qualify as a connoisseur (or if I want to), but it's not nearly as dark-roasted as I generally prefer my coffee, and more importantly, the taste --- no matter how strongly I try to brew it --- is just kind of weak. The search continues.

review/summary: Delicious French roast beans and great value
review/text: I started buying these years ago when an eminent consumer testing magazine, I believe Cook's Illustrated, did a taste test on French roast coffee beans and Eight O'Clock came out near or at the top, above pricier brands. The taste of French roast is important to me and when I tried this brand I agreed with the magazine taste test. To top it off, the price is right.

review/summary: Very mild tasting coffee
review/text: If you like your coffee to give you a strong rush of caffeine jolt with a dark roasted bitter taste (like most Starbucks), then this coffee may not be for you. If you like milder tasting coffee that has bit more aroma and taste, then this coffee may fill your needs. Starbucks this coffee isn't, and that isn't necessary a bad thing.<br /><br />I recommend everyone try this brand of coffee at least once. It was ranked #1 by one consumer magazine as the best coffee.<br /><br />I do like the taste of this coffee. Even though it is a French Roast, it tastes almost like a Hazelnut with very nutty flavor. The natural and pleasant flavor of the coffee isn't drown out by the bitter taste.<br /><br />The caffeine rush is also very mild and subtle. If you find yourself too hyper from drinking Starbucks, then this could be a good alternative brand.<br /><br />This coffee is also surprisngly affordable. It costs little over 1/2 of Starbucks coffee by weight.

review/summary: Can't be Exceeded
review/text: I was introduced to Eight O'Clock coffee brand over 40 years ago when my father and mother bought it.  It was a daily staple in our household.  Little did I know that this coffee was still being sold and of course, I snatched it up.  Being the french roast lover in my family was an added bonus.  I cannot say enough good things about this coffee.  Back over 40 years ago it was the cheapest coffee on the grocery shelf, but you could never tell it by its taste which exceeds the taste of some of he high end brands of coffee.  Eight O'Clock coffee is where its at and should be if you are a coffee lover looking for the best.  They just don't get any better than this and the added bonus is the cheaper price.

review/summary: Fine, Inexpensive.
review/text: My folks drank Eight O'Clock coffee the whole time I was growing up, so when I became a coffee drinker myself, it was an easy product to pick up.  Over time, I sampled all sorts of other roasters and varieties, sometimes finding something better, sometimes not, occasionally even switching my everyday brand of choice for a while.  Eventually, I always ended up with Eight O'Clock again simply for the value: I have not found a reasonably good-tasting coffee at a lower price.  If you're a regular consumer of coffee (our house makes a pot per day for sure, sometimes more), you've got to find the brand that fits all your minimum criteria, and for me, this is it.

Eight O'Clock is good but if you're looking for french roast this isn't it. This is a medium to dark, mostly medium, cup of joe that tastes like their old Bokar coffee from the A&P. I am mixing it with an espresso roast to have it be my morning coffee. Waste not want not.

If you put lots of sugar or flavored creamer in your coffee, this might be fine.  But if you drink your coffee with little cream or sugar, get a higher quality coffee.  If you French Press your coffee and love the ritual of making coffee, spend the money for better and fresher beans.

review/summary: Not very dark for a dark roast flavor...
review/text: No, the color in the bag I got looked more like Breakfast Blend, with a combination of light and dark roasted beans. Well, in the bag I got, there was even one GREEN coffee bean in there. It performs poorly, the brew color out of the auto-grind espresso machine I have quits rather too quickly. That prompts an adjustment to use less water, which means I have to do more brew cycles to fill a cup, three instead of two. That kinda kills the savings.<br /><br />This bean works very well for blended drinks, since the lighter flavor doesn't become overpowering when blended with ice, milk and sugar.<br /><br />I ate a few beans and they had this immature taste, not full-bodied coffee, like a burnt pinto bean taste. It seems like they got a supplier that includes a higher percentage of immature beans (not fully ripened when picked) which tens to roast into a lighter color than the rest. Either the picking machine's driver did not adjust to prevent picking the immature beans, or they decidedly had it set to increase yield at the sacrifice of the quality.<br /><br />Only using this one for iced coffee drinks.

review/summary: French Roast????
review/text: I've tried a couple of different French Roast coffees through Amazon. Cameron's Organic French Roast was by far the best but their prices have jumped considerably.<br />I've also tried Coffee Bean Direct French Roast Papua which was okay but had a different flavor for a french roast.  The moment I opened the Eight O'Clock French Roast I had a bad feeling since the beans were very light in appearance and not very oily at all.  I've been drinking it for a few weeks and it ranks with some inferior grocery store bulk varieties. If you love a good french roast in the mornings like I do then I suggest you look elsewhere.  I saw an article that mentioned that in 2010 it was highly rated by  Consumer Reports (or similar consumer guide) but they noted that in 2011, despite the  "new look, same great taste" ad at the top, the newer version was inferior. I'll keep looking for a good(not necessarily great) french roast at a reasonable price.

review/text: When I think of a hazelnut-flavored coffee drink, I generally think of the type produced by a barista with a syrup. By definition, my expectation of the Tassimo pod was therefore relatively low. To my pleasant surprise, the mild hazelnut flavor already emanates from the machine during the brewing process, and the result is a perfectly balanced cup of coffee with an intense but not overbearing hazelnut flavor.

review/text: I buy a lot of If You Care brand products & was very pleased to see they make environmentally friendly gloves.  I ordered them through the subscribe & save program thinking I wouldn't worry about household gloves again!<br /><br />I am so disappointed in these.  I am canceling the subscription with amazon.  The cotton flock lining is a joke.  I certainly cannot feel it.  The rubber is stiff & the fit is poor.  I ordered the size small & have to keep tugging them up because they are too long in the fingers.  They move down a bit making matters worse.  For some reason the pinkie finger in particular is way too long; more so than the extra length in the other fingers.<br /><br />My hands start to sweat in these pretty darn fast.  When I need to take them off, they don't come off easy despite the fact that they are too long/big.  I have to practically peel them off.  They are not comfortable.  The only thing to like about them besides being environmentally friendly is that they are a pretty cheerful green color.<br /><br />I am going back to my old gloves by Casabella.  I have yet to find a better pair of household gloves.  They fit well, last long & are very comfortable.  They also have more meat to them for protection when you are using really hot or cold water.  Don't try using the If You Care with scalding hot water!  Amazon sells Casabella & Casabella is what I recommend.

review/summary: One of the worst green teas I've ever tasted!
review/text: I had just recently ran out of green tea and the tea I usually get on amazon was no longer available, so I decided to give this one a try since it was 15% off with the gevalia discount + 15% off with subscribe and save. I made the tea and couldn't swallow more than one sip. It smelled horrible and had a really bad fake lemon-like taste. I forced myself to try it again, just in case it was just a one time thing, nope, still bad. I recommend you don't buy this tea, instead get yogi green tea. This green tea is bad quality and tastes atrocious. Plus, I can't return it to amazon since it is a grocery item...

review/text: This tea is not to my preference.  I am an avid tea drinker.  This tea is bitter and I would get a better brew by gathering the grass from outside that the gardeners blew over to the edge of the parking lot and throwing it into a pot of hot water.  I didn't taste any citrus in it.

review/summary: Try this tea if you don't like the taste of green tea
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for over 10 years now and it is some of the best green tea on the market. I had never liked the flavor of green tea but I was trying to drink it because of the health benefits but no matter how much I tried to drink regular green tea, I couldn't get it down because of the taste.  So I decided to order this flavor along with their other green tea flavor, Ancient Cherry, and now I can finally drink and enjoy green tea.  I steep the tea for 5 minutes for best flavor.<br /><br />The citrus flavor is light enough so that you know it is flavored but not so much that it overwhelms the tea.<br /><br />I recently bought some other brands of flavored green teas to try and save money but they just don't measure up to the Gevalia flavored green teas.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I had this first in Las Vegas, when I went for a trip.  I was so thirsty from walking around in the hot desert. When I went to a restaurant, Bouchon, they didn't have any lemonade. So, the waiter offered me this stuff... I wasn't sure at first. I thought it was a trick to get me to pay more money for something that is the equivalent of squeezed lemon in water with some sugar. BUT IT WAS SO GOOD. I had limonada everyday when I was in Vegas, everywhere that they offered it. I would demand to have a bottle of the good stuff.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when I came back to my natural habitat on the East Coast. I did not find any Limonada anywhere. When I tried to google for it, even that masterful search engine found nothing. Fast forward a couple months later, I go to a charity event. They offer as a giveaway to the people who attended drinks, sponsored by SAN PELLAGRINO. &lt;3  Heart be still!!!  It was my beloved Limonada in the US. In the north! Say what???<br /><br />Hoping that maybe limonada had somehow made its way to my cold region, I decided to try again my search. I looked online. BEHOLD Amazon, this retailer sells it in 6 packs! In the glass bottle! Straight from the bubbling springs of Italy. I purchased some right away. In didn't care if shipping was about double the price of the product. A few days later, these wonderful bottles made it's way to my refrigerator.<br /><br />I've been enjoying one a day. This supplier seems to have the best price so far of all the places I've looked. You can get a larger quantity for cheaper price per bottle. One retailer is selling it for $48 for free shipping for like a case with 48. However, if you want to try it out first, you might want to go with this listing. Currently, the price is $15 (including shipping & handling for 6 bottles). Not a bad deal for the most delicious bubbly lemonade in the world.

review/summary: Sophisticated and Delicate
review/text: When you compare the zesty Limonata Sparkling Lemon Beverage to other sparkly lemon beverages, you begin to realize the sheer perfection of the Limonata beverage by San Pellegrino. The balance of lemon, sparkle and zest takes this drink to the level of a gourmet beverage, which requires no mixing. I may have tasted this before, but recently ordered it while eating out at a Restaurant.<br /><br />San Pellegrino is also made with mineral water found near the town of San Pellegrino Terme which is located 70 kilometers northeast of Milan. The water flows from a thermal spring at the foot of a Dolomite mountain wall. The use of this water definitely adds to the energy this drink seems to possess.<br /><br />The carbonation seems more sophisticated and delicate. The only way to describe it is to say these waters are the champagne of sparkling waters.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

So we got this one since it compares itself to Wild Bill's.  I can't say that it tastes much like Wild Bill's, but I like it better!!  Even my "Only Wild Bill's will do" jerky-loving husband said this stuff was beyond good.  We may not bother with ol' Wild Bill as long as we can get this one.  Buffalo Bill's is good to, but so far this is my personal favorite!  Thin strips that are a bit "leathery" but so long as you have all your teeth no problem.  Heck, you could probably be missing a few teeth and still have no problem.  Last I checked, jerky is made for chewin!

With the Shake and Feed, just sprinkle some around everything you want to feed and turn on the water.

review/text: Using this with the regular Miracle Grow soil ends up damaging the plants. Well it did for mine anyway. The leaves quickly turned yellow, and brown and black spots developed on them. They looked like burn marks. A friend of mine told me it's because it's overfertilizing them and putting too much chemicals in the dirt. I then spent some time picking out as much of it as I could and eased up on the watering. The plants have gotten somewhat better. The leaves that were already starting to turn yellow before I did all that are now not turning yellow as fast. The look of it also kept throwing me off. Whenever I thought something was starting to sprout, it turned out it was just one of those little green pellets. So there's no need to use this stuff and I certainly won't use it anymore in the future.

My dog has not been sick up until I bought this bag of jerky on a whim in June.<br /><br />In late Aug I had to take him to the vet because he was suffering from diarrhea & fever of 106. They gave him fluids & medication which treated his gastrointestinal upset.  However, last night I brought him in for a check up and requested a blood test to see if his kidneys/liver were doing okay (since I was paranoid from the treats I had fed him). Results came back and he has inflammation in his liver (ATL), his liver enzymes are high (from the toxins that are in this jerky). Now I question EVERY PRODUCT THAT COMES FROM CHINA even if they were not recalled. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYTHING FROM CHINA.<br /><br />MUST READ CAREFULLY THAT THE FOODS ARE ACTUALLY MADE IN USA RATHER THAN PACKAGED IN USA.

I almost died when someone asked me and I took out the bag and there it was --- MADE IN CHINA.  I always thought Dogswell were in the USA so I'm very disappointed with that.<br /><br />With that said - the jerky treats seem like actual jerky.  We have a malti-poo with stomach issues and she doesn't digest them well.  So we do opt for the rice & lamb treats which seem to break apart and digest easier for her.  For instance, where I can snap a rice/lamp piece into smaller pieces with ease this Chicken breast jerky has to ripped and torn and it's stringy, almost like tendons in it.<br /><br />The dogs devour them though so I keep them for the little one and give the older MP the rice/lamb.
