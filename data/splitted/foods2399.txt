review/summary: wonderful, natural snack alternative
review/text: 80% organic (wheat flour is organic)...natural...all ingredients totally recognizable and pronounceable.  Competitively priced...I've found them from anywhere in the $2.29-$2.99 range.  Also, these taste FANTASTIC. If I hadn't gone on a special diet where I severely limited processed foods to root out an allergy, I never would have discovered the Annie's line.  Even though I no longer exclusively buy natural/organic products anymore, I preferred so many of the products I tried to the former brands I was buying that I now reserve that cupboard space for them...and as a result, the little bit of processed food I do bring into the house is about 75% organic or natural, give or take.  These have an incredible taste/texture....a few notches above goldfish crackers and worlds above cheeze its/nips.  I was very surprised.  Also, I am satisfied by about half a serving....I don't have the urge to sit there and eat the whole box, as delicious as they are. So while it's not exactly, health food, it's not addictive junk either.  It's a win-win all around.

review/summary: Convenient packaging for toddler on the go
review/text: My toddler son loves these cheddar bunnies and I'm pleased to be able to order these online and just have them delivered to my home. The only downside about the small package is that they are probably environmentally unfriendly but at least they don't get stale like the big boxes which I have to pour into his snack trap container.

review/summary: Fun, organic option to the ever present goldfish
review/text: Both my children love cheddar bunnies and so do I. Their cousins eat goldfish, which seem to pop-up just about everywhere. When possible, I prefer to buy organic items for my family, so I was extremely happy when I found cheddar bunnies!<br /><br />The snack size bags are perfect because my three-year-old is still learning about sharing. So it's great when both the boys can have their own bags. It's also handy when we're running out the door instead of looking for snack bags or little disposable bowls.<br /><br />The boy's friends are normally excited when I bring the cheddar bunnies out because it's something new and different, instead of the usual goldfish. One mom said "Bunnies, how cute!"<br /><br />Cheddar bunnies taste good, they're crunchy, and the ingredients are: Certified organic wheat flour, expelled pressed safflower oil, aged cheddar cheese (contains milk, salt, enzymes, cheese culture), salt, yeast extract, paprika, annatto extract (for color), ground celery seed, onion powder, yeast, safflower Oil or sunflower Oil.<br /><br />They do come in other flavors, whole wheat, sour cream & onion, and white cheddar. We like the original the best, followed by the white cheddar.

review/summary: Excellent snack
review/text: Cheddar Bunnies are just as good as any other cheesy snack cracker (like the fish ones) out there, except they're healthier.  The small snack packs are the perfect portion for a light snack, and great for car trips.  White cheddar bunnies are good as well, except I don't think they come in the individual snack packs, and they're much messier from the white cheddar cheese powder.  I LOVE other Annie's Homegrown products too, like the organic All Stars - a great alternative to Spaghettio's.  Highly recommended!!

review/text: The problem with Goldfish is that they're bland and tasteless.  These, I hoped, would fix that problem.  But, alas, it was not to be:  If anything, these are even blander and more tasteless.<br /><br />If you've got small children who like mild tastes due to their sensitive tastebuds, these are probably great.  But they're certainly no substitute for Cheez-Its, which remain the uncrowned king of cheesy snack crackers.<br /><br />And now that I've established that, I've got 35 packs of these left sitting in the cupboard, waiting...

However, at more than $2 a teeny little bag that is just way too expensive for our budget.  You could buy the regular size box for almost the same price and dole them out into your own baggies.

I told her that it makes everything taste amazing. I told her (exageration) that it probably would even improve icecream! She thought I was a little over the top... Then she tried it! She emailed me, "Oh my gosh! That is the most yummy spice I have ever tasted it probably would be good on icecream!"<br /><br />We joked and laughed about buying it in bulk and giving jars away for Xmas presents. Our friends and family would be indebted to us because we would be their only conection to get more.(Because it isn't sold in very many stores. So excited to find it available on Amazon.

review/summary: This product misses on many levels
review/text: First there is no information on the label about how much curcumin is actually in the product.  How do you know how much you are getting?  Second, this has to be about the worst tasting drink I've ever had.  It is truly horrible.  If it tastes this bad, why bother putting it in a drink?  Third, all of the curcumin is on the bottom of the bottle.  It settles out quickly, if you don't keep shaking it and drink it quickly (hard when it tastes so bad) a lot of the curcumin is left on the bottom of the bottle.  I find it interesting that they say, "Specifically formulated for excellent absorption".  This is just marketing BS.  There is nothing in this product (read the ingredients) that does anything to increase the absorption of curcumin.  Curcumin typically has very low absorption, and this formulation really has nothing, and does nothing to improve it.  While I applaud the inclusion of beneficial curcumin in the drink, the execution of the Haldi drink is severely lacking.  Mystery amount of curcumin (why?), horrible taste and consistency, and the curcumin ingredient keeps coming out of the drink without constant agitation.  Much more pleasant, easier, and cheaper to just take a curcumin supplement capsule.

review/summary: Really, REALLY black!
review/text: I read the previous reviews of AmeriColor's Super Black icing coloring and decided to give it a try to make my daughter's zebra-striped birthday cake. I wanted a black that I could use without having to start with chocolate icing (birthday girl does not like chocolate!). It turned snow-white marshmallow fondant BLACK, with very little of the gel and no noticeable taste difference. I was afraid that the coloring would leave my hands purple or blue, but the only place I noticed a stain was where I touched the full-strength coloring directly--once I mixed it in with the melted marshmallow before mixing the powdered sugar in to make the fondant, there were not problems with stains. I can't say if it would stain stone counters, though--I was not brave enough to test it on my granite, and so I kneaded the fondant on wax paper. Like other reviewers, I was a Wilton fan for years, but love this new alternative and will definitely be using AmeriColor from now on.

My son was happy so even if I wouldn't eat the final product, I'd say it was a success.

review/summary: Would Definitely Recommend!
review/text: Ok, now I understand why so many people online recommend using AmeriColor brand for my icing and fondant-coloring needs. I bought the black, and the color was super strong. Worked really well. I'll probably buy one of their color kits now that I know it's a great brand.<br /><br />The only thing I haven't tried yet is using it to color melted chocolate - I've been told that water-based dyes like this one will make the chocolate crumble. But *shrug* it doesn't hurt to try. I will give an update when I do!

review/summary: Be aware that the photo is NOT what you will get
review/text: I finally received the color that I ordered - there was a mixup on the seller's end, but they did<br />get right on it and send out the right color.  I have not used it yet - I bought it for special cupcakes<br />for an event in a few days. I'll add to the review when we have actually used the product.<br /><br />I did want to mention, though, for those who think this might be a really great deal - the bottle<br />you see in the photo is NOT the bottle you are purchasing. You are getting one of the very small (under 3" tall)<br />drop bottles, not one of the large ones shown in the photograph. I wanted to point that out, because for people who<br />are only looking at the photos, it is misleading. Not sure why some sellers feel the need to be sneaky, but<br />I guess they try for more sales that way.<br /><br />I'll be back to review the actual gel once we are done with the project.<br />Just don't expect the big bottle when you purchase from this listing.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Well, I am now a HUGE fan of the gel coloring!<br />It worked like a dream, gave us a beautiful frosting that looked like black leather (but soft).<br />No purples or blues, no weird shades - just great color.<br />Now I will probably have to get more colors, because with these, I might start decorating cupcakes again!<br />I am adding a photo of our cookout cupcakes that we used the frosting for... it all looked great!

review/summary: Meth
review/text: I used this to make rocky candy as meth for a costume prop. I dressed as Hiesenburg from Breaking Bad. It does work, I used two drops, but you have to be careful. Because boiling sugar, corn syrup and hot water makes a yellowish color, adding too little, too much or stirring too much can change to a green color. Took me three tries (first Americolor Sky Blue, second McKormick Neon Blue and third Americolor Sky Blue again), but I got it eventually.

review/summary: Best Coffee Ever
review/text: The Hawaiian Isles Kona Coffee Co.'s Chocolate Macadamia Nut Kona Coffee is hands down the BEST coffee I have ever tasted.  It is a rich, dark, and exceptionally smooth brew that makes one want to keep making another pot of coffee.  It is that good. I've been craving it ever since I was given a trio of coffees from Hawaiian Isles Kona Coffe Co., and unfortunately have not had it since.  The other two coffees I had were exceptional as well...one was the Sunrise Blend and it was delicious too, but I am partial to the Chocolate Macadamia Nut.  My advice is to buy, and enjoy!

review/summary: My poodle loves them!
review/text: For some reason my miniature/toy poodle loves fishy foods (especially sneaking into the cats food), so I was excited to find these fish recipe sticks. Made in USA is a huge must for my dogs treats after the Chinese treat issues, and I was happy to find this company offers that. My poodle is about 8lbs and this lasted her about 1/2-1 hour of chewing. More known brands (those you would find in every grocery store) usually get abandoned by my dog after a couple minutes when she realizes she doesn't care for the taste.<br /><br />An issue I've had with other products and my dogs are upset tummys if they eat too much. These sticks have caused no issues at all!<br /><br />I greatly recommend this product for those who care about quality.

review/summary: Best Iced Tea EVER!
review/text: I was looking for something healthy to replace my horrible addiction to soda. One day at my college, Steaz Iced Teaz were being put into a new healthy vending machine. I asked to try the Blueberry, Pomegranate & Acai flavor because the gentleman said it was his best seller. I certainly know why! The taste is great, it is a very refreshing drink and it has less than half of the calories, carbs, and sodium as a soda. I love this stuff and now I make sure to have it in my house at all times. When I'm going to leave, I bring some with me. I highly recommend Steaz Iced Teaz.

review/summary: Perfect iced tea flavor!  Lower sugar!  It's about time!
review/text: We are overdosing on high sugar (especially high fructose corn syrup, which is bad for your health) foods these days. Americans are experiencing record epidemics with diabetes and obesity. It's about time some companies are coming out with low, or lower sugar beverages (or in this case, with cane juice) to give people a fighting chance with their health. I am also thankful that this product does not contain any artificial sweeteners (which are also bad for your health; please read 'Sweet Deception' by Dr. Joseph Mercola- a phenomenal book). This iced tea tastes very good, without too much sugar overpowering the tea flavor. Excellent product!

You really taste the blueberry flavor.  I have stopped drinking sodas and have gone to drinking Steaz teas.  The peach and lime-pomogranate are very good as well.  Try picking one up at  your local grocery store to see if you like it, then go to Amazon and buy by the 12 pack for a better deal.

review/summary: low sugar but also low flavor
review/text: I find that most pre-bottled teas are too sugary and for that reason I decided to try these Steaz.  The amount of sugar in these is pretty close to perfect BUT there is barely any flavor in this tea.  Tastes like water with a slight hint of some blueberry taste.  I could understand lowering the sugar but with no flavor I might as well drink bottled water.  ALso the top of every can is stained with spilled tea and covered with dirt, kinda gross and a pain in the ass to have to wash it off before you drink each one.

review/text: I'm one of those people who has mysteriously developed a wheat intolerance with age and can no longer eat many "normal" foods.  I love barley and buy a lot of it, but pearled barley takes about 45 minutes to cook.  Sometimes I hit the kitchen and I need something fast, something that feels substantial and yet comforting.<br /><br />Dari Barley Couscous, from box to plate, takes less than 10 minutes to prepare. (NOTE: Ignore the package directions for amount of water, salt, and oil.  Use twice as much water as couscous.  Boil water, pour over couscous, let sit for 4 minutes. Fluff with fork, microwave 2 minutes, done.  Add butter or oil, salt, pepper, cheese, whatever, after it's finished.)<br /><br />I've been making a luscious gluten-free, low-glycemic Greek-style salad with it - barley couscous, grilled chicken breast, cherry tomatoes, feta cheese, Kalamata olives, lemon juice/olive oil/oregano dressing. One batch of it makes about five or six great summer meals. Keeps in the fridge for up to a week... if it lasts that long.<br /><br />Please get this back in stock, Amazon!

review/summary: Have a spot of tea !
review/text: I seem to have entered my green tea "wave".<br />After years of only black tea, then white, oolong and green tea, I have discovered the loose fruit flavored green tea mixes sold by Teavana, which are delightful. Teavana makes tea drinking a pleasure with all the available accoutrements and utensils.<br /><br />This green tea mix is flavored with apple pieces, hibiscus flowers, rosehip peels, blackberries, and blackberry flavoring, raspberries, plum pieces, cactus blossoms and spearmint and is called Blackberry Mojito.<br /><br />Fruitmixes are nothing new in the tea world, but Teavana's product is most fresh in the vacuum sealed pouches and has a wonderfully delicious fruity fragrance. However as an infusion, I found its slight astringent tartness somewhat objectionable, which most likely stems from the rosehips peel. Perhaps other people prefer this. If compared to the Lipton fruit flavored green and white tea bags, which are available now, and look like little pyramids, I have to say that I do prefer their taste, but as a potpourri Blackberry Mojito is the winner.

review/text: It's hard to buy tea from company that you never bought from belofe. I decided to take a plunge and was very pleased. The leaves are as black as they come and when rehydrated, they become brown. They are also quite large, at least 3mm side and 6-7mm long (which speaks of quality).<br /><br />The tea comes in those brown bags but inside they are nicely lined and have ziploc like airtight closure. Very well thoughtout, in my view.<br /><br />I found the flavor to be deep and mind. Color is excellent. I brew 2qt pitchers, so i can really see the gorgeous color. Overall, very impressed.

review/summary: A healthier dessert alternative
review/text: Chocolate flavored granola, with dark chocolate chunks and dried red straweberries and raspberries?  That's what "Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries" offers you.  Below are my impressions on this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It's tasty.  I've eaten a fair amount of granola in my life, and flavoring it with chocolate actually makes it seem less granola-like, which is a good thing, if you know what I mean.  The granola has a nice chocolate flavor, not too strong and not too sweet.<br />- It's certified organic.  While I'm admittedly not an "all natural" kind of consumer and don't typically shop at organic food stores, I will buy (and pay more for) organic products when given a choice, provided they offer a similar taste.<br />- There are enough dark chocolate chunks to be noticible when you're eating, and they add to the positive experience<br /><br />Cons:<br />- There aren't enough dired red berries. While you can see a few small pieces in the mix, you can't readily taste them.<br />- It's a little high in calories, so portion control is essential if you're going to use this as part of your healthy eating patterns. An 11 1/2 ounce bag contains 10 servings, and each serving has 140 calories, about 40 percent is fat.  One or two servings at a time is fine, the whole bag is not.  :-)<br /><br />Overall, this is a good, tasty treat that is much better for you than cookies or ice cream and the like.  Just be sure to watch how much you eat.  Four starts.

review/summary: Good taste but too high calorie
review/text: This granola tastes really good.  It doesn't have enough berries nor pieces of chocolate but the flavor is not too overwhelmingly sweet.  The serving is 1/4 cup and has 140 calories.  I am not sure I'll be satisfied with just 1/4 cup since it tastes pretty good.  I shouldn't be surprised about the amount of calories considering that some of the ingredients have a high caloric number anyways, like: soy oil, spelt, choco chunks, flax seeds, and dried coconut.<br /><br />It does taste very good and it is organic.  It really makes a good snack and it's not too dry, just watch your calorie count.

review/summary: Wicked Good
review/text: A few years ago another company *koffkashikoff* introduced a chocolate granola which was so good and so addictive that a friend of mine began calling it "Satan Cereal," a name that has caught on with the rest of us.  So when Nature's Path Love Crunch came along, I had to try it and I can report that the bottom line is that it's pretty close in flavor and texture to Satan Cereal, though I think Love Crunch is marginally sweeter.  In other words, it's wicked good.  So with all things being equal in the taste department, who wins on points?<br /><br />Love Crunch contains a freeze-dried berry mix that the other brand doesn't.  It also has small squares of dark chocolate in the mix and both are pretty darn tasty.  It's an organic cereal, for those who feel that's important.  And the company that makes Love Crunch -- Nature's Path -- is donating money and food to food banks for every bag of Love Crunch that you buy.<br /><br />The nutritional facts, however, aren't quite as positive.  First off, a serving of Love Crunch is 1/4 C.  Measure that out; that's a very, very small amount of cereal, and possibly not enough to start your day on.  If you're snacking on the cereal, okay, but as the central focus of the most important meal of the day?  It's a little thin.  By comparison, the other cereal is a 1/2 C serving which is more realistic, and so I'm going to make a side-by-side nutritional comparison based on 1/2 C of each cereal or a double serving of Love Crunch vs a single serving of the other cereal.<br /><br />At half a cup, Love Crunch (Hereafter referred to as LC) weighs in at a whopping 280 calories compared to 230 calories for the other cereal (Hereafter referred to as OC.) OC has 80 calories from fat, LC has 110.  LC wins on sodium @ 110 mg vs OC's 140 mg per serving.  Where OC really pulls ahead is in the dietary fiber sweepstakes with a whopping 7 grams of fiber to LC's 4 grams.<br /><br />Finally, if you buy from Amazon.com, LC will cost you $0.33 per ounce vs LC's $0.30 per ounce.  As you can see, in terms of price and nutrition, there's not that much to choose between the two cereals, so if you favor the flavor of one over the other, I'd say stick to it.  Since I love both, I'm going with the slightly cheaper, slightly less sweet one that has a bit better nutritional profile on a reasonable-size serving.  If you're able to get by on 1/4 C and like your cereals on the sweeter side, then by all means, choose Love Crunch. Either way you'll be looking at a tasty morning meal.

review/text: Granola, chocolate, and berries make for a very enticing combination.

review/summary: Dangerously good
review/text: This granola is almost too good.  The oat clusters are mostly all in the 1/2 inch range and they taste exceptionally good - definitely a natural, homemade taste.  The chocolate pieces in the granola are outstanding.  They are actually really good tasting semi-sweet dark chocolate, not artificial tasting at all, and there are a lot of them.  The only thing that I could say was slightly disappointing is that there weren't very many berries in our bag.  It may have just been this particular bag, but I definitely wish there had been more of them because they were just as delicious as the oats and the chocolate.<br /><br />I don't think you can go wrong in purchasing this for any occasion.  We ate it right out of the bag, but I can imagine it would be just delicious in yogurt, over ice cream or with milk for breakfast.

review/summary: yum
review/text: This is great plain or in a bowl with milk (and it didn't get soggy when I ate it as cereal).  More chocolate and berries would push this into a 5-star granola.  At first I thought my package was somehow missing the chocolate and berries because they'd all settled to the bottom and there weren't very many to begin with.  I was much happier with my second serving that included more of the perfectly sized mini-chocolate bars and the tiny bits of freeze-dried strawberries and raspberries.  I loved the flavor of the chocolate, but the berries weren't too noticeable given how small they were.

review/summary: Delicious "Dessert-like" Granola
review/text: Oh Holy Granola, Batman! This granola is basically dessert. It has granola that is basically lightly covered in cocoa, mini dark chocolate bars, and freeze dried strawberries and raspberries. The granola pieces are mostly pretty pulverized (possibly a result of the product coming in a bag, but the pieces are pretty small regardless), but there are some larger chunks of granola. The cocoa flavor on the granola is not overwhelming or overly sweet, but rather just a perfect amount of flavor added. The miniature chocolate bars are a delightful addition and a wonderful little treat when you get to them. I didn't have much opinion on the strawberries and raspberries, though; they didn't really taste like much other than chocolate once all was said and done. I don't like my granola in milk, so I just ate it by the handful and in some yogurt and thought it was great both ways. The other day I took a snack bag full of it to work for a snack.<br /><br />I love the fact that the company matches sales with donations to food banks up to $1 million. It is nice to see globally conscious companies trying to help the world fight hunger. Add that to yummy granola and you have me as a loyal customer! (PS Now I have to hide it from my husband or he eats it all and I get none... never had to fight him for granola before!).

review/text: This will be a pretty short review.  This granola is simply delicious.  It's full of relatively healthful stuff and also has dark chocolate and strawberry bits in it.  The milk turns a chocolaty brown color when added.  I could probably eat an entire bag in one sitting, it's that good.<br /><br />It's also cheaper than the regular price of some of the store brands, which have larger boxes but often a lighter weight.  This granola is seriously yummy.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Not quite Premium
review/text: If you love granola, you'll love this cocoa-flavored one from Nature's Path.  It has a very nice cocoa intensity and chunky pieces of dark chocolate.  It's also not cloying in sweetness, which I find off-putting in some granola. It contains some pieces big enough to snack on but it's also lovely with milk.  However, the red berries are almost non-existent.  I've eaten half the bag already and only gotten 3 measly pieces of spongy strawberry that were smaller than green peas. I can barely taste it.  For almost $4 a bag, I expect to see red berries when the package says red berries.  It would have been perfect otherwise.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- delicious<br />- made of whole grains, 0 g. of transfat, low sodium, cholesterol-free<br />- certified organic and non-GMO (made in a kitchen, not a lab)<br />- Nature's Path promises to donate up to $1 million dollars to food banks for every bag of Love Crunch bought.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- not nearly enough red berries<br />- a bit pricey<br />- serving size is a minuscule 1/4 cup but has 140 calories and 55 of those from fat<br />- produced in a facility that uses dairy, peanuts, and tree nuts so people with allergies - beware!

They produce mostly organic products that are made with healthy, natural ingredients.<br /><br />This granola is pretty sweet, so it would definitely not be recommended as cereal with milk in the morning.<br /><br />It's made up of mostly oat clusters with a chocolate flavor, with bits of dried berries mixed in. It's got a great texture, and biting into the pieces of dark chocolate is obviously the best part!

review/text: My wife doesn't like chocolate, but she likes granola. I love chocolate and I'm fine with granola. Here's a granola snack we can agree on. She tasted it and pronounced it "pretty good." I'm a big fan of chocolate bars with add-ins, like bacon or fruit or chili, so chocolate with berries is right up my alley. I like it, and I don't have to feel guilty when I eat it. Now if I can just get our 5-year-old to try some, I can share the whole family's opinion.

review/summary: Satisfying Crunch
review/text: Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries = Good stuff.  I like granola on occasion (not on a daily consumption basis).  Usually I buy a local brand that has nuts and raisins and chocolate bits in it.  The variety I am reviewing here has cocoa, chocolate bits and some freeze-dried strawberries and raspberries.  It's good out of the bag and should be a nice treat on top of yogurt or ice cream.<br /><br />The price per ounce is quite a good value and less than what I pay here at the store.<br /><br />It's not sweet.  I would say the dominant flavor is the oats, and they are listed number one in ingredients, with evaporated cane juice, soy oil, spelt, dark chocolate chunks, flax seeds, dried coconut, cocoa, freeze-dried berries, rice starch, sea salt, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor and tocopherols (Natural vitamin E) following.  I'm not a health-food nut, so I cannot comment on any of the ingredients.<br /><br />I could not taste the coconut.  I could taste the cocoa slightly, especially with the first taste.<br /><br />I would have to say, though, that after naming their product flavor as "Dark Chocolate and Red Berries," the manufacturers were too stingy with the berries.  The berry bits are too small, too few and too far between.  Any granola needs something to liven it up.<br /><br />I would recommend this product.  Add more berries and it would even better.

The serving size is listed as � of cup.  It is 140 calories per serving.  It contains 14 grams of whole grains per serving.  I'm trying to incorporate more whole grains into my diet and this is a great way to do this.

review/text: Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries 11.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I haven't had granola in quite a while. The calorie count for the amount, perceived or real, is on the high side. This product is 140 for � cup at just over an ounce. I don't tend to measure my cereal. I use bowls with known capacity. Larger bowls for the puffy type cereal, smaller bowls for the dense cereals. Well even my smallest bowl make � cup look puny. Grape Nuts runs into that same problem. That said, it's a delicious cereal or snack.<br /><br />The clusters have a great taste and nice bite. They hold up to milk well, but will sog out if you're a slow eater. I'm not, and they stay crunchy-bity throughout my meal. I like the bits of chocolate and freeze dried berry in the mix. I do wish there was more berries but other than that this is good stuff. The ingredients list doesn't have any red flags to my knowledge. No weird oils of unnatural stuff. Still it's a high calorie treat if you don't measure carefully. But who's really looking, enjoy!

review/summary: Tasty, ethical...could use more raspberries
review/text: I've never met a combination of dark chocolate and raspberries that I didn't like, and Love Crunch does not disappoint. This new Nature's Path blend is a really tasty combination of sweetened rolled oats, tart freeze-dried strawberry and raspberry bits, and chunks of high quality dark chocolate. The granola is not too sweet, perfectly crunchy, and ideal for eating straight out of the bag, on top of yogurt, or even ice cream. For whatever reason, it doesn't seem to chew up the roof of my mouth the way other granolas have in the past. I do wish there were more berries -- good thing the granola has plenty of character and flavor on its own. Each 30g serving has 14g of whole grains and a modest 6g of sugars (the 'evaporated cane juice' listed second in the ingredients is basically sugar, by the way).<br /><br />If you're the crunchy type (and I am), you'll be glad to know that Love Crunch is certified organic and has a very clean ingredient list. I'd love it even more if the bag were recyclable / compostable and the chocolate were fair trade, but am happy to find that Nature's Path donates to food banks for every bag purchased, up to $1 million. I'm not usually a big granola eater, but I'd happily buy more Love Crunch.

review/summary: Very tasty, but not as chocolately as expected
review/text: This granola is great -it has a fun theme (raspberries and chocolate), nice packaging, a delicious taste, and an inviting crunch.<br /><br />It didn't have a high chocolate ratio (as I might have expected with the packaging), but when considering that this product really is trying to be granola, and not a candy crunch dessert (like a chocolate covered granola bar), then it is fine.  The chocolate bits were small squares, and they seemed to be of good quality (and not chalky like some cheaper candies).<br /><br />I was impressed with the maker of this product, Nature's Path, and I will definitely be seeking out their other creations.<br /><br />Oh yeah, three more things to like: it contains flax seeds (which are one of the best way to get Omega-3 oils without eating fish), it is completely organic, and the company gives an equivalent amount of food to food banks for every product purchased.  If this is true it gives me one more reason to like them.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.

My problem is not knowing when to stop eating it, I finished this off (myself) in two days, 98% of the granola I ate straight out of the bag. I tried a handful tossed in low fat vanilla yogurt, not quite as good as eating it plain IMHO.<br /><br />One thing you need to watch - if you order this in hot weather, the chocolate will melt; it was 74 degrees the day this arrived, not really all that hot, and when I opened the bag it was pretty messy from the melted chocolate.

Not that I eat only junk, but in my experience a lot of things that are labeled as health food simply don't taste edible.<br /><br />I was very skeptical that this granola would be healthy and delicious, but I was wrong! How good is Love Crunch? I had to pry it away from my kids AND my husband just to get a taste!!<br /><br />What sets Love Crunch apart is two things: the fruit bits and the chocolate bits. The chocolate is delicious! Dark chocolate pieces that taste as chocolate should. Very yummy! The fruit pieces shocked me because many of them are tiny, but they pack a huge punch when you put one in your mouth.<br /><br />The only downside to this bag is that both my husband and I wished for more chocolate and more fruit pieces. The granola was delicious, however, and almost tasted like it was a crunchy no-bake chocolate cookie that had been smashed up.<br /><br />We were definitely surprised by this granola and are going to be ordering more!

review/summary: Delicious Granola From a Good Company
review/text: Before opening the bag, I read the back and I like what I read. Organic and non-GMO from a company that gives back.<br /><br />That's a good start, but means nothing if the resulting product is inferior. Nature's Path got this one right. This is one of the best granolas I've tasted! The clusters and loose bits of granola have nice crunchy chocolate flavor without being overpowering. The real chocolate bits are of a good quality, and while small, they compliment the crunchy bits perfectly. The only minus is that the freeze-dried red berries are few and far between, and the bits that are there are small.<br /><br />I snacked on it dry and mixed it with yogurt, so it lasted for almost two days. With my morning yogurt alone I might get four servings from a bag, but as a snack I would say there was one serving per bag. It's that addicting. They don't even need the "Best By" date on the back of the bag...it will never last that long!<br /><br />I feel that, at just under four bucks a bag here on Amazon as of this writing, this is a guilty pleasure I can indulge in now and again.<br /><br />Final Score: 4.75 (Rounded up to 5)

The strawberries didn't do much for me but that's ok. The only thing I didn't like was that more than half of the granola on the bottom of the bag was crushed and no longer in bite size pieces. This may have just been from all of the shipping though. Overall very good, tastes great.

review/text: I love, love, love this granola.  It tastes so sinful, but it's actually good for you.  (But one caution, a serving size of � cup is 140 calories, and it's easy to get carried away eating this!) It's the perfect snack for when your sweet tooth is acting up.  The granola itself has a hint of cocoa and a soft whisper of coconut which is tasty, but not overpowering.  The berries add a tiny bit of tartness that balances well with the sweet richness of the chocolate.  I did wish that there had been more dark chocolate chunks, but this is more reflective of my own chocolate addiction than any deficit in the product.  It's delicious eaten plain, but would also be great over ice cream or yogurt.<br /><br />I also really like to know that I'm eating something from a company that grows organically, and donates to food banks with each purchase.

review/summary: One of the best tasting granolas I have tried (dark chocolate and red berries)
review/text: Received the dark chocolate and red berries version. From a nutritional standpoint it was a good choice having very low sugar amounts compared to a lot of granola and cereal products (6 grams). The fat content is up a bit a 6 grams as well but only 1 of those is saturated. Everything is listed as being organic and chemical free.<br /><br />Tastewise this version is outstanding. In milk it reminds me of chocolate oatmeal christmas cookies. The chocolate chunks taste great and the berries are slightly noticeable and add great flavor. This is by far the best bagged granola I have ever tried and I go through a lot (I like to put them in plain greek yogurt as well as in milk).<br /><br />It is priced very competatively as well.<br /><br />Fat: 6g (1g saturated, 3g poly unsaturated, 1.5 grams monunsaturated)<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 55mg<br />Potassium: 105mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 20g (Fiber 2g, Sugars 6g)<br />Protein: 2g

review/summary: Real berries and real chocolate - delicious!
review/text: I fell in love with Love Crunch at the first bite!  I have had many flavored granola products and some even contained bits of berries, but I have never before had one that contained whole dried berries as well as actual chunks of chocolate.  The taste was so great that I was absolutely sure it had to be terrible for me, but that isn't the case at all.  For Dark Chocolate and Red Berries blend, the serving size is 1/4 cup and each serving has 140 calories (55 from fat), 6g fat (1g saturated), 0mg cholesterol, 55mg sodium, 105mg potassium, 20g carbs, and 2g protein.  It felt very decadent on yogurt or even just eaten alone.  Altogether it was an excellent treat!

review/summary: Yummy snack with everything I want...
review/text: Love Crunch is just delicious. Granola bits with dried strawberries and chunks of chocolate -- I don't know really how healthy it is, but it makes an excellent snack. Forgot breakfast? Love Crunch. Have coffee but nothing to eat with it except dried apricots? Love Crunch. Need something to keep in your car so you don't starve during a day at school? Love Crunch.<br /><br />I would caution against using it as a cereal, though. I tried, with Soy Milk, and it tasted pretty good at first, but you've got to be quick because once those strawberries get wet... they just don't taste very good. The texture is a bit slimy. Of course you can pick out the strawberries and throw them in as you go.<br /><br />Trying it with ice cream is certainly going to be my next step, though yoghurt sounds pretty good too. The combination of elements makes the treat interesting, you get soft and chewy, slight bitter slight sweet, fruity and chocolate. It's one of the best dried snacks I've had.

review/summary: incredibly tasty snack
review/text: For something 'organic' and 'granola', this seems much too good and tasty to be healthy for you.  The granola has a great, chocolate taste without being too sweet, as well as a satisfactory crunch to it without being too hard on the teeth.  I'd say that Nature's Path did indeed come up with a 'unique marriage of taste and health' with this blend - everyone I had try it loved the flavor!  There are nice sized chunks of yummy dark chocolate in the tasty granola, and the only complaint I have about this blend is the red berries - I don't know if it's the bag I received or not, but they were a bit missing compared to everything else, just a few tiny pieces here and there.  Yet the granola is still delicious and I didn't really feel it lacking for their tiny presence (the chocolate more than made up for them), just be aware if you're hoping for nice big chunks in yours.

review/summary: Nature's Path Love Crunch
review/text: I think the makers of this granola intended to have this be cereal, but I ate it as snack. This product is delicious and lower calories than most granola. The dark chocolate gives the crunch just enough sweetness. The berries don't really add a lot of flavor. I also used this with yogurt which was yummy. I think the dark chocolate bites really preclude this from being a breakfast cereal for most adults, but I am sure some will find this much more appetizing than other grains.<br /><br />For the price, this a good value and as I said the 3.5 g of fat per serving is lower than most granola.  The manufacturer is also donating proceeds to food banks. So besides being organic, good to eat, there is also a charitable element to buying this food.<br /><br />I know I will buy more of it.

review/summary: Contains real freeze-dried berries.
review/text: Unlike other berry-flavored cereals, this organic granola from Nature's Path contains real freeze-dried strawberries and raspberries.  There is no weird artificial aftertaste or sticky sweetness associated with added flavors.  The dark chocolate bits are visible and melt slowly in your mouth and if taken with milk melt easily to make a slightly chocolate-y milk.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Organic<br />+ real freeze-dried berries<br />+ real dark chocolate<br />+ No artificial flavorings<br /><br />Cons:<br />- product breaks easily during shipment, leaving lots of tiny bits and small clusters.<br />- Pricey<br />- chocolate could melt easily during shipment during hotter months.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for those who like real berries (and hate artificial berry-flavor) and real dark chocolate.

review/summary: Really Good in Oatmeal!
review/text: I'm normally not a fan of dark chocolate, but this granola is really understated and not the least bit bitter.  It's also not the type of granola that's so sharp and hard that it could sandpaper a wall!  It's crunchy, yet breaks apart easily while chewing and is really satisfying and delicious.  I'm not sure about buying 6 packs at a time, as packaged here on Amazon.  But I really liked it and would probably pick up a bag here and there at my local grocery store.  Definitely interested in the other flavors too.  Wish Amazon offered a variety pack instead; 2 bags of each of the 3 flavors.  Now that's something I would buy for sure.  We love it in our morning oatmeal -- YUM! :oD

review/summary: Yummy, though the serving size is rather small
review/text: I like to eat granola as a snack and this granola is delicious. At 1/4 cup for a serving size, it's far too easy to eat more than one serving size. A serving has 140 calories (calories from fat is 55); 6 g of fat of which 1 g is saturated fat; dietary fiber is 2 g and sugar is 6 g.<br /><br />The oats are sweet, but not overly sweet. I loved the dark chocolate and the berries were nice and tart and the mix of chocolate, berries, and granola is perfect. I would have liked more berries (strawberries and raspberries) as the pieces are very small (or maybe larger pieces) but overall this is great granola.

review/summary: Really yummy. Needs more berries.
review/text: This granola is really quite good. In fact, it may be one of my favorite commercial granolas (sometimes I buy, sometimes I make my own) and it may be my new go-to brand when I do buy granola. It's rich and full of flavor and not overly sweet. The sweetness level is perfect (and the sugars weigh in at 6 g per serving, which isn't too shabby for granola - sometimes it can be loaded with sugar). The chocolate is dark and rich (my favorite kind) and the berries are a nice addition. So why not 5 stars? Well, the berries are my only gripe - there aren't enough of them! I snagged some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JLT66M">Just Tomatoes Organic Just Strawberries, 1.2 Ounce  Pouch (Pack of 4)</a> to mix in and now it's perfect. I know those berries are pricey, so I get it, but it does feel a little lacking.<br /><br />I would like to try the other varieties of granola in this line. I'm sure they are tasty. Really, I haven't had anything made by Nature's Path that I didn't really like.

review/summary: Rich Granola would make a better snack
review/text: I was so excited to try this granola. Who doesn't like cereal, really?<br />It's definitely chocolatey! I would not imagine I'd like to eat this first thing in the morning, but it would be a good little snack, or lunch even. There aren't many berries, and the pieces are very little, but the flavor is there. There was just the right number/size of chocolate pieces. The bag is also a little small, but then granola bags tend to be as they are very dense. It's very rich, and I was not tempted to go back for a second bowl (in a row).<br />It is all organic and non-GMO, which is really nice. It doesn't have that much fat (for granola-notoriously unhealthy), and has 2g fiber and protein each. Only 6 gm sugar, which seems very low to me (luckily!)It's got a lot of whole grains and omega-3s too, which is supposed to be good for me.<br />Overall this was a fine cereal, I will definitely save it for a snacktime treat again.

review/summary: Delicious by the handful, or as a cereal.
review/text: Dark chocolate and berries is one of my favorite flavor combinations.  I have a weakness for healthy snacks like granola and trail mix.  Except they aren't so healthy when you finish a whole bag in a single day, a handful here, a handful there.  I decided to avoid doing that with the Love Crunch Granola by treating it like cereal.<br /><br />I served myself 1/3 cup of granola (which is more than a serving) and poured a little 1% milk on it.  It's perfect!  There is a good balance of smaller crumbles and larger chunks in the chocolate-flavored granola.  The dark chocolate squares and dried berries are just right ... enough to be savored without overpowering the granola.  The granola stays crunchy in the milk without being difficult to chew. (I have TMJ and sometimes crunchy granolas are hard and bother my jaw.)<br /><br />It was a decadent snack and I will enjoy the bag.  Hopefully I can savor it over the course of several days and don't give into my compulsion to sneak handfuls throughout the day.  Hopefully I can enjoy at least one more bowl before my teenage daughter discovers it's open and finishes it off for me.<br /><br />This granola did not disappoint me in any way.  It was deliciously perfect!

review/summary: A Great Little Granola
review/text: I'm a fan of Nature's Crossing products and when I had the chance to try and review  their new organic granola, I jumped at it. With each bag you're getting 11.5 ounces of high quality goodness.<br /><br />What's in "Love Crunch?" Well it's mostly road oats and chunks of dark chocolate, but you also get dried strawberries, dried raspberries (hence the "red berries"), dried coconut, some flaw seed and a bit of vanilla. It's all very tasty. Although I know granola isn't everyone's go-to snack food (It isn't even mine), thiis is a really tasty mix and I'm even snacking on it while I write this review. If you're looking to get your kids to eat something healthy or trying to ease out of processed sweets, you should definitely consider Love Crunch (although the name is kind of dippy).<br /><br />Each serving is 140 calories and contains 9% of your RDAs of fat. Unfortunately a serving is only 1/4th of a cup. That's a lot of fat and calories for such a small serving - which is why I knocked a star off. There's only 1 gram of saturated fat per serving at least. It's also cholestrol free and very low in sodium. So it might not be the be the best granola for you, but it's still healthier than a candy bar or a piece of cake.<br /><br />I was also happy to see that for every bag of Love Crunch purchases, Nature's Crossing donates a bag to a food shelf/food bank. That means in purchasing this, you're also giving a high quality organic product to those who are in need and/or otherwise couldn't afford the extra cost of going organic. This is a really nice thing to do and it definitely helps encourage me to want to purchase more. Think of it as a "Buy 1, Someone Else Gets 1 Free."<br /><br />All in all Love Crunch is one of the tastier granolas that I've tried. I've had better and I've had worse, but this is still a great little granola I can happily recommend even to people who normally pass up this type of snack.

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: This granola in one word? AMAZING. This stuff rocks. It's a perfect snack (though a little high in calories at 140 for 1/4 cup) full of cocoa, coconut, berries, oats and chunks of chocolate. I love that it's organic too. The only thing I didn't like is that there are an awful lot of small crumbs at the bottom of the bag from the larger chunks falling apart (due to shipping?). Love it and can't wait to get more.

review/summary: dangerously delicious
review/text: I really like granola, especially the Nature Valley bars, but this Love Crunch Chocolate Berry mix is beyond delicious!!  It is so good, it can be very, very dangerous for those (like me) trying to watch their weight.  Granola is good for you, but can also be high in calories, which makes moderation key.  This product is kind've high in calories considering the serving.  It's 140 calories a serving, but a serving is only 1/4 cup (30 grams).  Please see my pictures of an actual serving of this granola.  That's not very much when it comes down to it.  Thankfully, it packs a lot of flavor, so a small amount goes a long way in yogurt, cereal, or pudding.  I can't wait to mix some with Chobani.  I think this would also be great in baked goods likes muffins or breads.  It wasn't dry, like many granola mixes I have tried. And I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of chocolate pieces.  There are plenty so that you really do get some in every serving.  I would have liked to have more fruit pieces, but there was enough in the bag to give a noticeable fruity flavor boost and a good contrasting texture.  I truly wish they offered this in a single-serve size bar.<br /><br />The bag is a good sized 11.5 ounces, and the Amazon price for 6 bags is quite reasonable (less than $4 a bag as of this writing).  Having 6 bags in the house would be torture for me, so I'll stick to buying this one bag at a time in a supermarket.  But, I WILL buy it.  For a family, the bulk option is a good deal. The bag is also ziplock, which is great for staying fresh longer.  I keep mine in the freezer to maintain freshness, and because chocolate is just so much better cold :-)  Overall, highly recommended!<br /><br />As reviewer D.A.J. noted:<br />140 calories per serving<br />55 calories from fat<br />6g total fat<br />2 g dietary fiber<br />6g sugars<br />2 gram protein

review/text: This was a great snack food.  Excellent taste and pretty healthy.<br /><br />I woudn't recommend it as a breakfast cereal, we had some very large chunks in our bag, not something you'd grab with a spoon.<br /><br />Love the dark chocolate bits too, wish there was more in there.<br /><br />Overall... Great food!
