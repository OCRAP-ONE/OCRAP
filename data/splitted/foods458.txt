review/text: Altoids Smalls Sugar Free Cinnamon mints are our household favorite, hands down.  For some ridiculous reason, local retailers have stopped carrying them (what's up with that??), so trusty and reliable Amazon.com has filled the bill, along with the super-fast vendor.  Thanks to everyone; we are now enjoying our tasty mints once again!

review/summary: Sensational little mint
review/text: This little sugar-free mint packs a powerful, longlasting punch. The cinnamon is true to the cinnamon flavor. The mint can be discretly held in your mouth and still carry on a conversation. These are by far my favorite of mints. Great Job Altoids and thank you Amazon.com for supplying these mints.

review/summary: Love these little cinnamon mints!
review/text: These little cinnamon Altoids are my favorite mints -- not too strong and not too sweet. The small tin is the perfect size to carry in my purse or pocket, but it's very hard to find in my area; I've only been able to find them at World Market. I love ordering them by the box on Amazon and having them delivered right to my front door, and the price can't be beat.

review/summary: LOVE THESE! Cinnamon is the best.
review/text: I like all of the Altoid smalls, but cinnamon is my favorite. Usually avoid fake sugar products, in favor of natural varieties...but, I tend to pop so many mints during the day, I prefer not to rot my teeth. Smalls are perfect. Cinnamon is SUPER strong! That is a plus, to me. Any way, it's rare to find this flavor in the store; only one particular local Meijer store has them where I live. Thrilled when I thought to check Amazon, and found them at a good price. I usually buy 4 or 5 packages at the store when I can (since it's so rare to find them), and this package of 9 works out to be about the same price. Yay for me!

review/text: I cannot buy these locally. I have looked all over. I have found the peppermint and on occasion I can find the wintergreen but never the cinnamon. I was introduced to the cinnamon via a wedding favor. I was able to find them when visiting in NC but last few times there I could not find them. I prefer the cinnamon Altoid Smalls. They are great. The Peppermint are a little too strong and the wintergreen are ok.

review/text: I have a bad case of dry mouth due to the medications I take. I can use a special toothpaste, mouthwash, and mouth spray, but those only help for short periods. I found that using these cinnamon mints really help me throughout the day, and last longer than the mouth spray.  They are almost calorie-free, and are sugar-free - so that makes them even better. I use to buy them at my local grocery or drugstore.  But now it's a hit or a miss if I can find them in a local store. So, I've started buying them online in bulk. It solves my problem for months and months!

review/summary: stale and tasteless
review/text: I was looking forward to fresh, full-bodied coffee. Instead, I got stale, old, bland coffee. When I opened the bag, there was no fresh coffee bean aroma. The beans were completely dried out and very pale brown, not even a deep brown. I thought maybe that this blend might have lighter colored beans, so I brewed a pot. Yuck! This coffee was so horrible tasting. Drinking it was like drinking week old coffee you find at a mechanic shop. i will never purchase again. I will continue to pay extra for Jeremiah's Organic. The saving is not worth it.

review/text: Very smooth and mild, no "off" tastes - but unfortunately this blend is almost tasteless.<br /><br />I had to double the amount of coffee I use in my coffee maker just to extract a bit of flavor. Freshness may be an issue, because on opening the bag, I was not greeted with the strong aroma that is typical of freshly roasted beans.<br /><br />The price is right at about $6.00 a pound delivered. I may try another Boyers blend of a more robust nature.<br /><br />This blend is considerably milder than Starbuck's house blend.<br /><br />A major disappointment!<br /><br />I tried Boyer's "Rocky Mountain Thunder" which I found was much more to my taste. The Thunder blend was also much better sealed

(If you use a baking pan, line it with foil) Take your "Vernor's" and pour it into the bottom of the baking pan. Just enough to line the bottom of the pan and not cover the fish. Then wash your fish and place the salmon in the pan. Take the bottle of Honey and start covering the fish (steaks) with as much as you can use to cover every part of the fish. (I use a lot) After you have covered the fish, take the bottle of Tiger Sauce and pour over the honey and the fish. You use as much as you want. Start with enough to cover the honey and fish and then when you keep making it, use more like I do to season to taste. When this is all done, place in pre-heated oven (350) for 30 minutes. That's it. Hope you like it. Gloria...<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUH0US">TryMe Original Tiger Sauce - 10 oz</a>

review/summary: Mild heat combined with far too much vinegar
review/text: This is a mild hot sauce. That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etc<br /><br />Yet why have I rated it 2 stars? The simple answer it has far too much vinegar and it ends up tasting like vinegar and a bit bitter too. In addition, this sauce lacks any character beyond that heavy dose of vinegar. Now, if you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you might love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are much better ones, including ones that have a fair amount of vinegar.<br /><br />What is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.<br /><br />BTW: You will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!<br /><br />Suggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then you can save a lot of money by buying it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They don't cost much more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar or is at least - better balanced.<br /><br />Try any of these:<br /><br />a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a vague hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! It has no vinegar, is considerably more potent than Franks, yet just a bit sweet. Compared to Franks you have to be careful not to add too much.<br /><br />b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - low to medium heat and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar but is diluted, much like Franks yet with a far superior taste. Highly recommended<br /><br />c) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend and not so hot that it is unforgiving.<br /><br />d) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.<br /><br />e) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but still far less than Franks. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.<br /><br />In my opinion, all of the above are far superior to Franks.<br /><br />If you happen to like Franks and are at the least bit curious, you should try any of the ABOVE. For only a few bucks for a bottle, what is there to lose?<br /><br />I hope Amazon customers will rate my review after taste testing one of these other hot sauces.<br /><br />My very best<br /><br />Thanks

review/text: Normally, when we've brought home cat treats, one or two of our three cats will like them, and one or two won't. They're picky.<br /><br />With Greenies, they all go bonkers. We just need to start opening the bag and all three come running. It's become a reliable way to track them all down.<br /><br />One of them has figured out how to open the cabinet we used to keep them in, so we've had to get more creative about hiding them. The contortions he goes through to open the cabinet are incredible. Naturally when he finds a bag he opens it himself, and he doesn't use the zip lock seal, or follow the recommended limit of no more than six treats at a time.<br /><br />Try a small bag to see if your cats like them, but I'm now buying them in bulk.<br /><br />They like them better than catnip.

review/text: What is lebkuchen?  It's a gingerbread made with a lot of nuts.  It has a mild, rich flavor.  It's not extremely sweet.  It's a bread more than a cake.  It often comes on what some describe as a communion wafer.  It's really not something that one can easily describe or even say why it's so good; but for those of us who enjoy it there's few better treats.<br /><br />If you've not had real lebkuchen, you should first buy a small amount.  If you have had lebkuchen and didn't like it, you should buy a small amount of lebkuchen-Schmidt (from N&uuml;rnberg) and try it.  If you still don't like it, and there are many who don't and won't; you've done your due diligence.<br /><br />Now for the rest of us.  I love lebkuchen, especially Elisen (a style with more nuts).  I've tried it from all over and I like Schmidt the best.  It's a wonderful treat for Christmas.  Nothing put's you more in the Christmas spirit than opening a fresh pack of this wonderful treat (well nothing other than being around family and friends).<br /><br />A 'few' of the things I love from Germany:<br /><br />The bread, real crusty hearty,<br />The beer, rich and malty and never the same; but always of high quality,<br />The sausages, like the beer never the same, but always of high quality, and<br />The lebkuchen, the thing most Americans have never heard about, but really should try.<br /><br />I'm not a "Deutschophile".  That being said there are many many good things in, about and from Germany, and this is one of my favorites.

review/summary: German Delights
review/text: Purchased product for my husband who is German/Norweigen and he loves Lebkuchen.  Only part of box he did not care for was the Stollen, which he makes his own each year and the mass produced bread loses its taste when sent out in the mail.  Otherwise very good product and value for he money.

review/summary: Great on Large Orders (for cheaper shipping)
review/text: These sweetened carob chips are simply sensational. You wouldn't even be able to tell that they weren't chocolate. We use them in all sorts of cookies and candy making too. Contrary to popular belief, carob can be melted just like chocolate. The trick is to use a double boiler and do it as slowly as possible. If your mixture gets too grainier lumpy, you're doing it too quickly. Slow down!<br /><br />You might also try cooler water. Not cool water, just cooler than you're already using (and getting the lumpy mixture). This might mean, you need to use warm water instead of hot water. Or, it might mean you need to use hot water instead of boiling hot water. After all, if they can turn carob into chips, you can turn carob chips into something else, right?<br /><br />These babies go great with the Barry Farm's PB chips:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FH64VM?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8<br />...as well as the yogurt coatings also from Barry Farm:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AVTE0?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8<br /><br />Do note: the more you order, the better the shipping (compared to all items) but larger orders can take a little longer to ship. Don't fret though, you'll get it!

However, I took a chance on the sweetened carob chips from Barry Farms as their carob powder is so much better than any other that I have tried over the years.  I used them in chocolate chip cookies and they are absoultely, hands down, the best I have ever tased.  I ordered more just to keep in the pantry!

review/summary: maybe alright for baking but must have high trans fat content
review/text: I ordered this product in hope of obtaining a good chocolate substitute for my toddler to snack on. Unfortunately, beside a lot of sugar these chips are loaded with saturated fats - almost certainly with plenty of trans fats since the oils are listed as being partially-hydrogenated [trans fat content not described on label]. Taste-wise these chips are too sweet for my liking but at least have the basic carob flavor that I remember from chips available in the stores back in the 80s and 90s - albeit a purer carob with less fat content would be most welcomed.

review/summary: I always have one on my table!
review/text: My table has this and an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019S714A">Alessi Coarse Sea Salt, 2.83-Ounce Grinders (Pack of 6)</a> at all times (I use bulk sea salt and a larger pepper grinder in the kitchen.)<br /><br />Since I live alone, a single grinder can last me six plus weeks, so a pack of six of these is roughly a nine month supply. For families or couples, or for those who entertain often, how long it lasts will vary.<br /><br />The peppercorns are fresh and when ground they immediately burst into a wonderful aroma. The mechanism is relatively easy to turn, and unlike some grinders, does not stick of easily clog.<br /><br />Do be aware that the grinding mechanism tends to produce very coarse pepper, so if you prefer yours to be finer, a dedicated grinder may better suit your needs.  Another possible issue is when you have just a few peppercorns left in the container they may not "catch" in the grinding mechanism and grind. I've learned through experience that it's best to just dispose of the grinder and use a new one from the pack. It will save you frustration.<br /><br />For me this is a convenient way to make sure that my guests and I have fresh ground pepper during meals, and I always have a few on hand.

review/summary: Has Kick
review/text: I'm a big fan of peppercorn grinders. I love black peppercorn, and put it on just about all of my food. However, I had never tried a mixed peppercorn grinder, so I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised to not only taste something with robust flavor, but also something that has some good kick to it. This pepper conglomeration isn't red-hot like jalapenos, nor is it very mild or lifeless; it has just the right amount of kick to it. This grinder is great for salads, hamburgers, or anything that needs a little more flavor. Plus.....it lasts a long time (months, with regular use). So, spruce up your food with some mixed peppercorns, and enjoy.

review/text: I found this pasta in a local shop and the unique shape intrigued me; even when cooking for one, shouldn't dinner be a little special? The shape of the pasta can be very important to the flavors of a particular dish because of how it "holds" the sauce. I made this maccheroni al torchio with bolognese sauce and it turned out simply delicious.<br /><br />Remember to salt the water as you would with any pasta. These are pretty thick and cook up a little on the tender side; don't worry if you followed the directions and it seems *slightly* over boiled because after it sits in the colander for a few minutes it cools perfectly to al dente.<br /><br />The sauce clings really well to the pasta and the curls hold the meat from the sauce so every bite is balanced in flavor.<br /><br />I've added a photo so you can see the shape of the pasta a little better.<br /><br />Whether cooking for one or many, I think you'll enjoy this tasty, unusual shaped maccheroni.

review/text: We're picky about our gluten-free baked goods, especially since we can't use eggs. This mix was very successful without eggs, baked as muffins. The flavor is like a sweet cornbread, but lighter in texture. And it's wonderful with a quick lemon glaze ...and better yet with fresh berries. I suspect it will make an excellent strawberry shortcake, too.<br /><br />Note: I used a variety of egg replacer for 2 eggs, plus a bit extra Ener-G egg replacer, used milk instead of water, tossed in 2 Tb nonfat dry milk for extra yum/protein. Baked at suggested temperature, 25 minutes.

review/summary: Improved texture?
review/text: I bought this at my local store, not off Amazon (it was about $5 a box, I think) - I wanted the King Arthur Flour vanilla cake mix, but the store only had the KAF chocolate mix.  I came home and looked up reviews of the mix and found it here on Amazon.  I wasn't encouraged by them, but went ahead and made it anyway - it was for my friend's birthday and her celebration was only a few hours away.  I think that the company must have changed the ingredients that go into this cake (the reviews are all from 2011 at the most recent).<br /><br />This is easy to put together, as all mixes are; the only change I made was to add some fiori de sicilia to it for flavoring.  After the cake came out - it release from the pan very easily - I brushed it with lemon curd and topped it with sliced strawberries.  The cake was pretty good, I thought - not dry, with a tender crumb.  I thought there was a slight hint of grainy texture, but the lemon curd went a long way towards softening the cake.  I will say that it's a little bland - it didn't much taste of vanilla to me - and so I think that if I made this again, I would add even more flavoring - an almond extract might be nice, or rum (or just a lot of vanilla - think 2tsp).  This wouldn't be my go-to cake (I would always prefer one made from scratch), but this is pretty good, and doesn't taste at all of chemicals like regular non-gluten free cake mixes do.

review/text: I would agree with most reveiwers that this is not the mix I'd use for delicious cupcakes or cake, but it did have a great flavor... a bit like the sweet cornbread others have mentioned... but not dry like cornbread can tend to be. I decided to follow another reveiwer's recommendation and use it for berry shortcake and it was incredible.  I baked it in two round cake pans so it made it thinner, sliced it like you would a pizza, made some fresh whipped cream and then topped it with fresh strawberries and raspberries from the garden.  It was delicious and my non-gf friends LOVED it!  When I'm craving shortcake and feel too lazy to create my own recipe, this will be my goto!  :)

I would highly recommend this product to anyone I meet, but I would not recommend they purchase it here. The price here is more than double that of a local supermarket or health-foods store, not to mention you won't be receiving them cold.<br /><br />Overall this product deserves a 5-star rating for taste and energy-fulfillment, however, the Amazon price far outreaches the benefits of the product.

Not a huge deal considering the great price on these compared to other vendors, and this issue wasn't worth notifying the seller (it's hard to ship glass perfectly without a big increase in packing cost, i figure), but it was a hassle to clean up... mainly because i have been re-using the boxes to store my wine upside down. I'll still be buying these, however, and im glad they are available.

review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: Not many people know about this great dog food because the company spends their time on quality production vs. advertising. They use a great manufacturing plant and cook under low temperature; which is important- they make sure their product sources are safe; based on research they formulated this product; it has a strong taste my dogs love and the digestion is great as well. Highly recommended! Once you study dog foods you will find this food is fantastic.

review/summary: Great Product !
review/text: Want your Chinese dishes to taste authentic?  This product is a must.  Fantastic on chicken, shrimp, or beef.  Just mix with Shaoxing wine into a milky paste and marinate your proteins for 15 minutes, an hour , or overnight. The longer the better.  Does wonders for succulence and texture,  and adds a special flavor that is deliciously Asian, yet hard to put your finger on.  Want great wings ?  Just marinate with this stuff and deep fry at 305F for 11 minutes. For extra crispiness use the product along with the Starport dry batter. Fantastic on stir fry proteins. If you are into Chinese cooking,  do yourself a favor and buy this stuff and discover a whole new dimension of flavor in your Asian dishes.  Go Starport !

review/summary: Just don't think of it as Mac and Cheese
review/text: I ordered this for my son for his school meal. First off, the nutrition information is really impressive compared to traditional Mac 'n cheese so for a family trying to eat healthy, I did not have a problem eating this. But it does not taste like Mac 'n Cheese at all but rather Macaroni in a vegetable/butternut squash sauce with cheese. As long as you are aware of this then you will be fine. The flavor, for me, was good but texture was mushy for a frozen entree.Add this to the hefty price tag and I would rather cook my own vegetable casserole and choose a different pasta for it i.e. whole wheat Penne or Rigatoni.All in all, disappointing for us.

review/summary: The only no-carb gum option
review/text: I purchased Falim because I was looking for a completely carb-free gum. I didn't want a sugar-free gum with sweeteners.  I just wanted something to chew on when I was craving something. That is exactly what this is. It is virtually flavorless, completely sugarless gum. Once in a while you can taste a bit of a piney flavor but overall it's just like a normal piece of gum that has lost it's flavor.<br /><br />There are 5 small pieces in each pack so you get 25 pieces of gum for the price which is a little steep when you include shipping.  So, if you know you will use it, I recommend buying in volume to bring the overall cost per piece down by sharing the shipping cost among numerous packs.

review/summary: Good but unexpected
review/text: I ordered this gum on the grounds thinking it was a flavored sugerless gum- my mistake. people should know the following: this gum is basically Mastic flavored gum. Everyone should know that the packs have SMALL pieces of gum inside each of them; These pieces are basically double the thickness of a Chiclet! Some dislike this gum because they think it tastes like chewed gum(already been chewed) When chewing the gum it is a bit on the strong side to start off but a few chews later is soft. So if ordering, be aware these things. Otherwise, the mastic flavor lasts forever.I guess since this is a calorie free gum that people dont need to worry about sugar or suger substitutes.

Also a big plus is that there is no corn syrup or sugar flavoring.  The bottle is unique with a cool flask design.  It doesn't take up much space in my gym bag and also fits nicely in pockets.

review/text: I am trying to avoid both sugar and fake sugars. Fake sugars may have zero calories but they are not biologically inert. Some have turned out to have side effects, and I suspect that some are too new to be well-researched yet. Just my opinion. Anyway, that has left me looking for water that doesn't taste like plain water, but without sugar substitutes in it. This water is subtly flavored, no fake sugar, reasonably priced... Just what I was looking for. The only negative comment is that the flavoring is perhaps too subtle -- but I imagine without adding something sweet, it's hard to do more.

review/text: I tried this sauce on a whim, when I saw it in Whole Foods Market. It had a local label and I'm all 'gung ho' for trying out products made locally. I wasn't sure what to expect so I tasted a little bit before mixing it with my other ingredients, and was initially surprised that it truly tasted like its name as well as very authentic. But boy was I surprised after I used this with a stuffed shells recipe and really tasted the flavors! The flavoring of the herbs in the sauce were simply robust and just delicious, complimenting my other ingredients extremely well. I vowed never to buy commercial pasta sauces ever again, but this certainly changed my mind. This is very close to making a sauce from scratch, in my opinion. If you're skeptical, I would suggest buying a jar from your local health food store before buying in bulk...you won't regret it!

review/summary: The Brits secret to great curry
review/text: British friends of ours who are nuts about curries put us on to Patak's curry pastes.  I thought it would be difficult to find in the US but voila, Amazon has it.  Start by sauteing diced onion, add other ingredients such as garlic, red pepper, tomato paste, whatever to your taste.  Then add a tablespoon or more of Patak curry paste.  They come in different intensities and levels of heat with the Madras warm but not too hot.  The secret shared by the Brits is to make the sauce a day ahead of time and let it sit and integrate in the fridge overnight.  Next day, add veggies, chicken, lamb, whatever your choice might be and cook on the stovetop or in the oven then serve with potatoes or basmati rice and condiments such as raisins, coconut, pine nuts, and of course chutney.  That's it.  They swear by Patak -- why make your own curry sauce from all those spices and ingredients when Patak's done it for you?

review/text: I actually think the soup is quite good. It's not "low sodium", but it's not excessive either. It has 560 mg Sodium, so that's 25% of RDA-that's a lot less than what you typically see in canned soups. With the soup base added, I will say there is quite a bit of pepper and onion that I detect, but again, I don't think it's excessive. I decided to go for the creamier version and use a cup of milk with the soupbase instead of 3 Tbsp of water. It's a very nice change of pace. It passed the test with my husband and 9 YO son, so that's pretty impressive. I'm trying to get away from the canned soups (i.e. BPA)and Canterbury Naturals has been a great way to accomplish this. So far we've had the White Chicken Chili, Fireside Tortilla (added ground chicken to it), Tortellini, Farmhouse Curry, and the Chicken Noodle. I think they're all great. Whether the recipe calls for it or not, I am adding ground meat or chicken breast, just to give it more substance so it can be more filling. For the Tortellini soup I added 8oz. of tomato sauce, chicken breast, and an extra package of cheese tortellini-it was filling and GOOD. You can buy most of the flavors in the natural/organic section at Kroger, but they're cheaper on subscribe and save if you really like them.

Using your own chicken, onion, etc (I add my own carrots and whatever other vegetables are in season), the soup mix adds just the right mix of flavors to create an outstanding and hearty meal.  Right before the soup is finished cooking, you add the final packet of seasoning/thickening agent, and it really makes the soup taste great - not at all too salty.  I can only assume the other reviewers who gave negative reviews may not have diluted it correctly, or may not have followed the directions as written (or may just have very different tastes than we do).

review/summary: Everything you would expect
review/text: It's Pop-Tarts. What do you expect? She likes them. They got here quickly enough. They were still well within their expiration date. (expiration date? really? Won't the cockroaches be eating Pop-Tarts and Twinkies long after we're gone?)But everything Amazon and Kellogs did lived up to their promise. That's all I can ask.

review/summary: Good product. Reasonable price.
review/text: Good product. I am reducing one star because of the fact when cooked, for the same cup size, the quantity seemed to be little less than the brand I used before. I also felt like it is refined a little bit more than typical bulgur.

review/summary: One of my favorite ingredient secrets!
review/text: The brand of sweet dough flavoring is delicious. It tastes buttery, with a hint of vanilla and a slight blend of citrus! It's almost magical in baking sweet breads, sugar cookies and especially cinnamon rolls. The aroma conjures wonderful memories from my youth, smells like inside the Disneyland Main Street Blue Ribbon Bakery!<br /><br />It quite potent, so you needn't add much, but when you do, people will ask you for the recipe and what's your secret to success. Worth every penny!<br /><br />To save on shipping, be sure to order (their) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QPUGZY">Cook's Pure Vanilla Bean Puree (Paste) 4 oz</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049Z98Z0">Cooks Pure Vanilla Powder, 4.5-Ounce (Pack of 2)</a> to use in dry mixes. Check out my reviews for both. I'm not an employee, I've just been enjoying these products for years.
