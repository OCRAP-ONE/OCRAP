review/summary: Excellent in chocolate chip cookie recipe
review/text: I like this Fastachi product. I never used hazelnut butter before and needed it for a chocolate chip cookie recipe. They came out great. My son visited for the weekend and will take some back to his apartment. Amazon shipped the butter within three days. The only drawback for me was I would have appreciated storing tips. I want to know: should I  refrigerate it after opening? Again, the cookies are great! I will most likely order more of this hazelnut butter in the future.

review/summary: Was disappointed in the texture, but not the taste
review/text: This hazelnut butter definitely tastes wonderful and rich. I was disappointed to find out how grainy it was, though. Honestly, I have made grainy hazelnut butter of equal quality using a coffee grinder. So if you have a grinder of some sort at home and want to save some money, try making your own before buying this.<br /><br />If you want smooth hazelnut butter of the same texture as creamy peanut butter and don't mind spending the extra money, try shopping with L'Epicerie.com and buy some of their hazelnut paste.

review/summary: Enjoy some Turkish Delight
review/text: This is a mix of lemon, rose and mint flavored turkish delight. It is a nearly no fat,  high carb treat with a mild flavor, a soft chewy texture and covered with powdered sugar. The sugar covering makes the colors hard to distinguish unless you look carefully or brush some of it off. I sometimes serve Turkish Delight with a sweet-tart dipping sauce made by mixing a TBS each of lemon juice and honey. Fans of the Chronicles of Narnia will remember that the Magic Turkish Delight was part of what induced Edmund to betray his siblings to the witch. Enjoy some in the safety of your home.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2CC">Hazer Baba Turkish Delight, Mixed, Lemon Rose Menthe, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>

review/text: I love Turkish Delight and have been fortunate enough to have it freshly made while I was living overseas. I was a bit disappointed when I tried these. While the flavor is generally fine, they are exceedingly sweet and they weren't quite as soft as I had hoped, but that my be much to ask for in a packaged product. If you like Turkish Delight and aren't too picky about the texture, you'd probably like these fine.

review/text: I purchased this product as a gift, but since I received a four-box pack and I've never tried this brand, I decided to open a box and try it, to make sure it was ok before I gave the rest.  So glad I did. The sugar coating was stale and overpowering and literally dropped off the Turkish delight in literal waves.  Neither my wife nor I could finish a single piece of Turkish delight. The stale sugar taste made the product unpalatable and I threw all four boxes in the trash can.  I do not recommend purchasing this unless you like to eat spoonfuls of raw stale sugar.

review/summary: PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!
review/text: Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.  In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :)<br /><br />I got a great deal through Amazon on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs.  They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of crap food.  People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal.  But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust.<br /><br />Get these treats.  You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually.

review/summary: Dog loves them
review/text: We purchased these for our poodle.  She is the smaller breed (appx. 10 pounds) so I was a little worried these might be too big.  As a whole piece, the treats might be a little large for her, but they can be broken in two very easily.  The bag actually shows you how to break them in two, of course it's pretty self-explanatory as each treat has a cut down the middle of them.  So, the actual size of the treat should not be an issue for those with large or small dogs!  As far as taste--of course I can only rely on how well our dog likes them-she loves them.  Of course she is a little piggy and likes everything, but she really seems to be more fond of these than cheaper treats we have given her.  Overall I am pleased with these treats and I would recommend them if asked!

review/summary: A+ from picky eater
review/text: In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't buy from Amazon - I bought these at PetSmart, but I wanted to do a product review because these treats are worth buying in bulk - they're amazing!<br /><br />These little treats are wonderful.  I am extremely picky about what my dog eats because he's had digestive problems in the past and also because I believe dogs shouldn't be fed the unwanted junk leftover from the corn/grain industry, food that has been irradiated, or food that is made in questionable countries (cough* China * cough cough).<br /><br />Not only are these Newman's Own treats a good price, they are a good size and are indeed made with quality ingredients.  As another reviewer said, you can literally see the oats and such in the baked treats (see the product picture I took).  Plus, they're shaped like little hearts - adorable!  The best things about these treats, however, are that (1) they're made in Canada from a company we all can trust, and (2) my dog absolutely loves them. These treats are made from certified organic ingredients with 7% fat (min).  With all the pet food recalls and my inherent distaste for low quality, Chinese, irradiated, or high fat treats these treats are a winner!<br /><br />Also, my dog is a terribly picky eater when it comes to treats (which is hilarious because he'd eat cat poop if I let him).  He has never eaten any biscuit that was not literally made in a bakery from a boutique.  This has cost me lots of money in the past (in finding treats he likes, and having to deal with the bags and bags of treats he didn't like such as Blue Buffalo, Mother Hubbard's, and Wellness bars).  I bought a 13oz bag of these at PetSmart today for 5.00 (far less than I spent on the other brands), and my dog will not leave me alone.  He literally dances to get my attention because he wants me to give him one of these treats.  It seems like neither of us could be happier with this product.  If I can remember, I will do an update once the bag is gone to see if this trend has continued.<br /><br />Is there anything Newman's Own cant do?

review/text: Three years ago we found out our dog Bella had severe food allergies.Fish,potatos,veggies,fruit and a few other selected foods are all she can eat. I look and could only find Newmans Own Salmon&Potato treats for her to eat.Since then they come evey 2mths ,by Sub&save. Today when I opened the first package I was shocked. The normally,heart shaped treats that are light, airy, thick, and easy to break,were nothing but,dark,flat,hard to break rocks. So my question is "What Happened?" Not only was it one package but all six. If this is their new product,they lost a customer.But if it was a bad batch, I say how dare they send this out to consumers,take their money,and think its right.Today there are many treats made that she can eat,but I stuck with Newmans out of loyalty,because they were first in making a great product Bella could eat.And Bella really loves this treats.I hope Newmans can fix this.

Unfortunately, my two dogs (male 9 yrs & female 3 yrs) just are not impressed. I think perhaps if the 'cookies' were a little less dry and / or their excellent quality ingredients were just a little more aromatic that they would be more tempting and desired by my spoiled, but well loved dogs. If I break the cookie in half, it seems to release slightly more tasty aroma and I can almost talk the dogs into them.

review/text: I purchased these treats because they were on sale, but also because they're made in the US with safe ingredients.  My Yorkie loves duck breast jerky, but those treats are made in China, and I'm not sure I trust products from there 100% after the poisonous ingredients that were found in China-made dog food in the recent past.  Of course, I didn't expect my dog to enjoy these treats as much as the meaty duck, but he reacts the same way to these cheesey treats as the duck breast!  When I have one of these treats ready for him, his responses to commands (sit, lie down, etc.) are instantaneous - he really wants the treat!  I was concered buying 6 packs at once without first testing them, but now I'm glad I have 6 for him.  GREAT PURCHASE, and I'll be buying other Newman dog products in the future

review/summary: perfect food for my old dog :)
review/text: Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets. After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight. Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years. After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat. That may be age related as well. But the stomach upsets have stopped. And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula.

SO worth it!!  you can't beat the price (seriously folks, the name brand pet stores sell this at more than double the price)!!  i love newman's own organics, and more importantly...so does my little, four-legged girl.

review/summary: Dog Treats
review/text: Newman's Own Organics Premium Dog Treats were thought to be something that my two dogs (minature daschunds) would enjoy, however Heidi, the older of the two dogs will not eat these treats. She is usually eager to get treats but she turns up her nose to these.  Max, the other dog will eat almost anything so he's getting to partake of the entire purchase.  I will not be reordering any more of this treat because I need something that both dogs enjoy.

review/summary: Natural Treats; a product I trust
review/text: It isn't easy to find packaged food for pets that I can trust.  I have been doing a lot of reading lately about what actually goes into most commercial brand pet foods, and I am appalled.  I decided to start cooking for my brood, but the puppy was going bonkers for bicuits, which was kind of freaking me out.  I never thought I'd find something on the store shelves that satisfied us both...and then, in a WalMart in Honesdale PA (where my family owns a vacation home) I saw these.  I trust Newman's Own, so I read the ingredients.  I was happy, and my dog loves them, but I couldn't seem to find them back home in NJ, so I searched Amazon, and here they were.  I am slated to get a case every other month, but I might need to up that to once a month!

review/text: We were given a partial bag of these treats by a friend who no longer needed them. Our Boston Terrier loved them! Upon researching the product, and finding them to be a good product as well as a good bargain, we purchased 2 cases of them... not for our dog specifically, but to give them to our local Bank so they could give treats to the dogs in cars that came through the drive up window. (Our dog loves to get treats at the bank)... We have gotten great responses from our friends at the bank.<br />We appreciate giving treats that can be dependable and healthy for our pet family. Thank you!

review/summary: Disappointed, Brownie does not like it at all
review/text: I figured this would be great since Brownie loves Salmon, but he doesn't even want to touch it.  I got him the Salmon and sweet potato one. He'd rather eat regular dog food than this which is quite weird for him.  He eats everything he can get his paws on, including non edible stuff. It might be because the smell is not very strong.  When I put it up close to my nose to smell it, I barely got a light whiff of salmon. Dog treats usually have a stronger smell which makes it more tempting for dogs.

review/summary: Pretty Good Treats
review/text: These are hard treats shaped like hearts that you can break in half if necessary. They have decent ingredients though I try not to give my dogs anything with grain, the oatmeal and barley flour is not too bad. I only give one a day as a late night snack. My Doberman likes them but she is not too picky. My picky Shar-pei will eat them but is not enthusiastic about them (he prefers Merrick sausages). Overall, these are a decent snack for dogs as long as your pet does not have dental issues, these should be okay for them.  I want to make a comment about the packaging. This is one of the few "zip-loc" type resealable bags that actually reseals without having to mess with it a bunch of times. It stays nice and tight and keeps the treats fresh.

review/summary: small - not medium - sized treats
review/text: I'd purchased these dog treats in a local store (Medium sized) and it was a great size for my dog, my dog loved the treats and I thought that the ingredients were okay for my dog.  When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6.  Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats.  Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item.  I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats.  I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium.

review/summary: Good Treats
review/text: My dog loves these, and I believe (and hope not to be disappointed) that the Newman's Own Organics brand is to be trusted.<br /><br />The treats are small, and no doubt healthy, but I wish they listed the calories on their package. The ingredients are all good, but I'm trying to control my older dog's weight, and if these were very high-calorie, I wouldn't feed them to her. I'd look for something else. (I know, carrots and other veggies, but she won't eat them. She's a 9 year old rescue with terrible teeth, and set in her ways. My past puppies found baby carrots a great treat, but not this girl.)<br /><br />Maybe I'll contact the manufacturer and ask for the calorie count. But I do think it should be on the package.

review/text: My three dogs really love these treats.  They are made in the USA and reasonably priced.  One word of caution - I use these to stuff a "Waggle" bone and let my Dal go at it.  He loves it, but if he lays down with the Waggle on a light colored rug, the crumbs that fall out will discolor the rug if they get wet.  No big deal as the discoloration seems to wash out just fine.

review/summary: My dogs love them
review/text: I have two dogs. One of them is a picky eater and totally unmotivated by food (much to the annoyance of dog trainers who have tried to use treats as a training tool with her). I have purchased other treats and found that I had to give them all to my second dog (who is in danger of getting fat!).  Not Newman's Own Cheese Treats! My picky eater loves them and eagerly competes with my other dog for her share. Excellent product.

review/text: These treats, which are pieces of pure freeze dried-chicken, are pure chicken and as such<br /><br />are absolutely captivating to both my dog and cat, who will sit politely drooling, side by side, waiting for their treats, much to the amusement of friends and family.<br /><br />They are, however, fairly expensive.  The fact that I can buy them for a much more reasonable price through Amazon.com makes my faithful animal companions very happy, makes me look like a sport and keeps me out of the poorhouse.

review/summary: Our Cat's Favorite Treat
review/text: We always take our family cat for at least one or two 30 minute breaks outside each day. It gives her something exciting to do after being cooped up inside the house. When our cat gets in a naughty, bad, or rebellious mood and won't come in the house, guess what brings her in? Yep, Halo Liv-a-Littles Natural Treats for Cats Chicken Breast Protein treats. She immediately runs to me when she sees the bag and jumps on the table and gobbles up each piece like a vacuum cleaner. And that's saying a lot, because our cat's very picky when it comes to food. If you have a picky cat, I highly recommend these treats for your cat. These treats will make your cat happy.

review/summary: Has Sodium Phosphate in it
review/text: Sodium phosphate is a preservative.  So these are not chemical and preservative free.  That's the part I read, but I should have read more carefully.  I didn't realize it was in there when I ordered these for my cats.  One cat ignores them, but my other one loves them.  But sodium phosphate causes me terrible migraines so I stay away from it in my foods and medicines.  Even a little bit has a bad effect on me.  This makes me very wary about giving it to my cat.  The salmon has no marinade and therefore no sodium phosphate, so I'll get that one again.  I wish the chicken was more pure.  I don't do many reviews but I thought I should point this out in case it makes a difference to anyone else. I'm always looking for healthy food for my cats and dog.  Not sure this is, with that chemical in it.

review/text: We ordered these recently because we used to get them at Whole Foods in Louisville or at Krogers.  But there is no Whole Foods where we live now and Krogers runs out for long periods.  Our cats love them.  One of the cats eats these treats about 90% of the time.  They're expensive but he's just so healthy and playful. (We break them up a little smaller)<br /><br />They came in just a couple of days, too.  Great service and packaged up nicely.<br /><br />Update--The first few times the product came in 2-3 days.  This time I ordered it June 26th thinking it would come by the following Tuesday but it's now July 6th and they are giving me a goal date of July 8th. To me, this is just too long. I've ordered things from East Coast before with standard shipping and gotten them in 3 days, so I don't know why it has to be 11-12 days for this.<br /><br />Barbara, Larry, and Cats

review/text: I'm not quite sure why this product listing is for the chicken variety yet in the product description it speaks of how the beef version is made. That's a little confusing and makes me wonder about the chicken version...which is what I'm here to review. Trust me, the chicken variety is where it's at!<br /><br />This potent, endlessly pleasing box of feline ambrosia is the closest thing to opium I could imagine rewarding my cats with, without travelling over to the Middle East to get the real deal. Be warned: your kitty will take to this treat like the most ravenous furry addict you have ever seen, never missing an opportunity to spy on you as you open the refrigerator to once in a while (when you're not spending inordinate amounts of time with your cat) get sustenance for yourself. If you've never wondered what it is like to marvel at a cat trying to open a refrigerator door, don't buy this stuff. Don't even think of returning to simple store-bought crunchy treats after this stuff. Your cat will look at you like you are trying to replace sushi with a gold fish cracker! "C'mon, human, give me the goods; give me the white lines, I mean CRUMBS!"<br /><br />If you drop a little piece on the floor, your animals will race to lap it up and transport themselves into "Blissful." It is the ultimate reward with very few negative side effects as far as I can tell (other than unbridled, but functional addiction!)<br /><br />This stuff is a magical, mysterious little concoction that puts an instant smile on your feline and makes her your friend for life. It will slowly start wrecking your monthly budget, of course, but you will find justification after justification for purchasing it ad infinitum.<br /><br />I believe that William S.

review/summary: Kitties FLIP for these!
review/text: Our cat Max has a morning routine.  He goes into the kitchen and stands by the counter where these chicken treats are kept, and stares up at it until one of us gives him some.  Then he dances around while he devours the morsels.  If we don't come into the kitchen quick enough, say on a weekend, he'll come and find us and meow unitl we stand up, walk into the other room with him, and give him some.<br /><br />My wife and I have no idea why this is so addictive.  It has no particular smell, no special ingredients that we can figure.  My wife even tasted one of them, and found it to be very bland.<br /><br />But the kitsers LOVE it!  Dunno why, but we keep it handy.  And by the way, other flavors don't seem to have the same addictive appeal.  Only the chicken.<br /><br />We have a lot of fun giving them to our cat, and you probably will too.

review/summary: My cats LOVE these!
review/text: I don't normally bother to write reviews, but I had to put in a plug for these.  We adopted a mother cat and two 5 week old kittens a few weeks ago.  The mom had been a stray and is really skinny, so we wanted to get her to eat something extra.  We went to a cat show and one of the participants was feeding these to her cat as a treat.  She said all cats love them so I ordered a jar.  The mom and the kittens all love them.  The only problem is that we keep them in the refrigerator and every time we open the door the mom cat comes running hoping for one and the kittens soon follow if they are awake.

review/summary: It sure is - Kitty Crack!
review/text: I first learned about this product a year ago, and I've been giving it to my cats ever since. They get it once a day as a treat, and they love it. If there is a flavor of food that they may not be too crazy about, and I have nothing better to give them at a moment, then this will do the trick. I sprinkle it on top and they will eat it all no matter what. Also, when I clip their nails they get it for putting up with it, as well as if there is some special occassion. In overall, this is the best treat that I've ran accross, safe, apparently tasty, and one box can last me over a month, for two cats. I wish I could find it in local pet food stores.

review/summary: The perfect cat treat
review/text: I had not been buying treats at the store for my cat because the ingredients lists are full of things that are bad for her.  For Christmas she got some freeze dried salmon treats and she liked them but then she broke out like she always does when she has seafood.  So I came to Amazon to find a similar treat that was not made of fish.  These chicken treats are just right.  I do have to break most of them in half for her, otherwise it seems she can't get a hold on them.  But they are easy to break, airy and light, not dense and hard.  It's nice to have treats in the cupboard for her again, the giving of a treat now and then is highly pleasurable.  Update - I can not open "the" cupboard door or even a Gladware container now without Miss Kiki rushing into the kitchen hoping for some of these treats.  The only downside to them is the cost.  Maybe Amazon will add them to the Subscribe and Save program, that would help.

review/summary: My cats go nuts for these treats
review/text: My cats are giving this one an all-paws-up, quite literally. The Liv-a-Littles freeze-dried chicken pieces are the only treats that they will stand on their back legs for and beg. One of my cats thinks it's not really worth THAT much attention and begs in a bit more restrained fashion, but the others positively go nuts for this. Even my most picky and skittish treat-refusing kitty will take these eagerly and come back for more and doesn't even mind getting petted if there's a piece of freeze-dried chicken to have in return. That makes rattling this box of treats the best tool to "call" them when the times comes to go to the vet etc.<br /><br />One word of caution though: These are very rich and essentially concentrated dehydrated protein (80%). They really are meant to be an occasional treat only. I have to be careful to feed just a few pieces at a time and usually just give my cats 2-3 small pieces each and then put the box safely away again. If I offer more, they will eagerly overeat and at least one of my cats will eventually throw it all up again once it rehydrates in his stomach. Also, if you keep the box in an accessible place, they may try to break into it.
