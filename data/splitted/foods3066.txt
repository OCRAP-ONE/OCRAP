review/text: While I was away at college my friend's neighbors had brought these pretzels with them to her party.  They were the best pretzels I had ever eaten.  Since graduation I've been on a 3 year search looking for these pretzels, and here they are on Amazon.  No kidding, best pretzels ever.

review/summary: Seeing the light.
review/text: When I brew coffee at home I like to make it very strong because I enjoy a bold tasting coffee. Until I bought the Paramount Fair Trade Organic Peru Bean I never thought twice about the burnt coffee taste produced by my former choice of the past six years (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ53ZQ">Starbucks Espresso Roast Coffee (Bold), Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>) because I must have gotten used to it. This coffee is very delicious and regardless how strong a batch I brew it has never tasted "burnt." I feel as if I've seen the light and drinking coffee is a totally new experience with this fresh bean in my life.<br />Fun fact: the arabica bean featured by this coffee has substantially more caffeine than the Starbucks Espresso or French Roast because it was roasted for a shorter period of time and produces a better tasting coffee! (that is of course unless you throughly enjoy burnt coffee, in which case this is a judge free zone)

review/summary: Superb
review/text: This is a huge box of the finest tea money can buy. Sometimes I can't resist opening the box just for the heavenly aroma. One bag in 5 minutes brews a nice big 10 to 12 ounce mug. Other reviewers have basically said it all - a strong, dark blend which holds up to adding milk, sugar, etc. This is my first try with the Red label - before I had the Yorkshire Gold. After doing a side by side comparison of the two here is what I thought. As great as the Red is, the Gold is even better! The Gold is more refined & balanced, with a more lingering sweetness, and of course more expensive. Both are so smooth, with Red being a bit harsher though. Either one will titillate your senses with everything you love about tea, taking your enjoyment to the next level. Caution: you may get hooked on Yorkshire and never be able to go back to anything else. I've got about 100 perfectly good Dilmah ceylon bags sitting in the pantry, which is a great tea as well... but I keep reaching for the Gold... I mean, Red. Cheers!

review/text: There's a recipe on the back of the package for rice flour muffins - I follow it to make the best banana-blueberry muffins that are light and fluffy - just as good as wheat!  I usually mix the white rice flour with equal parts brown rice flour, and instead of 1/2 cup fruit juice, I use 3 overly ripe bananas - the recipe hasn't failed me yet!  Even better:  they freeze really well, so I can make a double batch and pop them into the freezer for later.<br /><br />I've also tried the pie crust recipe - it's OK - instead of rolling it out and trying to get it into the pie pan (it breaks apart too much) I just mix into a ball and smoosh it into the pie pan.

review/text: I use this for GF baking, I enjoy making a lot of recipes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1891105418">Easy Gluten-Free Baking</a>by Elizabeth Barbone, and the recipes typically depend on multiple rice flours as well as cornstarch, tapioca starch, and other products, most of which I get from Bob's Red Mill through Amazon.  I have found that all of the rice flours are of excellent quality, with no grittiness that you can sometimes see with rice products, have a long shelf life when stored in an airtight container and/or in the fridge, and I have never had any shipping problems through Amazon.  All the products have arrived well packaged and completely sealed in the box.  These flours produce high quality GF baked goods and savory meals when used in well-designed recipes and I've been really pleased with the results. The price here is also consistently better than I've seen at my local Whole Foods and Sprouts Market, so I'm a pretty happy customer.

review/summary: Must have for GF baking
review/text: I bought this because I found out recently that I have a gluten intolerance. Now I have to make all of my bread related foods. I also try to buy organic when possible. I was happy to find the rice flour available in bulk for a good price on the subscribe and save program. I typically blend this with other flours or nut meals since I also have adopted a low carb lifestyle. The product seems to be good quality and is one of the better substitutes for wheat flours in my experience so far. It has a mild taste compared to some bean flours I have tried and the consistency is decent in the finished product though it seems to have a bit of a crumbly texture. This will definitely be a staple in my pantry and I will buy this product again.

review/summary: Not What I Expected
review/text: I absolutely LOVE Orville Redenbacher Kettle Korn.  It hasn't been available locally for over a month, with no idea when it will be in stock again.  I tried making my own, but it was awful.  Finally, I find that Amazon will actually ship this (it's hit and miss for us overseas military folks).  So, I ordered 3 of these (that's a total of 90 bags).  I figured this would be more than enough to tide over my craving until it's available again locally.<br /><br />Well, I got two different batches and they are both awful.  Kettle Korn is buttery, slightly salty and slightly sweet.  A great 3-way combo.  Well, this stuff I got is just sweet and way, way TOO sweet.  They are bad batches.  I eat enough of this stuff to be able to tell the difference between a good and bad batch.  The two batches I got were the WORST batches I've ever had.<br /><br />I don't know if Amazon got these for a low price because they are "off" or what, but I will definitely not be buying any more.  As for the huge stock I have now, I have to add my own butter and salt to make it even slightly edible.  If I liked sweet, instead of salty, snacks, these would fit the bill.  As it is, it's disgusting.

review/text: I grew up with Cerelac and I love it. Since my baby was 4 months I used to add this cereal to his formula and today my baby is a big, strong and very healthy toddler. I wish it was easier to find it in the united states supermarkets. I highly recomed this cereal in every flavor, I am sure your baby will enjoy it!

review/summary: Best gluten free pasta yet
review/text: Trying to be gluten free is hard enough without forcing others in your household to eat gluten free meals too. This is the best gluten free pasta I've found that has been accepted by everyone I've fed it to. Just like other pasta, make sure you only cook it as long as it recommends. Any more than that and it's too soggy.

review/summary: Meyer Lemon Cupcake mix
review/text: I purchased Sweet Dreams Meyer Lemon cupcake mix from BJ's It sounded so good. I followed directions to a T for making in a 13X9 pan. The cake when baked did not rise at all. The mix's best by date is 08/28/13 so the mix is not old. Taste is good, but more of a cookie than a cake. Very costly cake mix, but not a good value.

review/summary: "sweet dreams" cupcakes might give you nightmares
review/text: I bake a lot. Let me rephrase that.... I bake A LOT. I usually bakes from scratch, but occasionally, in a fit of laziness, I may purchase a boxed mix. I was picking up a few things at BJ's recently and a combo of my sweet tooth and good photography got the better of me and I bought these. They sat in my pantry for almost two weeks before I finally decided to bake them tonight. First off, they need enough butter to make Paula Deen proud. Second, while they were baking, I was looking everywhere for burning electrical wire. I was completely convinced that my apartment would catch on fire at any moment. I made my husband get up and help me look for where the problem was. He got close to the oven and informed me that it was the cupcakes. Last but not least, they have a very bitter taste, almost like they were flavored with lemon oil and pith or a chemical, rather than lemon juice. I really wanted to like these but I just can't. Duncan Hines and Betty Crocker are both cheaper and better tasting than these :(

review/summary: Bacon Flavored Goodness! Definitely A Guilty Pleasure.
review/text: Let me be clear, I like bacon.  A lot.  There is no meat on the planet that is more perfect than bacon.  With that said, these croutons taste a lot like a nice smokey bacon.  I use them in salads, in soups, in chili or as a snack.  The croutons are nicely sized and pack a perfect crunch.<br /><br />What makes these even more awesome to me is that I have an allergy to MSG, so I have to avoid literally 90% of the flavored chips and snacks out on the market.  These little chunks of bacon joy pack NO MSG!  Many thanks to J&D for that, I just wish that all of their bacon flavored salts were MSG free as well.<br /><br />The bottom line is if you like bacon, you'll most likely enjoy these.

review/summary: Makes a great hair conditioner, grows hair.
review/text: Oh my goodness! This is a great product when used externally for hair growth. I would make a tea rinse with this by boiling in distilled water and a couple ounces of coconut oil, simmer for a few minutes, allow to cool, strain and pour over my pre-oiled hair. After saturating my hair with the oil, I would put on a plastic cap and go under a hooded dryer with medium heat for 30 minutes, wash out and deep condition my hair as I normally do. Results - soft and silky, strong and well conditioned hair. It gives my hair really good slip and makes it nice and shiny. I don't cook with this, I just like it for my hair.

review/summary: Maxwell House filter paks
review/text: I purchased this for an elderly parent who was having problems scooping coffee into a basket with a filter.  All they have to do with the filter paks, is put it in the basket and add the water to the coffee maker.  There is no more spillage, no coffee grounds to clean up and they can do all of this by themself which makes them feel more independant.  So glad Amazon offered this for purchase.  We could have it sent directly to the home.

review/summary: There was something wrong with this batch . . .
review/text: We've bought these before both at the grocery and through Amazon and usually, we've been pleased. We went to using these for the benefit of my mother, who lives with me and has Alzheimer's Disease in its mid stages. Making coffee is one of the little things she does as her part around the house. Just makes her feel good that she's the one that gets our mornings started and using the filter packs makes it so much easier for her. This order, however, began to show problems about half-way into the box. Coffee was weak. We could drink it, but it was noticeably weak. This past week (we used 2 packs a day for 8 cups) it was just awful. Today, we couldn't drink it. Like colored water.<br /><br />Yes, the thought came up that it might be the coffeemaker, so I poured out our cups and the pot then made another pot using Maxwell House out of the can (we always have Maxwell House in the house) with a regular filter, came out just right (bit of a shock to have real-strength coffee after three weeks with the lesser stuff, but it was good). So, I don't know if the filter paper had too much to it that the water couldn't penetrate it, or what was wrong. The amount of coffee in the filter packs seemed to be the right amount so I'm thinking it had something to do with the paper in the filter pack.<br /><br />So, we're done with filter packs because our morning coffee has to be good. I'll put the coffee in the filter, then Mother can do the rest. She'll still be the one that gets our mornings started but the filter pack idea isn't going to work anymore.

I was a little concerned when I first ordered this product because of the lack of photo, but it turned out fine.  Each filter pack is individually wrapped in separate packaging (like you would find in a hotel) and the 100 of them arrived in a large cardboard box.

review/summary: Incrediblely Great food with great results.
review/text: I order this food to try as it was grain free and I liked the ingredients listed on the site with the reviews. I opened the bag and the smell was incredible. It almost made me hungry lol. The dog loves it and is doing well on it.<br />  I start doing more research on the food and was very impressed. The owners of this food make sure ethoxyquin, BHA and BHT (which are knowing to cause cancer) are NOT used at all in the food. They make sure that the slaughter and processing plants do not use them either. That is great and it show that they care as well.<br />  I have communicated with the Petcurean and have been very impressed with them as well. I am really happy with this food. It has very good ingredients. he company is great. I highly recommended this good and I have tired several different grain free dog foods.  Plus my dog loves it.<br />  Thank you amazon. i would have never found it without amazon.

review/summary: Lucy loves it!
review/text: I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I am so happy with this food that I felt it was necessary! I was nearly at my wits end before I purchased this. When we adopted our Basset Hound, Lucy, a few months ago we started feeding her Innova from the get go. She had loose stools, but we figured it was just because it was a different food than what she ate at the rescue. We fed her pumpkin with the food, and she did great, but she also would not eat from then on without the pumpkin. We weened her off of the pumpkin, and as soon as we did she had loose stools/diarrhea again. Kept trying for a few weeks. It never let up, and she still had no real interest in eating the food at all. She would not eat for a day until she was starving. We nearly took her to the costly vet to see if she had some sort of digestive issue.<br /><br />We did some further research, and discovered that Innova was bought by P&G, and that there were many people that had been feeding for 10 years and suddenly started having loose stools so we decided it might just be the food. We immediately switched her to Petcurean Now!, and immediately her stool turned normal even though we did not phase it in. Lucy *loves* the taste of this food. We put it down, and she eats every last morsel without having to coax her. She is excited for meal time finally!<br /><br />I am so very content with this purchase. It is worth the slightly higher price tag if you want a happy, healthy dog.

review/text: Like many pet owners, our 7-month-old Lhasa pup suddenly is getting picky, picky about her food.  The Now Dry Puppy Food is the eighth brand (wet and dry) I have tried and I am holding my breath because she actually ate a helping of it and why I gave it a 4 star rating.  It is also wonderful to be able to buy it in smaller quantities than 6, 10 or 15 pound bags only to find out she will not eat it and we donate bag after bag of dog food to our neighbors. I don't believe she is allergic to any of the brands but I think she is holding out for a human food menu.  I have high hopes for the Now Puppy Formula and will update this review when there is a change-positive or negative.<br /><br />Update:  Once again I thought our picky eater pup was going to turn her nose up at NOW on the third day but when I laid some kibble on the floor, she gobbled it up.  She likes wet food and pieces of meat in her bowl and dry food on the floor.  This is our third Lhasa and this adorable pup provides us with so many first experiences. The hunt for the perfect food for our picky eater is over.  I feed her Redbarn Premium Variety Pack Food Rolls cut up in treat-size pieces for all day treats and lay NOW dry food and extra supplement cubes (all combined to equal her daily allowance) on the floor in her exercise pen for her to eat at her leisure until just after her last meal of the day and what is left is taken away and all food and treats are suspended until breakfast the next morning.

review/summary: Great sprout mix!
review/text: I use a Victorio VKP1014 4-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter to sprout these seeds and so far its been wonderful and tasty! I do soak them over night before putting them in my sprouter, and it only takes a day or two to sprout enough to eat though how many days really depends on your sprout growth preference. The amount of seeds that you get is definitely enough to last a bit even if you sprout everyday. So far all of my seeds have sprouted with no duds yet!

review/text: I absolutely love this oil. I use it often for many things including stove-top cooking and salad dressings. Though it says that the burning point is hotter than several other oils, I do not find that this oil does well in the oven. It burns quickly in the oven for me. BUT for everything else, the flavor is light and great. I especially love searing scallops in this oil, as they pick up the flavor very well. In addition, the saturated fat content is lower than even olive oil. Great product!

review/summary: Magnificent Matcha!
review/text: I am a new tea drinker and I am certainly new to the world of Matcha tea. But oh, what a wonderful world it is! After reading all the rave reviews for Red Leaf Tea's amazing flavor assortment of Matcha teas on Steepster, I took the plunge and ordered their "2 in 1" Custom Matcha Tea. I chose Caramel and Madagascar Vanilla for my flavors and I am so glad I did! I am not sure I can adequately describe how much I love this tea and these flavors.<br /> I had been a little apprehensive prior to ordering mainly because I had never heard of it before and it was so green. Even after it arrived, I didn't dive right into it. After a couple days I decided to make some and see what all the hype was about. One taste and I am hooked. The flavor is amazing! I had it hot and then I made some cold. They were both awesome! I mixed up a tumbler full for my daughter for her morning tea at work and she absolutely loved it. She said she thought it would also taste great in cupcakes and I agree! Now my wheels are turning about all the awesome ways I can incorporate this flavorful Matcha into recipes. On Red Leaf Tea's website they have some delicious recipes for smoothies, frappes etc that I can not wait to try. I love that there are so many possibilities of ways to use this tea besides drinking it (which is awesome in itself!).<br />I have been trying to diet but have a bit of a sweet tooth. Drinking this Caramel & Madagascar Vanilla was like having a dessert. I was totally satisfied. With a bit of sweetener added to these already uniquely superb flavors, this was like drinking a high calorie fattening dessert but was actually guilt free and healthy.<br />Finally, I definitely need to comment on the amount of energy I feel after drinking this tea. It is a really good energy not like a coffee or sugar rush. My whole transition from coffee and soft drinks to tea was to reap the vast health benefits associated with tea. I was pleasantly surprised when I read the various and significant health benefits of Matcha tea. Besides the antioxidants & cancer fighting properties, it also aids in weight loss and mood enhancement!<br />Great taste, health benefits and lots of ways to use it. It doesn't get better than that!<br />I highly recommend this brand of Matcha tea.

review/text: I use these with my Briel espresso machine. I like both the Espressione Classic (traditional espresso blend of arabica and robusta beans) and these 100% arabica. They taste slightly different, but I don't have a preference really. Good crema!<br /><br />Watch the prices though, the 150 pack boxes are much cheaper per pod and are sometimes on sale. Be aware of the expiration date on them, but I've found a few pods that were expired for years and were just fine (I wouldn't swear that they were as good as they would have been earlier, but they were perfectly acceptable).

I like saving money by making my own lattes, but don't want to take the time or deal with the mess of grinding beans.  These pods smell fresh when opened and are easy to clean up.  I recently bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F49XXG">De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>, and was inspired to expand my horizons beyond Starbucks espresso pods.  I tried a few different brands, and these are my favorite.  I find the flavor to be smooth and not bitter, and I get a good pull from my machine.  These are E.S.E espresso pods, made for espresso machines with E.S.E pod adapters.  They are not for Senseo or K-cups machines.

review/summary: Delightful, High Quality Extract
review/text: The previous reviewer is clearly confused.  An "extract" is the essence of the plant or fruit (orange, in this case), mixed with alcohol.  No alcohol, no extract.<br /><br />That said, this extract is excellent and an astonishing bargain at its current price of $6.99.<br /><br />The aroma is pleasant and, not surprisingly, smells just like oranges.<br /><br />It adds delightful orange flavor to any dish.  I made lemon poppy seed bread for Christmas and, instead of putting all lemon extract, put half lemon and half orange extract.  Every single person who ate the bread said it was the best they ever had.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the confused and uninformed reviewer, this orange extract is excellent.

My dog is 8lbs it takes him maybe 5 times @ 30 mins before there's nothing on the bone anymore, and even after the stuff is gone he gnaws on it a bit. I'm very happy my local pet place turned me on to these. I get them for him only every so often as a super special treat. : ). I'm really happy these exist. There is one drawback and that is the oily substance on them, if you have a long-haired dog, makes their facial hair kinda gross.
