review/summary: Lightly Flavored Pumpkin Latte
review/text: This pumpkin spice latte has a mild pumpkin aroma and is lightly flavored.  It makes a nice cremora top, just like the hot lattes you get in an expensive coffee house.  I've had it as an evening drink to warm me up and as a morning pick me up.  It's good any time of the day.  I prefer my drinks to be sugar free, but Maxwell House doesn't make very many of its flavored coffees sugar free.  Even so, it's only 60 calories when made with hot water.  And, you don't need to make this with milk because it already tastes like there's milk in it.  It could have a more bold spiciness to it and maybe a richer pumpkin flavor, which is how I prefer my pumpkin spice anything from drinks to pies.

review/text: Oh this is so good! I actually like it better than Duncan Donuts Pumpkin Spice Latte and you can make this right in your own kitchen!! Full of flavor--it's a warm treat. I even put an extra shot of instant coffee in for a little 'wake up' and it's great. The foam on top is just enough, not too much. I hope they have this all year and not just in the fall. YUMMY! Serve at Thanksgiving dinner!

review/summary: It's an autumn treat
review/text: Along with the falling leaves and nippy air comes a wonderful cup of coffee to celebrate the change of seasons. The Pumpkin Spice Latte is bursting with flavor and is a perfect companion to the shorter days and anticipation of holidays to come. It's amazing that so much flavor can be put into such a small package so easy to prepare and so satisfying to enjoy. Put the kettle on and pull up a chair, sit back and let your cares float away.

review/summary: Different
review/text: I am told that I like a little coffee with my milk and sugar so a sweet/pumpkin coffee did appeal to me.  It is a different flavor.  My first cup was a little watery and I was a bit dubious, but a second cup when I used a bit less water and added a little milk seemed to take care of that.  I'd probably have gone 4.5 stars if I had the option, I don't think it's the best flavored coffee I've ever had, but I think that most people tend to think if you go 4 stars that there was something "wrong" or "bad" about the product.  If you enjoy sweet flavored coffees and like pumpkin flavoring you'll love this one.  If you buy it, I hope you enjoy and thank you for taking the time to read my review.

review/summary: Surprisingly nice drink for the season
review/text: Now I'm a tea drinker and I will admit when I saw "pumpkin flavored coffee drink" I grabbed it up fully expecting to have my review set on `snark.' But having had it, I'm willing to eat humble pie, so long as there's a mug of this stuff with it.<br /><br />Fall in the north east and all sorts of pumpkin flavored/colored scented odds and ends come out. Many are disgusting but this one works. Just a few spoonfuls into a mug, pour over hot water and add just a little milk and it is a nice warm drink for a chill evening. The pumpkin flavor is present but not overwhelming. If anything the scent is like cinnamon sugar doughnuts and the texture is more like hot chocolate than coffee but it is a nice change from other drinks and certainly fits into the mood of the season.<br /><br />My wife, who is a coffee drinker also liked it saying the flavor was more consistent than the pumpkin coffee from a certain chain of doughnut shops and for about the price of one of their cups you get the whole box of powder here which will carry on for several mugs. It is gonig to be cheaper if you buy it in the supermarket than on line.<br /><br />So despite my hopes for a wonderfully snarky review, this tastes good, is on a par with or better than store bought special coffees and is more cost efficient. I guess I can live with the disappointment so long as I can have another mug.

review/summary: Love at first sip! (but costly)
review/text: I used to have International Coffee years ago but haven't had any in such a long time.  I am a pumpkin fanatic so I figured it was worth a try.  This stuff is absolutely heavenly however, $49.99 prime for a case of six doesn't seem reasonable to me.  Other offers are pretty much the same price when you add in the shipping they charge.  Some offers are even more costly because they are the same or similar price for only a four can pack.  Too bad because I logged in to order not just to review but not at that price.  I feel the price should be a good $10 less if you are buying a six can quantity.<br /><br />I am still giving it five stars because it tastes sooooo good.  Maybe I'll put it on my Christmas list!

review/text: I already drink the Cafe Viena, which was the only flavor I really liked; now I have two favorates! The pumpkin spice is really yummy, and I usually don't like pumpkin flavored foods. I used just a little less than suggested on the package and it was plenty sweet and flavorfull. I'm a black coffee drinker, so I don't like my flavored coffee too sweet. I love the spices. I will be buying this flavor again! It's worth a try, especially during the holidays.

review/summary: As good as ever
review/text: Years ago we used to drink these International Coffees all the time.  We especially loved the Orange Cappuccino.  But, for some reason we stopped buying it.  I was glad to give this a try, and I have to say the taste and quality are as good as I remember them.  The Pumpkin Spice Latte is just delicious.  It has all the spicy flavors you'd expect, and actually kind of has the taste of pumpkin pie. Once it's all stirred, it has a layer of foam on the top which is really pretty.  I'd suggest using a clear cup, like shown on the container, and maybe sprinkling some cinnamon or nutmeg on the top for a pretty holiday drink.  Not too much, though, because there is definitely lots of spice flavor already in the coffee.

review/summary: Tastes like fall!
review/text: We served this up as an after dinner drink one night and everyone liked it. The only problem with it is the same problem I have with almost any instant powder; it is hard to get any 2 cups to taste the same! The drink I had was too watery and the one my wife had was too strong. When you do get the flavor it tastes like fall to me. The aroma is wonderful and it tastes like the fall spices you use in pumpkin pie.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys autumn drinks.<br /><br />**edit**<br />My wife has found that adding it to a pot of coffee that you already made is even better than simply adding hot water! Now we both can really enjoy this as a creamer.

review/summary: Fits in well with all the other Maxwell House International coffees
review/text: I am a huge International Coffee fan, Vanilla Nut being my favorite, but my kids are pumpkin freaks so I figured I would try this.  Needless to say it was a big hit with them.  They have each enjoyed several mugs of this 'coffee' with a nice topping of whipped cream.  I tried it, and although I didn't dislike it, I just have never been a fan of pumpkiny, cinnamonny drinks.  Still, I didn't think it was chemical or fake tasting, just not my favorite. I believe it meets the standards of their other coffee drinks and if you have a penchant for this flavor, or just want to indulge in it because it is that time of the year for this flavor, then I would do so.  If it was the only coffee I had in the house, I would still drink it, but until my Vanilla Nut canister is empty, the kids can have this one.

review/summary: Tasty enough, but a few caveats...
review/text: First off, yes, this tastes pretty good. It's a nice blend of spicy pumpkiny flavors (though actual coffee taste is minimal), and there's a nice latte style head. It's creamy and delicious (and very sweet). But it doesn't dissolve very well -- you're going to have to work at it with a spoon for a while to get rid of the lumps. But you'll need the exercise to help kill the 60-calorie load, which, admittedly, is pretty minimal for something this yummy. My main complaint is the highly-touted "lock-in fresh pack," which, in *my* pack, wasn't a very good lock, since very time I tilted the "sealed" container, some powder came out. Also, if I were a regular drinker of this coffee, I'd be concerned about the price. It's a great deal to pay for a product that is primarily sugar.

review/summary: I love International Coffee!!
review/text: I have always been a fan of the International Coffees.  I did cut back on them because my favorites seemed to have a lot of fat and tons of sugar.  But, I love them just the same.  I like to save them for special occasions.  With the weather cooling off and the leaves starting to turn, the Pumpkin Spice Latte was calling my name!  This is a great seasonal treat.  The pumpkin taste is superb.  Mixed just right, you get a little froth.  There's 2 grams of fat per serving.  That's not too bad if you don't drink too much at a time.  I love the ease of preparing these coffees.  Heat water in a cup in the microwave and add mix!  Couldn't be simpler.  And it's soooooo yummy!  I'll be buying more of this flavor for the holiday season.

The flavor is excellent and I love that you can mix this with either milk or water depending on your taste preference. Bet this would even be good if you spiked it with rum.  My only concern is that you need to use 4 tsp. per mug, so it's bound ot go fast.

review/summary: Very Tasty!
review/text: Since their inception the Maxwell House International coffees have pretty much been the best coffee drinks available in their price range. The pumpkin spice is no exception. The spice flavor is hearty & bold but never overpowering the coffee itself. When mixed it has just the right amount of foam. A little whipped cream on top? Yea! It probably isn't a flavor you would want every day but with the variety of flavors Maxwell House has in their International line of coffee drinks you could go a long time without having the same drink twice. They hit another home run with this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

review/text: This is very yummy with a smooth and creamy texture and a subtle hint of pumpkin.  To ensure froth, we first add the power, then about 1/3 water to mix it into paste and finally finish off with the rest of the water and stir.  It's well-liked by my entire household.  The only thing I worry is the amount of sugar but it's not too bad of an indulgence.

review/summary: Mediocre with water, good with milk
review/text: At first I tried this coffee with boiling water and a little milk.  Unfortunately, the beverage seemed flat tasting, kind of sweet with good spice, but definitely missing something.  I tried other instant coffees before, and some are actually pretty full bodied, tasty versions (like Starbucks Via or Trader Joe's instant).  Once I tried this coffee with hot milk, however, this International Coffee was very flavorful, full bodied and perfectly sweet, almost as good as a Dunkin Donuts pumpkin spice hot coffee.  The only drawback to this tasty drink is the sugar content (about 24 grams per serving), but as an occasional drink or substitute for a candy bar, this sweet little beverage is a nice break from the norm.  I would just recommend heating up some milk instead of boiling water, or at least mixing the two in an even ratio.

review/summary: Perfect Hot Fall Beverage.
review/text: I grew up on the International Coffees, Cafe Vienna, Cafe Francais, Dark Mayan Chocolate, Orange Cafe, its what I grabbed if I didnt want regular coffee, or just plain hot chocolate.<br /><br />First off Maxwell House up and changed the can design. Im all for nostalgia, so when a company revamps thier look, I get a little sad. I understand the need, I just dont like it!<br /><br />Secondly, The Pumpkin Spice Latte is delicious. Just the right amount of pumpkin flavor. The directions say to use 4 tsp, I always use more, because I like it a bit stronger. It has a warm, spicy, smooth creamy taste. Comforting, and yummy, and so perfect for the weather that is starting to change to colder now (in florida that means going from the 90's to the 70's) I would buy this again for sure, I hope its not a seasonal flavor because I would drink this year round.

My seventeen year old son liked it so much he made a second cup right away.  I've not seen this in the stores yet, but I believe you can get this through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program at rather good deal.  It would make a nice gift for the holidays as well.  Combine this with a snowy afternoon, a good book and a fire in the fireplace for a cozy afternoon treat.

review/summary: Saves my money from the big chains!
review/text: I've been a long-time consumer of Maxwell House International Coffee drink mixes, but I had never tried the Pumpkin Spice Latte flavor before. I've always loved their mocha and "Vienna" flavors, so I was excited to try this seasonal flavor. It definitely hit the spot! It takes almost the same as the Starbucks version of the drink. The pumpkin flavor isn't overwhelming, it's mild, but I prefer it this way. The spice and sweetness are, in my opinion, just right.<br /><br />One thing I noticed about this mix specifically is that it foamed up at the top quite a bit more than any of the other flavors. I loved the foam on the top, just like a real coffee house latte.<br /><br />Whenever I buy these Maxwell House mixes at the store I cringe a little bit at the cost (I'm a cheapskate at the store), but then I always remind myself that I'm often willing to pay $5 a drink when I go to a coffee shop. So I have started to really prefer the Maxwell House mixes not only because it saves me money in the long run (one can costs less than one of my regular drinks at the shop!) and I can also be assured of the taste & quality ALL the time. It can be hit or miss at the coffee shop, sometimes the barista doesn't quite hit the mark on my drink and I end up disappointed and feeling like I wasted money.<br /><br />One thing I will say about this mix, as I've noticed with all Maxwell House International Coffees, is that I always end up using more mix than the directions say to use. Using the recommended amount makes for a weak drink. Also, I like some flavors made with water, some to be mixed in with actual coffee, and some are better made with milk. This is one I think does well with milk, perhaps it's the latte part?<br /><br />Having tried one of their seasonal flavors now I'm excited to try more, I think I'll branch out a little. I have never tried a Maxwell House mix I didn't like, so far! I also think these cans make for excellent treats, perfect for gift baskets, care packages, stocking stuffers, etc. I liked the size and the new label design. I won't hesitate to gift some this holiday season.

That is probably how I'll have it more often.<br /><br />If you like pumpkin spice, you will really enjoy this!  :)

review/text: Mixing this product exactly as directed using boiling water yields a rather thin drink. The balance of sweet to spice is good (not too sweet) and it foams up a good head as you stir.

Others might prefer to use milk to make it a little richer.<br /><br />Allover, a tasty product nice to have on hand for the holidays.

I don't drink a lot of coffee, but when I do I want it fast and with little hassle. I'm all for being able to toss a few teaspoons of coffee mix into a mug, adding in hot water, and getting back to more important things--as long as it tastes good and once again Maxwell House did not disappoint. The Pumpkin Spice latte is delicious and may have just become my favorite of the line. Even better is that it comes in the slightly larger 9-ounce container (versus the 8.4-ounce one).

review/summary: Creamy, rich, pumpkin spiced and not overly sweet
review/text: Remember those International Cafe powdered hot drink mixes from the 90's when lattes were first becoming a popular mainstream thing?  Apparently they still make those.  It's Maxwell House International Latte Pumpkin Spice.  It genuinely tastes like a real latte with pumpkin spice flavor and it actually has foam on top.  I don't know how they do that but it makes a tiny fizz sound when you add the water.  The directions say four tsps per six to eight ounces of boiling water but that you can customize your flavor by adding more.  I found the four tsps in eight ounces very weak, clear and watery.  Five wasn't enough either, six was getting there but I found seven was the closest to getting the full strength correct.  So that comes to 105 calories and I think that's fairly low for a treat when compared to a Starbucks latte for example.  It's not overly sweet with mostly coffee, cream and subtle pumpkin spice flavors.  I really enjoyed it on this fall afternoon.

Made according to the directions with 4 teaspoons of powder and 6 ounces of boiling water, it was too weak.  I had to double the amount of mix for it to taste decent, but then the carbohydrate count became 22 grams with the sugar at 16 grams (doubled).  I'd rather have a slice of pumpkin pie. I didn't taste the slightest hint of coffee either. This is the first time I've ever poured a coffee drink down the drain.

All of the many Fall flavors of pumpkin are lovely...  and this pumpkin spice latte, easy to make with hot water or hot milk (do the milk!) is very tasty, and a nice companion to the many other pumpkinificent flavors of the season.

review/summary: Perfect for holiday guests
review/text: These coffees are usually too sweet for my taste, and this one is no exception. However, the Pumpkin spice flavor blends nicely with the creamer in this mix, and makes a nice treat for a morning visit with a friend or for a quick pick-me-up after holiday shopping. Easily and quickly, you have a special holiday treat to enjoy with a pumpkin muffin. If you want more coffee flavor and to tone down the sweetness, try adding a teaspoon of instant coffee to the mix before pouring in the hot water. This is a holiday special, so if you like it enough to drink it all winter, stock up!

review/summary: Great taste; Zero health
review/text: So this is the type of drink that's good for the occasional "treat." It's extremely flavorful (quite delicious actually!). It definitely gets me in the mood for fall and the winter holidays.<br /><br />However, the FIRST ingredient listed (the one in greatest proportions) is sugar. I personally think sugar has slowly been worked into daily consumption in the US society in disturbing amounts. In the last year I've sought to eliminate all sugar from my diet; anyone who starts reading the labels on every food item they buy will be shocked to note that sugar is in nearly EVERYTHING.<br /><br />I'll be sharing this drink with others (everyone has given it high reviews on taste) but I don't think it's healthy for any sort of regular consumption. A for taste; F for health. Is it too much to hope for a meeting of the two? I don't think so.

review/summary: Dude, where's the coffee??
review/text: As I sit here drinking my Pumpkin Spice Latte, I'm enjoying the experience.  It's a very sweet drink - I hate to think how much sugar must be in here - and the cinnamon spice is very pleasant.  It's not quite a pumpkin flavor to me, but a more generic 'holiday spice' type of blend.  But it's nice.<br /><br />There's very little coffee taste in this drink, though.  I didn't notice any and I was looking for it.  Too bad.  I think that the slight bitterness of the coffee would have really helped balance the sugary sweetness, and made this an even better drink.<br /><br />In terms of replicating a latte, I was really impressed by how foamy the drink was - and how long the foam lasted.  Another reviewer mentioned that it was an excellent substitute for a mug of hot chocolate, and I agree...this Pumpkin Spice Latte has a similar creaminess and mouth-feel to hot chocolate.<br /><br />Oh, it's also worth mentioning that the original serving amount - 4 teaspoons in a mug - was very weak and watery.  I kept adding more powder until the drink felt right, and I reckon I must have doubled the dosage amount.

review/summary: Not Bad for Instant Coffee
review/text: I was pleased with the fact that this stuff was not overly sweet, and the pumpkin spice flavor was rich. The powder didn't clump, and it really was frothy and nice like a Latte, just like it said it would be. It's not exactly mind blowing, but I actually enjoy it and find it easily augmentable with sugar, milk, etc., or even a little fresh brewed.

review/text: I'd say it's more like an alternative to hot chocolate: no real coffee taste that I could distinguish, but a nice, homey, warming flavor as you drink it.<br /><br />As with other instant blends, you have to play around a bit with the mix-to-water ratio, but when you get it right, this is an altogether pleasant drink to help you wind down at the end of a stressful day. Or even in the middle of one.

review/summary: Weak or unhealthful
review/text: When made according to the directions on the container, which is 4 teaspoons to a cup (8 ounces) of boiling water, the result has no coffee flavor that I could detect, so calling it latte is misleading.<br /><br />I made a second batch of Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte, 9-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4) using about FIVE times as much powder and nearly boiling skim milk, which made it more flavorful and less weak-tasting, of course, but I still detected no coffee flavor, just spices that I think include cinammon and nutmeg.<br /><br />The mixture either way does produce a foam on top, even without stirring, which is interesting.  As time passes and you drink the level down the foam remains on top (albeit with ever-shrinking bubbles over time).<br /><br />I will not replace this product, and I subtract 3 stars from 5 because of its high price per unit of mouth-pleasure to me and its low flavor and its low healthfulness ratio when used at full-flavor strength and its high degree of coffeelessness.<br /><br />However, unlike some previous reviewers, I subtract no stars because it does not smack of pumpkin flavor.  I'm not sure, which is noteworthy, but I don't think this powder was ever designed to smell or taste or look or feel or sound like pumpkin.  The label on the container is confusing, and it differs from the name of the product on the Amazon description page, but either way I think it is not supposed to taste like pumpkin.  I confess I chose this product because I thought it would taste like pumpkin, which is a flavor I like.  Sometimes in the heat of the moment choosing products I make mistakes:)<br /><br />However -- just to be clear -- whichever name you use there's no doubt it is said to be a latte, which is by definition the flavor of coffee with milk and which, as I said, it does not taste of which at all to me.<br /><br />However, it does make for a good addition to a pumpkin smoothie.  The spices add a fine kick, and for this off-label use I add back 1 star.<br /><br />However, if you decide to use the product this way, keep in mind that the first two ingredients are sugar and non-dairy creamer, which presumably means you'd want account for them in your recipe.<br /><br />Anyway, having so much left over, I decided to try some off-label uses, and here's what I found.<br /><br />-- If you sprinkle on and rub in 2 teaspoons of this powder on each side of a one-inch-thick, 24-ounce ribeye steak and sear it for 2 minutes on a side in a little butter and olive oil and then bake it at 400 F for another 6 minutes or so till it reaches an internal temp of around 120 degrees F and then let it rest for 3 minutes in a loose aluminum-foil tent so the juices can resorb throughout the meat, the dog will eat it.  If you do all that to a second 24-ounce ribeye steak and then cut it into pieces that are small enough, the cat will eat some.<br /><br />People will not.<br /><br />-- As a substitute for a gasoline additive such as STP, this product is not successful.  It turns out you should really not pour several ounces of what is more sugar and non-dairy creamer than anything else into your 1994 Thunderbird's gas tank unless you have an extra several hundred dollars lying around to pay for the expense of removing all traces of it from what turn out to be many, many parts of your car.<br /><br />-- As a substitute for a natural fertilizer such as manure, for most U.S. farmers this will prove to be too expensive.  If you need as little as 500 pounds of real manure per acre, for example, you will need over $3,600 worth of Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte, 9-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4) for that same acre.<br /><br />The Amazon description page for the 9-ounce package says each ounce costs 91 cents, which means $14.56 per pound, which means $7,280 for 500 pounds.  Even if we reduce that by 50% for a quantity discount, that's still $3,640 per pound, which in terms of manure is exactly 2.1333 orders of magnitude higher, which is why you don't see a lot of reviews from farmers who've tried this as I have.  Also, all the crops you raise on land you treat this way and all the animals you let graze on it for the next five years will die.<br /><br />-- The empty container, according to embossing on the bottom of it which no other reviewer seems to have noticed, is both diswasherable on the top rack and non-microwavable.

review/summary: The candy version of Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte
review/text: I was first concerned about the ingredients of this beverage when I read its vague disclaimer:  "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product."  Ingredients were not listed at Amazon, but according to this even if I looked them up on the product site they may be inaccurate??  That's no help to someone with a food intolerance.  In reality, the ingredients of individual products aren't listed on the Maxwell House site at all.<br /><br />I ordered it anyway, and of course the first thing I notice in the ingredients is an unsourced "maltodextrin," which is a problem for people who require a gluten-free diet.  Further, below the ingredient list where the allergen warning is it says only "milk."  That either means that their source of maltodextrin is clean, or they don't know.  To be on the safe side, I would urge those with Celiac to steer clear of this beverage.<br /><br />That said, the next thing I noticed is the partially hydrogenated coconut oil, corn syrup solids, and the high amount of sugar.  Definitely not something to have on a regular basis.  Adding water to the mix  it crackled.  Beyond that, there was no latte-like foam, as the packaging indicates.<br /><br />The spice flavor was OK--I personally like that aspect to be pretty strong in such drinks.  There was no pumpkin flavor, and almost no coffee flavor.  Beyond that, it was way too sweet.  I added more of the mix, but it only got sweeter, not more flavorful.  Indeed, it tastes like the candy version of the Starbucks product.  After two sips I was finished.<br /><br />In all, the spice flavor is good, but that's it.  The vague labeling and high amount of things I don't normally consume are enough to put me off of it.  If you aren't worried about that and crave a warm, milky spice beverage, this may be the one.

review/summary: Doesn't Have a 'Latte' Flavor
review/text: I have enjoyed Maxwell House's latte products but, don't like the flavor of this one.  Making it to the manufacturer's specifications, I mixed in 1 1/3 tablespoons (that's 4 teaspoons)to 6-8 ounces of water.  The foamy top layer looked good, just like a restaurant latte.  But, the proof is in the aroma (light pumpkin spice scent) and the drinking.  I did not taste the coffee at all.  In fact, it was more of a tea-like flavor.  Too weak.<br /><br />Reading the ingredients list is a sojourn into a science class.  To paraphrase an old TV commercial, it's 'better living through chemistry'.  Chemists have created many products that mimic natural ones--just not this one.<br /><br />While I like pumpkin pie, pumpkin spice scented candles and the like, I don't care for this drink.  And neither did two others who tried it.

review/summary: Good made with water, better with milk
review/text: It's been years since I tried an International Coffee flavor, and I find that the brand has definitely improved. Years ago, their coffees had a bitter aftertaste that I didn't like. I didn't find that problem with Pumpkin Spice Latte. Yes, it's instant coffee and as such not quite as good as coffee made the regular way, but I enjoyed the pumpkin spice flavor and the ease of preparation. I made it first with boiling water, adding coffee creamer after it was made. Then I tried making it with hot milk. I definitely liked the latter version better. The coffee has a nice foam on top and takes just a couple of minutes to make. A good choice when you're in a hurry or at your desk.

review/summary: Great Holiday Latte To Celebrate This Season of Joy
review/text: Maxwell House offers a great twist on a holiday treat; pumpkin spice latte. I can't think of a more appropriate drink for this season, with the possible exception of hot apple cider. However, potential consumers should be forewarned, I would recommend modifying the instructions by using only two, maybe three, heaping teaspoons - depending on your own personal taste - in making a drink; otherwise, you may find the taste a bit too robust in pumpkin spice flavor. While it is best served with hot water, one can get by stirring these spoonfuls in room temperature water. Some may view this as a less desirable drink for the holiday season, but I can't think of one as suited for a Thanksgiving dinner as this.

review/summary: Cinnamon Latte
review/text: The predominant flavor of this drink is of a latte with cinnamon.  There is just a hin of coffee and pumpkin flavor in this mix.  For 2 cups of hot water, what my mug holds, I need 2 heaping tablespoons to get full flavor from this mix.  It's also very lightly sweetened so I usually have to add sugar.  Some may not need to do this, though.  The mix is also very powdery and needs to be stirred for a while before it fully incorporates into the hot water.  And lastly, the container is made of some sort of reinforced cardboard.  The tins were definitely better in my opinion.  But all in all, I'd have to say that this is a nice treat to enjoy this holiday season.

review/summary: OK in a pinch, but otherwise, "meh".
review/text: My wife is a big fan of Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte, so when I saw this item crop up, I got her one, thinking it might be something that could satiate her cravings for the Starbucks cup of the same flavor.<br /><br />The report back from her was "it's a good thing you got that from Amazon Vine, and didn't pay for it, because if you did, I would have said you wasted your money."  Asked her if it was really THAT bad, and she said, "Well, if you have no other coffee in the house, it's OK, but otherwise it wasn't very good".<br /><br />So from someone who is a big fan of Pumpkin Spice Lattes, this gets a thumbs down from the wife.<br /><br />Additionally, if you look at the list of ingredients on the side, pumpkin is not one of the ingredients.  Just a lot of words like "Maltodextrin" & "Dipotassium Phosphate".  Uh, hello?  Pumpkin in a pumpkin spice flavoring, please?

review/summary: Perfect drink for a chilly day
review/text: I remember the Maxwell House International Coffees from about a decade ago and all I remember is the flavors sounded so great but the tase was always subdued and watery.  Luckily all that has changed with their updated International Lattes.  I was surprisingly happy with this product.  First time I made it was with water and though tasty I found it a little disappointing.  So I tried it with milk instead and everything changed.  What a delicious, frothy and luscious drink.  The good news is it in no way tastes artificial.  All the flavors, spices and coffee blend together perfectly.  The touch of cinnamon and pumpkin is delicious and in no way overpowering.  I found that with the milk the expected frothy foam with a latte was light, airy and added the needed final touch to this tasty latte.<br /><br />The flavor here of the pumpkin spice does lend itself more to holidays or chilly, cold days or nights but if it is your preferred flavor you may like it year round.  I only took off one star for it does take a little bit of configuration to decide how to make it to your liking.  But once you do, rest back, sip and enjoy this superb latte.  The days of the watered down International coffees is gone.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Not bad, but not impressed
review/text: I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I enjoy the occasional cappucino or latte. In general, I've had good luck with the store-brand instant-mix cans, so I gave this a whirl. Maxwell House is definitely one of the more recognizable coffee brands, so I was expecting it to be at least marginally better than a generic.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I made a few cups of this with warm milk, and although I was not impressed, I'm not going to say it was bad either. It was a little thick, and while the cinnamon flavor definitely came through, I could not really sense the pumpkin in it. We subsequently made some cups using water instead of milk, which made the drink much thinner but also let the pumpkin flavor be a little more prominent.<br /><br />If this product was a little cheaper, I'd give it four stars, but for the current price (over thirty bucks for four cans, coming out to almost a dollar per ounce), I expect much better than a taste comparable to the bargain brands I normally buy.

review/summary: Perfect for a cold morning!
review/text: I expected this to be sweeter, or more syrup-y like other flavors and varieties I have tried.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It's a good balance of flavor and sweetness.  The pumpkin is not overwhelming - you can taste and smell it, but it doesn't overpower your palate. The perfect touch of sweetness keeps you from feeling like you're trying to drink syrup first thing in the morning, and compliments the pumpkin flavor without making it candy-like. I got a different taste when I microwaved the water as opposed to stove-top boiling.  I prefer the boiling water method, which is in the directions. My only complaint is how much you have to use - it's 4 tsps of powder for 6 to 8 ounces of water, so it doesn't last long if you make it your new morning wake-up. Overall, I like this a lot and am sure it will be making many more appearances alongside my morning muffin.

I pretty much adore anything pumpkin and I was disappointed with this version from International Coffee.  The pumpkin flavor is barely there - there is more predominant flavors of the spicing in pumpkin pie rather than pumpkin itself.<br /><br />The product itself is OK.  It does foam up like promised but I found it hard to get everything to mix properly and even after a lot of stirring was left with clumps of mix in my cup.<br /><br />This will do in a pinch and with some doctoring could be rather tasty but honestly I'd probably put my money towards getting some pumpkin syrup and making my own.

review/summary: Nice, not particularly healthy
review/text: I will start by listing the ingredients, which are not - at this point - given under the product description:<br /><br />(1) Sugar,<br />(2) creamer (corn syrup solids, partially hydrogenated  coconut oil, sodium caseinate (from milk), dipotassium phosphate, mono- and diglycerides, artificial flavor),<br /><br />(3) whey,<br />(4) maltodextrin,<br />(5) instant coffee,<br />contains less than 2% of<br />(6) cinnamon,<br />(7) ginger,<br />(8) natural and artificial flavor,<br />(9) cellulose gum,<br />(10) sodium citrate,<br />(11) modified cornstarch,<br />(12) silicon dioxide.<br /><br />I lined them up that way to make reading easier, especially so you can see the list that describes the creamer contents. For me this kind of hot drink is an occasional thing, especially for days when I've already had my normal unadulterated java and want something different. So I'm not terribly concerned about its health merits. You may want to note that this is a product of Kraft Foods.<br /><br />I found the taste pleasant, mostly creamer which I normally avoid, with the pick-me-up of coffee and flavor enjoyment of light pumpkin pie-type spices. On the second use a week later, I got the ratio of powder to water right. It takes a lot. The powder dissolves reasonably easily - some encouragement with the spoon was needed to break up a few clumps, and use of a milk frother would easily take care of that. The stuff forms its own convincing latte-type crema; a frother not needed there. Not bad, nice for the season and to offer guests, not mine for everyday but really enjoyable on a chilly afternoon when the coffee's all gone.

review/summary: Creamy, pumpkin-y and delicious!
review/text: Disclaimer: I really like sweet coffee-beverages, and am a sucker for "flavored coffee drinks".  If you don't like this sort of thing, stop reading: this product is not for you!<br /><br />But, if you like sweet, flavored coffee type drinks, this is surprisingly good.  I figured it was going to be cloyingly sweet, but it actually made a rich, pumpkin-spicy, milky drink, that didn't actually seem very coffee-like, but almost more chai-like when made with water.  After a full cup, I didn't feel that it was overpowering and was very satisfied, for something that is only 60 calories per serving.  I don't think this would make an ideal everyday drink, but as an occasional treat, it was delectable.  I also tried adding a spoonful to black coffee and that was also quite delicious--it creamed the coffee nicely and gave it a pleasant but subtle pumpkin (pie) flavor.  What was nice is that I could do this with only 1 scoop (instead of 4 needed to make the drink from water), and it didn't leave any smells/flavors in our coffeemaker which my wife hates when making flavored coffee.  So this is a neat way to get a different flavor in your coffee as well as being able to be made with water or milk.<br /><br />In sum, a tasty, well-balanced product, that makes something of a chai with water, something more latte-like with milk, and a delightful flavored coffee when added to black coffee.  It's worth a try for sure and I will likely buy it again for the occasional treat.

review/text: This "International Coffee" is sweet and delicious, but it should be: the first ingredient is sugar, and the next is a coffee lightener with corn syrup solids as ITS first ingredient.  So, if you enjoy the fancy lattes at Starbucks and such places, don't hesitate to buy this as a much-cheaper alternative, since their drinks are just as sugar-rich and calorie-dense.  Just don't overlook that, unlike ordinary coffee with a little milk and sugar, this beverage is indeed an "indulgence" which you will see on your waistline if you drink it daily.

review/summary: Lovely flavor, but is it healthy?
review/text: The flavor of this latte is a delight, a creamy pumpkin taste with a slight touch of cinnamon and ginger (less than 2%).  What could be nicer?  I found myself wishing I had a piece of pumpkin pie to accompany the latte.  That would be ideal.<br /><br />However, I would be concerned about having it on a daily basis because of the inclusion of partially hydrogenated coconut oil as when coconut oil is hydrogenated it becomes a trans fat, and trans fats have been closely associated with heart disease.  Nevertheless, it is stated that trans fat is 0 (how can that be?) and saturated fat is 2g (10%).  I would also like to know the percentage of instant coffee in the latte.<br /><br />One serving is 60 calories (not bad!) and of the 60, 20 calories are fat.  Sodium is 60 mg (not bad), total carbs 11g, sugars 8g and protein 1g.<br /><br />I felt when drinking this latte like I was having a treat.  No harsh coffee taste and no harsh after effect.  The directions say to serve it in a mug with four teaspoons of latte.  I personally like it a bit stronger, so I had it in a somewhat smaller cup and added a little more latte.<br /><br />Um-Um-good!

When the leaves start turning (or if you just wish they were) Pumpkin Spice Latte is a fun, simple treat.<br /><br />The coffee is super easy to make: just add hot water. The directions also say you can add hot milk. I'll give you one of my favorite twists: add a scoop of pumpkin spice mix to your morning cup of Joe for a little treat. I keep several flavors on hand to flavor my coffee depending on my mood.<br /><br />I find a little less is more with these coffees. They can be a little too sweet if you use too much powder. But a few trials and I am sure you can find the flavor level that is best for you. Also the mix does contain powdered milk just in case dairy is an issue.<br /><br />This a great coffee when the weather starts to get crisp, try some of this delicious Pumpkin Spice latte.

review/summary: Not Starbucks...but worth it in a pinch!
review/text: The "good" about the product is it is creamy, with a pumpkin spice taste.  It mixes well with water and is even better with whipped cream on top!  The product can be mixed "more" or "less" for taste.  The picture on the can is truly what you get less the sprinkles.  This is not as good as Starbucks, but if you're snowed in this winter it will truly come in handy!<br /><br />The "bad"...the can.  I'm not sure what made the company switch from the former "can" to the new plastic container but it is not near as good.  The new "plastic" containers lid does not seem to fit tight.  When you press on the red lid the top of the container air pushes in and out.  The old "can" container appeared more secure, more air tight.  I suppose they assume you will want to make the entire container in a few days but I did not like the new "improved" design.

review/summary: Good!
review/text: I enjoyed this drink, however it did not have a lot of coffee flavor. Then I made it with my brewed coffee... yum! Just as soon as you add it in it foams up. It was just the right amount of spice, and not too sweet for me, usually the instant coffees are too sweet. I will enjoy this whole container!

I particularly enjoy with hot milk as opposed to boiling water.  The<br />milk makes it taste so much richer, better.  Give it a try.  You will love this if you are a<br />pumpkin pie fan.

review/summary: Perfect Cold Weather Drink For Coffee Lovers
review/text: I have to be honest.  I am hopelessly addicted to pumpkin!  I have loved pumpkin from the time I was a little girl and I still love it so I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try this product.  I received the Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte in a small container that was sealed with foil under a plastic cap.  When I opened the container and removed the foil I could really smell the pumpkin and spices.  I followed the directions to prepare the drink. This included 6-8 ounces of boiling water and four teaspoons of the powder.  As I stirred the powder and hot water together a cap of foam formed on the top of the liquid.  I've never tried a Maxwell House International Coffee before so I was amazed that a powdered latte could produce foam like a coffeehouse drink.<br /><br />When drinking the latte I noticed that the liquid had a somewhat weak flavor.  It is recommended that you adjust the amount of powder and water to get the right taste so I added two more teaspoons of the powder.  This made for a richer latte.  My only concern with this product is that the pumpkin flavor is not as intense as the smell of the powder.  As a self-confessed pumpkin addict I would have preferred the pumpkin taste to be stronger but most people would not care.  Overall, this is a fantastic product that looks and tastes like a coffeehouse pumpkin latte and I will certainly purchase more cans for my cupboard!

review/summary: Not Starbucks but Not terrible
review/text: I live a good hour & half from an actual coffee house, so for a sweet cup of seasonal frothy goodness that doesn't need to be brewed this is actually pretty good.<br /><br />If I take it for what it is my only complaint is the new all plastic tub the International coffee drinks now come in. The lid is ill-fitting so the slightest squeeze or placing this on the counter with even a gentle thump will illicit a cloud of drink mix into the air.<br /><br />I'm sure the plastic tubs are economically more feasible & easier to recycle, but oh how I miss the tins and their reliable seal.

review/summary: A dessert beverage
review/text: This is the first time I've had Maxwell House International beverages.  I'm a huge fan of pumpkin spice and wanted to try this.  It recommends using 4 teaspoons of mix to 6 to 8oz of boiling water.  I used 7oz and it just tasted too watered down for me.  Next I tried 6oz of hot skim milk and tasted too rich.  Next time I'm going to mix water and milk to get the right richness for me.  I enjoy the frothy top and the hint of pumpkin and spice but am surprised in the lack of coffee flavor.  If I had to choose, I'd pick going to Starbucks for their seasonal pumpkin spiced latte for the bolder flavor of pumpkin and coffee.  But, this has the convenience of home.

review/summary: Even weaker than most flavors, just okay
review/text: Maxwell House's latte mixes always suggest 4 tsp of powder for 6-8 oz of water (3/4 to 1 cup).  I have always found this to be completely inadequate and the resulting beverage very weak in flavor.  So, I wasn't surprised with the pumpkin spice latte had no flavor when prepared according to the directions.  I kept adding more and more powder.  By the time I had doubled the powder, it tasted fine, but was nothing special.  Adding any more powder would have made it too sweet, but there was still not enough spice to it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this flavor; Maxwell House has better flavors of latte and cappuccino.  Just remember that they will typically require more powder than the directions claim.

review/summary: Very Sweet, Like Hot Chocolate with Some Pumpkin Flavor
review/text: Though the spice is not as strong as a latte you'd get from Starbucks, this is a decent tasting Pumpkin coffee latte. It's very sweet and tastes more like Swiss Miss hot chocolate with some pumpkin flavor thrown in. The only thing I'm not happy with is how much corn syrup, sugar and artificial colors it takes to make this product, as listed on the label. It's like fast food that tastes good but you know it's really not healthy for you. So while it tastes OK, I wouldn't have it on a regular basis - if you're looking for an organic and a more natural product, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Revamped, reformed, completely awesome!
review/text: Admittedly, I was quite skeptical when ordering this item because, quite frankly, all of the other International Coffee products I've tried over the past 20 or so years, have literally made me ill.  Possibly because of the 5 pound sack of sugar in every drop but, lo and behold, Maxwell House bought them out and actually made this a great product!  I've had pumpkin lattes at both Starbuck's and Panera Bread and this product, no kidding, rivals them both!  It's honestly better than Starbucks and is almost equal to Panera's.  It's honestly that good and coming from me, you can believe that!  It has a very smooth, creamy top that seems to be from a latte machine (so, how do they do that?).  Just a nice, warm drink on a blustery fall day, not overly flavored with cloves either, just in case you're wondering about that spice.  Clove seems to cause problems with other products with pumpkin, leaving that weird, almost as if you've eaten licorice feeling in your mouth.  In addition, I'd like to know why it makes that popping sound when you put a teaspoon of the product into the water?)<br /><br />The one thing that Maxwell House hasn't solved is the problem they have with dissolving all of the product into the water.  That problem is still there and I suppose you could solve that with an electronic hot beverage mixer such as Mr. Coffee produces.  Also present is problem number 2 with International Coffees: you have to use at least 10 teaspoons to get the stuff to taste like anything.  They haven't changed that yet either.  I used 9 teaspoons in about 8 ounces, if that gives you some idea.  If you drink a mug of about 12-16 ounces, you'll only get about 5 cups out of this package.  Teacups, and I mean the kind that are used in England, you'll get about 20 cups from it.  But our large American mugs are going to require a great number of teaspoons to keep it from tasting like colored water.<br /><br />Other than that, I really like this product - so much so that I'm going out to buy more.  Something I've never done with International Coffee before.  Well done, Maxwell House and as Teddy Roosevelt said years ago, it's "Good to the last drop."

review/text: I am a coffee drinker; I like it black.  But occasionally, I do enjoy a cup of latte.  I put 4 tablespoons of this Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte in a cup and added a cup of boiling water.  On the first few sips, I tasted sugar, milk, and malt, amid the favor of coffee beans.  I did detect a faint favor of pumpkin spice, but I wouldn't have if I hadn't read the words "Pumpkin Spice" on the label.  It was quite good for an instant latte.  I like it.  I will order a pack when I finish this can.

review/text: OK, it's not Starbucks, but it's close and it's instant!  This is a really good pumpkin latte.  There's a nice creamy top to it, and has just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and kick of cinnamon.  The perfect Fall drink.  Four stars instead of five because Maxwell House has changed it's packaging from a recyclable tin to a number 5 (and therefore un-recyclable in most areas) plastic.

review/summary: Yum, but...
review/text: Maxwell House International is famous for its yummy coffee treats, and this is another wonderful flavor just in time for fall and the cool weather of October.<br /><br />The smell and taste are wonderful in the pumpkin spice latte. The directions say to mix with hot water, and the product disolves very quickly with no lumps or problems mixing. There is a wonderful foamy look, just like a professional latte, to the drink, and the taste is good.<br /><br />However, I found it a little on the thin side when mixed with water. I tried the directions, then even tried using more, but it was not as satisfying as I wanted. The company website suggests adding this to hot milk, but I didn't want to go that direction. So then I tried adding it to black coffee and it was excellent! Maybe I just wanted a little more kick, but when added to hot coffee, it was just what I wanted and had that feel in the mouth of a really luxurious drink. What a treat!

review/summary: Very Good, Complex, and Creamy Latte Quality
review/text: Both my wife and I like this pumpkin spice latte.  It has a more complex mix of flavors that is more than just one note.  Most notably is the latte aspect that seems quite milky or creamy which is nice.  The actual coffee aspect (like most mixes like this) is minimal, but it does contain instance coffee (according to the ingredient list).  It is not a caffeine jolt like a strong coffee and does not taste of strong coffee, but I wouldn't expect that.  Between the sugar, fat, and small amount of coffee it is maybe a gentle boost.  It is a creamy mix of flavors that surround a pumpkin pie spice.  However both my wife and I would say we "like", not "love" this.  Still very good and happy to have it on occasion.<br /><br />The biggest drawback to me is the fat content, with a 10% DV of saturated fat (although only 3% DV total fat).  The 4% DV carbs (8g sugars) is okay in my book.  It makes me think twice about having a cup, and think about what else I was going to have that same day, and certainly not daily or multiple in a day.  So within moderation, one cup of this now and then around the Halloween & Thanksgiving holidays seems a nice treat.  It isn't terribly bad for you, but in my book cannot be ignored.  Of course check what your alternative was going to be, if your next choice was something using a creamer with equal or more fat content, then this consideration is a moot point.  But this is just based on the 1 1/3 tbsp serving size and you are likely to use a bit more.<br /><br />Do use the 4 teaspoons (or more) recommended for 6-8oz.  For 6oz, I found 4 to be ideal to taste great.  They don't clarify what kind of teaspoons, level or heaping, so I assume level or slightly rounded.  4 slightly rounded seems to yield a very good drink.  But I think it adds up to more than the serving size of 1 1/3 tbsp.  But you cannot really cut down to stretch the mix or lower the %DV.  We have tried 3 rounded tsp in 6oz on three occasions and always find it to be too watery and always needs that extra tsp.  If you are going to have 3, you really need to put in the 4th to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I have to compare to a another pumpkin spice coffee that we think is heavenly.  We absolutely love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Z6ZGZU">Green Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice (K-Cups)</a> mixed with 1 or 2 tbs of International Delight, fat free, french vanilla, coffee creamer, found in your refrigerator section of grocery stores.  The fat free version has 0% fat and 2% carbs per tbs.  I always use 2 tbs, so compared to a serving size of this, they are both 4% carbs, but I save the fat.  The pumpkin spice K-cup with this is just heavenly, but much more of a single note flavor that is the pumpkin pie spice and creamy in a simpler way.

review/summary: Great Tasting Alternative to Your Normal Latte
review/text: I really love the taste of this Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte. It is slightly sweet, but not overly sweet. It is frothy and does taste like a latte to me. It has a decent pumpkin and cinnamon taste that is not overbearing and it does not taste like coffee. I personally do not like the taste of coffee, so this is a good thing for me. If you are looking for coffee with a hint of pumpkin, then this is not for you.<br /><br />The recommended serving is 4 teaspoons per 6-8oz of water/milk. I used 4 teaspoons with about 8oz of water and after tasting it I discovered that it needed A LOT more of the mix to have the flavor that I wanted. I ended up using about 6 teaspoons for 8oz. I do like my drinks flavorful and I typically use more than the recommended amount on mixes, so this could just be my personal preference. I do love the fact that it is a loose powder and I can add as much or as little as I like.<br /><br />There are two things that I dislike about this Pumpkin Spice Latte: 1) the price and 2) the carbs and sugar. The current Amazon price is at over $8 per 9oz container. This seems to expensive to me. I guess if you take into account the price at coffee shops, it isn't a bad price, but it still seems high. There are supposed to be 17 servings in the can, but I would guess it is more like 8-9 (depending on the amount you use). I would rather buy something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F1PR8E">Folgers Cappuccino French Vanilla Beverage Mix, 16-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)</a> which currently costs less than $4 for a 16oz canister. This Maxwell House International mix also contains 11gm of Carbs and 8gm of Sugar per serving (and even more if you use milk). Since I had to do 1 & 1/2 servings to really get the flavor, my one cup cost me about 16.5gm of Carbs and 12gm of Sugar. I wish that they had a lighter and sugar free version available.<br /><br />If you love pumpkin and are looking for something different, I would definitely give this a try.<br /><br />**PLEASE NOTE THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS MILK. IF YOU ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DRINK IT**

review/summary: A Nice Change of Pace
review/text: I had misgivings about whether to order pumpkin coffee or not, but this product has a nice combination of pumpkin and spice flavors with a latte creaminess. The spices are similar to those found in spiced apple cider with the acidity of apples replaced by pumpkin and cream. It provides a nice change up from my regular brew.<br />The first time I tried it, I had just come in from working outside in the cold wind, so I sat down with my hot latte to rest.  The very nice fall flavor lulled my aching bones and muscles into a lazy haze. After an hour and another pumpkin latte, my wife had to yank me up by the ears and make me finish raking the leaves. I tried to tell her I needed a third cup in order to do a proper review, but she wouldn't believe me and my ears hurt so I went back to work.

review/summary: Nice for an occassional treat
review/text: This is my first time trying any of the National Foods coffees. First of all, be careful when you open the package. I peeled back the cover and powdery coffee went everywhere. Making the coffee is very easy - just put a few teaspoons (they recommend four) into a mug with hot water.<br /><br />I really loved the smell of this coffee. The pumpkin scent is great, and really makes you think of Fall. My problem was that it was really too rich to drink more than a couple sips. The coffee seemed very sweet, and didn't match the smell, meaning that the actual coffee didn't have that "bite" of pumpkin. I didn't find it very satisfying. However, a couple family members said it "wasn't too bad" and did manage to drink the whole thing. So I think a lot depends on your taste. Overall, it is a rich coffee that is best used for an occasional treat rather than as your regular morning beverage.

review/summary: Good flavor, not as good ingredients
review/text: First, a disclaimer. I love coffee, love lattes, enjoy the pumpkin spice lattes at the local coffee houses. But I'm not a big fan of non dairy powdered creamer or an overly chemical cup of ... anything. I don't understand why it needs hydrogenated coconut oil (ingredient#4 on a long list).<br /><br />Just looking at it was kind of a shock and disappointment. It looks like finely ground wheat flour, light beige, with little brown specks (cinnamon? coffee?) The smell is very aromatic--cinnamon and very pleasant--but where's the coffee?<br /><br />Mixed with water, it isn't the drink for me and even with milk I don't want to drink 4 tsp. of this powder. However, adding a spoonful to a cup of coffee that I made myself, it gave a good flavor, even better when I added some milk. I'd use it as a flavored sweetener but not as a drink.

review/summary: It's the Ingredients that Give You Pause
review/text: The first ingredient is sugar, the second is nondairy creamer which is made of corn syrup solids, partially hydrogenated coconut oil, sodium casenate dipotassium phosphate etc. There isn't anything real about this product. In addition, these artificial ingredients are some of the worse for your health. The claim that it has 0 trans fat and so it's okay to ingest, doesn't tell the true story - that hydrogenated coconut oil is terrible for peoples health (cholesterol). What's even odder is that coffee (instant) is way down the list, and as far as pumpkin, well there isn't a drop of pumpkin or spice to be found!<br /><br />However, if you're one that doesn't sweat the ingredients list, I can say that as advertised this instant (just add boiling water or hot milk) coffee pumpkin spice drink does produce a frothy latte foam (reminds one of a chemical reaction in science class). The color is of a milky light tea. The taste is very sweet, and vaguely reminds one of cinnamon stick. Overall, not the best choice for a cold fall eve.

review/summary: Delicious and Very easy to make!
review/text: I received the product this week and the first thing I like to notice when I buy grocery and edible items are the experimentation date (mines says July 2012). This is almost a year, so if you are like me and only drink lattes here and there, you have over half a year to sample and taste this product :)<br /><br />I did not try this product with water, I tried it with milk and it does taste like pumpkin spice. For those of us who have tried the Starbucks version of pumpkin spice, it is not as sweet and a bit more pumkiny and less cinnamony (but you can alter the taste if you would like by adding more or less product or even sugar/splenda to the taste though I would not recommend it). I find the taste to be more 'grown-up' than the Starbucks version since the pumpkin spices I have had from Starbucks the baristas always make them very sugary.<br /><br />There is some foam that is created on the top, mines was a very thin layer of foam, but you get more foam if you put in more product.<br /><br />Product says "dishwasher safe" but not microwavable safe so I guess you can wash the tin and reuse it for other items such as sugar or even to put small cookies in.<br /><br />TASTE: A<br />PRICE: Box says 17 servings (price at time of review = 34.22 for 4, so thats $8.55 per box and $.50 per serving)<br />If I want the latte to be very tasty, I double the serving, so depending on taste, each latte you make will cost about $.50 to 1 dollar per latte [excluding cost of milk]<br />VERY CHEAP compare to starbucks!<br /><br />OVERALL: A-

Anyway, the Pumpkin Spice Latte is my new favorite of all the International coffees.  It's just as convenient as all the others and I love the pumpkin flavor.  I highly recommend this to anyone with a taste for pumpkin.

review/text: I served some Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte to friends at a Halloween party and later did the same at Thanksgiving dinner.  The response was widely varied and some of my guests thought the coffee tasted "old" or "dusty."  Not exactly what you want to hear.  For me, the added element of extra cream makes the pumpkin spice flavor a smoother, mellower brew.  I love the aroma and have since mixed the instant coffee with other more exotic brews and have come up with my own original flavor that everyone loves.  I think it may be the added Kona beans that do the trick.

review/summary: Just the right amount of everything.
review/text: I drank this product during the holiday season with my (many) desserts (except pumpkin pie - too much of a good thing!) and think this is a good product.<br /><br />I thought it had just the right mix of pumpkin and spices. Others may disagree, but I don't like the flavorings to be overwhelming. I thought it had a very good balance of flavors - especially for an instant coffee. I shared some with my mother and sister who are Cafe Vienna fans and each of them were suitably impressed.<br /><br />This is an instant coffee and must be judged by that standard. Frankly, the only fault I found with this product is common to all products of this type - there's always that stuff at the bottom of the cup that never dissolves.<br /><br />On the whole, for an instant coffee, a good product. I give it four stars.

review/summary: Tasty Pumpkin Spicy Fat Goodness
review/text: This Pumpkin Spice Latte blend from Maxwell House was great, tasty, frothy, yummy. This from an instant mix that comes from a coffee that had a bitter taste to their previous flavors and blends, Maxwell House you have definitely improved.  I shared this can and it was gone in a week.  You also do not have to use too much to get a great latte, the required amount can be overwhelming after awhile.  It was better with water for me than with milk since the milk made it too creamy.  I added some clove spice and it made the blend taste better.  I took off one star for the price, twice the supermarket price.  I took off another star for the  fat content, it's got 2 grams of SATURATED FAT.

review/summary: Creamy and fast to make in a pinch
review/text: I like instant coffee during the winter months to curl up with while watching TV and when I am home alone and don't want to brew a whole pot.  This coffee is sweet, spicy and fragrant with cinnamon notes and the taste of pumpkin it is a taste of indulgence. I love the creamy froth that peaks at the top when I use hot water to brew and pour over the "grounds" and while the flavor could be a bit stronger in the spices I still like the ease of preparation and the touch of pumpkin that I can drink at home instead of going to my favorite expensive coffee shop.

review/summary: Smooth strong flavor and disolved well in hot water
review/text: This was pretty good as instant coffees go.  It dissolved well in hot water, and didn't clump up overly.  Some similar coffee mixes require sprinkling, then stirring, then sprinkling a little more mix, then stirring, and so one to prevent most of the mix going into the water in the form of powdery bubbles.  That this dissolved easily was probably the best feature.<br /><br />As for taste, this was good.  It is creamy and has hints of nutmeg and other spices that go well with pumpkin.  The nutmeg and the creamy taste and texture contribute to the pumpkin taste, since pumpkin is a texture as much as a taste.  This drink does a good job at conjuring pumpkin and fitting into that family of seasonal products and foods.  Some of the other reviews are negative on the creaminess dominating and say it doesn't taste like coffee.  To me, it tastes like coffee, but very milked and sugared up.  Then again, that's how I drink coffee - milked and sugared up.<br /><br />This drink mix is pricey (right now almost 10 dollars a canister after shipping for the 4 canister bundle).  I'm not sure if it's worth so much.  It's a solid beverage, but much cheaper for similar - maybe even for the same thing - at the grocery store.<br /><br />Oh, and here is the nutritional information off the food label:  Serving size is 6-8 fluid ounces.  60 calories (20 of them from fat), 2g fat (both grams are saturated), 60 mg sodium, 11g carbs, 8g sugar.  Ingredients:  Sugar, nondairy creamer (corn syrup solids, partially hydrogenated coconut oil, sodium caseinate (from milk), dipotassium phosphate, mono-and diglycerides, artificial flavor), whey, maltodextrin, instant coffee, contains less than 2% of cinnamon, ginger, natural and artificial flavors, cellulose gum, sodium citrate, modified cornstarch, silicon dioxide.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid hot beverage in taste, texture, and ease with which it dissolves in water.  However, it's very pricey.  I recommend trying this if you have a sweet tooth and the price doesn't phase you.  Avoid this if you like strong coffee or are price conscious when grocery shopping.

review/summary: A Treat
review/text: I generally drink 'normal' coffee or tea and save the International House coffees for more of a treat. This is due to the fact that it is sweet and has a powdered flavored creamer in it.  I really like the taste of all of these coffies and I think that the Pumpkin Spice Latte is a great addition to the International Coffee collection.  It is easy to make, contains around 70 calories a cup if made according to the instructions.  Just measure the amout out with the teaspoon and add water - you are set.

review/summary: A taste of the holidays
review/text: This is a decent latte if you are looking for something to remind you of the fall/holidays (which Pumpkin Spice always does for me).  Personally I feel the changing of the seasons with the changing of the coffee flavors in my local coffee shops.  This product can be made with water (though I don't recommend it).  It is much better with milk (like any other latte).<br /><br />Personally I enjoyed the product when made with milk, the only drawback is that your calorie, and fat content rises with the addition of the milk, so it is no longer simply a coffee product.  However, that being said, if you are looking for a decent alternative at home, rather than heading out to the coffee shop to drop $4.50 on a Pumpkin Latte, this product will certainly work for you.

review/summary: New cardboard packaging, same great flavors
review/text: The International Coffee's have been around since at least the early 1990's. There are a variety of flavors. All of them taste great. They are heavily sweetened drinks. Think of them as more like hot-cocoa in terms of sugar content (than coffee). The Cafe Francais and Cappucino are the two I think actually taste like coffee. The Pumpkin Spice flavor is very sweet and tastes best when very hot.<br /><br />The packaging is new. They used to come in tin container. The new cardboard containers are actually larger (now 9 oz. instead of 5oz). My only other comments is that I preferred the tins better because if you set the new cardboard container on the counter where it is wet the container and the ingredients in it get wet making for wasted mix...

review/summary: Not very 'latte'... much better with milk
review/text: The first time I made this, I used water as the directions suggest. I found that it was a bit bland and needed a bit more of the mix. Still overall my wife and I found it a bit 'boring'. The next time we tried it with milk and it was much better and had a nice froth on top (still needed more mix though). Not sure if I would call this a 'latte' though since with milk, it's more like a mocha hot chocolate. Can't really taste the pumpkin either, but overall it's very good.

review/summary: Sanka/Nescafe & Pumpkin Spice Coffeemate is a much better quick cuppa than this glorified cup of sugar water
review/text: I love my frou-frou gourmet pseudo-coffee drinks as much as the next guy (I love pumpkin spice coffee in general). I remember my parents buying "International Coffees" so I thought I'd give this a try.<br /><br />I want to be clear that I was not expecting this to be on par with an espresso-based drink that costs $4. I decided instead to compare this to a cup of instant coffee (Nescafe) with Coffeemate's Pumpkin Spice Creamer -- which should be a fair comparison.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this comes nowhere close to fulfilling even that modest expectation. These bad boys are completely flavorless unless you double or triple the amount they suggest. And when you do that, you feel like you're drinking a cup of hot sugar water -- there is no coffee to be found in here. Pretty disgusting for me and my wife's tastes.<br /><br />In my opinion, you'd be better off buying regular instant coffee and a bottle of pumpkin spice Coffeemate. It's 100 times better than this.

review/summary: Terribly disapppointing
review/text: I followed the directions which suggest you use 6-8 ozs of water and add 3-4 tsps of product.  The result was a watered down tasteless mess, even when I used only 6 ozs of water and 4 tsps of the powder.<br /><br />I eventually found a balance of water to powder that made a tolerable drink but it didn't have much coffee flavor at all and barely any spiciness.  Not even close to a substitution for the pumpkin spice latte I buy at the local coffee shop.  What's worse, is that by the time I add enough powder, the amount of sugar/fat/additives makes it significantly less healthy.  Even when it's made properly, this is not a healthy option and I would urge anyone to just learn how to make your own latte.  It may take a little more effort but your body will appreciate it.<br /><br />Absolutely a waste of money and an offense to my taste buds.  I ended up throwing most of it away.

I used 6 ounces and added the suggested 4 teaspoons of the pumpkin spice mix.  The taste was quite bland and I added three more teaspoons.  I LIKE FLAVOR!  With this addition, I tasted the spice.  However, the pumpkin flavor was subtle and barely detectable.  I would compare this to a spiced chai latte.

review/text: I love lattes and pumpkin spice sounded like the perfect flavor to try at Thanksgiving.<br /><br />I used a measuring spoon to ensure that I put in the correct amount, but the flavor was very watery.  Think iced tea diluted two to three times beyond the recommended amount.  The flavor was more what I would expect from a cheap "pumpkin spice" herbal tea rather than the usual "International Coffee" latte.<br /><br />I added 50% more powder, but the flavor got sweeter but not richer.  Overall, this was very disappointing, and my guests agreed.  None of us finished our mugs.

review/text: I'm not sure what sort of magic Maxwell House has captured here, but this product completely surpassed my and my wife's expectations.  (It probably helps to have low expectations!)  We weren't hoping for anything close to coffee house quality, but I dare say that when mixed correctly, this latte surpasses the beverages one gets out of the machine at the local gas station.  That's pretty darn good, considering this comes out of a can.  That considered, I'm very happy with this latte mix.  It's got a great, robust pumpkin flavor that balances the coffee nicely.  Not too sweet, certainly not bitter.  It's a nice cold-weather combo.<br /><br />If you're looking for a remarkably easy coffee treat at home, this is a nearly fool proof way to go.  I recommend it without reservation.

review/summary: I LOVE this coffee!
review/text: We just finished our first canister of Maxwell House Pumpkin Spice Latte, and it was SO delicious!<br />My husband and I love the Maxwell House Coffees, but had never had Pumpkin Spice, so when it was offered through Vine, I was more than happy to review this coffee.<br /><br />The directions call for two scoops of coffee/latte added to 8 oz of hot water, but we used 2 1/2 - which isn't a LOT more, but it did make a difference. It might be that this is a latte, and not a coffee - it was a little lighter in taste than a coffee, but it was just OH SO YUMMY! We also used 1 sweetener, and it was perfect.<br /><br />We also tried adding the Pumpkin Spice Latte to our protein shakes, and that makes a delicious alternative to a plain vanilla protein shake. Being kind of a holiday flavor (and one of my favorite flavors!) there are all sorts of things you can do with Pumpkin Spice Latte. Since we were reviewing for Vine I tried some fun things - the things we added it to which worked out well were:<br />gingerbread cookies, vanilla ice cream, add two scoops to regular coffee add some creamer (there's a new pumpkin creamer that just came out that's delicious and perfect with the Maxwell House Pumpkin Spice Latte) and then put some whipped cream on top sprinkling just a tad on top to make it look pretty!<br /><br />This is a great buy on Amazon! I haven't seen it in any of the stores I've been to yet. I hope it comes out and isn't just a test coffee!

review/summary: You know it's Fall when Pumpkin Spice latte appears
review/text: I cheer every year, even if it is still 102 degrees and I see that Starbucks is offering pumpkin spice latte.  The only thing I don't cheer about is the price for this addictive habit.  Now, I can make a pumpkin spice latte that ALMOST tastes like the ones a barrista makes and I don't have to leave a tip!  This flavored coffee has very good  flavors, especially of nutmeg but cinnamon and cloves are in there too.  Like all these coffees, using really hot water and stirring for at least a minute, makes a better cup and prevents the bottom of the cup residue.  This is a light coffee, not a strong robust one so don't think it is going to wake you up in the morning if you did something the night before you shouldn't have!  But it is very nice mid-day or evening treat and won't keep you awake unless you are sensitive to small amounts of caffeine.  You don't really want to serve it with dessert because it is too much like dessert itself but some vanilla flavored cookies go nicely with it.

review/text: Its been a LONG time since I've had an International Foods coffee. I remember those funny commercials in the 80's that seem to make you think that drinking this coffee was SOOO cosmopolitan!<br /><br />I love a good pumpkin spice coffee so decided to give it a try.  It was ok as made with water, but like one reviewer wrote-its a LOT better made with milk or unsweetened vanilla soy milk.  It makes it a bit thicker and more satisfying. It was wonderful to make a mug on the first cold day. I added a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon to spice it up even more.  If you prefer a stronger coffee taste, its easy to add a bit of instant coffee or espresso to it.<br /><br />My only negative about this is that it's very sweet, sugar is the first ingredient. It would be nice if it were unsweetened, to allow people who don't or can't use sugar (diabetics, carb watchers) to add their own sweetener to it.

review/summary: Decent canned coffee but no threat to Starbucks
review/text: Overall, I was impressed with the flavor. Sometimes the pumpkin spice mixes tend to go a little heavy on the nutmeg for my preference, and while you can taste the nutmeg, it's not overpowering. I would've preferred a slightly stronger hand on the cinnamon and pumpkin flavor, however.<br /><br />You can make it with hot water or with warm milk; we tried it both ways. I found that adding the milk made it very dairy-heavy, and really hid the coffee flavor. The biggest litmus test was my husband, who is an enormous fan of the Starbucks pumpkin spice latte. He even liked this, although it wouldn't be a complete replacement for the coffee shop variety. He recently picked up another can for his work so that he'd have it at his desk.<br /><br />We never got the amount of foam that is pictured on the can. Ours just had a very light frothy layer. If you like fresh, strong espresso drinks, this is definitely not for you, but if you prefer lattes or americanos and like the taste of pumpkin spice, it's definitely worth the try.

review/summary: Sweet taste of the season
review/text: I've always loved the convenience of Maxwell House International Coffees for lazy Saturday afternoons, or those chilly evenings when I just want something warm to drink.  Although not an avid pumpkin fan, I do usually get one or two pumpkin lattes each fall from one of those expensive coffee shops. So I was very curious whether Maxwell House could combine the convenience of their coffee mix while getting the taste right.<br /><br />Wow, was I pleased. Yes, it's very sweet, but that's what makes this a seasonal treat. It's creamy on the tongue, too, which makes it feel extra luxurious. And the aroma is divine! When I'd made a cup the first time, my husband (an anti-instant coffee snob) took a sip even before I could. I didn't get my cup back. He liked it so much, he finished off the rest of the container over the next couple of days. Thankfully, I was able to get a couple of lattes myself in that time, or a certain someone would be in big, big trouble.

review/summary: Good for What It Is
review/text: First of all, this may say its a flavored latte but in the end it's still instant coffee.  So there are two standards here - one for the more general product and one for the genre of instant coffee.  In the first one, it's OK.  It tastes closer to hot chocolate mix with some pumpkinish flavor than anything you might associate with coffee.  In fact, it's rather like the sort of "flavored latte/cappucino" you might get out an automatic dispenser at your local convenience store than anything you would order at a coffee shop.  Not bad, mind you ... but not great either.<br /><br />As a coffee product, it's fairly inoffensive and might rate 2 stars at best.  As instant coffee, which usually is a most vile concoction, it would go up to 4.  I'll average it out and give it 3 stars.  Not something to rate up with the best but certainly not horrible either.  It is an alternative to hot chocolate or to make something quick if you're in a rush, but it's not a great cup of coffee of any sort.

review/summary: Decent Instant Coffee
review/text: I call this Pumpkin Spice Latte 'decent' because the taste is just fine - not fake tasting or chemically - but I could not get my cup to come out creamy or full flavored. I tried many different ratio combos of water to mix but it all just came out watery and thin tasting. Perhaps if you use milk instead of water it might taste better. If you're into instant coffee I'd definitely recommend this flavor though, taste is very nice.

review/summary: Instant Latte....YUM
review/text: I teach at an elementary school, and with recent budget cuts, I had to remove my coffee pot from my classroom.  We do have a big coffee station in the teacher's lounge, but most of the time the pot is empty by the time I make it down.  The coffee maker does have a hot water spout on the side, which is usually used for hot tea or hot chocolate.  After receiving the Pumpkin Spice coffee in the mail, I was excited to see if it could help with my coffee dilemma.  Just a few spoonfuls in my mug, and a trip down to the teacher's lounge would prove very rewarding.  As I add the water, I stir the coffee, and that actually creates a little bit of foam on the top.  The smell is incredible, and I have teachers walking by asking what I am drinking that smells so good.  OK, smells are one thing, but the big test is.....how does it taste??  As I lift my mug to my lips, the aroma of pumpkin spice fills my nostrils.  I take a sip and..........mmmmmmmmmmm the taste of fall fills my mouth.  While this may not be quite as good as a cup from your local coffee house, it is a really tasty cup of coffee for instant.  I'm almost finished with it, and it is on my shopping list to replenish.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: The first two ingredients are sugar and coffee creamer, so this isn't the healthiest beverage for you, but Maxwell House doesn't claim to make it healthy, they just claim to make it good, and it's pretty yummy.  I was surprised to see that it actually does foam up when you pour the hot water in.  You do have to stir it quite a bit to get everything dissolved, which reduces the foam, but if you don't mind some dregs at the bottom of the cup, just stir it moderately, then enjoy.  The pumpkin spice flavor rivals anything you'd pay $4 for from a "barista."

review/summary: Nasty
review/text: I only gave this a one star because there were no minus stars.  This stuff is just nasty.  Maybe its my taster or maybe we don't have the right water for it.  But, I did try the chocolate/peppermint flavor and it was yummy.<br /><br />The instructions are just way off.  If I put in the correct amount of powder, the water/milk just changes colors...barely.  So, I add more and more.  By the time I can taste the flavor its just waaayyyy tooo much flavor and its bitter. This can says it has coffee in it but it is 10th on the ingredient list.  The first three ingredients are some sort of sugar.<br /><br />For 8 ounces of water and 4 teaspoons of powder the calories are 60, the total fat grams are 2, 60mg of sodium, 11 grams of carbs, 8 grams of sugars and less than 1gram of protein.<br /><br />Skip this colored water and drink some mud instead.  The mud will be the better tasting of the two.

review/summary: Good for a quick afternoon cup of coffee, but not great
review/text: I like coffee. Not only do I drink coffee in the morning, but I drink it in the afternoon, usually around 2:00, as a quick pick-me-up. I especially like lattes and cappuccinos in the afternoon, which I consider a snack.<br /><br />What I like about this coffee is that it's an instant product -- the only thing you need is hot water. No brewing involved. I do recommend using a real measuring spoon and not relying on your teaspoon, though, when measuring out the product. When you mix it with hot water, it produces a really good, foamy product -- very much like a latte.<br /><br />While it's foamy, it's not very thick, and I honestly can say the pumpkin-spice flavoring falls a little on the weak side. I've never really liked the International Coffees because I feel they come off as a weak-tasting coffees. I prefer a strong coffee taste, with strong flavoring, when drinking cappuccinos and lattes. This product reminds me of a coffee-flavored tea, with some spices added. It's also just not very sweet.<br /><br />While the recommended serving is about 90 calories, I tend to use 5 teaspoons instead of the recommended 4 teaspoons, just to add a little more flavor. Making it with milk, instead of water, is an alternative to add more density to the product, but then the calories could start to add up. All of this said, the product definitely falls-short in the flavor department.<br /><br />The packaging makes no mention of the caffeine content. My experience tells me it contains caffeine, but it's impossible to know how many milligrams of caffeine are in a serving. I find it provides an afternoon lift for a few hours.<br /><br />If you're looking for an afternoon alternative to coffee or tea, and like spiced coffee, give this a try, but don't expect coffee-house quality or flavor.

review/summary: Great coffee with a spiced twist
review/text: The name of this coffee is somewhat less-than-inspiring.  I really wasn't sure about a coffee with the word "pumpkin" in it.  I couldn't imagine a pumpkin flavored coffee as being good at all, but the name is somewhat misleading too.  There is no pumpkin flavor, it simply has similar spices to a pumpkin pie.<br /><br />It's a smooth instant coffee, consistent with what we expect from Maxwell House's International coffees line.  The spices are very noticeable, yet not overbearing, and the blend is highly satisfactory as well, without being overpowered by any particular spice.<br /><br />Spiced coffees can be tricky, and this one is very good as a dessert coffee.  I enjoy it after an evening meal most of all.  It's also more of a stand alone coffee rather than one to be served alongside dessert or anything else.

review/summary: A nice change of pace.
review/text: So Fall is the time for all the cliches we see advertising autumn leaves, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and pumpkins everywhere. How appropriate a time to try this new blend... and I must say, I love the flavor of pumpkin, so I was genuinely looking forward to this. Be warned, it does say pumpkin spice Latte, so when the cup produces a foam, it was designed to do that. Flavor is good, not great, but it is creamy, sweet and smells heavenly so not too much to complain about. Very little coffee flavor, but a nice cup of fall flavor.

review/summary: Nice Treat but not perfect
review/text: This is a nice treat on occasion, with good flavor when you make it right. However, to make it right you need to use a lot more than the suggested amount (about 1-1/2 to 2 times as much as directed), and it doesn't really have a pumpkin flavor as much as a kind of generic "holiday spice" flavor. On the other hand, I like it better than some coffeehouse pumpkin spice lattes so perhaps that is being a little unfair.<br /><br />The suggestion made by others to use milk instead of water is a good one. Gives it a richer flavor with more of a latte froth to it. Of course you'll pay for it with the extra calories, but again, probably better than many coffeehouses. Just consider it a treat rather than an everyday drink and you should be OK.

review/summary: Decent
review/text: This is okay.  You have to use more than is actually called for to get a good flavor and the ingredient list isn't anything to rave about, but in a pinch it's okay.  My main issue is the taste isn't worthy the high calories in the least.  The coffee flavor is also pretty nonexistent.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I really enjoy the flavor of this drink and its really easy to make.<br />It reminds me of eating pumpkin pie.<br /><br />I tend to use more than they tell you to use in order to get the sweetness I desire but is really preference.<br />I also use milk instead of water.  It makes it creamier and that is the way I like it.<br /><br />I haven't purchased any of these in a long time and I was surprised to learn they are in plastic now instead of tins like they used to be.  I guess I shouldn't have been.  In any event, its probably cleaner anyways.<br /><br />If the name Pumpkin Spice makes you think you might like it then I would say that you will because it tastes very near to what I was thinking it would taste like and I love it.<br /><br />Also fits the season perfectly.

review/summary: Smooth taste! (but no pumpkin flavor)
review/text: I gave this product 5 stars because it is easy to prepare and it tastes good--very smooth and creamy with a hint of ginger and/or nutmeg spice.  I thought it would taste like pumpkin but I couldn't taste any pumpkin in it at all.  Since I thought it tasted good even without pumpkin flavor, I gave it the full 5 stars.  In addition to using it as a stand-alone drink, I've also added a teaspoon or so to my regular coffee to give it a little more pizazz.  One thing I found interesting was that this product came in a plastic container instead of the traditional metal one I've come to know and love.  It seems a little more flimsy now.  Anyway, this does not affect the flavor, just a packaging change that I noticed.  If you like GFI's other instant coffee drinks, give this one a try.  I think you'll like it too!
