review/summary: These are great!
review/text: I have one of these every morning on my way to work. They have a great flavor and are just enough to tide me over until my breakfast break. I was a little hesitant to buy so many after never trying them, but I'm glad that I did. I ordered these and their French Vanilla Yogurt bars and was very pleased with both. I also like that they're organic and don't have a lot of the added chemicals and preservatives that other cereal bars do. I would definitely order these again.

review/summary: Okay if you like this type of thing....
review/text: I wanted to add a review since, while these aren't a bad product, I don't particularly care for them.  There may be others who are helped by my description of the product.<br /><br />These are neither pastry-like or cookie-like.  I would describe them as similar to a very thin, soft Fig Newton in consistency, and somewhat similar in flavor as well, except instead of "fig" these have quite a lot of cinnamon flavor (very good) and a nondescript "creme" filling (meh).<br /><br />While I appreciated the courageous use of lots of cinnamon in these, overall I find them far too sweet (and I like sweets) and lacking in appealing texture and flavor really otherwise.<br /><br />On the plus side, if you like these sorts of "bar" snacks, these are healthier versions than some.

review/summary: Hard to find in stores
review/text: This is my husband's favorite mid-morning snack.  It is very hard to find in the local stores ... but when we've found it, the price ranges from $3.79 per box and higher.  It wonderful to be able to buy this in bulk (we usually get 2 orders of the 6 packs of 6) and also get free shipping, so it is less expensive.  It was delivered in less than a week.

review/summary: Re-confirms empty calories of "health" confections
review/text: Wow, this stuff has a zing to it. You have to taste it yourself to see what I mean. If you care about some thoughtful balance of protein and calories, which is easily achievable in a product like this, you'll have to look elsewhere. There is something downright malicious in the recipe for this confection and its insistence on sources of empty calories and borderline objectionable food products. The best you can say for it is that it isn't immediately harmfull.<br /><br />Oh yes, the product package implores the shipper to keep it below 70 degrees F, "because it is natural". As you will find out, this is a signal for shippers to ignore any precautions, since refrigerated trucks don't occur on most shipping company routes.

review/summary: Why does Health Valley use such misleading photos?  See my pic up top
review/text: This is not the only Health Valley product to show a photo on the box that differs considerably from the actual product.  They did this with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVQ2O8">Health Valley Cobbler Cereal Bars, Apple, 6-Count 7.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, too.  (I've also posted a photo and review of the apple bars.)  Their chocolate bars differ, too, although not to the same extent as these other two.<br /><br />The photo on the box of the Cinnamon Danish bar certainly LOOKS delicious, with a seemingly thick, juicy filling.  As you can see from my photo, the actual filling is a thin layer of a beige, sticky, and overly sweet substance.  Another reviewer described it as resembling school paste, and I can't think of a better way to describe it.  A better name for these bars might be "Sugar Danish" because the sweet taste is so much more pronounced than the cinnamon.<br /><br />I followed other reviewers' recommendation to heat these up prior to eating.  I would recommend a toaster oven, rather than a toaster, because it tends to become very "floppy" when it's warmed, and it breaks apart in the toaster.

review/summary: Tasty, but a bit too sweet and very flimsy when warm.
review/text: I decided to take a break from the organic chocolate tarts I've been enjoying and try the cinnamon danish.  While they do taste pretty good, they are a bit too sweet for me (and I actually like sweet things, so that says a lot), and when put in a toaster, become almost impossible to get out of the toaster, because they lose their rigidity and basically fold over and become a bit of a mess.  I'll try some other flavors, but that's it for me on the cinnamon.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVQ2Q6">Health Valley Cafe Creations, Cinnamon Danish Bar, 6-Count 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I have become a member of Amazon's Subscribe and Save Plan and have ordered several different low cal foods through this plan. This item is one of the low cal snacks that I received and would re order again. These very tasty cinnamon danish bars are perfect when I am in the mood for something sweet without having to worry about weight gain. The hard part is not eating all of them at once, but since I am used to dieting I am able to savor one bar at a time a few times a week.  They taste very much like a cinnamon danish.  However, the consistency is not at all like that of a danish. They are somewhat chewy and yet soft and creamy.  I know this sounds contradictory but they do have an unusual and delicious slight amount of chewiness which does add a degree of eating something more substantial then your ordinary low cal thin pastry snack. Obviously cinnamon is the predominant flavor and if you are not a fan then these are not for you. I am very happy I found these on Amazon.  They are a welcome change from the low cal snack cakes I am used to. They are great by themselves or with a beverage. So if you are a fan of the flavor of cinnamon and are watching your calories, try them. Your taste buds will thank you.

review/text: My husband won a basket of dog treats at a raffle. Most were too big for our little 7lb Chihuahua mix, but she works on them anyway. :) The Merrick sticks weren't too stinky or greasy (pig ears are way worse) and our pup works on them forever. I didn't know they were so pricey, but reading the reviews of the other brands, you must be paying for quality. I'm going to bite the bullet and order some of these 6" sticks for her now. At least I know they last more than a few hours and will be worth the money!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I have a very small Papillon who's not quite 2 yet.  He loves chewing on bully sticks and he likes Merrick the best.  I have given him some non Merrick bully sticks that just lie around half chewed.  The Merrick sticks get chewed up to a little nubbin that I throw away when he's not looking.  They do stink like a dead animal or something.  It's really bad but it keeps him out of trouble.  I gave him these to chew on as soon as I got him at 4 mos. and he has never chewed on any furniture or other objects.  I also noticed that if he doesn't have one to chew on he starts licking his paws and I'm afraid he could lick a bare spot.  These keep him occupied so he doesn't do stuff like that.

review/summary: My yorkie loves Merrick Bully Sticks
review/text: I gave my yorkie puppy his Merrick Bully Stick and he chewed on it for HOURS, which I love because it freed up some time for me to relax without having my puppy running around destroying everything in my house!<br /><br />Merrick bully sticks are great for puppies and adult dogs.  I have purchased other brand bully sticks and my dog prefers these far more than other brands.  The only thing is that Merrick stick tend to have a stronger odor in comparison to other brands, however, the smell reminds me of really strong smokey beef jerky (doesn't bother me).  I've heard others complain that Merrick bully sticks smell really stinky so they won't buy them for their dogs.  I guess it depends how sensitive you are to strong odors.  I love the bully sticks because they keep my puppy occupied and it helps him with his teething.  It's definitely worth purchasing if you're having chewing/biting issues with your puppy or need something to keep it entertained.

review/summary: OK if you like sour almond syrup
review/text: I bought this product, remembering the sweet almond taste of the Orzata beverage.  To my surprise, the sour taste of the added citric acid was strong enough to make the overall flavor tart instead of sweet.  Compare the ingredients in Ferrara Almond Orzatata Syrup to the ingredients of Monin Almond Syrup, and the difference is obvious.<br /><br />Ferrara:  sugar, water, almond extract, citric acid, artificial color, 1/10th of 1% sodium benzoate(as preservative)<br /><br />Monin: Pure cane sugar, water, natural almond flavor<br /><br />I rest my case.

review/text: I recently tested three orgeats available on Amazon, including this one, Monin, and Teisseire. I tried each one in a variety of cocktails. Ferrara and Monin both beat Teisseire by a long shot, and were more or less equal in terms of taste. I have to deduct some points for Ferrara because it contains preservatives and comes in a plastic bottle, rather than glass. But it is a very close second. Recommended, especially given its lower price.

review/summary: Need magnifying glass to find liver.
review/text: Finally, a canned cat food that the kitties are eating (at least for now, with a few vitamins & minerals. And this brand won't end up in the dog bowls! But I am hard pressed to find the chunks of liver - very skimpy - which is really O.K. because the cats leave what few itty bitty pieces that ARE in the can behind (3 Star for deceptive liver chunks/ 5 Star for chicken breast).  Looks almost as pictured, except for liver chunks.  I also bought the plain chicken from same company & will just go with that and rate a 5-STAR.  If your kitties LOVE cooked liver, you won't find enough in this recipe to satisfy their hunger - unless they eat all of the chicken too, which you probably wouldn't buy if cat didn't like chicken.  I am just so happy to transit the dry food & salty canned chicken addicted cat to a wet food to save on the kidneys. I do have one cat that loves raw liver & chicken, but I like to take a day off from adding vitamins and messing with raw meat (cutting, etc) so this is going to work out, it appears; hopefully for awhile - though one never knows with kitties.  Great today - terrible tomorrow!

review/summary: unbeatable quality
review/text: i was a skeptic of this product when i first met the rep in my pet store a few years back because they'll tell you anything to push a sale. "human grade this", "super-luxe that", and so on. out of curiosity, i picked up a few cans at a different pet store in the area to test it out.<br /><br />my. cat. LOVED. them.<br /><br />every morsel, licked clean from the bowl. this price offered online is an exceptionally good bargain: 36.92 for a 24-can case gives you a deal of just over $1.50 per 5.5 oz can. i've never seen it for less than $1.99 in stores with the average being around $2.50/can. the quality of this product is simply unbeatable, period. the moisture content is great for weight management, urinary tract and dental health. the meat quality is absolutely unbeatable compared to any canned food i've ever seen. the best part is the SMELL - delicious! it smells just like canned soup for people to eat. it doesn't smell anything like cheap, canned cat food... because it isn't.<br /><br />do yourself and your cat a favor. buy this product and lots of it.

review/summary: Excellent,cats love this food
review/text: just received my case of this food after reviewing many other types. I wanted something that was organic and healthy for my two cats,instead of taking them to the vet all the time..They absolutely LOVE this food,plenty of juice and meat. One 5.5 oz can feeds them both heartily and they lick the dish clean. I started them on an organic holistic dry food over a month ago and I see a big change in their coats,so shiny and soft. I believe that the added expense should keep them overall much healthier and happy...

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: My cat likes Mideast Feast and Asian Fusion. He's not so crazy for the chicken or Marbella Paella, but I think it's more that he doesn't like non-fish and doesn't like shellfish.<br /><br />This stuff might be a bit expensive but I see it this way:<br /><br />With the wet food I used to buy, if I didn't take care and left some in my sink or garbage can for more than a few days, there will be small flies that emerged from it. With all the Weruva stuff, I've left some remnants out in my sink for a week and no flies. I really think the cheaper, more available wet cat food has something wrong with it to be spawning flies so quickly.

review/summary: Best wet food I've ever purchased!
review/text: I have 2 super-picky older cats (13 & 9).  I've tried so many options, but this is the first one where the CLEAN the bowl.  I've tried every flavor of Weruva on them, and the plain chicken is by far their favorite.  They like the other chicken varieties but for some reason there are peas, carrots, and pumpkin in it, all of which they strategically eat around.  They both can't stand fish, so chicken it is!<br /><br />Being meat and gravy in it's almost purest form, it definitely has a positive impact on their health.  Their fur is shinier and softer.  And they seem more happy and playful.<br /><br />I never used to believe a food upgrade could make such a difference, but this certainly did!!

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: This food is a hit!<br /><br />The cat likes it because it's got chunks of shredded meat in gravy.  He won't eat ground or pate-style foods, so the shredded meat in this one is a winner.<br /><br />I like it because, for one thing, it's grain-free.  To my mind, if you could only pick one quality to shop for, grain-free would be it; carbohydrates - and particularly grains! - are not good for cats.  It's very high in protein, which *is* good for cats.  It contains pumpkin, and while that is a carbohydrate, it's supposed to be good for their tummies.  I'm also pleased that it contains duck meat, since I like to rotate my cat's protein sources to take advantage of their differing nutritional profiles.  And finally, it's got plenty of gravy to help my cat stay hydrated; cats are built to take in much of their fluid from their food sources, so feeding dry food exclusively can dehydrate them (and possibly lead to urinary crystals).<br /><br />True, it's expensive.  Even for higher-end cat foods, it's expensive.  But if you'd ever had a cat develop diabetes because of an improper diet (i.e. dry foods high in carbs and too low in animal-based proteins) - or any other condition brought on by a poor diet - you'd agree that a little expense up front is way cheaper in the long run than treating the health condition.  The fact that I'm still giving it five stars should tell you something.  Not that I don't recommend shopping around for deals!)<br /><br />Give this food a shot.  It's a very healthful choice.

review/text: Paw Lickin' Chicken is a big favorite with my cats. It's amazing stuff. Looks good enough to put on a crossiant!<br /><br />I use it in rotation with other Weruvas and other brands. When I first served this, my cats ate it like little crazies. Having seen the euphoria, I went out and bought more cans of PLC. I served it all the time and suddenly there was no interest. My epic fail. Too much, too often, equals wasted uneaten cans.<br /><br />I place Weruva's Paw Lickin Chicken on reserve, serving it 2X total (breakfast and dinner) per week, due to the high cost hence one less star in my review.

review/text: Seriously, this stuff actually looks like something humans could eat.  When you open the can, it looks and smells like real (canned) food, not pressed and formed mystery meat or worse, meat paste.  Gluten-free, which has helped reduce the amount of cat barf left in random places or hidden behind couches, etc.  We buy two or three varieties at a time and rotate it through so the cats don't get bored with it.  Pricey, but definitely worth it!

review/summary: Only Food the Babies will Eat!
review/text: I first discovered this product at a local pet food store. Bella and Dora, our adopted kittens, were suffering from a respitory cold that they had picked up from the shelter and were not eating any food.<br /><br />The girl at the shop was really cool and introduced us to the Weruva line of food as well as other brands. I was interested to find out that the owners of Weruva are somehow related to the company that produces all the tuna for Subway Sandwiches. I guess the husband/wife team had cats and were dissapointed to find low quality soft food in the market, and asked to find out what it would take to be able to use the same facilities. They found out that as long as they produced human grade food, they could use the facility. Anyways, we bought a whole bunch of flavors to see what they would like, and ultimately this is the only one that they always finish!<br /><br />I like that you can tell that it is fish, and not some mushed up by product. It smells very fishy, so if that makes you sick just be aware!<br /><br />Hope your kitties love it as much as ours do!!!

review/summary: Weruva is top quality and this flavor is *MY* cats' favorite
review/text: I've tried many different vendors and varieties of canned cat food and this is the favorite for *my* cats' (two of them) by a long shot.  *Your* cats may not like it.  Cats are very finicky!<br /><br />My advice to any reader is to learn about quality pet food (take an hour or two on the web, there's plenty of material to read) and then shop for top quality pet food only (Weruva qualifies in my opinion) and try a small sample until you find a set that YOUR cat likes. Rotate here and there for variety... if your cat likes variety, that is.  Both of my cats hate fish, love poultry and pork, and will tolerate other meats such as beef and lamb, and they both like a little variety.<br /><br />I wish I had fed my cats canned or even raw food from early on but I made the mistake of listening to an indoctrinated vet and fed them "prescription grade" Hill's Science Diet kibble which is total crap as I have come to learn from my own research. Like most doctors with humans and the pharmaceutical companies, many vets become distributors for pet food vendors for financial reasons and won't recommend something that doesn't make them money.<br /><br />I now feed my cats this Weruva flavor and a couple of other quality canned cat foods (they don't care for any other Weruva flavor, by the way) plus a couple of quality kibble brands (high protein, grain-free - no corn, wheat, or soy).

review/text: This is the best cat food on the market, as far as I'm concerned.  All three of my cats gobble it up every day, week after week, month after month.  It's pure white meat chicken breast, shredded, in broth.  The vet recommended it for all of my cats, who have different medical issues.  They love it.  Unfortunately the price has gone up twice since I started buying it. It used to be $32/case, then it went to $35/case, now it's at $37/case.  That's a 15% increase over the past six months.  However, shipping is free, and I order 4 or 5 cases at a time.  They arrive promptly, and I never run out.

review/summary: Our favorite of the premium cat foods
review/text: After researching cat food, we tried quite a few brands and flavors (Merrick, Nature's Variety, Wellness) before settling on this one.<br /><br />What I like about Weruva Chicken is the strip texture instead of paste/pate, and also the very low fat content. While it's ok for cats to eat fat, they get enough from their EVO dry food, so for their wet I prefer low fat and high protein.<br /><br />I hesitate to say our cats love it, cause if I switch to something else for 2 weeks, then back to Weruva Chicken, they forget that they like it. They seem to need 2-3 days of tough love to adjust to any food, even one they previously liked.<br /><br />I wish it was made in USA instead of Thailand, so it's not perfect.<br /><br />It's only about 160 cal/can, but this is due to very low fat, which other premium catfood makers use to boost their caloric content.

review/text: My super-picky, unbelievably finicky cat who is not a big eater and has refused so many different kinds of food LOVES the Mack and Jack and the Meow Luau.  It has been so frustrating to get her to eat something, much less actually like it -- with this food she hears the can open and comes and cries for it.  She didn't like the chicken and liver (Nine Livers), but I am sure that flavor is good, too, she is just ridiculously picky.  I gave the chicken and liver to a friend and her two cats loved it.  Thanks for making a food that this cat will actually eat!

review/summary: great for non-chunk lovers!
review/text: The key to choosing a successful wet food is obvious--knowing what your kitty likes. Over time I learned that my cats like non-chunky wet food. I tried the Weruva chicken flavor, which has grainy chicken pieces. They didn't hate it but didn't go crazy over it either. Then I tried the Polynesian BBQ which has a lot of chunks so that didn't work out either. Then I saw the picture of the Mediterranean Harvest and knew that would be the magic dish. And it was! My cats absolutely love this flavor! I am so happy I finally found something both of my cats love to eat everyday.

review/summary: Even very finicky cats eat it!
review/text: I have three very picky cats who quickly get bored with the same old food. As a result, I am constantly on the lookout for different varieties of cat food that they will eat. Forget about any of the veterinarian supplied cat foods. My cats' response to those cat foods is consistently, "you must be kidding!". The weruva chicken cat food was very well received and gobbled down. But please remember, in the world of cats, variety is the answer! I rotate the foods I feed my cats each day. Just like people, cats do not like eating the same thing day in and day out, and don't hesitate to let you know their dissatisfaction.

review/summary: Roxie loves this food!
review/text: I've tried numerous canned -grain free- foods for my cat Roxie. She just doesn't care for them. I opened the can of Paw Lickin' Chicken food from Weruva and she started eating right away and never stopped till it was all gone! I was shocked! She's always had a lot of allergies and has always been picky when it comes to canned foods...so i was a happy camper when i saw how she took to Weruva's food. I contacted Weruva via email to tell them how impressed i was and to inquire where i could just purchase some single cans instead of a complete case of each of their flavors to try on Roxie. They responded immediately (actually the President of the company and co-owner responded) - WOW!  They were very helpful and gave me a lot of insight about cats and allergies and such. I did order about 8 different cans/flavors from one of the websites they mentioned and am anxious to see how Roxie does with the other flavors. Again, i am very pleased with their food and the company itself!  Will definitly order again!

review/summary: i like the smell :)
review/text: i absolutely LOVE this brand! i tried the chicken one and my kittens adored it, but we traveled steadily in june so i couldn't really get deliveries from amazon like i needed. i supplemented with petco's soulistic food because i read that weruva is contracted to make that brand. my kitties really dig it, too. but here's the difference between the two: with weruva, they eat a lot less and bulk up more. 2 cans a day for both of my 5 mo. old kitties is enough for them. with soulistic, they cannot stop eating it and one of my kitties still has a very lithe body. SO, i'm back to weruva - mack and jack this time - and i mix in SOLID GOLD SEAMEAL nutritional supplement that i purchase here. i mix extra water with the seameal and mix it in the food (about 3/4 cup) because we are in the desert and although we have ac, it is still 100+ outside.<br /><br />i bought a 6lb bag of dry salmon halo for them this go-around and they are so used to not having an dry food at all so their bodies don't like it very well. after half of this case of weruva is gone, i will initiate them into an all raw diet. i am also going to put soil in their litter box instead of all this other stuff (even though i am very happy with my KITTEN ATTRACT litter).

review/summary: My two cats love Paw Lickin' Chicken
review/text: I have two finicky eaters.  They will only eat Paw Lickin' Chicken canned food.  I've tried other varieties from Weruva and many, many others from other manufacturers.  My cats seem to like the meaty texture of the food.  They won't touch pate' type foods.  They'll lick the gravy off of foods with morsels and gravy, but won't touch the morsels.  They won't even go near wet seafood types of cat food.  It's this and Wellness brand dried food<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006MWNPM">Wellness Complete Health Salmon, Salmon Meal & Deboned Turkey Recipe Dry Cat Food</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CNZA86">Wellness Indoor Health Dry Cat Food</a>.  Needless to say the food bills are high.  This is cheaper than the four local pet food stores by 20% - 25% (two boutique stores and two chains).  I tried buying whole chickens and cooking them in the crock pot as it is cheaper than this, but they wouldn't eat it.  With Amazon Prime free shipping it makes sense for me to buy it here.  I still buy from the two boutique pet stores from time to time to assuage my guilty conscience because I'm not buying local and wouldn't have discovered this food if it hadn't been for the helpfulness of the local pet shops, but the price savings and convenience of to my door shipping is significant enough to get me to buy it here.  Buy a few cans from your local store to see if your lovlies will eat it and compare the price.

review/summary: Finally, a food ALL my cats are thrilled with!
review/text: We began feeding natural foods after 2 of our cats developed "asthma". The veterinarians treated them with prednisone and the cats became sicker and sicker.  We switched to natural foods and the asthma completely disappeared, never to return.  So, we fed natural foods for years, then picked up a few strays that refused to eat them and we went a while feeding low quality grocery store brands to those cats just so we didn't end up throwing away a lot of natural food.  Then we tried this and every one of our 6 cats are totally thrilled with it and lick their bowls clean.  We are not throwing any food away and feel great about feeding a high-quality food once again to our cats.  We have also had great luck with Evangers pheasant and Wellness Core.  The natural pet food companies seem to be working hard to make their foods tastier.  If you have tried natural foods before and have been disappointed with their palatability, you should definitely give this a try.

review/summary: Male Cat Owners Beware Seafood Based Cat Foods
review/text: I recently did research on kidney/renal failure as I just lost one of my male 7 year old cats due to CRF (chronic renal failure). CRF is common in cats, especially male cats due to their intricate urinary system. About a year ago we discovered Weruva & started adding various flavors along with their high quality dry food. My cats totally loved their new canned foods especially Out Back Grill, Asian Fushion and Mack & Jack which happen to be all seafood based. I did not know that a seafood diet is not good for cats. Fish can contribute to urinary tract problems in cats. My cat that had CRF was a slim, but normal weight for his small size, but had lost weight partly due to his high fish diet (I found out fish based cat foods do not contain the fat they need). Wuruva, Tiki Cat,Tiki Cat King Kamehameha Luau Variety Pack Canned Cat Food 12/2.8-oz cans etc are all low fat. Cats need animal fat like chicken fat, fish oil, even emu oil. Besides being needed for their overall health, it's important for their kidneys! Not that I know of any onion eating cats, but I also learned never to give any onion to your cat. Deli (sandwich meat)& some meats (ham, hot dogs) may contain onion powder. The vegetable broths in canned tuna may contain onion. Read the label on any broth (including chicken, beef) as most contain onion or "spices". Occasional tuna water from a can of tuna packed in water is okay from what I've read & that is something I have given my cats. Also, I am always careful to keep anything with Xylitol (natural sweetener) away from cats & dogs, that includes toothpaste & gum including the gum wrappers & any toothpaste spatter in the bathroom sink (if your cat likes to sleep in your sink). My CRF cat was the runt of the litter so was a 'small average' size, very active, happy, partially outdoor cat who also ate high quality dry food, but mostly Weruva the past year or so. Over the past year we probably tried every Weruva flavor & it was great seeing how well my cats took to quite a few flavors, especially the fish based ones. I made the error assuming they were getting the right food. I won't be buying fish based cat foods by the case anymore.

Keep that in Mind when ordering they can use real sources of vitamin K that are less dangerous.<br /><br />Also lately the 5 oz cans of Grandma's Chicken Soup contain less meat than the 3 oz cans of the same flavor. (They are mostly all liquid) If you buy that flavor the 3 oz cans are a better bet till they straighten that issue out. My cats and I like Paw lickin Chicken the best.

review/text: I agree with "Nicole Rae":  it makes no sense whatsoever that Weruva would be using Menadione Sodium Bisulfite. You don't need a Vit K supplement, and if you want it then use kelp pwdr because it's cheap. Google this ingredient for yourself.  For some reason TWO WERUVA FLAVORS DON'T USE THIS INGREDIENT:  PAW LICKIN CHIKIN and PEKING DUCKEN. The kitten loves them, but he loved Poly BBQ and others too.  Hey, if it's banned for human consumption in some European countries, why take the chance. I called the company and simply gave them direct feedback:  please stop using this ingredient, then I'll buy the full line so long as the kittens will eat it and luv on it.  I hope they won't be 10 yr old cats by that time.

review/summary: Damaged cans
review/text: As other reviewers have noted, the product arrived damaged... over half the cans were dented and 3 of them badly enough to compromise the seal (lovely smell). The problem is that a dent near the top of the can causes the lid to separate along the score-line that would normally only separate when you pull the pull-top lid off. It is clear that this happened before the product reached Amazon for shipment as the light bulbs shipped in the same box suffered no ill effects (not to mention the age of the stain on the cans themselves).<br /><br />The product itself seems to be OK; it looks pretty much like the pictured product, though not all of our cats enjoyed it and it has a strong fragrance of fish even when sealed properly - was a hit with one of the cats, not so much the others. For a product at this price point, and at the relative rate of damage noted in other reviews, this is not something I will buy again as I am now concerned that I may have missed a slightly damaged seal and would not want to risk feeding my (spoiled) animals a spoiled product.<br /><br />If the manufacturer is reading this, my first thoughts would be jams at case conveyor transitions, low back-pressure conveyor failure, palletizer/wrapper problems or rough forklift handling. It seems intermittent but frequent and has now cost at least one customer.

review/summary: Total rip off
review/text: I'm surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%).  This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients).  Here is what the FDA says on its web site:<br /><br />"It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a "stew," "in sauce," "in gravy," or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter)."<br /><br />On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can).  The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients.  Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight.  Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight.  So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet.<br /><br />So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva.  Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content.

review/summary: My cat don't eat it
review/text: It looks pretty healthy and with real meat, but the only problem is that my cat doesn't enjoy it at all, he doesn't really want to eat it. I don't know why, maybe it's not tasty.

review/summary: Not a hit
review/text: My cat wouldn't even take a bite of this. I figured maybe he was just being picky again, so i gave some to my younger cat who eats anything. She also wouldn't touch it. When i spend this much money on cat food, i expect it to at least smell good enough for my cats to taste it. This just smells like old fish.

review/summary: Great Food - Cats Should NOT Eat Dry Food
review/text: I don't know why this is not known to everyone, everywhere, but cats should eat a grain free, wet food diet. They cannot digest or get any nutrition from grains, so there is no reason for grains to be in cat food, yet to save money, they put it in. Also, cats naturally have a very low thirst drive, and with the correct diet, they will hardly ever drink water. If they are on a dry kibble diet, they will have to drink to get their water, and with the low thirst drive that is natural, a lot of cats don't get anywhere NEAR the amount of water they need. Cats on a dry food diet are likely to have kidney problems or urinary tract problems that could be prevented just by changing to a wet food diet. This is so important, and I urge everyone who loves their cat to get them off the dry food, and over a couple weeks, switch them to a grain free, wet food diet. Sorry to be preachy, but the word needs to be spread!<br /><br />This Weruva food is a big hit with my kitty, and it is a proper grain free wet food that makes sure he is getting the water he is supposed to get. Yes, it is canned in Thailand, but it is in an all human grade food facility. I would be much happier if it was all done in the US, but it has been reviewed by reputable sources and scored well. The other bonus, at least with the chicken flavors, is that they smell good! No stinky cat food smell, but in fact smells like something you might want a bite of. The cashier at the pet store I used to get this food from said he had eaten it, and it was good! Of course, it is also important to give them a variety, so I give him some of the "fishy" ones too, but the chicken smells great. I would recommend this food, but whether you feed this one or another one, please feed a grain free wet food diet to your cats!

review/summary: Seems to Be High Quality, But Be Aware "Product of Thailand"
review/text: I ordered this for some time but have recently stopped.  My cats took a while to begin to like it, but once they got used to it, they really liked it.  It appears to be good quality.  I have tried the Chicken and Nine Liver varieties.  That said, I was disturbed to notice, printed on the bottom of the cardboard containing the cat food, that it is a product of Thailand.  As of the writing of this review, Amazon's site does not indicate the country of origin.  There have been several very large, very disconcerting recalls of pet food from Thailand or containing ingredients from there over the past decade.  And the food safety record of Thailand of "human grade" food has also been very spotty.  As an aside, I quote "human grade" because I recently learned that that term, unfortunately, has no legal definition.  I decided to give the item 3 stars because it seems of good quality, but chose to not rate it higher because of the lack of disclosure of the country of origin and the overall price.

review/summary: Animal Food I Can Actually Recognize!
review/text: No longer are the days of anonymous mushy pet foods.  Weruva food is a distinctly different experience for my pets from one day to the next.  Prepared in a kitchen the makes people food as well only reassures me that my cats and dog are treated as friends rather than captives.

review/summary: The Cats Love This - But There's Something that Bugs Me
review/text: I ordered this cat food because we have two cats in the house and we have an agreement to keep the cats on more natural or organic foods.  They really seemed to like the cat food with fish in it, and my friend swears by the Weruva foods.  So I went ahead and ordered a case of 24 - 3 oz cans.  And of course, both cats loved it!<br /><br />But there's one thing that's really nagging at me.  Weruva cat foods, according to their "advertising" on the label, are manufactured and processed in a facility that processes human food.  To me (but what do I know?) it seems like a good thing for the cats, and perhaps not such a good thing for me.  I'm not feeling really great about this whole idea of the place where my food comes from also processes cat food.  The cardboard box gave me a few more clues - since it said in rather large letters - Made in Thailand. (It's also on the individual cans and packages - in really teeny tiny letters.) And so then I thought, "Well, I don't buy anything from Thailand so I should be ok."<br /><br />I'm usually not that squeemish - my father was in the meat production business - first as a buyer, then as a USDA live animal inspector and I also spent quite a few years of my childhood on or around farms.  I get the ranch/stockyard/processing plant connection - I've seen it up close and personal.  But then I remembered that Phillips Crab, the makers of the Maryland cakes with restaurants and food processing - which originally came from the Chesapeake Bay - was now processing blue crabs "farmed" in Asia.  And it seems that often tilapia in the market comes from Asia.  Now I'm wondering what else is from there - and more importantly - how do they handle their food production that's for the US market.<br /><br />Bottom line - Weruva's great for cats and they love it, but perhaps we need more information on our how our own foods are handled.

review/summary: GREAT GRAIN FREE OPTION
review/text: After MUCH research and two complete urinary tract blockages we discovered that our cat SHOULD NOT be eating grain. Grains such as rice, wheat, corn and gluten are present in a large majority of pet foods available on the market. Manufacturers like to insert grain into pet food to their reduce cost and create inexpensive calories. Grain causes alkaline urine in both cats and dogs. Alkaline urine leads to crystals and bladder stones and develops when an animal eats pet food with grains and fillers (high carb diet). Our pets need only meat, organs and water for proper nutrition and you are not "spoiling" your pet by feeding them an all wet food diet. Kidney failure is one of the most common diseases in cats and I have learned that I'm putting unnecessary strain my cat's kidneys by feeding him crap food. I purchased 8-10 grain free options for my cat to try out because it's very difficult to get an animal to change their diet once established. Weruva Paw Lickin Chicken was a clear winner with my cat Otis and I highly recommend it. If you think you can't afford a grain free diet for your kitty, please consider the $4,000 I have spent unblocking my cat's urinary tract when crystals formed (emergency procedure). Also, be wary of so-called prescription diets that the vets insist will remedy the problem, they are also full of grains and fillers.

review/summary: It Used To Be Better...
review/text: My cat is a picky eater, and loves his chicken. So Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken has been a huge hit with Hercules for the past year or so. That is, until the last two cases. I've been noticing that it looks a little grey, and not so much like freshly cooked chicken. Then I realized that I was throwing out about 1/3 to 1/4 of each serving, something that never happened before. Then I happened to compare an older can with one of the newer ones: Bingo! While the ingredients are the same, it looks like the amount of potato starch has been vastly increased. And the cat doesn't really like it as much.

review/summary: Real Quality Nutrition
review/text: I got this for my long hair male cat who has been prescribed wet food by the vet after having urinary tract problems. I read about Weruva and that the Paw Lickin' Chicken would be good for him and keep his urine pH at levels to prevent struvite crystals, just like the vet prescribed food. The Paw Lickin' Chicken has a lot of water and low magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium. But unlike the veterinarian recommended food, it has no byproducts or fillers or grains. Weruva actually looks like food, not gruel, and it doesn't have an unpleasant smell like a lot of cat foods. Weruva costs almost as much as the vet prescribed brand, but Weruva is clearly made with superior ingredients. I will still be monitoring my cat for any problems, but so far this food is working fine for him and I feel better knowing he is on a better quality food.<br /><br />At first my cat was hesitant to eat the Weruva food, but I believe that was simply because he wasn't used to the texture. The Weruva chicken is shredded into fine strips, rather than minced. My cat would drink the juices, as he had no problem with the flavor, but was reluctant to actually eat the chicken. So I had to mix it with the prescription food he had been eating before he would eat the Weruva food by itself. It is a good idea to mix the food with what your cat has been eating, anyway, so they can gradually get used to it. Now my cat doesn't hesitate and will eagerly eat the Weruva food.
