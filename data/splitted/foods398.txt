review/summary: the perfect chili bean
review/text: These beans are perfect for making chili if you like beans in your chili and not that Texas style junk with nothing in it. Forget other kinds of beans, dark colored vege's are the most nutritional and these beans are dark and tasty. BPA free cans too.

review/summary: 7 dented cans
review/text: Just received a shipment and there were 7 dented cans. Two were so badly dented that I discarded them.<br />More than half of the beans were "stuck" together and came out broken and mushy. The previous orders were<br />great. This one was not good at all. The current $20 price rise is a SHOCK. Subscription canceled.

review/summary: Great "No Salt Added" beans!
review/text: I have been purchasing Eden Organic products for years.  We are particularly interested in "no salt added" products and Eden puts out great quality beans, at a very reasonable price.  Amazon makes it easy to order with free super saver shipping.  Prices are better than at our Health Food store which is an hour away.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: While the beans can be overly soft, their flavor and quality are very good. Eden Organics is one of the few companies that use safe BPA-free can lining. Unfortunately, several of the cans in my recent order arrived dented. The outer box was not damaged, just the cans. Since denting compromises the safety of the contents, these had to be thrown out. I will not be ordering this online again--I'll go back to selecting individual cans in my local market.

review/summary: Almost better than dry kidney beans, at least more convenient
review/text: I haven't had a problem with this product.  Like most other canned, no-salt products (or regular ones), I rinse the contents in water before using them to reduce whatever sodium level is in the product (usually by about one third).  While dried kidney beans have little to no sodium, it takes time to get them soft.  This canned product is very good and convenient.  If you want less salt, buy the dry beans, soak them overnight in water or cook them in a lot of liquid until they soften.  If you don't have that kind of time, then these are as good as their salty counterparts on the market.

review/summary: Robust coconut flavor
review/text: Finally!  A delicious coconut cereal.  And it's organic, which is important to me.  It has large coconut *shavings* in it (not stringy shredded cocount, or miniscule flakes).<br /><br />The coconut flavor is robust and significant.  So if you're looking for something with just a "hint" of coconut, this probably isn't for you.  But if you're looking to gorge on big coconut flavor, this is the hot ticket.  I LOVE coconut, so I love this cereal.<br /><br />If you live in Southern California, I found this at my local Mother's Market for less than $4.  On sale, it was only $2.79.  Significantly cheaper than Amazon.

review/summary: More smell than flavor
review/text: While the smell is amazing, the taste is lacking compared to other Earl Gray Teas. This is the case for most of Teavana's teas, when your in the store they waft the smell of the tea toward you and your like WOW I bet that tastes amazing.... then you later taste it and its only ok... The Earl gray is not very traditional compared to other teas like Twinings and Harriods... Being from London and growing up on earl gray this tea is not horrible but there are better teas out there. Its seems like an American twist on an English classic, but if your like me and like that traditional English taste, this is not the way to go.

review/text: PORT SALUT ABBEY is truly scrumptious cheese! (Yum!).  I first got acquainted with Port Salut cheese years ago, when I was a member of "CheeseLovers International".  There, I not only bought delicious cheeses, but also became familiar with the term "tyrophile", which means "cheese-lover".  That certainly is one very accurate description of me!<br /><br />I not only became acquainted with Port Salut cheese, but also Royal Harvarti cheese -- both for the first time, via C.I.  I've had other Havarti cheese since, (no "royal Harvarti" could I find) -- and found it not to be as good as the Royal Havarti from the CheeseLovers International club.  However, this PORT SALUT ABBEY is every bit as good as the Port Salut I got from C.I. -- and even better!<br /><br />Although Port Salut does not list "wine" as one of its ingredients, it does have the slight, but distinctive taste of port wine.  "Wispride" and other cheese spreads have a port-wine version....and, though the winey flavour in Port Salut cheese is definitely present, (even without any wine being listed in the ingredients), it is much less strong than in the Wispride, or other port-wine cheese spread varieties.<br /><br />Slightly sweet, with tiniest hint of an egg-creme taste, (again, without egg-cream being listed on the label), Port Salut is a superb cheese for any and all occasions!<br /><br />This Port Salut Abbey Cheese was even better than the Port Salut cheese I bought from Cheeselovers International, because it was much creamier --and probably fresher, as well.<br /><br />I give this cheese only four stars, (although the TASTE merits ten -- if not 196 stars.  That's one for each year since Port Salut was invented, according to the label, which says, "Depuis 1819", for this French-made, pasteurized cheese.<br /><br />The reason for only four stars is this: The weight of this cheese is listed as 5 pounds here on Amazon.  The carton it comes in, (wonderfully sdecure, and also wonderfully easy to open! : ) says it weighs 4.99 pounds.  However, on the cheese itself, the weight is listed as only 4 3/4 pounds!  This prompts a rhyme from me,<br />that goes:  "Nibble?  Who is nibbling, please?  Don't take ounces off my cheese?"<br /><br />This is NOT to infer that any entity, (mouse, human, or whatever), has been "nibbling" at this cheese -- only to wonder at the short-weighing of this cheese.  In these days of high food prices, (and higher shipping rates), every ounce counts!<br /><br />I bought the 5 pound wheel, (or what I thought was a 5 pound wheel), precisely because of the higher shipping rates for smaller wheels.  In fact, I bought THREE 5-pound wheels for this very reason: Three-five pound wheels, (with shipping costs), bring the price down from approximately $17 per pound, to $14 per pound.<br />Of course, this has to be recalculated if the wheel is not 5 pounds, but only 4 and 3/4 pounds.  Still, this is a LOT better than the one-pound wheel, which, with shippping costs, comes out to an astonishing $23.00 a pound!<br /><br />Today, people are looking for bargains -- even in luxury goods.  (At least I am.)<br />I have, in fact, put a 15 pound wheel of Swiss cheese on my wish list.  It is not presently available, and perhaps never will be...but I have cast my vote here, for buying in bulk and saving money!  I see here that only four more 5-pound wheels are presently available -- and hope, fervently, that this does not mean the end of the 5-pound, (or even 4 3/4 pound), wheel!  Fourteen dollars a pound is a lot to pay -- but compared to $23 a pound, it is a positive bargain!  I respectfully suggest that five-pound wheels continue to be sold, for economy's -- (and sales!) -- sake(s).  Perhaps to make this delicious cheese even more tempting, a SLIGHTLY higher price could be charged for buying 5 1-pound wheels, together. Slightly higher than the price for a whole 5 pound wheel -- but much less, hopefully, than five one-poound wheels bought singly.<br /><br />This is truly SCRUMPTIOUS cheese.  For those who do not drink wine, (or who do not want to drink wine every time they eat this cheese....yet DO want something to drink with it), I would like to suggest drinking BLACK TEA, or COLA with it!  The<br />Tea -- and especially Cola -- might seem to be slightly, er....plebian...when drunk with this gourmet cheese.  But remember, no one is really "above it all",<br />that just about EVERYONE has eaten fast-food fare, that "nice guys" not only usually win, but also sleep better at night, that "being one of the people" is guaranteed to win more votes......and that cheese -- any cheese -- tastes quite GOOD when accompanied by drinking tea and/or cola!<br /><br />Eating Port Salut cheese is something everyone should have a chance to do -- even if only once in their lives.  Bon Appetite!  : ),

review/text: I actually ordered the two other flavors, black bean and lime, and those were awful.  So I started to think maybe the "plain" would be fine.  Glad I came here to see all the previous reviews so I won't waste my money on these also.  Apparently these are just as bad as the other flavors and leave that slimy fat-like coating all over the roof of your mouth.  That, along with the artificial flavoring, is what I disliked about the two other flavors.  I wonder if the oatmeal bar product is good, but I can't eat gluten so I won't be trying that either.

review/text: Melitta coffee is an excellent coffee for daily use.  It is a little stronger than most American brands, but your taste quickly adapts to it and you do not want to go back to regular coffee.  To me, Brazilian coffee tastes better than Colombian coffee and is smoother to drink with a good flavor.  I would recommend that anyone try a bag and see for yourself; just use a little less than usual to keep it from being too strong.

review/summary: Worst. Chai. EVER.
review/text: I've been drinking chai since the 70's. I've had literally hundreds of different blends all over the world, most of them just minor variations of the traditional recipe using a base (black or rooibos-type herbal) and cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and so forth. I've also had blends that use chamomile and orange peel as enhancers.<br /><br />I love chai. I've been looking for a good decaf chai in bulk, and I like Davidson's other teas.<br /><br />This stuff - I don't know what the heck this stuff is. It tastes quite literally like dried lawn clippings. Like straw. It does not taste like rooibos, chamomile, cloves, cardamon, cinnamon and orange peel. It's the most god-awful not-chai I've ever tasted. I really wanted to like it but I simply could not; I tried two different cups and could not make myself finish either. I poured the tea down the drain and would like to return the entire box for a refund, but that's not allowed, so I'm stuck with my purchase.<br /><br />I enjoy Davidson's teas. I love the Meyer Lemon and Bing Cherry flavors. Their French Vanilla is delicious. But this one? Eeeeeee-YUCK!<br /><br />I didn't think I would have to road-test this flavor before buying in bulk, seeing how much I like all their other teas, but lesson learned and word to the wise. I'll look elsewhere for good herbal chai.

review/summary: Original Idea---Kombucha from a Tea! And Decaf, too!
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Green Tea Decaf Kombucha uses the same delicious recipe as our Green Tea Kombucha but is naturally decaffeinated. Our organically certified CO2 decaffeination method removes only the caffeine while leaving all of the beneficial polyphenolic elements of Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) intact. This method also maintains the antioxidant properties and delicate flavor of our delicious, organically-grown Green Tea.* Unlike other green teas, this special organic Green Tea has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. This formula incorporates the natural antioxidant properties of Green Tea with a concentrated, purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm). This extract is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs and is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea. For centuries, practitioners of herbal medicine have used Kombucha to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach.* This convenient form of Kombucha can be taken daily for maximum health benefits."<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of "Kombucha-Pure", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a caffeinated version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea does include caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: We heard about the infamous, large & delicious Virginia peanuts before moving here, but didn't ever try them.  Since moving out here, we have tried many brands. Feridies is our favorite.  You really can't go wrong with any of the main brands, but we like these the best.  All of the flavors are yummy.  I love the cajun, the redskin and the salted the best, but really, they are all delicious.  This pack is a good one to buy for variety.  I also like the variety pack that has the sweet versions too!  Big, plump, crisp peanuts.  They cook them differently and they have so much flavor and crispness.  It cannot be explained or compaired to regular, store bought peanuts.  These are out here in all the stores, because we live here, but I still buy them on Amazon for the ease & the price is about the same.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Bad. Bad. Bad.
review/text: This is literally the worst salsa I have ever eaten. I bought this thinking it would be spicy. It isn't. It's really bitter and after looking at the ingredients, I can't figure out why.. They all seem pretty natural and there is no sugar at all in the product so maybe that's why? Maybe it's left over burnt flavor from the charred (not hot spicy at all) peppers used in this product. I actually had to add Valentina brand salsa/hot sauce to this to make it slightly passable, and that didn't even help enough. I'll never be buying this salsa ever again.<br />BEWARE: If you're looking for something HOT and SPICY, DON'T buy this. Also, if you have taste buds and like eating things that taste good, also don't buy this.

review/summary: Too Watery, Mild Taste and Heat
review/text: I bought this salsa because I saw Guy Fieri's face on the jar (normally I buy the big jugs of Pace Picante salsa from Costco), and I figured, it's got to be amazing since it is from such a reputable chef. The ingredients are very pure: tomato puree, red bell peppers, tomatoes, yellow bell peppers, onion, garlic, cilantro, canola oil, guajillo chile peppers, sea salt, lime juice, habanero peppers, chile de arbol peppers, chilaca peppers, and black pepper. Notice that there are no chemicals, additives, substitutes or anything that is not natural. That's a big plus. The taste is ok. It tastes mostly like tomato sauce with a hint of pepper, and a hint of spice. On Guy's Heat-O-Meter it indicates that this salsa is Hot, but it's very mildly hot, unless you chew on one of the hottest peppers chunks. But overall it's pretty mild. I don't taste the cilantro or lime in it, it's mostly the tomato, onion, and the pepper. What I didn't like about it is that it's VERY watery, with hardly any chunks (see photo), and if I make a quesadilla the watery sauce drips everywhere. I like a more consistent salsa with chunks of vegetables in it that holds it together in a wrap. I gave it 3 stars for the list of pure ingredients and calorie count (2 tbsp - 10 calories, great for low calorie diets), and I took away 2 stars for the taste and consistency.

review/summary: Same gum, way more packaging
review/text: I like this gum, it gets a 5, but here's my gripe.  For some reason they decided to change the packaging, and the changes are really lame.  This gum used to be packaged in 12 blister packs, each having 12 pieces of gum, each blister pack with a cardboard sleeve.  Now it's 16 blister packs of 9 pieces each, again each with a cardboard sleeve, but two of the sleeved blister packs are stuck together. That's right, way more packaging for the same amount of gum.  The claim is "now 50% more" because apparently when you stick two packs with 25% less together, you get 50% more.  Sadly, it's the same 144 pieces of gum, just WAY more packaging.  I hope the marketing agency that convinced Wrigley to do this incredibly stupid, environmentally irresponsible thing is forced to move to a landfill and watch as their offices get inundated by 9 piece blister packs.  The only downside to this scenario is that the process will be a third faster than if they had just left it alone, putting them out of their misery sooner.  By the way, have I mentioned that there's WAY MORE PACKAGING?

He always eats it down and he loves it; I can tell.<br /><br />You get eight cans of Sliced Chicken Hearts & Liver Feast; eight more cans of Sliced Turkey Feast with Cod and eight more cans still of Sliced Beef Feast. They also come with gravy flavoring--very good!<br /><br />The food does have some nutritional content; I always look for that when I buy food for the cat. There's some vitamin E, A, D3, B12, and B1. I like that. Naturally, ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat's personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet.<br /><br />If you catch a sale on this, stock up! However, I would use these cans of food within six months of buying them.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is one of the better brands of cat food out there; and I recommend it. Your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them, too.

review/text: This stuff is really nice to have around as a &quot;special treat&quot; for your cat, but I wouldn't introduce it as a regular daily diet or you may wind up in the poor house. It's pricey and the cans are very small, but if you want to spoil your cat for his birthday, holidays, etc., then they're great for that. My cat doesn't really care for most of them - he prefers the chicken hearts and livers the most, but could care less if he has it or not. I buy these occasionally, but it really isn't worth it too much for me to do so because he just doesn't care that much about the taste. It doesn't drive him to his dish and actually, he leaves a lot of it there and just wants his regular old Friskies. I have a Persian too, just like the commercial, but mine doesn't really like it!

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect with these, but they are like a sugar wafer with a light, creamy peanut butter filling. I was pleased with the fact that they aren't as sweet as many cookies are and the filling is pleasantly fatty on the tongue. They aren't really reminiscent of Nutter Butter cookies, except that they do have a peanut butter filling, but are delicious nonetheless. The only small point about them which I don't like is that it is difficult to break the cookies apart. They tend to tear off in ragged and uneven blocks. This is a trivial matter, but makes portion control a little more troublesome and creates more crumbs in the bag.

review/text: I had tried Frontier alcohol-free mint extract because it was called for in the recipe for a "healthified" shamrock shake.  However, that "mint" was spearmint and I prefer peppermint.  And there was a slight aftertaste to the shake.<br /><br />So I searched for a peppermint extract and found this one.  Perfect flavor and no aftertaste at all.  Just a very clean taste.<br /><br />The other reviewer commented on the price.  Well, yeah, it's "expensive" -- but we're talking ten bucks folks!  This is about six dollars more than I paid (locally) for the Frontier extract.  But there's no comparison.  I'll never use the Frontier again so that makes it way more expensive.<br /><br />Besides, I'm using this stuff a quarter-teaspoon at a time.  It will last me quite a while.<br /><br />Anyway, I love it.  Outstanding flavor.  Very, very happy.

review/text: I'll admit, I was skeptical since this tea was sold as a 5-pack at a pretty cheap price. Couldn't possibly be of good quality if they are going to sell bulk for cheap, right? Especially since I was looking for an alternative to Lupicia's Apple Black Tea (which I love, but it gets costly).<br /><br />Just opening the box and smelling the apple scent was convincing enough. The brewed tea has a strong (but not overpowering) Ceylon taste with a slight sweetness of apple. I can imagine if I mixed some sugar and refrigerated this, it would make a really delicious iced tea too.<br /><br />If you like apple black tea, I highly recommend this one. :)

When you purchase food by the case I just expect it to be fresh.  Instead what I got was 3 months from the expiration date and it tasted like it.  If you find a similiar Chex Mix item locally it will most likely have a freshness date almost a year out.  I will think twice before buying anymore food items from Amazon.

review/summary: Love the energy without the super sweet
review/text: I was turned on to Vitalyte (at the time called Gookinade) by a friend and my husband and I LOVE it. I could never drink the other "power" drinks as they were way too sweet for my taste so I always stuck with water. After trying this drink, I am hooked! My husband who always drank Gatorade came to drink only Vitalyte after trying it. We live in the desert and now drink it on a daily basis to stay hydrated. Love the lemonade- the only flavor we buy.

review/text: Love fig newtons!  These are really fresh individually sealed, unlike their 1lb counterpart packages that have a tendency to get stale rather quickly.  These are worth the extra cost for that reason alone.  But, they're grab and go snacks too that are somewhat healthy for you than a regular cookie.  They also make great treats for after ballgames and other sports.  We love these in our house, highly recommend!

review/text: I like Fig Newtons and have been missing them since I cut out white flour and enriched flour from my diet. These are made with whole grain and taste very good. The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list "high fructose corn syrup" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does. This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it.

review/text: I have to stay for long hours at school, and I've been looking for snacks I can bring that aren't too unhealthy. When I found out about these fig newton minis, I was pretty excited since I absolutely love the full size fig newtons. Since they're smaller, there is of course much less of the fruit filling.. but still, a delicious snack. The size of each individual bag is quite small (a little over 1oz) so it's not too great at staving off those hunger pangs, but it helps.

Nabisco has been baking these little gems for over 100 years and they are a part of American culture. If you actually haven't tried a "Newton" they are small cookies that consist of a soft cake outer sleeve with sweet fig jam in the middle. These packages are half the size of a regular package of newtons and come in a rigid plastic tray, inside a plastic bag, inside a small cardboard box. These were fresh and well within the "best by" date.

I am AAF with 3c/4b hair that has been thinning since the birth of my child. I have been natural for 4 years and mostly keep my hair in cornrows because of this dry, hot weather. I do "baby" my hair. Weekly conditioning, bi-weekly deep condition, satin scarves etc etc. I used this oil for my weekly conditioning. I put this on my dry hair, let it sit for a few hours (after dinner). I washed it out with apple cider vinegar and applied some shea butter and went to bed. When I wokeup I had a new head of curls!! Perfect little corkscrew curls and they were so moist. I have also been using it on my ends when I were my ponytails (between braiding). I have only been using this oil about two weeks but it really has made a difference in my curl definition and the moisture content of my hair. I highly recommend this proudcts to my natural girls!! It does have a smell to it but it disappears throughout the day. Be sure to rinse it out well.

review/summary: Cheap ingredients in an expensive bottle
review/text: This oil was something else a decade or so ago. It was also pricier. When I recently bought it at a local Indian grocer, I was surprised the price had dropped significantly. Hair oils in India are traditionally coconut oil mixed with other essential herbs, extracts etc - which is what I assumed Dabur's would be too. What a disappointment to find this only but an unhelpful formula of 1. Canola oil 2. Paraffinum Liquidum (a fancy name for Mineral oil) 3. Palm Glycerides (Solids as byproducts from hydrogenating Palm oil)...search the internet for contra-indications for these and it should steer you far away...Goes to show, bigger brands are not necessarily better (DABUR is huge in India)Unfortunately my purchase was not from Amazon and I ended up tossing it - so no refund.<br /><br />I would highly recommend pure coconut oil: you can use essential oils to add to its perfume, but sometimes I even use Azulene oil on my scalp. Works like a charm for oily, greasy scalp days...<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Easy-clean-easy-Azulene/dp/B00011JN56/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1291331352&sr=8-1

I've only been using the product for about two week now and I'm seeing big difference in my hair.  I use it as a part of deep conditioning regimen and let me say when I complete the overall process of conditioning, shampooing, and combing or brushing through my hair I have very little breakage.  If I don't use it as a part of my DC regimen than, I'll use some to a cheap conditioner as a prepoo to soften my hair for about 35 mins.  True the smell isn't the best but for the work it has done on my hair it gets my respect.  I will warn you the first ingredient used in this oil is mineral oil, so for my natural ladies who are scared of that, you may want to try the powder form.

review/text: I was using Dabur Amla Hair oil for many years and realized that it is mineral oil (Paraffinum Liquidum) and it is petroleum product and NOT a organic oil. It has Zero percent<br />(0 %) hair penetration. I have started using and trying different oils including coconut oil, and Til (Sesame) oil. I loved both - Coconut and Til oil from different company including any local Ayurvedic company in/from India which has herbs into it.<br /><br />Coconut and Til oil has more than 90% hair penetration after overnight use and I am telling this after I searched and reviewed some studies done on hair products, especially, oil. Dabur do have other hair oils product (e.g. Vatika) which has coconut oil and so if you pleased then can use that. But local Ayurvedic are far better than big brand for hair oil.<br /><br />Hope that help you a bit. Thanks.

review/text: I only used the product Amla Oil twice at the hair salon.  My hair stylist assistant washes my hair regularly and adds a cap full of the oil along with conditioner and massages it in for a few minutes and leaves it in for 10 minutes.  After she does a light shampoo to remove the oil which is very oily. YOU MUST DO A SHAMPOO OR MAYBE TWO AFTER USE.  The assistant only does one shampoo for me.  After she blows my hair out dry, my stylist styles my hair however I want and he does not put a heat protector.  My hair is left healthy, strong, and shiny (I have thick medium length hair, permed but not damaged. My hair is pretty healthy already).  The oil does not weigh my hair down, eventhough the smell is strong it is not bad.  The first use the smell lingered in my hair for two weeks and the second time of use the scent lasted 4 days.  I will continue to use this product.

review/summary: Fantastic Oil...Great for Natural Hair
review/text: I absolutely love this oil. I applied it directly to my scalp/roots, then massaged my scalp and put a bonnet over my hair and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning and washed my hair (with a homemade shampoo using castile soap) and conditioned and my hair was so incredibly soft.<br /><br />A lot of women I've heard have complained of the smell. It smells similar to the Blue Magic hair grease to me...the blue bergamont hair dressing that people use. It has a natural, almost earthy smell to it, and the smell does tend to linger. It took a day for me to stop smelling it in my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend. I am African-American, and I have natural, 3b/3c hair. I felt as if the oil has accentuated my curl pattern (not defined it anymore than usual). I have noticed that my hair is shedding a lot less, and the softness is to die for. Two thumbs up, definitely.

This product did seem to remove some of the red undertones in my hair, but didn't make it thicker or softer. This product is mainly mineral oil with dye and a bit of amla mixed in. For my hair, I prefer natural coconut oil or olive oil, so now if I wish to darken my hair I mix pure amla with either of those oils and get great results.

review/text: I just wanted to let everyone know about hair oil products Bc I use them at times.. While this product does smell, it should not be worn outside, it should only be used as a leave in treatment and as such, should be used at night and shampood out in the morning. Never leave it in all day. I have not used this particular product but "amla" is a kind of a gooseberry and that's the primary ingredient in this (this oil is an ayurvedic product). Amla is very beneficial for dandruff and dry scalp so this will help with that.  But a great hair oil I use to get my hair to be healthy and grow faster is called "Vatika" and its from the same company(its on amazon). This oil does not smell bc its a coconut oil and it also has a nice fragrance added to it, so its great. I massage it in hair at night and shampoo it out in the morning. I sometimes do it twice or three times a week. I'm not a regular User. But it really helps w hair growth and also makes it stronger. I hope this helps. Sorry about the long message though.

I'm not even sure that it's all that authentic because the ingredients on the bottle don't list any that are compelling.<br />Since trying this item, I have switched to Extra Virgin Olive Oil from my kitchen cabinet, used the same protocol for treating my hair and have noticed a softer quality in my hair as a result.<br />Don't waste the time or money ordering this product.  Go to an Indian market and choose from more authentic products.

review/summary: Worked GREAT - White Woman w/ Blonde Hair
review/text: I just got the product yesterday. I used it last night. I have fine blonde hair with damage from regular abuse. It is also thinning a little, due to the abuse. I put it on starting at roots, massaged into scalp and then ran it through the ends. It stunk. It was not the worst smelling product, but it was not nice. I left it on all night. The smell did not keep me awake. In the morning I washed it twice with a Nexus shampoo and ran a daily conditioner through my hair really quickly. It worked GREAT! My hair feels healthier. My ends show a little less damage, but really the only cure for split ends is a trim. It also looks really shiny. I plan on using this for about an 30 minutes to an hour 3 times a week for about a month then backing off to twice a week - I really don't want my hair to darken, so I might drop down to once a week, depending on how my hair reacts. I will use this product again and would advise anyone that is dealing with brittle, damaged, fine hair to use it as well.

review/summary: Works for me
review/text: I tried this product while deployed to Iraq. Being an African-American woman, our hair needs oil. This product conditioned my hair and I immediately noticed less or no breakage. My hair is in the best condition that it has been in years. I use it nightly and leave it in since my hair is very porous. It absorbs completely. This product was also excellent as a braid spray. I put it into a spray bottle and sprayed it on my scalp between the braids. No build up. I purchased many bottles prior to me redeploying back to the US. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Stinky, but gives me "fall"
review/text: I precondition with Alma oil under a shower cap for an hour once a month.  It's really stinky, but well worth it.  It seems to give my hair fall and darkened it slightly.  This product will always be a staple in my hair care arsenal.

review/summary: What is in this?
review/text: I used this once. It works.  My hair is stronger, slightly darker and softer.  My concern is what is in this product?  What types of chemicals or pesticides were sprayed on the herbs?  How pure is the oil?  The product does not have an herbal scent but rather a chemical smell.  What is in this?  I worry because the scalp absorbs products readily and these things end up in your bloodstream....that includes any hair dye and shampoos you use.  The ingredients are especially important here because we are supposed to leave this on overnight  thus giving the scalp a lot of exposure to some unknown ingredients.  Keep in mind that the chemicals and pesticides that were banned in the US years ago are shipped to third world nations and frequently re-imported into this country via these types of products.  I don't know what is in this and it may be great but I am concerned about the smell...it is not a natural scent.

review/summary: Nice hair oil
review/text: Good alternative to coconut oil when oiling your hair.  I usually use coconut oil but will occasionally use this oil for my very long hair.  It moisturizes well and washes out easily.
