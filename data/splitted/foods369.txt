review/summary: How Pure is this Extract to Volume?
review/text: While identified as pure cherry extract, the label states the ingredients to be: cherry extract, alcohol, and water.  Since it appears other extracts commonly contain alcohol and water, I can live with these additional ingredients as a compositional reality for extracts.<br /><br />Disappointingly, however, the label does not state the percentages of each ingredient.  For some extracts, the FDA specifies certain minimum percentages and/or weight to volume requirements be met for them to be marketed as an extract.  Required or not for cherry extracts, I would like Olive Nation/JR Mushrooms to provide this additional transparency on its ingredients label.<br /><br />Finally, I purchased this cherry extract to be used, in combination with the liquid form of Carlsons "Very Finest" Fish oil, as a supplement for various medical conditions.  While it's too early for me to assess any personal medical benefits of this extract, I can state it tastes a bit like cherry cough syrup.  Lacking any other opinions for now, I decided to rate this product 4 stars, and hope more reviewers start weighing in for a broader based rating and overview.

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended!
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: You Can't Tell it's Low Carb
review/text: I've been using Dreamfields for a couple of years and love every shape. It tastes no different than your regular white dried pasta and no one I've served it to has suspected it is "different". While we try to eat whole grains to lower the carb count and GI impact, but we just don't like whole wheat pasta so Dreamfields is the perfect solution.<br />Unless you like your pasta very al dente, you will probably want to cook it for a few more minutes than called for on the box.

review/summary: Dreamfields is a dream!
review/text: I first sampled this product when I got it at our local HyVee food store. However, to my dismay, they did not restock this item. It is a boon for us diabetic people in that it has only 5 digestable carbs per serving. It tastes great, and I can enjoy a little more food with this product. Amazon has a great price on this when buying a case and it is much cheaper than HyVee. I got free shipping too and that helped sweeten the deal.

review/summary: The carbs DO absorb...8-16 hours later...
review/text: I'm a type I diabetic, so it's pretty easy for me to measure whether the "5 net carb" claim on the Dreamfield's package is actually true.<br /><br />Here's what I discovered after four iterations of testing on my own body:<br /><br />2 hours after eating 5 net carbs worth of Dreamfields pasta, my blood sugar increased by about 30 mg/dL.  This mild rise in blood sugar supports the claim that Dreamfields is, in fact, only releasing 5 grams of sugar into my body.  At first I was ecstatic.<br /><br />But...about 8 fasting hours after eating Dreamfields, I noticed my blood sugar started to rise and remained greater than 300 for a number of hours.  It became a fight between my blood sugar and insulin.  My blood sugar was still high well into the next day.<br /><br />I've tried this experiment with Dreamfields four times.  The body absorbs all the Dreamfields carbs, and not just the "net" carbs.<br /><br />It's extremely dangerous for a product to be so misleading.  If you're a type I diabetic and you're eating Dreamfields and wondering why your blood sugar is so high the next day, it's because of this pasta!

I made it two days in a row and there was NO spike at all in his glucose levels.  Pasta is back on the menu.  One warning.  If you use Spaghetti sauce from jar read the labels to make sure that is also very low in carbs. Now if they could make low carb Italian bread we would be in heaven.

Don't lower the quantity and keep the price the same.  It is a insult to our intelligence.  I called dreamfields and was told that most consumers aren't as aware as i am.  Wel. AMERICA, BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU BUY.  That is a 2.5 oz difference.  Out of 16, that is a lot.  Buy something else.  If a company can decide that i would be stupid enough to not notice, well, guess what, i did.  Now, they lost a customer because of their corporate Greed.

review/summary: Gets an A+ from My Doctor
review/text: Since I am not a diabetic, I cannot comment on the reviews by others who found that this pasta affected their insulin levels.  I can, however, report what I have learned.<br /><br />I discussed the pros and cons of Dreamfields pasta products with my gastroenterologist.  To begin with, he tells me that this is the only pasta he eats at home.  It leaves him without the gassy, bloated feeling associated with other pastas.  (I also find this to be true.)  When I questioned him about a reviewer's findings that, acids (tomato sauce) change the ability of this pasta to remain a low-carb food (and thus, rendering its claim to be invalid), he told me that this makes no sense.  Tomato-based products are low acid.  Our bodies' own digestive acids are extremely strong.  If they weren't, we would be unable to properly digest our food.  As the pasta passes through the stomach and intestines, the carbohydrate level does not increase.<br /><br />For those who are gluten intolerant (Celiac disease), this is not a gluten-free product.  But, for those of us who mildly react to gluten, you may be pleasantly surprised at how well your body tolerates Dreamfields pasta.<br /><br />Eating this pasta product in normal quantities (2 ounces dried), as with any pasta product, is important.  If we follow the example of Italians, pasta is only a small portion of the meal.  To eat a large portion of pasta without also consuming a helping of vegetables, a salad, and a protein, is not healthy.<br /><br />As for texture and taste, Dreamfields pasta is excellent.  It looks, feels, and tastes like any regular brand of pasta.  You can use it as you would with any of your pasta recipes.  With the A+ rating it gets from my doctor, this will be our brand of pasta from now on.

review/summary: Low Carb Pasta
review/text: We've been watching carbs as a way of managing our weight and if you do the same you'll know that it gets tough doing without pasta. Well the good folks at Dreamfields have developed a method to make it possible to bring some of that comfort food back into your diet without tossing the low carb life out the window. Honestly, it is hard to imagine anyone not jumping off the wagon from time to time for a special occasion but as with any program, you need to get back on the next day. With these pasta products the majority of the carbs are coated and locked up somehow so you don't absorb them and as such can be easily incorporated into those many 'on the wagon' days all without any compromise on taste! That's right, no compromise on taste! It is real pasta and it tastes like it should so this is an awesome product in the low carb world!! Try it, you'll love it. Even if you are not necessarily on a low carb program, this pasta offers everyone a simple substitution to their food purchases and a chance to cut a few carbs from their daily diet.

review/summary: Love It!
review/text: I have nothing but praises for this product. Call me naive, call me a pasta lover, but I am firmly bought on the idea that this is a low carb pasta and prefer to not dispute the fact or second guess it. I love pasta, always have, always will! But since time does take a toll and careless living does have a consequence I ended being basically blocked from regular pasta. By basically I mean, that once I got a little smarter, I realized that most of my eating habits would have to change If I ever was to conquer my limitations. It was either or and going back to my many meals of italian origin, be that canneloni, lasag&ntilde;a, a la bolognesi, tutu di mare, pesto, I can go on and on and get hungry at the exact same time. The point is that Dreamfields Pasta (with such a beautiful name it can be the pasta of dreams) offers me a way out or should I rephrase and say: I way in. Man Oh Mama Mia, pasta a la alfredo, just with parmesan and butter (for me I can't believe it's not butter for the rest the real deal from the cow's mouth!) pasta primavera...I better stop! I am getting emotional and my eyes are heating up! With the upcoming Wonderfully Exciting FIFA World Cup 2010 and the beautiful first days of Summer Dreamfields Pasta appear like the saviors in a market that mostly ignore the needs, of perhaps the few, but never the less active, dedicated, and deserving as anyone else to enjoy life at its fullest! I hope this is the best of all world cups ever and I give 5 Stars to the only kid in town!

review/summary: If it's too good to be true . . .
review/text: . . . it probably is.<br /><br />If you can get past the big number 5 on the front and look at the nutritional information, you'll see that each 2 oz serving contains 41g of carbohydrates like most other pastas.  I don't buy into the "net carbs" mentality - a carb is a carb, and I was disappointed that they'd put something so hokey on their packaging without anything to back it up.  Some poking around on their website will tell you they have a method of producing the starch so that it gets through undigested, and decided I was going to drink the kool-aid and give it a try.<br /><br />The pasta tastes - like pasta!  It has none of the strange taste or texture you'd find with a whole grain variety.  You wouldn't be able to detect any difference if you tasted it next to any other brand.  Do I really think I'm only getting 5g of carbs per serving?  No.  But it tastes normal and it can't be any worse than regulary pasta so I'm going to keep buying it just in case they're right.  There's no reason not to.

review/summary: The only dry cereal I've ever loved!
review/text: As with other reviewers, this cereal was part of my childhood, and it ruined any other dry cereal for me forever.<br /><br />The chewy raisins are infinitely better than the soft gummy ones in other raisin brans (and there is the PERFECT amount of raisins! It is cereal with raisins in it, not half raisins and half cereal like some I've eaten), and the wonderfully tasty flakes (whole kernel, double-toasted REAL wheat flakes; not a paste molded into the shape of flakes) stay crunchy-to-al dente until it's eaten.<br /><br />I can only find it locally at my health food store under the name Erewhon Raisin Bran, but it's the same thing.<br /><br />[And re: the couple of "Yuck" reviews. They remind me of the time I was visiting a daughter in Florida and decided to make my 10 year-old grandson some chocolate pudding, his favorite thing in the world.<br /><br />I made it from scratch with whole milk, fresh eggs, excellent chocolate, Madagascar Bourbon vanilla, a knob of butter.  I had it cooled in little individual custard cups when he got home from school and proudly sat one of them on the table for him.<br /><br />He took a spoonful and his face fell.  Stunned, I said, "What's the matter?  Don't you like it?"<br /><br />He said as politely as he knew how, "It just doesn't taste like  REAL pudding...."  ("Real" pudding being the little Jello cups in the 6-pack: only kind of chocolate pudding he'd ever had.)  Enough said.]<br /><br />The muffins you can make with this cereal are w/o doubt the best bran muffins I've ever eaten and everyone who tries them says the very same thing.  Here's the original recipe my mother made for us kids with back in the 1940s and I make for my grandchildren today. I'm never without the batter in the fridge. (The recipe given on the Erewhon website is the chic low-fat kind of thing that tastes like dry lawnmower clippings.)<br /><br />1 15 oz. box Skinner's/Uncle Sam/Erewhon Raisin Bran<br />3 C. sugar<br />5 C. all-purpose flour<br />5 tsp. baking soda<br />2 tsp. salt<br />1 qt. buttermilk<br />4 eggs, beaten<br />1 C. veg. oil<br /><br />In BIG bowl, dump all together in the order given (Oil last, at any rate). Stir well. Batter will keep tightly covered in fridge for up to 6 weeks, so you can bake up just what you need. (Makes about 3 1/2 qts. of batter, 50-60 muffins with a slightly rounded 1/4 cup ice cream scoop. I wouldn't try to make giant muffins with this heavy batter. They might overbrown before the middle cooks.)<br /><br />Bake in buttered muffin tin in pre-heated 400 degree oven for 12-14 minutes, lower the temp to 375 for another 5-6 minutes till light golden brown. Run a knife around each muffin and flip on the side so the bottoms don't get soggy.<br /><br />(Don't try to gussie up with vanilla extract, cinnamon, etc.  You won't believe the richness of the flavor, esp. if you'll make it a day ahead and let the malty bran flavor permeate the batter.)

review/text: I have spent the better of my adult life chasing locations for Skinner's Raisin Bran. And the quest has always been worth the journey, when I can find it. Like one other review states...I,too, think that there must be a Skinner's Cult! I could be their leader. My first taste was when my Grandpa bought me a box...and that was around 56 years ago. Hooked instantly! If you are NOT one of their sugar junkies, that our generation created..you will LOVE this cereal!

review/summary: My 1st choice in raisin bran for 60 years
review/text: The wisdom in the old saying, "compare apples to apples...oranges to oranges," etc. applies here. If you compare Skinner's Raisin Bran to other raisin brans, you are comparing apples to oranges, so to speak. Skinner's is made by an entirely different process than any other raisin brans. While I have had to use Post Raisin Bran and some of the organic products when I was unable to find Skinner's, the difference in taste is dramatic. The difference is in the way each is made. Skinner's is made by steaming the whole wheat kernels, rolling them flat and baking them. The common brands of raisin brans are made from wheat flour and other ingredients, and the flour is most commonly "bleached and enriched", having been refined by separating the components of the wheat berry and bleaching the endosperm,the major ingredient in bleached wheat flour. Therefore, cereals made with bleached wheat flour lack the bran and most certainly the wheat germ. Those two nutritionally essential components of the wheat berry (the bran and the germ) not only provide the strong flavor, but also all the healthy ingredients provided by "whole wheat". Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that only whole grains can be completely metabolized by the body; refined grains less so and tend to be stored rather than fully metabolized.<br /><br />Therefore, for those cereal eaters who are accustomed to raisin bran or other cereals made from wheat flour with flavor enhancers, the Skinner's at first taste may seem strong, mainly because whole wheat has a strong flavor, which could be interpreted as "bad" because it is so different from those made with refined flour. Also, because they are made from the whole wheat berry, the Skinner's flakes have a much firmer texture, the advantage of which is that they do not get soggy in milk before you eat the whole serving. My children and grandchildren all prefer Skinner's, either as a breakfast cereal or as muffins or cookies. I am so thankful to be able to get this product from Amazon since it is scarce in the markets in my region. Remember, apples to apples, oranges to oranges....

review/summary: Best Raisin Bran there is!
review/text: I have been eating Skinner's Raisin Bran since I was a kid. It was the only Raisin Bran my Mom ever bought. A few years ago, when my local grocery store stopped carrying it, I quit eating Raisin Bran. Oh, every once in a while I would try some other brand, my husband prefers Kellogg's, but it would always turn out soggy and I can't stand soggy cereal. Recently, I started craving Raisin Bran and Skinner's was the only one I could imagine. So I searched on-line to see if it was even available anymore. To my amazement, there it was. I ordered two cases (shipping was free that way) and shared it with my family. Everyone was very happy and I get to satisfy my craving. I love the whole grain crunch that comes naturally with the rolled oat method and there are so many raisins that you get a raisin with practically every bite. I love Skinner's Raisin Bran.

review/summary: Unlike all other raisen brans -- and better!
review/text: OK, writing a review for a ceral seems silly for an adult. But I really like Skinner's Raisen Bran, and it's hard to get. My local supermarkets will sometimes carry it for awhile, but then stop carrying it, leaving me "high and dry." They all carry Uncle Sam Cereal from the same company: US Mills. Having Skinner's available here on Amazon is great.<br /><br />Skinner's Raisen Bran claims to be the first raisen bran, introduced in 1926. That may be, but what's unique about it is that the cereal flakes are not formed by grinding up the grain, making it into a paste, and then forming it into flakes. Skinner's uses toasted whole grain wheat flakes complete with the bran and germ. It's a refreshing eye-opener after spending a lifetime eating typical American cereals and other brands of raisen bran.<br /><br />In addition, Skinner's doesn't seem to coat their raisens with granuals of sugar. Who needs sugar on a sweet raisen?! Well, apparently just about all major brands of raisen bran think that you want it. Look at the raisens next time. It's quite silly. Plus, it's really just wasted sugar calories if you're watching such things.<br /><br />Skinner's is not for everyone, though. Since people are used to the more processed flakes in other cereals, they may not like the crisp, clean crunch of Skinner's. I prefer it. The un-sugared raisens are a bonus too. Personally, I think the "health food" supermarket isles and stores should all carry Skinner's. They carry other "healthy" brands of raisen bran, and those are horrid; they taste like eating cardboard! Give Skinner's a try!

review/summary: Skinners Raisin Bran - The First Raisin Bran Made
review/text: I believe this is the best tasting Raisin Bran ever made.  My Mom bought it for me when I was a little girl and I've loved it ever since!  It has the best fiber content of any raisin bran on the market; no soggy thin flakes with a raisin here and there.  It is chock full of plump, juicy raisins and delicious bran flakes.  I was so happy to have found that Amazon.com carried it. It really is the very first raisin brand ever made.  It's been my favorite for 58 years, and I guess that says there's  something really terrific about this breakfast cereal!  Thanks U.S. Mills and Amazon.com.

review/summary: Skinner's is the best
review/text: I think maybe there's a Skinner's Raisin Bran cult.  For about the last 30 years, I've been searching out this cereal in local supermarkets, but it keeps disappearing. When I found it on Amazon, I was overjoyed told all my fellow Skinner's fans.  As other people here are saying, the flakes are completely different from the processed fake flakes of almost all packaged cereals because they are rolled out and you can see the grain of the wheat kernel. They taste like real wheat, not cardboard! The raisins aren't sugared, but naturally sweet.  I was outraged when Consumer Reports gave Skinner's a low score about 15 years back.  People must be too programmed to feel that cereal has to be fake and sweet.

Doesn't get better than that.  I think I know why some people hate it...what they are tasting is good toasty bran flavor and plump natural raisins and what they are used to (Post, etc) is sugar.  Anyway, I love those crunchy little bran flakes and just enough raisins -- Skinner's Raisin Bran is perfect just the way it is.

If you eat cereal to get all the fake taste, don't buy this one, because you will only taste real bran flakes and good raisins. I've been eating this cereal for about 50 years. My Dad and I would get up every morning and make a bowl of this and eat it together before going on our way. It brings back great memories. It also helps with your digestion.

review/summary: Growing up with Skinners
review/text: I discovered Skinner's Raisin Bran when I was a child, growing up in Ashland, KY.  It was the only raisin bran that didn't get soggy when I addded milk.  When I left Kentucky, I could not find Skinners anywhere.  Then I moved to Claremont, CA and for a few years, one of the health food stores carried it--and then it stopped.  On a whim, I checked the internet, and there it was.  Since then I hae been ordering 6 boxes every few months, and I love it.  It still remains crisp, fresh and yummy.  I am a grateful fan.

review/text: This is the original raisin bran; none compare.  It is not sweetened...YEA!  It stays crunchy in milk...YEA!  Do not try to compare it to the raisin bran found on most grocery store shelves; it is a different "animal".  This is nuttier, heartier and not sweet.  It is closer to the earth, with less processing, less of a carbon footprint.  It is a squished wheat berry; you can tell by looking at it!  The wheat berry is steamed, flattened and baked.  You can't get more "whole-grain" than that.  Wheat products can be of concern, but for me, not this one.  I wish it were still sold in southern California.

review/summary: Three generations of skinner's fans!
review/text: My Dad introduced us to Skinner's years ago. We are now three generations and extended family fans of this cereal. We have some dissenters in the family and I am controversial because I prefer my skinner's on the soggy side as that allows all the flavor to emerge from the cereal. One look at the nutritional value of Skinner's versus Post or Kellogg's on the basis of sodium (skinner's very low) and fiber (skinner's very high) will tell you to give this a try. I admit the taste is maybe not for everybody as it isn't sweet but I have always found it to have a raisin in every bite and we enjoy it.

Several grocers have told me it is not made any more, but one suggested Amazon.com. I tried it, and found that Amazon.com sells the original product, and it has not been changed. It's just as delicious as ever. All it needs is a bit of cold milk, nothing else. It has enough good chewy raisins to give it a wonderful, natural sweetness without any sweetener at all. But it is the rich, hearty flavor of the natural grain that is its best quality, just like in the old days. Thanks, Amazon, for making it available.

review/text: I love this version of Skinner's RaisinBran the best as far as taste goes.  It is the tastiest and stays crisp in milk to the end of the bowl unlike other so-called Skinners versions.  But darn! It has more sugar than the blue box sold by Uncle Sam.  That version has only 8 grams sugar/cup. Sugar is increasingly implicated in many diseases and according to a 60Minutes investigation, is looking like it is a carcinogen.  Isn't it interesting that cancer, obesity, diabetes and other diseases are on the rise at the same time that added sugar is packaged in practically everything we eat.  I am starting to pay attention.

review/summary: Perfect balance of chocolate, almonds, and salt
review/text: I'm a big fan of salted dark chocolate, preferably with nuts. If you're a fan, as well, then you know how hard it is to find a brand that combines the three ingredients with finesse. I've tried a lot of different kinds of salted chocolate bars and most of them are a disappointment. Some are only available in milk chocolate (travesty!) Some don't have nuts. Most are just not salty enough. Ghirardelli has gotten it right. The chocolate is rich and dark, but not too bitter. The nuts are crushed and scattered evenly throughout the bar. The salt crystals are in the chocolate itself, instead of just coating the nuts. Tastewise, this is very similar to the Chocolove brand Almonds and Sea Salt, which is also a perfect combination. If you like one, you will like the other.

review/text: Do you love dark chocolate without it being a bit too bitter?  Do you like almonds in said dark chocolate?  Well, I don't normally review this sort of product, but I was so impressed by this bar that I simply have to rave about it!  Not only is this great dark chocolate, but it melts easily in your mouth, making it water the moment it comes into contact with your taste buds.  It reminds me of the homemade fudge frosting my mother used to top our cakes with by using Baker's chocolate squares, heavy whipping cream, butter, vanilla, and powdered sugar.  That was so delicious we all wanted to lick the bowl and beaters.  This goes up a notch, adding almonds--the best nuts in the world--cocoa chips, and the distinctive accent of sea salt.  It is definitely your best friend when you want a great chocolate to consume with the wine of your choice in front of the TV, or just because you want to reward yourself sparingly for committing to a good workout.  Believe me, it's worth it.  Ghiradelli Intense Dark Seasalt Soiree' is the best chocolate bar I've eaten so far, and I'm a chocolate tramp!

review/summary: It's good - small, tasty, crunchy, and "hullless"
review/text: I love this popcorn, it's tasty and crunchy and it's my favorite so far. Blue popcorns seem to have more flavor than yellow or white. I think the selling point of this type is that because the kernels are small the hulls shatter when it pops ("hullless"), so that you don't get the big painful pieces of hard popcorn hull in your teeth like with larger varieties. It's not going to be completely hullless but compared to regular large yellow popcorn the hulls are pretty much gone. The resulting popped corn is smaller than you may be used to, though. Try it, it's good!

review/text: My dogs love this stuff. I was currently on Taste Of Wild until I found out they were Owned by DIAMOND, bad bad company and they hide it very well. Anyways, the kibble is real small and my dogs do real well on the this formula.<br />My dogs have only been on Surf & Turf for about 3 wks and they are doing awesome on it. This stuff must taste really really good becuase my dogs go right after it. This is one of the top grain free dry kibble's out on the market. When you read this comment you must slowly introduce this kibble to them if not your going to have problems with there waste & they might vomit. It took me 3wks to totally switch them over. Anyways this stuff rock and yes I would recommend this to highly active dogs only. Here are the ingredients for the GRAIN FREE SURF&TURF. I would rate Surf&Turf & Orijen the top two dog food companies on the market. The only difference is FROMM is a US comapny & ORIJEN is FROM CANADA/<br /><br />Salmon, Duck Meal, Potatoes, Pea Flour, Sweet Potatoes, Duck, Chicken Fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols and citric acid), Dried Tomato Pomace, Salmon Meal, Whole Dried Egg, Pea Protein, Chicken, Flaxseed, Cheese, Salmon Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols), Chicken Broth, Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Apples, Green Beans, Lecithin, Chicken Cartilage, Potassium Chloride, Cranberries, Blueberries, Salt, Chicory Root Extract, Alfalfa Sprouts, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Folic Acid, Parsley, Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Bifidobacterium Longum, Lactobacillus Plantarum, Enterococcous Faecium, Vitamin A, D3, E, B12 Supplements, Choline Bitartrate, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine Mononitrate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, Manganous Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Cobalt Carbonate, Calcium Iodate, Sorbic Acid, Iron Proteinate, Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Sodium Selenite.

review/text: My golden retriever puppy had weeks of stomach problems and lots of expensive and unsuccessful testing to try to determine the problem. My puppy trainer suggested I try this grain free food. I did and his problems cleared right up. It is expensive but has all natural and healthy ingredients and should actually reduce vet bills in the long run since he is such a healthy dog now. I plan to start feeding my cat Fromm food now too. She likes the smell of the salmon in the dog's food so I'll try the salmon cat food soon. This company makes quality food for pets and produces it here in the United States.

All in all, it's great quality food.<br /><br />Plus it's made in the USA which gives me a little more peace of mind about the quality of the food. The only downside is that it smells fishy and the fishy smell tends to linger on my dogs face.

He's tried some other flavours in the Fromm line, but so far he seems like like this one the best. His coat got much more soft and shiny since he's started eating it and he gets compliments at the dog park all the time. He's a cocker spaniel so the small/average size kibble is great. Would highly recommend. I believe this flavour is also grain free, which is a bonus.

review/text: My four year old chihuahua has had epilepsy since she was about a year old. After having serious seizures about every two weeks I took her to the vet and he prescribed her phonobarbital. After researching the horrendous side effects that dogs experience while on this medicine I decided to look for a natural method. After hours apon hours of researching I found this food and I am SOOOOO thankful I did. Almost immediatly after feeding her this food her seizures stopped and she has not had a seizure in a year and a half. Thank you lord for this dog food. My dog is my world and her seizures are gone. Another effect from this dog food is her coat, she use to have dry brittle hair and my husband constantly joked around about her being "mangy" she now has a full coat of beautiful hair. On top of all the wonderful benifits, my dog LOVES this food. Fromm four start surf and turf is highly recommended, your dog will thank you!

review/summary: My pup gobbles this food up!
review/text: Fromm Surf & Turf is a great, healthy dog food. Small kibbles for any size dog (like the size of an eraser head on a pencil). Smell is not over pungent like some of the cheaper brands.<br /><br />My 5 month old pup was on Natural Balance from the rescue group that I got him from. I switched to Fromm when he had some while at a friends house and he gobbled it up, which he had never done before. He never fails to eat everything that is given to him. In fact, sometimes I wet the food a little so it will slow him down!<br /><br />I am switching him to Fromm Gold for Puppies until he gets a little older (per the vets request). He is steadily gaining about a pound a week, which is perfect.<br /><br />Lastly, I am happy that it is made locally here in Wisconsin.

review/summary: Fromm Four-Star Surf & Turf vs Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon
review/text: My 2 Minature Schnauzers are 3yrs old and picky eaters. They were occassionaly spoiled by me adding chicken breast or turkey to their dry food. They eventually got bored of the Fromm Surf & Turf but for the first month loved to eat it. Yes, it's more expensive than the other dry foods but the ingredients used helped my prevent break-outs that one of my dogs were experiencing from allergies. I switched them to the Blue Buffalo Wilderness and it has higher protein and Omega fatty acids. The dogs enjoyed the change in food but it gave them both gas and one of them had diarrhea. I like the ingredients of the Blue Buffalo but according to my vet some owners are complaining about the same effects on their dogs because it's very rich. I'm remaining with the Fromm simply because of the quality and it's grain less so it helps my dog with allergies.

Fortunately he is a small dog and the food lasts a while.  He has done well so now feeling safe to expand the diet to other flavones in this line for variety.

review/text: I've been using Fromm Surf N Turf in my rotation (which has come down to this and the beef frittata veg by Fromm) over the last several months.<br />First, I have an itchy/scratchy bichon.  Surpringly she does not have food allergies, but environmental allergies.  She gets better and worse, depending on the season.  Her coat is nice, skin, stool, all good.<br /><br />Next I have a sensitive tummy Portuguese Water dog who cannot have any grain AT ALL.  Surf N Turf is perfect and she digests it well.  I've tried several other foods and she just cannot handle foods with grain in it, not even the 'easy to digest' rice formulas.<br /><br />Even my little chihuahua, Cookie, does great on it.  Beautiful, soft and full coat, nice teeth, breath, stool and overall health.<br /><br />I do feed this as 70% of their overall diet, the other 30% being from The Honest Kitchen (Zeal and Love formulas).<br /><br />This is a food I've happily recommended!  And I don't see myself feeding anything else. Pleased with the customer service as well!

review/text: For me, Bear Creek's Chicken Noodle soup mix has three problems: 1) it tastes too salty; 2) there are teeny little corn niblets in the mix (who needs corn niblets in chicken soup?) that stay rock-hard no matter how long you simmer the soup; and 3) the noodles are too broad. I've always been a fan of thinner egg noodles. This mix is okay in a pinch, I guess, but not my favorite. I do love many of Bear Creek's other products (Hot & Sour, Darn Good Chili, etc.) and they're all wonderful.

review/text: I know, it's dry and in a packet so how can this soup compare with canned soup!?  I couldn't believe it either.  Bought on a whim one day at a high end grocer.  One 9.5 oz packet makes 8 cups of soup!  I still can't believe this soup comes out of a packet. The broth is thick & creamy, the noodles are thick and taste exactly like homemade noodles.  This is so far above ANYTHING I've ever purchased out of a can-and I'm a huge soup eater. I now buy it by the case.  It's fantastic just to whip up a batch and eat on it for a week.  My only recommendation for cooking is to simmer it at least 15 minutes beyond the recommended cooking time otherwise the tiny (barley?) pieces don't soften.

When I finally got done, the soup was great.  Don't know if I would buy again unless the salt is cut in half (at least).  I am sure the Ministrone must have suffered from the same problem - I don't remember - I do remember my son & I liked it very much - I have been unable to find it at my grocery again, though.  My grocery is WinnCo.  Please lower the salt content - People can always add salt but I have to really change the soup to make it paletable for me.

review/summary: Warning, contains mono and digltcerides. Be Careful.
review/text: I initially purchased this soup because it is not packaged in a can with the carcinogen BPA, or Bisphenol A. BPA is especially bad for men since it acts as estrogen. So bear creek chicken noodle soup seemed safe. Well I found out after consuming this soup that the food industry only has to report trans fat content from triglycerides--not from monoglycerides or diglycerides. But trans fats are inevitably formed in when mono- and diglycerides are manufactured. Since bear creek soup contains both monoglycerides and diglycerides, there is in fact trans fat in the soup. So basically it is perfectly legal to say any food product does not contain trans fat when in fact it does contain trans fat. In addition to being able to put as much as 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, not in the entire package but per serving and rounding down to zero the food industry has pulled another one over consumers. So before you or your children consume any product with monoglycerides and/or diglycerides, do some research about their dangers to your health.

review/summary: Humble indulgence
review/text: JELLO Sugar Free, Fat Free Chocolate Fudge is such an indulgence--you'd never guess it from a "free" version of the real thing. The taste is so satisfying, this chocolholic is willing to forgive its less-than desirable aspartame sweetener.  For a little more nutrition, I make this with 1 & 3/4 cup filtered water, and one hard boiled egg (protein + lots of nutrients in that yolk); and I hardly notice it's made without milk.  All in all, an automatic classic on my dessert menu.

review/summary: Fudge Fan Finds Fantastic Fare
review/text: The stores in our city, Wal-Mart and HEB, at one time, handled the Chocolate Fudge pudding.  However, as with many products, as soon as it began to catch on and fly off the shelves, some brilliant purchasing agent decides to discontinue the product.  Such is the case with these two stores... leaving a host of taste buds craving the rich chocolate flavor.  I decided to try the internet, and to my pleasant surprise, I found the delicious morsel available at Amazon.  Pleased, as I so often am, with Amazon's range of available products, I pounced upon the opportunity and purchased a case of this deceptively low calorie dessert treat.  Now, we can enjoy the dessert with wild abandon, secure in the knowledge there IS a source.  Thank you.

review/summary: Great Sugar-Free Snack - Highly Recommended!
review/text: Jell-O "Sugar-Free Instant Pudding" is a great snack! Since becoming a Type 2 diabetic last year, I am always looking for good tasting, low carb snacks.<br /><br />The Jell-O instant puddings are easy to make and taste so good that it is hard to tell it is a "diet" snack.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Best kept diet secret!!!
review/text: I have recently lost 20 pounds on the Dukan diet and I highly recommend it if you need to lose weight. But my saving grace (othet than Swiss Miss diet cocoa) is all of the flavors of Jello sugar free fat free pudding made with non fat or low fat milk. I consider myself a gourmet cook and these puddings never cease to amaze me.....especially topped with non fat Cool Whip....totally satisfies a discriminating sweet tooth!! Awesome!!<br /><br />Check it out at your grocery store!

review/summary: Real good -- but not 5-star
review/text: I've tried most of the Jello Pudding Sugar-free/fat-free flavors -- and I'm re-ordering all of them.<br /><br />I have found that the Chocolate Fudge and the Chocolate do not dissolve as well, nor set quite as well, as the other flavors. They both taste great, and are only slightly different in flavor from each other. As sugar-free/fat-free ways to eat chocolate, they are wonderful. But it is more difficult to get these chocolates to mix and to not be runny.<br /><br />The chocolate fudge when it comes out runny does make a delicious sugar-free/fat-free syrup.

review/summary: Good, low-calorie dessert
review/text: This pudding is very easy to make - done in about 5 minutes.  The texture is not as good as a cooked pudding, but it's acceptable.  The chocolate flavor is very good, better than the regular chocolate flavor.  The combination of low calories and simple preparation makes it a winner in my book.
