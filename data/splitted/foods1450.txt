review/summary: Far too inconvenient and expensive
review/text: For all of the good that it will do, (probably none), I have been to the Nescaf&eacute; web site to complain that this product is no longer available in canisters. The taste of this coffee is excellent, the price in these packets is prohibitive, and it is very inconvenient to use these packets at home. Please go to the website and complain.<br /><br />I am sure that Nestle has done this from greed alone. This way they can charge much more for less product. Of course, the claim is that this is the way the customers prefer the coffee to be packaged. Yeah, right.

review/summary: Greed and stupidity at Nescafe
review/text: I really liked this Hazelnut coffee when it was sold in canisters as I can take exact qty I want for my cup and it was more or less reasonably priced.<br />Now this one is exact opposite - I can NOT take exact qty I want for my cup and it is NOT reasonably priced.<br />So knowing that it can't compete with their previous (canister) version they just discontinued canisters.<br />DO NOT BUY IT - unless you want to encourage corporate greed and arrogance by Nescafe.<br />Tasters Choice is well on its way to join a list of brands destroyed by greed and stupidity.

review/summary: Bring the canisters back!!!!
review/text: I totally love this Hazlenut coffee and was shocked when I went to reorder the canister 3 pack and found it was no longer available.  These individual packs might be nice to have in my purse when I am out and about, but at approximately 25 cents a serving, they make absolutely no sense to have in my kitchen!  I did find some canisters for sale on a kosher grocery website and just stocked up.  A bit more expensive than what I was paying on Amazon, but still a way better deal than these high priced singles.  I hope Nescafe brings back the canisters or I will be looking for another brand of coffee.  So bummed out!

review/summary: Coffee
review/text: Unfortunately, I've been drinking coffee every since I was a baby, and I am now addicted to coffee to a certain point, but not too severely.  Sometimes I just have to have a coffee fix.<br /><br />Fortunately, I'm usually not too picky about the type or style of coffee I have for that fix.  Now sometimes I do have to have a cappucino, so I go to the natural store to get one (they are the only place I have found that will use coconut milk or almond milk, as I do not drink soy milk).<br /><br />When I am at home, sometimes I don't feel like making a whole pot, and one cup will be sufficient for me.  Therefore, these Tasters Choice Hazelnut Instant Coffee Sticks are very convenient (and tasty) for me.  I love the flavor of hazelnut.<br /><br />Not only do I drink these hazelnut instant coffees as just coffee drinks, but I also cook with them.  I also use them in my smoothies.  Coffee-flavored smoothies are wonderful, as I love the flavor of coffee.

review/summary: Bring Back Canisters
review/text: This is an outstanding product.  The taste is unbelievable for a instant coffee.  If you match this with the Creme Brulee flavored creamer from Coffee Mate, it is fantastic.  You don't need at add anything else.  Right amount of sweetness and complexity as the (artificial) flavors intertwine in a sweet harmonic dance of awesomeness.  You can also drink this black and enjoy the nutty flavor.  None of the aftertaste or characteristics that accompany an instant coffee.  The vanilla and regular Tasters Choice is not even close to this one.  They got it right with this product.  If you enjoy coffee, you will love this product.<br /><br />The best is when you take your cup and jump in a cold car the sweet smell fills your car.  Step out of the car for a second and jump in again, it will be worth it.  Unbelievable.  Try it.  works good in a small car anyway.<br /><br />Such a great product thus it saddens me not to give it the full five star rating.  Just because of the packaging.<br /><br />This is great coffee that needs to be back in the canister.  Please take a moment to send a comment to Nescafe Tasters Choice website under the 'contact us' section.  Its more expensive in the packets under the guise of 'convenience' or 'freshness'.  Lies.  Don't be fooled people.<br /><br />Read a comments under the canisters of this coffee and you will see more.

What a pity, this is wonderful coffee, but the sticks are too small and wasteful.<br /><br />I started a Facebook group for fans of the canisters who want to show their numbers, and hopefully get the company's attention.<br /><br />Amazon disallowed my first review with a link to the group.  If you're interested, just Search for "Nescafe" in Facebook.  You'll see it: "Please Bring Back Nescafe 6.1oz Canisters."

review/text: I almost hate to say it, but I really love this product. But Nestl&eacute; doesn't seem to care about what its customers want.  They care more about the higher profit margin that is generated by the new 20-pack box.  (Today's 20 cup of packets - $3.39, yesterday's canister used to get about 100 cups for $5.29 in my area.  I guess this is the way of the corporate world these days - just look at AIG and other lending agencies.<br /><br />Nestl&eacute; - please bring back the canisters...

review/text: My mom and I have been drinking this coffee for years and absolutely love it.  It is well-priced, tastes great, and it's easy to keep in the office to make at work - not to mention way less money than heading to a coffee shop.  BUT, I really hate the new packet format.  First of all, one packet really isn't enough for me for a good cup.  Second, they are annoying to open.  And most importantly, these are the opposite of environmentally friendly.  Why do we need all the excess packaging?<br /><br />Bring back the canisters!

review/summary: Honest Rating for THIS Product
review/text: I love this.  It's just the right amount of flavor: not so much that it feels like I'm drinking coffee-flavored hazelnut syrup, but enough that I don't even bother with sugar.  And it's got enough caffeine to keep me going without burning a hole in my stomach.<br /><br />And, guys, I LIKE the packets.  I can throw a few in my bag without relying on the company's coffee pot or for when I'm travelling and they take up practically zero space.  I only wish the packets were a bit larger.  They seem geared for the 6 oz. place-setting "coffee cup" that no one really uses, so I need two for a regular 10-12 oz. mug or 3 for my oversized mug.  But they are a great size for adding to a mug of hot chocolate to turn it into hazelnut mocha.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is the way people have downgraded this product because it's not their beloved canister.  Write a letter to the company instead.  People who look at reviews on Amazon are looking for information about -that- product, not about how you wish the company would bring back a different version.

review/summary: Best Coffee You Can Buy for the Price Here or in the Store
review/text: I've tried so many different types of coffee from whole beans to instant.  I've traveled to the coffee plantations of Central America and that is the only place where I've tasted better coffee.  But in the United States and what you can buy in the store, and for the price, this coffee is the best tasting.  I could probably drink this Hazelnut flavor all day if it didn't stain my teeth and put more caffeine in me than my heart can handle.  The aroma is out of this world.  The taste by itself is a perfect 10.  Add some flavored creamer like Vanilla or something else in the creamer section and you got yourself a $5 cup of coffee for less than a $1.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I can't find this in the large size.  Maybe it is to prevent customers from going overboard on this coffee at one time lol.

review/text: I'm not a huge coffee drinker because I don't usually like the taste, I get wired really easily from caffeine sometimes, and certain coffee hurts my stomach. But sometimes I need something to wake me up in the morning. I love this instant coffee. Usually what I'll do is mix it together with artificially sweetened cocoa, one packet of splenda, 6 oz of water, and two tablespoons of french vanilla creamer. I only put one packet of the hazelnut coffee in as (like I said) I'm sort of sensitive to caffeine. It wakes me up quite well without any jitters or stomach upset. This is my favorite thing in the morning. I don't mind the packets...it stays fresh and it's easy to just rip the top open and pour in the cup. I wish it were available in more grocery stores though...the only place I can get it besides amazon is target.

review/text: I was absolutely in love with Taster's Choice Hazelnut for many years.  But as GREED got hold of most of American corporations and in fact all multinationals, they started squeezing customers.  First they shrank the size of the hazelnut canisters, then they raise the price relative to the regular canisters.  Finally, they removed completely the option from the customers and offer them this incredibly expensive packaging.  The only effective way to fight them is to boycott Taster's Choice and its parent company.  Unfortunately I am still hooked on it. One star for cost and five stars for taste.  Three stars averaged.

review/summary: Love as snack or carb alternative
review/text: No fat, low sodium, low carb, some protein.  What more could you ask.  Flax?  Why yes, that too!  I am using to replace some bad habits; mini bagel in the morning, sandwich bread and chips in the afternoon.  Hope not to tire of them.  They satisfy my need for crunch.  Have a nice grain taste, but for me not cardboard at all.  Way better than a baked chip (what are those things anyway?).  Better than crackers (fat, salt and carbs).  Not really usable for a sandwich, but you can deconstruct and eat as separate items (did this when I was atkins, but now vegetarian, so....).  Also, half the price of buying retail, and the subscription will be a good idea to keep me supplied, at least until I tire of them.

review/summary: Best carbs you can eat
review/text: If you're going to eat something with pure carbs and no fat -- this is clearly the only choice. Only 10 carbs for each 3 wafers and one or two servings is the closest thing I ever come to eating bread/pasta/rice. Sure, it looks like a cork board but it tastes like something that actually was planted and lived. It's apparent after the first bite that there are no "industrial binders" to hold its crumbly goodness together. In sum, it's the food equivalent of Claude Debussy's "La Fille aux Cheveux de Lin" on your tongue!

review/summary: Great Heat, Great Flavor
review/text: I must have gotten a bottle from a great batch.  It's been almost a year, and I've barely put a dent in this stuff.  I worked my way up the tasting scale at All Sauced Up, the sauce store in Gatlinburg, TN.  They didn't even make me sign a waiver.  This was the second hottest sauce they sold.  The hottest didn't have the nice smokey flavor this one had, just pure burn (which I don't care for).  When I let people sample my jar, I put a little on a toothpick, just how it was sampled to me.  It makes everyone I know break out in a sweat, and some get hiccups.  One drop will heat an entire fajita or burrito to perfection.  I used a few drops in a sausage ball recipe and it gave a wonderful kick without completely overriding the flavor.  It's a great little bottle and will last a long time- use sparingly.<br /><br />I'm guessing quality control or whatever is a bit lax, or they don't mix it up really well before bottling if people are complaining... but I have no complaints.  I love this stuff!  One of my favorites!  If you like the smokey flavor, but want a lot less heat than this sauce (but still hot), there's a wonderful sauce called Dragon's Fury XXXHot (Red Eye brand) that I love.

review/summary: Fantastic flavor and heat if you get a good batch
review/text: I've been on a hot sauce kick for a while and worked my way up to some of the 'ultra hot' sauces.  I love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ITPE54">Blair's Death</a> sauces, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PZY08U">Mad Dog 357 Ghost Pepper</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033P2RN2">Satan's Blood</a> (for cooking), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DID5R">Dave's Insanity</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BVY02M">Ultimate Insanity</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00170OV48">Mad Dog 357</a>, and various other extract-based sauces.<br /><br />When I tried this sauce, it really blew my mind.  Where this sauce really stands out is flavor.  It does not use extracts, but is still extremely hot.  This sauce is like a fine Bordeaux compared with extract-based sauces that are like fortified wines (or in some cases like vodka).  This sauce has an amazingly pleasing and complex flavor (aroma) that lures you into believing that you are tasting a wonderfully flavorful but mild sauce.  Then the heat kicks in.  It slowly builds up over the course of a dozen or more seconds and produces an intense but wonderful pain and endorphin rush.  I was shocked and amazed that a sauce could be this flavorful and still be this intense.<br /><br />I also really love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LBNUUU">PAIN 100%</a> because it has a wonderful and complex flavor, but it is significantly less intense.  Mongoose Hot Sauce is hotter than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZSRWM">Blair's Ultra Death</a> (at least, based on my subjective taste comparisons with the bottles I got).<br /><br />The packaging of this sauce is really cool and includes an outer box, so it would make a nice gift.  The small bottle is compact enough to put in your pocket and take to restaurants.<br /><br />From the label, the ingredients are:<br /> * Bhut Jolokia Chiles<br /> * Fatalii Chiles<br /> * Vinegar<br /> * Natural Flavors<br /><br />If you are looking for something that is cheap and "stupid hot" for a practical joke, then look elsewhere.  If you are used to eating ultra hot sauces and want one with an excellent and unique flavor, then this is definitely worth trying.<br /><br />Edit: 11/25/11 -- I just started on a new bottle, and it is much milder and less flavorful than the first two bottles I tried.  It is even a different color and consistency (lighter color and much more watery).  Apparently some batches are a lot thicker and hotter than others.  Based on the 2nd batch, I am taking away a star.  The first batch was 5-stars for sure, but the 2nd is more like 3 stars since it isn't hot enough to be worth the high price for such a small bottle.

review/summary: Nice flavor but not very hot...
review/text: I bought this sauce looking for a insane over the top hot sauce and saw some sites out there that said this sauce had a scoville rating somewhere in the 2-3 million range.  It comes in a little 2 oz bottle for the price of what you'd pay for 5 oz of many other "super hot" hot sauces.  But that's what I'd expect for an extreme scoville rating in the millions.<br /><br />Well I finally got it and tried it out.  My impressions are that it actually has a very nice clean "fresh vegetable" flavor to it and a slightly fruity taste that actually makes it one of the better tasting hot sauces I've tried but, alas, it was not very hot.<br /><br />I compared it to some Mad Dog 357 Silver Collector's Edition which, according to the label, is 750,000 scoville units, and I found the Mongoose sauce to be quite timid in comparison.  In fact I'd say the Mad Dog was 3x to 5x hotter (purely subjective on my part).<br /><br />This wouldn't be such a problem except the Mongoose comes in that tiny 2 ounce bottle with a hefty price tag in a box that makes all sorts of claims about it's wickedly extreme heat.  Unfortunately it doesn't deliver -- I have several 5 oz bottles of hot sauce that are much hotter.<br /><br />It's a shame too because I like the flavor of Mongoose.  In fact the flavor is so clean and so friendly compared to other extremely hot extract sauces (which tend to have a bitter taste to them) it almost makes me wonder:<br /><br />Did they forget to put the pepper extract in this batch of Mongoose?

review/summary: Raisin Bran Omegasm
review/text: If you've never had flax seed oil before, you may notice a slightly "off" flavor to Nature's Path's version of raisin bran.  I think even flax newbies will habituate to this taste, especially because of the familiar taste of the multi-grain flakes and the raisins (see other reviews).  As one who sometimes puts a tablespoon of flax seed oil on top of oatmeal, the flax seed flavor was a welcome change from the usual cold cereal offerings.<br /><br />THis cereal is pretty darn good for you> Obviously, you're gonna want to consult a doctor or nutritionist, and I am neither.  From a lay person's pont of view, however, the 11 grams of fiber("11 WHOPPING grams," I should say--that's way more than oatmeal, and more than bran flakes or any other hot or cold cereal I've seen) 600 grams of Omegas and no saturated fat all sound very good for you.  If offers 20% of the Daily Value of iron (see nutritional information below), without any added iron!  Very rare. Perhaps it has to do with all those organic grains (and raisins): Organic whole wheat flour, organic wheat bran, organic oat bran, organic barley malt extract. (See below for a complete list of ingredients.)<br /><br />Nature's Path is making some of the most interesting cereals around, with healthy organic ingredients not often found in other products (e.g., pomegranites, pumpkin seeds). You can get a good idea of the breadth and depth of their products by visitng their website at naturespath.com<br />Nutritional Information without milk (per serving, or 3/4 cup, about 55 grams; 7 servings per container). 180 calories, 10 from from; 2.5 grams(g) of total fat, no saturated or trans fat, 600 mg of Omega 3 and also of Omega 6, no cholesterol, 280 mg sodium (12% of the daily value for a person on a 2,000 calorie diet), Total Carbohydrate, 41g (14%0, Dietary Fiber, 11g (28%), Sugar, 16 g, 4% Daily Value of of Calcium, 20% of Iron.<br /><br />Ingredients.

review/text: Bought this from Amazon Warehouse Deals, 4 boxes for $9 and change. Nowhere in the description did it say that the boxes I would receive would expire within 2 months of purchase (purchased Sept 2012, box expiration (or is it sell by?) says Nov 2012). Either way this is utterly disappointing and misleading. The organic Kashi I purchased at the grocery store in Sept 2012 does not expire until May 2013. Normally Amazon does a great job but this felt really underhanded.

Having never eaten flax of any kind before, I don't know if the aroma is typical of flax. At first serving, I was sure I'd consume the rest of the box (eventually), but would not buy more. Yet, with each serving, the aroma is less and less noticeable. I enjoy this cereal and will buy it again. It has more fiber than any other cereal (organic or not) I've seen.

review/summary: Nice crunchy cereal, but raisins are tough and chewy
review/text: I was very surprised by how tough and chewy these raisins are, right from the very first bowl. I had to take a good second look at the carton to make sure I was eating from the right box and not the Kellog's Raisin Bran I had opened a few weeks ago. I don't remember ever remarking on the consistency of the raisins in my cereal before, so this was a first.<br /><br />The only times I've had raisins this chewy were when they'd been sitting out for a while and gone stale. This box was freshly opened, so freshness was not the problem. Without exaggeration, the raisins are almost as dense and tough as pencil erasers. (I squeezed both with my fingers to compare.) The flakes are good and satisfyingly crunchy, but the raisins will give your jaws a good workout.<br /><br />As for the health benefits of this cereal, I have no doubts. Health professionals recommend getting 25-35g of fiber a day for an average adult, so the 11g per serving in here goes a long way towards the total (28%). Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not detect any fishy smell or odd taste. I am used to eating healthy foods (some of which are truly dreadful!) and have no complaints about this product other than the raisins.<br /><br />I love Nature's Path cereal. Just not this one. I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00282YCMA">Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Maple Pecan Crunch Cereal</a> instead. Much better tasting and no rubbery raisins.

review/summary: raisins too hard
review/text: I agree with Barbara that the raisins are too hard, and rate this 3.5 stars as a result.  Their Flax Plus Multibran with some Trader Joe's raisins makes a great raisin bran cereal, though.  My current favorite is their Flax Plus Red Berry Crunch.

review/summary: LOVE IT!!! Keeps my little maltese busy for hours!!!
review/text: My dog is a rescue and had really bad teeth so many of them had to be pulled.  But even with just a few, she LOVES to gnaw on this.  I love how focused she is when she get her nylabone... because she just really gets into scraping her teeth against it.<br /><br />I have bought several different nylabone flavors/types but she always seems to prefer the original and chicken flavor.<br /><br />I also follow the directions and steep them in chicken broth for a while so not sure it that flavor penetrates inside because I rinse it off after steeping.<br /><br />She seems to lose interest in them after gnawing off the nubs on one side... so they don't last too long.  In less than a year, she has gone through 8 of them.  I wish they were less expensive.

review/summary: The Good and the Bad
review/text: I've worked with different types of fondants and if you are reading reviews because you are new to the Fondant Cake process, here are some things to keep in mind:<br />1. Satin Ice is Yummier than most<br />2. Satin Ice is harder to work with than many<br />3. Satin Ice shouldn't be you're first ;)<br /><br />I started my Fondanting adventures using Wilton's, a brand that makes most professional cake decorators cringe. It isn't yummy, but it is forgiving. If you are new to cake-ing I would recommend using Wilton's the first few times to get the hang of things before moving to the more finicky fondants. If you start by using this fondant, you may be Freudianly misspronouncing it in a loud voice: "I hate you SATAN Ice!!" Really, fondant tears may stain your cheeks.<br /><br />Fondants I've used in order of easiest to work with:<br />1. Wilton's<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. Homemade Marshmallow<br /><br />Fondant's I've worked with in order of yummieness:<br />1. Homemade Marshmallow<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. (distantly) Wilton's<br /><br />I would recommend the tutorial on Satin Ice website, really great:<br />[...]<br /><br />If you are only buying Satin Ice to sculpt edible animals, than this would be a great one. For first time cake coverings, try Wilton's, get things down then come back to Satin Ice.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and good luck on your cake adventures!<br />Jackie<br />domesticfits (dot)  com

review/summary: Great tasting fondant, but hard to work with
review/text: This fondant tasts great, I find myself eating the scraps as I cover my cakes with it. However, it stiffens up and begins to crack VERY quickly once rolled out. A trick I use is to kneed a little Crisco into it before rolling it out. This makes the fondant SO much easier to roll out and you end up using less because you can roll it thinner. It also covers cakes beautifully and doesn't crack around the cake's corners if you add the shortening. As long as you make the addition, it's a five star product that's suitable for beginners to work with.

review/text: I've never tasted this (or any other dog food) so I can't speak to the taste or what it does once it's ingested.  But our pet store recommended putting a small amount on top of our puppy's dry food to get him to eat.  He is more interested in this canned food than his dry food and sometimes leaves only the dry food behind.  He seems very healthy...no complaints.

review/summary: YOU CANT BE SERIOUS!
review/text: Hello again Folks! Ahh Maxwell House ...Good to the last drop! I grew up on this stuff! BUT.........<br />I have a major beef about the fact that this coffee for one ....IS NOT A GOURMET COFFEE! I grew up on Maxwell house original and have had it from a Stove style corningware pot. a pyrex pot, a electric percolator, and so many other coffeemakers and it still tastes like Maxwell House. I love this coffee...BUT-ITs not GOURMET<br />I cant believe non gourmet coffee is selling for some of the prices they list on amazon and everywhere else. I almost feel like we the public are being taken advantage of. These price increases are ridiculously steep and in my opinion (given the fact that the US economy has almost hit a depression state) merchants , including grocers are taking advantage of the increase in delivery costs which i think is a crock. First, americans get hit with gas price increases, then utility cost increases, then food price increases and not to mention the contents are getting smaller and smaller. I find the price increases to be revolting and utterly ridiculous. I can understand cost going up a 10 or 20 cents but Maxwell house went from 6 dollars for a less than 2lb can to 15 bucks for a three pound can? I think this is sheer robbery and seemingly grocers dont care that there are people out there losing their homes and jobs...but do they care? From the looks of all the price increases and the amount of the price increases...you do the math! Ill never believe that they have to raise prices 3 to 4 dollars or more to keep up with inflation..something is really wrong with this picture. We lose our jobs and homes and have to eat scraps while Congress gets a raise and brand new free cars thru the stimulus package and the american people get price increases , their homes taken away, higher real estate taxes, job loss. Hmmm..there is something really wrong here!

review/summary: Good noodles
review/text: My mother-in-law sent me an article about it. I always look for ways to eat healthy and this is definitely something one of the top things on my list. Easy to cook and use in the stirfry, soups, or any other noodle dishes. These noodles come in different types and there are plenty of recipes online for them. They have to be washed for a while to get the fishy smell out and i don't recommend it to eat them by themselves, they dont really have any taste/very plane. The good part about them is their nutrition value, compared to regular pasta/noodles, miracle noodles have Zero Carbs, Zero Calories, gluten and soy free. So, if you want to eat good and healthy without giving up food - this is for you. Oh and Amazon has the best price as well.

review/summary: Magical mystery oil
review/text: The House of Tsang's Mongolian Fire oil is a critical and irreplaceable ingredient in my fried rice recipe, a staple of my diet which I eat nearly every day.<br /><br />When my local grocery store stopped carrying it, I tried a number of other oriental pepper oils but they couldn't hold a candle to Tsang's.  They either had way too much garlic or lacked significant "fire".<br /><br />I tried to make a similar oil starting from scratch: heating powdered cayenne pepper and fresh garlic in a mixture of  canola oil and sesame oil to about 120 C for 1 hr then allowing to stand over night.  After mixing and straining through a coffee filter, I got a product approaching the color of the original.  The taste was better than any of the other commercial products.  However, there was clearly something lacking.  Perhaps using canola oil made a difference but I suspect the key lies in a secret unlisted ingredient.<br /><br />Fortunately, I was able to find a source for the Fire Oil on line.  It is ridiculously expensive, more than my local grocer, not to mention the cost of shipping.  However, when you've gotta have it, you've got to have it!<br /><br />eesnyder<br /><br />If there is anyone that might be put off by the "fire" oil name, it is worth mentioning that the flavor is much more complex than simply hot pepper.  In fact, it is not exceptionally hot; certainly less than the benchmark Tabasco, although they are very different condiments.

review/summary: Too much product; too little time
review/text: First I'd like to say that this pepper oil has a GREAT flavor. It is the best ever for seasoning many dishes (including fried rice as noted by another reviewer). Also like that other reviewer all my local stores stopped carrying the product, even the ones that carry other House of Tsang products. So I decided to buy a case here. That was a bad move.<br /><br />Know that with this oil a little goes a long way. The case I got has a 'best by' date of January 2011. From when I received my product that was almost exactly six months. Now I can use a good amount of this oil pretty often, but as I said a little goes a long way. I'll probably use perhaps 2 bottles by the end of January. If I still use up another one, well by that time the rest may not last. Anyway that means I paid about $20 per bottle when shipping is added in. I just can't recommend ordering this product by case of twelve bottles if it only lasts six months.<br /><br />The best thing I can recommend is that since this is a great product, just hound a local grocery store manager into getting it back in stock or find sonewhere to buy single bottles.

review/text: This is one condiment that makes even frozen diet dinners taste great!<br /><br />The sesame oil plus the addition of a balance of garlic, onion, and ginger enhances otherwise ho-hum foods. Great for those who don't want vinegar-based condiments.<br /><br />Put it on take-out Chinese food or on scrambled eggs, burgers, etc. I've even used Mongolian Fire Oil to spice-up my own lasagna sauce recipe and the resulting dish received rave reviews at a church dinner.<br /><br />Some people are put off by the name: "Fire Oil" but it has less bite than regular hot sauces.

It's making me salivate just thinking about it.<br />I'm just sad that it's no longer carried in our local grocery stores, so now I have to order it - but that's how good it is!

review/summary: Coffee Easy, Coffee Delicious
review/text: I am a coffee drinker of the first order. I used to drink a couple pots a day, but now I've cut way, way back, so now that I'm not into quantity, I'm into quality. I really enjoy, really savior a good cuppa joe. I've given up my Mr. Coffee and now have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig Home Brewing System</a> and I make my coffee a cup at a time and I really love it. It only takes a minute to make a cup and each cup is different, depending on my mood.<br /><br />I've been drinking K-cup coffee for a couple years now and have more of these little cups in my house than you can shake a stick at. For awhile I used a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E">Chrome Carosel</a>, made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round.<br /><br />For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I've sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors.<br /><br />For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are:<br /><br />Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend<br />Tully's French Roast Coffee<br />Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Morning Blend<br />Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold<br /><br />For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are:<br /><br />Gloria Jean's Coffees Hazelnut Coffee<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold<br />Gloria Jean's Coffees Black Gold Extra Bold<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Private Blend<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda<br />Gloria Jean's Coffees GJ Special Blend<br /><br />And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that's not so bad, considering I don't drink, don't smoke, don't eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I'll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn't seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn't. Anyway for dinner I'll drink one of these seven:<br /><br />Tully's Full City Roast Coffee<br />Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend<br />Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic Extra Bold<br />Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend<br />Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark<br />Gloria Jean's Coffee, Classic Reserve<br /><br />And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZH8NA">Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso</a>, a Timothy's World Coffee.<br /><br />I keep my k-cups in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0TZO4">Sharpie</a>, of course, "Breakfast", "Lunch" and "Dinner". So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors I'm going to wind up with.<br /><br />I don't drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It's a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip.<br /><br />I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone's gotta have their quirks, besides, I've cut way down.<br /><br />Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that's the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn't enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I'm not as wired as I used to be, but let's face it, I'm still running on caffeine. That's not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else.<br /><br />In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I've come across in the hundreds I've tried. But please don't take my word as gospel, everybody's different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best.

review/summary: best k-cup ever
review/text: this is my personal favorite, strong notes of a medium roast coffee with just enough boldness to spike your interest...does not come close to an actual Italian cafe but as with most, interperate loosly.

review/summary: Timothy's is delicious
review/text: Timothy's is smooth and delicious... I suggest having a few different types of coffee on hand so as not to get tired of one flavor.  I drink more coffee now with the Keurig and each one is great. Definately need variety tho.

review/summary: We like this Italian Blend
review/text: Me and my wife like this particular coffee flavor for its mildness and taste. We don't like super bold coffees that leave bitter taste in your mouth. After going through a dosen of Keurig coffee flavors we found this to be the best. Now we're buying this flavor exclusively.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: As other reviewers have said, this has a nice taste, not bitter, not too strong or too weak. However I got an acidic aftertaste I do not care for, which keeps it from being a "5" for me. Everyone's tastes are different!
