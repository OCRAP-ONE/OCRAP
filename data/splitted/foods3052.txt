review/summary: If you like licorice...
review/text: you'll probably love these!  The flavor is intense, but it's great!  So much licorice candy today is bland, tastes like sugary mush.  In addition, they do a wonderful job on your breath as well, leaving it sweet and fresh.  Co-workers who tried these and don't even like licorice think they taste good.  Great price through Amazon, less than $2 per box.  Thanks Amazon!!!

review/text: Liquorice Altoids are my wife's favorite flavor of that candy, but they're hard to find in stores in our area. So, for her birthday I ordered 12 tins from the Altoids website, and they came quickly and with no problems from the Amazon site in time for her birthday. She was delighted.

I order these by the case now.

Within another 3 days, I had another case of six, as my daughter went to Amazon thinking this would make a nice Father's Day present.  If I use a tin a month, I'll be back next year for more.

review/text: I have been an Altoids fan for many years, but had never tried ,or even heard of, their Liquorice mints before. It was a very pleasant surprise to receive them. For one thing, the scent is very strong and I could smell the Liquorice through all of the packaging. I must at this point admit that I have a very good sense of smell, but I did find the scent quite pleasant. The flavor is from natural liquorice and although as strong as one would expect from an Altoids product, it is very sweet. I would highly recommend this flavor to anyone that likes Liquorice or anise flavors.

review/summary: Licorice candy, Great! Altoids Licorice Mints, UGH!
review/text: After seeing the Altoids advertisement in Amazon and based on the many favorable reviews, I quickly ordered the 12 pack. When it arrived and I took the first mint in my mouth, the aroma and taste wasn't what I expected. After the first mint, I felt a queasy feeling and quickly brushed my teeth and tongue to get rid of the lingering, nauseating taste, YUK!<br /><br />The tin's shelf life was less than a year and half from time of receipt: 14 Nov 2010 and the ingredients seemed okay: sugar, natural flavors, gum arabic and gelatin, but the freshness of the ingredients?? The mints in the tin were larger when compared to an aspirin or tylenol pill and the uniformity of mints shape were uneven giving suspect to faulty production quality control. The distributor was Callard and Browser of Chicago, but the source of production is unknown.<br /><br />If you like licorice candy and want to try ordering a 12 pack of Altoids Licorice mints from Amazon, I suggest to find a outlet where you can buy just one tine and sample it to determine that it meets your expectations in terms of value, taste, aroma, and after experience.

And this is not the taste of real liquorice, it taste of something candy we had when I was a kid and exactly like the dutch salmiak 'Lakrisal' drop, if you can get hold of that thing BUY RIGHT AWAY... But bottom line, the altoids taste incredibly good, but it's definitely not liquorice... Besides that and my childhood good taste I give it 5***** thanks...

review/text: UPDATE - I bought a tin of Liquorice Altoids at Trader Joe's and they are definately different (and better) than the ones I purchased from Amazon. The tins from Amazon don't have the purple flowers on the top and the Altoids themselves have more of a bitter taste. Original Review: I'd never tried licorice Altoids before, but based on all the great reviews and the fact that I love black licorice, I figured I couldn't go wrong. Now I'm stuck with all these lovely tins of horribleness. They taste very bitter to me and I can't even finish one. In another review someone thought maybe they got a bad batch. The numbers on my tins are L191009 110 Z3.

Tea India also makes a good masala chai, which is found throughout India. If you prefer a stronger brew, just use more than one bag per cup. The nice thing about this brand is that the tea doesn't get bitter when you steep it for longer periods - it only gets stronger.<br /><br />Add some fresh ginger to this tea and you've got something really special! I drink this tea every day. Cardamom is great for your health - it's considered a weight loss tonic in Ayurveda, and is also good for various internal organs.

I usually pick these up at a local Indian grocery for 2.99 a 60ct box. My mother, who introduced me to this brand, thinks its very strong and uses 1 teabag in about 12oz of water; Personally, I like my tea strong, so I tend to mix the same amount of water with two flavored + a basic black teabag. Mix in a little sugar and/or milk and its the perfect wake-me-up or after dinner drink (the ginger version is particularly good for that.) Our household goes through several boxes of these in a month!

But it makes a perfect balance with the Tazo Chai and all the other spices I throw in.<br /><br />After the tea is all brewed I do add honey & whole milk. The milk eliminates any bitterness.

review/summary: Good for Breakfast
review/text: Panettone is an Italian Christmas tradition. A product that is inherently artisanal and difficult to make, requires use of "sourdoughs" from Milan that have been sometimes kept alive for over a century. Understandably, you cannot get a good mass market adaptation of a real Panettone. If you want to try, you should still go for something made in Italy like Bauli, Perugina, Balocco, Motta etc. or for the quintessential higher-priced commercial panettone: Tre Marie.<br /><br />The above-notwithstanding, Bauducco is a decent product if you see it for what it is: a commercial cake from a Brazilian producer; an item that essentially exploits the Italian sounding name of the original panettone. The bottom line: if you can find this product on sale for $5 or so buy four of them. They will probably be good until new year. However, there is no way I would spend more than $8 for this.<br /><br />I found it on sale at a local store and my daughter loved it for breakfast with some milk. But that is about it.

review/summary: Most expensive bread ever, but so worth it!
review/text: I had this bread a long time ago, and I couldn't find it anywhere near me, so alas I had to order it here. Good shipping times, and MaxBras even sent me some candy for ordering! So very nice of them. Delicious bread, perfectly moist and just the best amount of sweetness. I probably won't be able to order another until next year, but well worth every penny! Now if only I can get the chocolate kind around here..

review/summary: Loving Kadoya Hot Sesame Oil!!!
review/text: I first saw Kadoya Hot Sesame Oil sitting on the shelves and  I was attracted to the bright yellow top.  I was looking for hot sesame oil and it looked so enticing.<br />I bought it, took it home, and it was just what I had been looking for all my life!!  I have tried other hot sesame oil's and they do not hold a candle to Kadoya.  It<br />seduced me and I have remained faithful all these years.  So glad you can order and have it shipped to  me....Thanks...........

review/summary: AN EXPLOSION OF FLAVOR IN YOUR MOUTH...
review/text: all chocolate chip cookies taste alike, right?  Wrong.  I heard all the great reviews about Tate's cookies, and so had to order some for myself.  The cookies can only be described as "how grandmother would make them."  Thin, not chewy, but crunchy.  The taste is "home-made" or as close to home-made as you are going to find.  I could really taste the butter ingredient in the cookie, which gave it a pleasant taste.  The chocolate chips themselves and the cookie itself was great.<br /><br />makes a great gift as well....highly recommended.

review/summary: Buyer beware--you MIGHT like these cookies (or might not)
review/text: I bought these cookies because they were rated #1 by Consumer Reports magazine, which calls them "tender".  Ha!<br /><br />If you like dark, thin, crispy cookies, then these are for you.  However, I'm a thick and chewy type of cookie gal, so these aren't the best tasting cookies, IMHO.<br /><br />To be more objective, I would say that they are baked a wee bit (1 minute?) too long.  Some people--my husband being one, but then again, he likes burnt toast!--like overbaked cookies. Not me.<br /><br />I saw his two cookies each had one chocolate chip. I checked my two--one of which<br />I put back in the package after I decided I don't like Tate's--and my remaining cookie also had one chip.  Dang!

review/summary: Teeny tiny, slightly greasy standard cookies
review/text: I purchased these cookies as a gift for a friend who LOVES chocolate chip cookies and was surprised at how much smaller they are than the picture on the package.  They are crisp and tasty but a bit greasy and frankly not worth the premium price.  I would prefer that the picture on the box represented the actual size of the product the way that competing products do.  Heck, a Pepperidge Farm cookie may not be all natural but it tastes better and you get exactly what you expect.  These were a disappointment.

review/text: Well, I just had to try canned crab meat.  I'd never had it, so I bought a can of it retail (and I decided that on-line is the way to shop for products like this).<br /><br />The meat looked and smelled fresh and was wrapped in a little cloth-like baggy.  I was impressed.  But not being a chef I just wolfed it down out of the can and it tasted like crab meat that had been soaked in water for a long time.  This is no substitute for fresh crab like the crab that's in it's shell on ice, but it's better than I expected canned crab to be.

review/text: I love crab meat.  Have many great recipes and also purchase this brand and this product because it says on the can, NO MSG.  I am highly allergic to MSG...stops my heart....so I am so careful any more about products because they slip it in under different labels. Crown Prince has other crab meat but I buy this organic one BECAUSE it says ON THE CAN NO MSG.  If they ever remove that from the label, I will stop purchasing.  Campbells used to put NO MSG on some of their soups and then stopped.  I stopped buying immediately. I just learned to make my own soup bases or buy Kitchen Basic which has great soup with NO MSG.  But besides this, it's good crab meat for those of us who live in Iowa.

review/summary: Still At the Top
review/text: While I agree with the reviewer who said this one is not as good as Twining's old Four Fruits and other fruit-flavored black teas, they've stopped offering them, and this one is a very good substitute.  It's still full-bodied black tea, and the fruit flavoring of mixed berries is pleasant and tasty.  There is caffeine, but not nearly what a cup of coffee contains.  Like another reviewer, I can no longer deal with coffee, and this tea is exactly right for me, too.  Also, in the interests of "marketing" and "today's prices", I recently tried the offerings of other tea companies, black tea with berry or currant flavoring.  I gotta say it, Twining's is still the best.  I even noticed that some of the tea companies are using smaller tea bags, along with inferior flavoring.  It's not worth the trade-off, for the consumer, seems to me, to save a buck and get tea you don't like, and that just never improves cup by cup as you "get used to it". I'd rather have Twining's, any day.

review/summary: Excellent Black Tea that Rivals the Best
review/text: This Twinings black tea with fruit favors, including strawberry, cherry, red currant, and black currant is certainly one of the best teas I've had in recent years. The tea has an excellent aroma which is delightfully aromatic without being too strong, or artificial. The taste of the tea itself is also excellent, with good body, smoothness, and just the right amount of flavorings to make it unique. It's so good that it is sometimes difficult to stop at one cup, but since there is likely less caffeine than in a cup of coffee, its not a problem. Twinings has done a great job of mixing the favors just right to make this a standout tea. And, in spite of this, the price is not unreasonable for a 25 bag package, and since the bags are individually wrapped in airtight seals, they will keep for some time and you won't have to feel pressured to go through the box of 25 quickly just because you opened the package!<br /><br />Offhand, the only tea of this kind I can think of that I might prefer even more is the French <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVROW">ST. DALFOUR Organic Tea, Tea Bags, Black Cherry, 1.75-Ounce Bags, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, which is fully organic and with no artificial flavors, a truly unique tea that is not as well known as it should be. The issue here, however, is that this tea can, at times, be very expensive to purchase: you have to watch the changing prices on Amazon to grab them when they are reasonably priced. The St Dalfour is flavored only with black cherry, but the result is similar to the Twinings tea here, but perhaps with even a richer and smoother result, at least, to my taste. (The St Dalfour teas are also individually wrapped in air-tight foil-lined packets, a nice touch.)<br /><br />But this Twinings tea here is simply excellent. Its an easy recommend to the tea lover. Great taste, good packaging, and reasonable price. Five stars.<br /><br />Note:<br />An important tip to make a good cup of tea: use the correct brewing temperature, and don't steep the tea too long. Most black teas can take fully boiled water, but lighter teas can brew better at slightly less than boiling water for the best results. Perhaps even more important (in the case of black teas): don't steep the tea too long! 1 minute to 90 seconds is usually great for a smooth, tasty cup, but if you let a tea bag sit for many minutes in the water, you'll likely come out with an overly strong, muddy taste. Try to keep it to 60 seconds with a few dunks at the end, and then see if your tea comes out more smooth. (If it's not strong enough for you at that point, try 90 seconds.)

review/summary: Tasty and good for you!
review/text: I really like this Zola with blueberry - its pretty tasty with lots of good flavor in every sip. This is a large bottle and I likely drank more of my portion in one sitting, so I had to share it. I first had Zola at the Green Festival in SF years ago and bought it locally, but these Amazon prices can't be beat. The juice makes you feel healthy and I love all the antioxidants and vitamins in here. It has a bit of a light pulp but not overly so. And it does look a bit murky if drinking out of a cup. It's a bit acidic, like pineapple, but I like that about this one. If I drank it more regularly I'd definitely get these large bottles.

review/text: Sometimes it is a challenge to find a juice that all my family members will like, as i do not want to buy several all at once. I was so happy to learn that everyone liked the Zola Acai with Blueberry, because it is a great healthy option for all of us. I found it was a tiny bit too sweet for my husband, but he still liked it. My son starts each morning with some of this juice with his breakfast, and I feel smart and responsible serving it to him. Yum!

review/text: I was never a fan of the taste of Acai, but knowing that all the great antioxidant properties that it has I was looking for a drink that was mixed. I found the solution in this blueberry mix for it makes it sweeter and taste very good. I can get all the benefits of Acai without the bitter taste. I prefer this than pills which was what I was using before. This is more natural, easier to digest, and filling! I would recommend to anyone who is looking to start taking Acai. I discovered a while back that Acai helps with my immunity, my skin, and my energy level. Now I have found a great way to take it!

The drink has a slight bitter after-taste, but it doesn't bother me at all. I could drink all of this in one sitting! My only issue with this drink is the chocolate-milk color. I will say it's a little unsettlingly to drink what looks like chocolate milk, but taste so fruity :) If you can remedy the stark difference in your mind you should definitely try it!

review/text: I'd tried another brand of Acai juice and wasn't a huge fan.  This juice (Acai + blueberry) strikes the perfect balance between healthy and tasty - it's sweet enough, but not cloyingly so.  I like the bottle size, even though I'm currently the only person in the household drinking it - it catches my eye in the fridge and it lasts a bit.  I like that it's made with organic ingredients.  For what it is, it's a very fair price.  I'm currently working on grad school finals and need this energy boost!

review/text: Our family tried this today, and was pretty impressed with it. It wasn't overly sweet like some other juices I tried before, and it wasn't too sour either. It did have a bit thick texture like the reviewer below mentioned, but it didn't really bother me. The packaging was very nice and sturdy and pleasant to look at. It is pretty big so it's a good size to share in a group of people. I thought the smell was a bit strong at first but it wasn't offensive and as I drank it, smell was no longer a concern. The color of the juice isn't too pretty to look at (also a bit murky).<br />What I liked the most is that it is USDA organic, gluten free, and sustainably harvested. 4 stars because I took 1 star off for strong smell and murky color/texture.

review/summary: ~*~*~My Girls LOVE these, PERFECT SIZE for Little Fingers~*~*~
review/text: When we first started giving these to our daughters we had to keep a very close eye on them(as with any solid food) because sometimes they would start choking and we would have to stick our fingers in their mouths and get these out.<br /><br />These do 'dissolve' pretty easily but your baby may take a little getting used to eating them like mine did. But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'.<br /><br />We have bought Walmart Store Brand & these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling.<br /><br />Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk.<br /><br />These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done. Even if I have just fed my girls, if they see us eating they will have a fit. We put some puffs on their walker or high chair trays and they are Happy again. We even pour these in their play pen & they don't even make a mess. At a restaurant if my girls are getting fussy, we'll keep giving them puffs and they are happy. We give them puffs while we are heating their food, if not they'll normally throw fits until we are feeding them.<br /><br />We've tried the Gerber flavors: Bananna, Strawberry/Apple, Apple Cinnamon & my girls love them all.

review/text: Our little grandson loves his Gerber Sweet Potato Puffs. Sprinkle some on the table before him and he'll immediately start grabbing for them and putting them in his mouth. I like that they dissolve so readily, making them a safe non-choking hazard. The taste is actually pretty good though to me they taste more like orange than sweet potato.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's not a major one, is that there is more sugar in the puffs than sweet potato. Yet, with only one gram of sugar in a half cup serving, this minor sin is forgivable.

review/summary: Good for a Teething Baby.
review/text: Our 11-month-old boy is teething and starting on solid foods. We've been giving him more and more solids for a number of months now. You'd be amazed at the things he loves to eat, such as french fries for example. In any case, my wife found Gerber's Graduates in a variety of forms and the boy seems to like them all to one degree or another.<br /><br />One of the varieties our boy likes is the Graduates puffs. They come in several flavors and the present ones we have are the apple-cinnamon. Previously we had some banana-flavored ones. In any case, the  specific flavor seems to make little difference. The little puffs are about 3/8 inch across and are star shaped. We give them to the boy one at a time, which gets somewhat tiresome. So, we place a small handful on his high-chair tray now and then. He attempts to get them all in his hand and then put them all in his mouth at the same time. What are you gonna do? He seems to like chewing them up, as best as he can, and we've had no problems with him choking or anything like that. It's a good product, but we, and the boy, prefer the Cheeto-like larger crunchies.<br /><br />Gary Peterson.

review/text: I'm 21, but these are great snacks even for adults! I first tried them when my nephew was a toddler. My sister got him these all the time because he loved them. She told me "Try one for yourself. They're really good" so I did. They melt in your mouth within seconds, so this is great for toddlers and babies who can't chew very well yet. As for myself, I'm a constant snacker, so these are a great alternative for me so I don't gain weight. They have vitamin E, Zinc, Iron, and Calcium in them. This is great nutrition for your toddler or baby ... and myself as well I suppose haha.<br /><br />So far I have only tried Strawberry apple and banana. They truly do taste like their flavors they say they are. This is another reason it is a great snack for your little ones. It'll help cause a much easier transition from these to the real thing (real strawberries, apples, and bananas I mean).<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. It's great =)

review/text: PROS<br />-great to start as finger foods (easier than cheerios to pick up and eat)<br />-dissolves quickly (less of a choking hazard)<br />-baby loves them!<br /><br />CONS<br />-stains!  As the baby drools on his hands or loses a half-eaten puff, it leaves a bright orange stain on clothing, rugs, etc.  Not easy to get out, and a lot of the other flavors are more neutral colored and do not stain as much as the sweet potato.  The last thing I want to do is have to wash his highchair cover and straps, rugs, clothes, etc because of bright orange stains all around.<br />-cheaper versions available (ie, at Target they have their own brands)<br />-does have sugar (I wish they can make a low or non-sugar version, because I'm pretty sure the baby will still eat them.  Why add unnecessary sugar into everything?)<br /><br />I started with the Gerber sweet potato, but I'll be sticking to the Target blueberry (because it's cheaper and doesn't stain)

review/text: These puffs are great for a snack for my toddler. He loves all the flavors of these, but banana most of all. My husband and I even tried one ourselves to see what they were like. In my opinion, the banana aroma is much stronger than the flavoring. It's not a bad thing, there's just a very strong aroma of bananas when you open the container, so if I hadn't tried these myself, I would assume my son is getting a flavor (sugar) overload. That is NOT the case. There is just enough flavoring to make these good. My husband (who HATES fruit of any kind and refuses to eat it) actually said these weren't bad. Coming from him, that's a huge compliment.
