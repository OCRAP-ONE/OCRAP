review/summary: Summer melts the chocolate
review/text: We live in Hanoi and we can't buy choc chips that we like, so when in town we order some or buy the ones we like to cook with when we get home.  The issue I have here is that the chocolate chips have fused into one large choc piece in the bag as it is summer and so the shipper has driven around in a hot van, and so this was a waste of my money - will need to resupply at the supermarket...

I LOOK FOR THIS GUM IN EVERY STORE I GO INTO WITHOUT ANY LUCK. SOMEONE MENTIONED LOOKING FOR THE GUM AT AMAZON. LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THAT  AMAZON WAS ABLE TO SUPPLY ME WITH THE  GUM. I BOUGHT 2 BOXES. BUT THE SHIPPING WAS SO EXPENSIVE THAT I WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO CHANGE MY FLAVOR BECAUSE THE SHIPPING COST 1/3 OF THE COST OF THE GUM.

review/summary: My Babies Did Not Appreciate This One.  Yet It Introduces Them to Onions
review/text: I gave this product four stars because on the fourth feeding, my 10-month old twins ate it without complaining even though they were unenthusiastic.  They disliked it the first two times so much that they refused to eat it.<br /><br />I feel that at least they were introduced to new foods that they'll probably like when they're a bit older.<br /><br />When I purchased this item, I was unaware it doesn't have anything sweet like all the other Earth Best flavor brands I've purchased.  Others have carrots, for example, and my babies like that.<br /><br />The ingredients for this brand are as follows: "Organic Green Beans, Water, Organic Whole Wheat Flour, Organic Roasted Onions."<br /><br />Roasted Onions - what was I thinking?  At least they weren't raw onions.  No wonder they wouldn't eat this on the first attempts.<br /><br />In the end, I'm glad I purchased this product because my babies tried onions and new foods, and this may be a natural way to introduce such foods starting at an early age.

review/summary: My Son LOVES This!!!
review/text: I wouldn't say that my son's a picky eater, but he definitely has his preferences.  He's just turning six months old now, but at our pediatrician's suggestion we started him on solid food on the earlier side (four months).  A couple of weeks ago, he transitioned from "first" foods (pears, apples, and other single-note wonders) to "second" foods like this one.  Although he's generally willing to try new foods, his responses usually range from "I guess I'll eat it" to "I might eat it if I'm desperate" to "I'd rather starve."  The Earth's Best "Creamy Apple Chicken Compote" fell into that last category.  To be honest, I tried it, too--sometimes it motivates him when he sees you eating it, and liking it--and it was fairly foul.<br /><br />But since he's big for his age (already in 9 and 12 month sizes) and growing quickly, it's important that he get enough protein--which means that, really, we can't so much give into temptation and be like, "fine, eat applesauce."  And it's been a challenge finding high-protein foods that he likes and will reliably eat.  BUT HE LOVES THIS STUFF!!!  He'll eat it morning, noon and night.  He'll eat it when the house is quiet; he'll eat it amidst distraction.  He'll eat it while the television's on; he'll eat it while the cat is staring at him.<br /><br />The Amazon price isn't, you know, earth shattering, unless you live in the Boston area and your only other source of organic baby food is Whole Foods.  In which case this is about half price.  We've started buying it by the case.

They'll eat other green beans, too, but these are definitely the favorite (and clearly preferred to the ones I make myself).

review/text: Simply put, they are relatively strong for the "breath-conscious" person and the flip top can is convenient. They are strong enough (for me) to withstand my love for onions and garlic and I like the taste. I had to resort to buying online because I can't find them locally anymore. Not quite sure why that is, but to me they are worth searching for. I guess you could call me a "mint-a-holic!" ;-) If I had to compare Eclipse and Altoids, I would say Eclipse mints are equivalent in power, but they avoid the powder mess and are packaged in a smaller tin.

review/text: Bought these specific mints because they were advertised with the magic slogan "Now with Natural germ killing" which came on the mints that were sweetened with Xylitol (same as in the gums that claim germ fighting ability).  These are not those mints any more - those had the Red Letters on the box front that also says "Now with Natural germ killing."  These do not and are sweetened with sorbitol instead.  I have had some great success switching to Xylitol in my toothpaste, gum and even as a coffee sweetener and was happy to find these again after not seeing them for awhile.  Unfortunately I was disappointed.

review/summary: best tasting healthy Hot Chocolate
review/text: The dark chocolate flavour of this gourmet healthy hot chocolate is best in 8 ounces of hot water. Research 'ganoderma, 'any disease'' at pubmed, webmd, and the like but I have heard & read of many instances in which this brand of Hot Chocolate, because of its strategic infusion of 100% Certified Organic Ganoderma Lucidum, has coincidentally positively affected many children and young adults with ADD and ADHD.  Do the research online yourself, I'm just a messenger. :)  But I do recommend you mix it in 8 ounces of hot water, after that, you can add your marshmallows, creamer & whatnot, but really, it's perfect all by itself in my opinion. I think anyone you hand this hot cup of rich chocolatey goodness to will love it, and thank you profusely, plus they will 'feel' alot better too.  Gourmet Healthy Coffee flavours [black, latte, mocha] & Organic Green Tea are available too, but for children, and especially in chilly weather, you will make many people happy serving this brand.  You'll see.

My husband is picky about the tag being able to be wrapped around the handle in such a manner that it doesn't fall into the cup, and these fill that bill.  I like that black tea is included in the mix, as that gives the tea little more ooomph than just green or white.  Very nice flavor makes this a good choice.

review/summary: Whole grain!
review/text: On the whole, my family eats a pretty healthy diet.  The majority of our food is organic and healthy.  However, we also have really busy moments sometimes, where this Whole Grain Beefaroni comes in handy.  I am glad that Chef Boyardee made the effort to product a whole grain product.  My teens really like it and I don't mind them having it once in a while.  This is one of the only canned pasta meals that doesn't contain MSG. And, the Amazon price for the pack of 12 is the lowest I've seen anywhere.  Thanks Amazon!

review/text: When I saw this product on Amazon, I thought "Great" some whole grain noodles from Chef Boyardee, NOT! Oh, yes, there is whole grain, but it is only 52% whole grain. Let's see, a 15 ounce can has two servings and if you eat the whole can that's 62 grams of carbs! So, I guess I'll save these for a time when I need to boost my blood sugar.

review/summary: excellent teas---especially for respiratory symptoms
review/text: I get some nasty chest congestion when I have a cold or the flu, and the other day, when I felt the crud sneaking up on me, I used one of these teas in order to help with the congestion I knew was about to get bad. Well, normally my congestion would progress and become horrible, even making me run to my asthma inhaler (the only time I really need it is when I have a respiratory infection). But after a couple of cups of this one tea, I found myself indeed breathing a bit more easily. I can't prove it was just the tea that did this, but I can tell you that the progression of my congestion wasn't as bad as usual, and all indicators said it would be bad (I can usually tell by how bad my throat is at the onset).<br /><br />Also, my sister used the one for throat comfort and found it made her own creeping crud FAR  less horrific than usual. Both she and I typically begin respiratory stuff with throat problems, and the pain in our throats can get pretty bad, so it's something special when she can find a tea that helps with that.<br /><br />We basically agreed that while Yogi teas are not panaceas, they are helpful in easing some of the symptoms, and that might be enough for most people to get through the cruddy cold season with their sanity more or less intact. :-)

It never came back.<br /><br />It's not the best tasting tea, to me (although my staff love it.  I gave them each a box of the sampler and told them there's no excuse now for them to call in sick again :)<br /><br />My husband hates tea but when he was sick with sore throat, stuffy head etc. I made him drink the Throat Comfort first, then the Cold Season, then the Breathe Deep.  His throat immediately stopped hurting, he stopped sneezing and was able to get some sleep.  I think he recovered sooner than he normally does too.<br /><br />Good stuff!

review/summary: Beware:  Terrible taste, possible side effects, buy at your risk
review/text: I've had very good luck with some of the teas sold by Amazon (for example, Good Earth and Triple Leaf brands), but not with this product.  Contains four different types of teas specifically formulated to combat the sniffles.<br /><br />Breathe Deep:  Tastes like jasmine incense (though licorice root and eucalyptus leaf are the top ingredients) with an unpleasant lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />Cold Season:  Very powerful smell, taste, and aftertaste.  Ginger root and licorice root are the top two ingredients.<br /><br />Throat Comfort:  Licorice root and fennel seed the top ingredients.  Can really taste the fennel and soothing to the throat but gave me stomach upset and a headache.<br /><br />Echinacea Immune Support:  Peppermint leaf and lemongrass are the top two ingredients (note that peppermint is not recommended for those with GERD).  Echinacea root is the third ingredient. Can taste the top two ingredients.  It is not an unpleasant tea, but does have an odd aftertaste.<br /><br />There is a pattern here:  Licorice root is prominent in these teas' formulations.<br /><br />Buy at your risk:  They cannot be returned under Amazon's grocery policy, though Amazon did kindly refund my money after complaining.  Yoga does not have a customer satisfaction statement on the box, so don't know how the company would handle customer dissatisfaction.

review/summary: Great price. Fresh tasting. Mild.
review/text: If you use a large amount of sundried tomatoes (for pesto, salads, pastas, whatever), you cannot beat this price.<br /><br />When shopping for sun-dried tomatoes there are generally the kind that are moist-dry (as these are). They are plump, slightly juicy, but have a concentrated tomato flavor.<br />Others are leather-dry and more shelf stable, but have to be slightly rehydrated before using them.<br /><br />These are milder tasting than some, but still have excellent flavor.  If you need "strips" for a recipe you can easily cut these with kitchen shears or add to pesto to make a fabulous pizza or pasta sauce.<br /><br />They are not the kind that are soaked in oil, which is favorable in my opinion. It makes them easily to work with and lower in fat for healthy cooking. It is rare to find a "dried" tomato this juicy without being soaked in oil.<br /><br />They do require refrigeration after you open them, so you may want to consider sharing a bag with a cooking friend because of the sheer volume.

The tomatoes are a bit big and must be cut down for cooking, but at least you can have them when you want them. 5 pounds is quite a bit - would be nice to have about a 2.5 pound size instead.

review/text: I am not sure if it was age or something else, but these just suck. Yes, I did refrigerate them right after opening the bag. I am sure it didn't help that Amazon sent them via Fedup-with-Fedex so they wasted away in Fedex's rotten warehouse for about 2 weeks before finally making their way to my door.<br /><br />Tough, very tart, odd odor. They certainly weren't edible as-is. Trying to hydrate them to get rid of the tartness didn't do much good. Tried to use them to make a sauce - cooking made them tender but the odd taste and aroma persisted. I am sorry that I wasted my money on this product.

review/summary: Good For Soups, Stews.....Great Price
review/text: Sun dried tomatoes are kinda in a class by themselves as far as a product, and flavor.  Some fruits and certain olives are sun dried, but tomatoes seem to be a favorite that are easily available.  I'm a lover of tomatoes in any form and sun dried is no exception.  Like a lot of other dried products I use these mostly for hiking and camping.  I've never been one to settle for just hot dogs and canned meals on a hike. I actually look forward to the open fire dinners on a wilderness trip as much as I do the hike itself.  Sun dried tomatoes make an excellent and flavorful addition to camp soups and stews.  I use them often as a substitute for tomato powder that is mostly to give a soup a tomato broth flavor.  Although these tomatoes come in a nice "fun" size suitable for just eating as is, I don't really eat them, or recommend them that way.  If you like your sun dried tomatoes as a snack, or in salads, I would suggest you buy one of the more expensive brands.  The expensive ones are a little more tender and a smidgen more flavorful than the Roland's.  But if you like using sun drieds in a soup, stew, or casserole, I highly recommend the Roland's.  The price can't be beat here on Amazon for a 5 lb bag, and once they are warmed and simmered in a big pot as I use them, trust me when I tell you they all pretty much taste the same.  They are very convenient to tote along on a hike in your back pack, and are very much appreciated in a hot stew over an open fire way out yonder somewhere. Go for it and enjoy...

review/summary: Chewy bits of sunshine
review/text: Brilliant color, tangy taste, and a chewy texture that is just right.  Roland Sun-dried tomatoes in the 5 lb bag have exceeded our expectations, especially for a dried tomato that is not packed in oil.<br /><br />Other brands that we've had were hard as rocks, some aspired to at least be leathery.  Some other brands have had a bizarre and unpleasant chemical flavor and unwanted smell.  Not here - Roland Sundried tomatoes in the 5 lb bag are moist, flavorful, and opening the bag was an aromatic treat that made us think of our favorite pizzeria.<br /><br />One note - it's not a reclosable bag, and it's rather hard to use 5 entire lbs of tomatoes at once.  Re-bagging into ziplocs will be needed.  Quite worth it for the price, tho.  Good stuff.

review/text: I've tried the Roland sun dried tomatoes in garlic and olive oil previously and they were good. I thought I would try these next. I ordered these a couple of months ago and decided to open them up and put these in a salad. One bite and I spit them out. These tasted like plastic and I was concerned that I was going to get poisoned. I don't know if being vacuum packed in a thick plastic bag is the best thing. The whole 5 lb. bag is sitting in my outside garbage. My money was wasted which is a shame since I've tried other Roland products and have been very pleased, especially there Balsalmic Glaze.

Yeah, it's pretty tasty, but you would have to be an idiot to support these clowns in their attempt to pick your pocket like this.  In Hawaii, the exact same article is about $5 and targets tourists, because anyone who truly wants this would just make some from scratch.  It's not hard, the ingredients are easily available at any grocery store, and home made does not have the chemical aftertaste.  It doesn't even take long to make, and you can easily have it done, fresh, if you start the same time you begin to cook your pancakes.  You are not doing anything else except waiting for the tiny bubbles to form and start to pop, anyway.

review/text: When these bones arrived, my dog KNEW that something inside the box was for her. On Christmas day, we opened up the box and unwrapped one of her bones. The knuckle fell off (i'm assuming it got tossed around a lot in shipping) but no worries, Munchkin ate that as well. We put the bone on her blanked she normally uses to play on to help keep the mess down. Munchkin, a 100-pound 8 month-old Newfoundland is STILL working on her bone. Lasts a long time and provides hours of chewing time!

review/summary: Mammoth bones are HUGE
review/text: I bought two of these for my daughter's dogs. They were literally "stunned"by the size. Her larger dog would not leave the bone. She finally had to take it from him so he would go for a walk! The smaller dog (30 pounds) could barely lift her bone. I highly recommend this product, if just for the amusement factor, but the dogs loved to chew them also. probably not appropriate for a small space or a tiny dog.

review/summary: Bad Bone
review/text: I bought this item prior to christmas 2011, and once it arrived i gave it to my dog, who (of course) began slobbering all over it.  He spent the next 2 days, after i threw the bone away, vomiting all over everything.  I dont know if i got a bad item, or if they are all like this, but i would strongly recommend going elsewhere for your pets chew-toy needs.

review/summary: My dogs love these bones! :D
review/text: Both my dogs are aggressive chewers. I usually give them rawhide everyday but I've been hearing that rawhides are actually bad for dogs so I decided I'd cut down on how many I give them.<br />I got two of these bones, one each for my dogs.  I expected them to chew off some of the good crunchiness off of it and then leave it alone but no, they really enjoy them.  They chew them up until the tops of the bones have fallen off and then they keep on chewing.  It lasts my dogs for about 2 days but then they get bored with it and I'll feed them some other kind of bones or rawhide but they'll keep going back to the bones.<br />I've already ordered another order for them and I'm here to make a third purchase for them.  So, I'm pretty happy with them.<br />On the side of caution..not only does the boney ends get chewed off, if you're worried about choking hazards, which I don't cause they're really big pieces, the bone does break apart after some chewing on it.<br />Also, these bones can be quite messy.  I'm use to cleaning up after my dogs so that doesn't bother me much until they decided to lug the bones on to the bed and start chewing.  I thought nothing of it at first because the motion of them chewing on the bones lulled me to sleep.  But during the night I kept feeling these little hard pieces of bone debris.  I woke up, turned on the light and my sheets were covered in a little snow fall of bone debris.  So, I wouldn't recommend allowing your dog to bring them up on your furniture for that reason.<br />Otherwise, any aggressive chewer will really enjoy this bone.

review/summary: Huge and messy
review/text: I got this for my sisters jackabee in NYC. She was not happy about it. Apparently it makes a mess all over the apartment... But her dog loves it. And thats the important thing. The dog was a little intimidated by it, but very quickly warmed up to it and started dragging it everywhere. Much to my sisters chagrin. So I would say this is definiately for large outside dogs. My sister now keeps it in the dog food until she can supervise its consumption in a safe area. The dog didnt get sick from it or have any adverse side effects as some other reviewers indicated.<br /><br />This bone is perfect for the large loved outdoor dog in your life!

review/summary: smokehouse is an excellant brand
review/text: I commented on someones review of this product whos dog became very ill, which caused me to look at some of the other negitive reviews and I would like to offer information about this product and my experiance with smokehouse.  I have purchased this brand for many years. I have also purchased other brands. None of my dogs has every gotten sick from a smokehouse bone. At one point I purchased a bag of 3 bones that were a differant brand, when I opened up the bag a cloud of mold poofed into the air. Obviously I didnt give them to my dogs. My point is this the brand this happened with is well known and reliable, but that doesnt mean nothing ever goes wrong.  Most people at sometime in their life have purchased a moldy loaf of bread, or cheese or even gone to a resturant where there was something very definantly wrong with the food. It may not happen often but when it does its dangerous, and unpleasant. But we still continue to buy food at the grocery store and go to resturants.<br /><br />There are differances in opinions of even vets as to whether or not you should use properly cured beef bones or raw hide chews. I have never had a problem with the cured beef bones from smokehouse and I know of vets that recommend bones vs rawhide chews and rawhide chews vs cured beef bones. Yes pieces of bone can be broken off, swallowed, and then get lodged in the system, I also know of dogs that have had rawhide chews that have caused serious health issues. If a dog gets a large enough piece of rawhide swallowed, contrary to what some think it does not get fully digested and can also cause vomiting and even a blockage.<br /><br />When you deal with food whether its for pets or humans things do go wrong.<br /><br />The smokehouse bones keep my dogs teeth free of tartar, they have fun, Im happy and have never had a problem. I under no circumstances will give my dogs rawhide anything. Ive know of several dogs that have had issues with rawhide and only one dog that had a minor problem with a cured beef bone and it was not a smokehouse bone.

review/text: I have an eight year old Great Dane and he thought it was Christmas the moment UPS delivered this to us. For the next three days all he did was work on this bone. A month later, it's scattered in small pieces around the house and he lays around still gnawing on the big knuckle at the end. The only negative with the flavored bones are they leaves a pretty big mess. If you can handle that you will have one happy and busy dog.

review/summary: My Bone is Bigger! !!
review/text: This bone is huge! Literally bigger my forearm. My full-grown German Shepard has a hard time carrying it around (he actually drags it).<br /><br />***When I was unwrapping the bone, it suffered a one foot drop onto concrete and a large chunk off the end broke off. Now, my dog has a bone and a portable bone chunk he can actually carry around.<br />Personally this was a good thing, but it did leave lots of small bits and chunks. So I would take caution if you had a smaller dog that can choke on things easily.

review/summary: Bigger than appears! Holy cow!
review/text: I purchased this for my 80lb lab mix for his Christmas present, and I could not believe how HUGE it was. It's a femur AND a knuckle bone, which quickly came detached after my dog chewed away all the connecting tissues.  That's actually great, because now he has TWO bones, both of which are still enormous. Amazing value.<br /><br />I recommend starting this as an "outside" toy, because it is pretty messy until they chew all the tidbits off.  It only took my dog two days to clean it off enough to make it an indoor toy.  I foresee this thing lasting him a long time.

review/summary: A Little Messy, but my Dog Loved it! Recommended!
review/text: I have an 8 month old Black Lab and she chews on everything, especially shoes. I was buying her some of those rawhide strip things, however she finishes those off in a matter of minutes. I wanted something huge which would take her months to get through. This is absolutely the perfect product I was looking for.<br /><br />Upon opening the shipping box you can notice a strong smell of the bone which is wrapped in plastic. The bone was very greasy and still had some meat on it. I unwrapped it and put in on the kitchen floor. My dog (Ripley) looked at the bone, then back at me thinking, "really? Is that actually for me". It took her a while to get going on it, as I don't think she knew where to start, but after a few minutes she was really going to town. She stripped off all the meat first, and then just started gnawing on one of the ends.<br /><br />There were little bits of crap all over the floor, however she cleaned most of them up pretty quick. I did notice some greasy lines on the kitchen floor and the smell is still quite strong, however it makes her happy, and that is what it's all about.<br /><br />Over-all it is a huge bone for a great price. My dog loves it and I'm sure any other dog would as well. Recommended.<br /><br />*** UPDATE ***<br /><br />After my dog ate all the bits of meat off of it and started working on the bone I noticed she seemed to not feel well. She went through a week or so throwing up and I took the bone away, however she seemed to keep away from it as well. I have heard other reviews say this, so I do not think it was just this bone or my dog. I cannot recommend this product anymore. Review rating changed from 4 stars to 2 stars. Be careful!

review/text: Just got this in today and had to break it open just to see how the dogs would react to it. Let me say it's so awesome!!! Its HUGE!!! I mean by the title I thought it was just a slight exaggeration, but by no means is it a exaggeration. I bought this bone for my 65 lb shepherd mix and I bought a smaller one for my golden retriever mix bc she has a chewing problem. Well needless to say they are both sharing this bone and are very happy. I have no doubts that this bone will last for quite some time. My male likes scraping the yummy bits off and eating it. I don't quite know what that is. My little girl loves chewing the nub. It has a typical bone odor. I have stone as my flooring, so I don't really know if it stains or not. I don't know yet if it will cause digestion problems, but if it does I'll update my post about it. A GREAT BUY!

review/summary: Purchase with caution
review/text: This bone is MASSIVE!!!  Probably the biggest bone that I have ever seen.  My 135 lb. bullmastiff puppy loved this!  When I opened the packaging, 1/4 of the bone was broken and fell off, which was fine because I didn't want to overwhelm my puppy.  I was able to store the larger part in the fridge for another time.  He gnawed on it all day and night, but later in the evening, threw up a big pile on the carpet.  I think all of the fatty bits made him get an upset stomach, so I put the bone away until the following day.  He is a serious chewer and pretty much got that small portion down to a piece that could fit in the palm of your hand, with bits of bone laying everywhere.  Obviously, he ate most of the pieces and 2 days later was throwing up.  Needless to say, even though this bone is awesome and your dog will most likely love it, you probably need to limit their access to very short periods of time and definitely supervise.  It also smells horrible and the smell will get all over your dog and anything it touches.  I will not be bringing the other larger piece out for a long while.

review/text: And by haunt you, I mean in the form of vomit all over the place. Though my dog, a 150lb. Newfoundland, absolutely loved the bone but even after just a few minutes chewing it, he had managed to gnaw off some bone slivers and swallowed them. Shortly after that he was throwing up, not just the bone slivers, but everything he had eaten for what seemed like days. So, while it seemed great to give him a treat that he loved so thoroughly, the aftermath just wasn't worth it.

review/text: So my 4 1/2 month old Yellow Lab is going through his teething and chewing phase where everything is fair game. I lost a pair of $100 sunglasses, 3 books and a pair of running shoes before looking for an alternative and this bone was my first choice. HE LOVES IT!!!! he doesn't chew anything else anymore. It took his puppy stomach a few days to get use to it but now he happily lays at my feet and gnaws away. I would highly recommend this product and just remind people that dogs stomachs are way more sensitive than ours and might just take a few days to get use to it, but don't give up!

review/summary: We have one happy dog!
review/text: First off, this is a great price for this ginormous bone. I ordered a few other items at the same time, so they all came together in a big box. When I opened the box, the plastic over the bone was torn open on one side. So all the "meat" spilled out on the other items. (not a big deal. But it would have been nice if the bone was a little more padded, secluded or SOMEthing). Also, remember to open this bone over a bag or something because when I took the rest of the plastic off..it immediately fell apart in 3 big pieces and tons more crumbs to follow. For these reasons...it lost one star (in my heart).<br /><br />However, I expected my dog to tear it apart as it is and make a big mess. That was inevitable. But our dog loves it so much, he picks up all the tiny morsels himself. The fact this bone last a very long time and has brought our dog loads of happiness and less boredom makes all of us happy too. So that extra star gets to be back on!

review/summary: This is a WOW bone!
review/text: I ordered two of these bones for our Welsh Corgis.  These bones are HUGE.  Each bone is nearly as long as each Corgi!  The bones had meat on them and, although they came wrapped in a plastic wrap, somehow a bit of the grease from the meat soaked through the shipping box.  Nonetheless, it was not a big deal.  Well, our Corgis LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these bones even though they could not physically pick them up.  They do look like the leg bone of a cow.  After about two weeks of knawing on the bones, our Corgis have been able to break them apart at the ends.  After our Corgis had these bones for about 8 days, I baked them in the oven for half an hour at 350 degrees farenheit.  They were a little bit less "gross" because the meat cooked off.  The Corgis are still getting hours of enjoyment and often don't want to come in the house.  They love being in the backyard with their bones even though they are indoor dogs.  When these bones "run out" I will order more, however, it is going to be a very, very long time before I have to buy these again.  I wish I had found these bones before our Corgis started chewing up our furniture.

review/text: These bones are in the 15" range not the 18" so they are a little small across the ends and the shaft for my two 100# girls. I'll have to toss them as soon as they eat the ends so they won't choke on the narrow center shaft part. I call them soft because my dogs are running right through them like their rawhide or something. Don't get me wrong these would be great bones for a 50#er normal dog as in they smell good and still have lots of meat on them. It's just that my big girl can bite a tenis ball clean in half so this bone is little challenge for her or my smaller 98# girl. Just watch your dogs when they chew!

review/summary: The biggest dog bones I/ve ever seen.
review/text: I ordered 3 of these bones figuring the size was exaggerated. When I received them I was completely surprised, they were "HUGE".<br />They were shipped and I received them within a week. I think my dog was a little terrified at first, but once he got used to it, he dug in and is still chewing on the first one he's had for over a month.<br />I'm happy, my dog is really, really happy, and I will definately be re-ordering once he finishes the three I ordered.

review/summary: Tasty - but small and not lasting
review/text: The quality of this bone has left me disappointed. It is also smaller than advertised, only about 12 inches.<br /><br />This is the second bone of this type that I have purchased. I will exclude the brand name of the first because I cannot remember it. It's been that long since it was purchased. Granted, I bought that bone when the dog was still teething, it has lasted for close to 10 months now. At one point, I sawed it in half and gave a piece to my sister's dog because she loves it.<br /><br />My point is that the previous bone has withstood much more heavy chewing than the Smokehouse brand. It arrived not even 36 hours ago, my dog chewing on it for about 3 of those hours, and she has already worked off one of the ball joint ends (about 3-4 inches). She's a Pitbull mix and she is just shredding through this thing.<br /><br />I should add that it has not made her sick and she does enjoy it greatly. However, if you are under the impression that this bone will last for a while, you will be disappointed.
