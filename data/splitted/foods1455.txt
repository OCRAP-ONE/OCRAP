review/summary: Mmmm Best Burgers
review/text: These burgers are fantastic! Anyone who is stating they are dry and not tastey or tough and chewey is not cooking them right. Sounds like you are over cooking them or not following the cooking directions. I have made them a number of different ways, pan fried, bbq grill, george foreman grilled and broiled... everytime they come out awesome! Grill or stir fry some onions with them, add a little cheddar, monteray jack or spice it up with peper jack cheese, whatever kind you like, and you got an amazing burger! Top with a little Ketchup or russian dressing if you like condiments or for some added zing lightly brush a little italian dressing on the bun before toasting. So much better than those super market slop burgers! If your not sure how best to make them, read the little book that comes with it. 15 minute flash defrost trick works great for pan frying or broiling. I have grilled them frozen fresh from the freezer on both the bbq and the g foreman grill and they come out great.In fact... I think Ill make some for dinner... AGAIN!

review/summary: Decent food, but overpriced
review/text: We ordered The Amazing Celebration through Amazon, for $80, supposedly a deep discount.  The food arrived about when we expected it, and while the dry ice was gone, the food was all still frozen.  So far, we've had the sirloin steak, stuffed potatoes, pork chops, chocolate cake, and stuffed sole.  The sirloin and pork were decent, but no better than typical grocery store quality.  The meat at Costco is better and much cheaper.  The potatoes were good, and quite convenient.  The chocolate cake was pretty good, and with a short time in the microwave was like an expensive "molten chocolate" sort of cake from a restaurant.  The stuffed sole was disappointing.  It was OK, but no better than what I'd expect at a cheap restaurant.  In short, Omaha Steak food is less expensive than good restaurant food, but also less convenient and not nearly as good.  It's more convenient than getting everything from a grocery store, but much more expensive and not as good.  If convenience is your main goal, and you aren't too picky about price or quality, then Omaha Steaks is a good choice.

review/summary: Decent, but nothing special
review/text: I received 4 of these Omaha steaks burgers free with my recent order, which was my first time ordering from Omaha steaks. Everything was frozen solid upon arrival. Through my own error I guess, for some reason I thought these were actual steaks, in the form of a burger for some odd reason. Ridiculous, I know. Turns out, they're just standard burgers. Nothing special about them really and they look nothing like they do in the picture, size/plump wise. No surprise there. Anyway, I put 1 in the fridge for a few hours to let it thaw out before throwing it on my George Foreman grill. The burger, which was small to begin with, became even smaller when I was finished cooking it even though it held its shape of being a perfect circle. The tray that catches the fat/juices filled up a little bit as it cooked. I guess it's possible I "overcooked" it, but I cooked it the same way I would a Bubba burger, or any other burger for that matter. I like my burgers a little crispy but like I said, these were pretty small to begin with. I have 3 left, so next time, I'll cook one on low instead of medium to see if it makes any difference but I don't see how a burger that small to begin with won't shrink after its fully cooked, seems inevitable. I mean, they are 4 oz burgers. Anyway, the burger itself was decent and somewhat tasty, nothing special though. Threw a piece of American cheese on-top and ate it, without a bun. Tasted like a standard beef patty. I got 19 grams of protein out of it, so I was happy. My girlfriend laughed hysterically though when she saw me sit down in-front of a plate with nothing but this tiny little patty on it...lol I wouldn't go out of my way to order a box of JUST THESE off the Omaha site obviously as there's no point in doing that whatsoever, but I would have no problem eating them again just as long as they were included in a nicely priced packaged deal or sent free with a future order. I'll just make 2 at a time. In this case, I received 4 free, so it's hard to really complain all that much.

review/text: I have these in the freezer always for impromptu cookouts. When the grand kids come over unexpectedly, or when friends drop in and we have nothing fresh to offer, these always do the trick. Take the burgers out of the freezer and set them on the counter top for an hour while taking a quick drive to the market for avocados, tomatoes, purple onion, buns, and lettuce, and when you get home sprinkle a little seasoning on the burgers and put them on the grill on high heat for about 5 minutes then flip them over and put a good dose of shredded cheese on them, and close the grill for a few minutes until the cheese is nice and melted.<br /><br />Put them on a platter and bring out the sliced veggies and condiments and there ya go!! Easy Nice Meal!!<br /><br />The burgers are fine, not the gourmet best, but not bad either---I say go for it, and keep a dozen in the freezer for ad lib meals!!

review/summary: Not that great
review/text: I expected these burgers to be better from the reviews. In the package they look great - fresh frozen with great deep red color. One good thing is that the do retain their size/shape after cooking. But the reason is because they are very lean so the fat doesn't cook out. The huge downside to that is fat = flavor. These were very dry because of the lack of fat to keep them moist and juicy. Unforunately I bought 20 burgers so I have a lot to eat. I will not buy them again.

That sounds expensive until you realize this is glass and can get super shipping on it.  This also makes a good conversation piece if you don't live in the region it's sold.

review/summary: Regional soda
review/text: Cheerwine is a regional soda from North Carolina, that has expanded into 12 other southeast states in the last 8 years. Started in 1917, Cheerwine was first formulated in the basement of L. D. Peeler's wholesale grocery store. Created during prohibition when it was common to name sodas after liquors. The owner added a new cherry flavor syrup to his previous soda and cheerwine was born. Believe it or his great grandsons still run the company.<br />The bergundy red soft drink has a nice mellow cherry flavor, and the color is really a pretty burgundy color, almost like wine. It is more subtle and seems less sweet on the palate than the grocery store house brands of cherry soda. No aftertaste or bite. It is easy to see why the locals in North Carolina rave about this and the other drink from this company, "Cool Moon".  Also made in diet soda.

review/text: I never thought of Vietnam as a point of coffee growing. But on second thought, why not..it's very close to Indonesia and they have some wonderful brews. And the same is here!  This is  very smooth with a low acid taste. So it will roll across your tongue and not leave an after bite. There is even a hint of chocolate in the taste-very surprising! For me this is one of the more unusal island-type coffees I've ever tasted.A good find and nice to drink. A further note,if you go to the Trung Nguyen website, they sell a Vietnamese single cup coffee maker real cheap. It's sort of a cross between a french press and a melita single drip cone. If nothing else it's fun.

review/summary: Interesting coffee. It is worth trying.
review/text: Everyone has their own way of enjoying their cup of coffee, whether black or with cream and sugar. In addition, coffee comes in many grinds and blends. This coffee, is certainly worth a closer look. Trung Nyugen is an anytime of day coffee. It has a blend of four beans; Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa and Catimor.<br /><br />  When you first open the can, you will immediately notice its dark texture. The texture may remind you of baking flour. This coffee has a butter oil added in the roasting process, probably to slow down oxidation which can spell the demise of even the finest coffee. In addition, Trung Nyugen coffee is a coarse ground coffee. If you have a French press coffee maker, that's great. You are ready to make a cup. If you are not ready to make a commitment to purchase one at this time, be sure to add another paper filter in your coffee maker, to allow the water to soak up the flavors during brewing.<br /><br />  This coffee seems to me as an "anytime of day" coffee. But as one of the other reviewers stated, this blend tastes bitter without milk. I would agree with him. If you are an expresso or black coffee drinker and are satisfied with your coffee, it may not be worth your while to try this one. Trung Nyugen is a comfort coffee with a rich explosion of four different coffee beans, each one with its unique characteristic. I prefer to prepare it with condensed milk and a small amount of artificial sweetner. If I use half and half, the results taste much like Arabica coffee, which spoils the effect I am looking for. It seems to have a higher than average caffeine content and is slightly acidic but never bitter. It is probably the most intense tasting coffee you will have because of its unique blends. Finally, this coffee has a very small amount of cocoa flavoring. It is virtually undetectable when drinking.<br /><br />  I will buy this coffee again. I am annoyed that virtually every type of coffee that I see in the grocery store is an Arabica based bean coffee. My taste buds cry out for something that is blended, with an intense flavor that will make me look forward for more.<br /><br />  By the way, this is not the only Trung Nyugen coffee. They also make Creative One, Two...up to Creative Five. Each one has its own unique characteristic. I happen to have my own favorite of the five they have for sale. Creative One is a breakfast coffee, for those who want a very high caffeine content. Creative Two has a lower caffeine content and blends Arabica with Robusta beans. If you have time, surf the internet to find a distributor who can send you these coffees to your home or business if you want to explore more of these very unique blends.<br /><br />  As for myself, this one is a very pleasant alternative to store bought coffee. It encompasses much of what I am looking for in a coffee blend; intense flavor, higher than average caffeine content and a flavor that never tastes bitter, regardless as to how it's brewed.<br /><br />  Enjoy!

review/summary: Trung Nyguyen - Decent Vietnamese Coffee, But I Prefer Cafe DuMond.
review/text: I like a good cup of Vietnamese coffee.  I use either a coffee press or a Vietnamese filter depending on how much of a hurry I am in.  I have two boxes of Trung Nguyen coffee, which I don't really use.  The coffee is a little bit bitter for my taste.  While the bitterness of Vietnamese coffee is cut by the sweet silkiness of sweetened condensed milk, this coffee bean is still manages to bite.  Fixing the coffee with Cafe DuMond provides a rich experience without the bitterness.<br /><br />I can get Trung Nguyen at an International market near my house.  However, if you buy it online, expect to pay excessive shipping charges.  Before this store opened, I had to pay nearly as much for shipping as the actual coffee.  So a ten dollar box of coffee will set you back another ten for shipping.  Ridiculous.  Be aware of that if you decide to order online.<br /><br />The cost of Trung Nguyen is actually pretty good compared to most other specialty coffees (when you don't have the shipping component).  I can get it at my local market for $6.99.  The online prices normally range right around ten dollars.  Any good coffee brand is going to run around ten dollars per pound.  This brand is just shy of one pound, at fifteen ounces.  The seven dollars I pay locally is a steal.  It is just too bad that the bean bites more than I like.<br /><br />Trung Nguyen is excellent if you like to fix Vietnamese coffee.  I you enjoy a bean that has an extra bitterness, then this is just right for you.  It is a mixture of several beans, which is a by-product of the micro-climates that affect growing in Vietnam.  If you like something a little milder, use Cafe DuMond.  The chicory adds a pleasant chocolate quality without the harshness.  Three stars.

review/text: This beats the hell out of anything from Starbucks, the self-declared authority on "good coffee". What a joke.<br /><br />This is strong, flavorful, and not at all bitter.  The "Gourmet Blend" is the best...almost tastes like dark chocolate.  Coffee is now my favorite "snack".  A spoonful or two of condensed milk and some ice ("cafe sua dat") and you'll understand why coffee is as internationally popular as it is.

review/text: To carryit especially....Add sweetened condensed milk to your coffee cup. Then use Vietnamese coffee filter...Stir...Then Break/chip ice cubes and add to coffee (I use the backside of a spoon to break ice.) With a spoon, somewhat rapidly, sink and release ice chips into coffee until it foams. It's like drinking a malt or milkshake this way. Is very bitter without milk, but espresso fans may enjoy.

review/text: A Vietnamese friend introduced me to this & I have been hooked on it since. You need one of the individual metal coffee sieves that can be purchased at any Vietnamese grocery for $2-3. It takes 20-30 minutes for the coffee to completely drain after you add the boiling water. You then add sweetened condensed milk to taste. Most of the Vietnamese drink it with ice, but you can drink it hot if you like. It is like expresso with a very strong hint of chocolate, making it quite yummy.

It is strong but not bitter, and is almost like drinking liquefied chocolate when mixed with sweetened condensed milk. More complex flavor and not as bitter as competing brands like Vinacafe, which is also good for the price.

review/summary: Improper representation
review/text: While this coffee is an excellent coffee, it is not properly described. It is represented as "all-Arabica" and "light."<br /><br />Trung Nguyen Premium Blend is distinguished by being a blend of three different bean types and a small touch of cocoa, and "spices", as listed on the ingredients. It is Arabica, Robusta and Excelsa, otherwise known as Chari. It is not a light coffee, it is quite strong, like most Vietnamese coffees.<br /><br />This seller does not understand the product or list the proper ingredients, and I suggest that buyers look elsewhere for the proper representatives of the product on the Internet. Trung Nguyen products do have authorized Internet resellers that feature proper descriptions and pricing.<br /><br />It is not acceptable for a seller to misrepresent the major ingredients of a product to the buying public. Particularly on a product that also has non-coffee ingredients. Buyers who may have allergies should be aware of the ingredients.

review/summary: pretty nasty tasting stuff
review/text: coffee, is wifey and my favorite hobby we utilize most of the known ways of preparing it and we scour the net and shops for the perfect bean.  i recognize that most of our likes come from what we grew up tasting and drinking, so our coffee tastes are compared to folgers or butternut, however we have made an effort to expand our coffee palettes over the years.  that said i prepared the coffee using a Vietnamese coffee filter system and it was not drinkable, i tried using the chemex system which usually yields a mild result and still no good. french press, nope.  next step is a cold brew which often makes the worst and cheapest beans drinkable, if that doesnt work, i'll give the can to my brother in law, he will hate it but not admit it because he thinks he is a sophisticated drinker of exotic coffees i give him all my nasty beans. lol.<br /><br />i watched a program put on by illy on creating good beans (actually my favorite espresso bean is lavazza super crema) anyway they talked about a bean they called a 'stinker' thats a bean that if it finds its way into the blend will ruin the blend.  i have found beans like that they have a cheezy smell to them. it could be possible that my can of trung nguyen had many 'stinkers' oh well, do keep in mind that when it comes to taste, whether its food, recipes, or coffee and its infinite varieties of preparation, what makes me gag, may be another persons absolute favorite.<br /><br />try it for yourself, one can wont break you, if you dont like it you could use it to sepia stain your black and white photographs or i'll give you the address of my brother in law.

review/summary: Absolute garbage unless you use it to make vietnam style coffee only.
review/text: The vietnamese style coffee is kind of like cuban coffee, highly concentrated, roasted until it is like charcoal and served with sweetened condensed milk to cover up its foul taste. In addition to being absolutely terrible coffee for a coffee maker/traditional american cup of coffee the odor and taste of this coffee leads me to believe it is cut with CAROB which is a cheap filler. All in all I was highly disappointed with this terrible coffee and could not bring myself to finish the packages that I had, I would continually wind up throwing out the pot after a few cups and having to mix it with lots of milk to get a grey color out of it. (it's burned to hell just that bad.. I normally love STRONG coffee- but this is real garbage and it appears to have filler as well.).<br /><br />Avoid this junk, if you like dark strong coffee get Rainforest Hurricane Epresso instead or Dunkin Donuts original blend whole bean if you like a medium roast instead. This is terrible coffee made for a specific presentation, and that specific presentation is to cover up how horrible the coffee's quality and taste is. If you like the taste of burnt carob and a coffee that refuses to turn beige with milk.. this is your brand!!

It has a nice smokey flavour, and it had just the right degree of tartness, probably from the citric acid listed in the ingredients. It's also very smooth and consistent, no chunks of unmashed eggplant. It's almost as good as the baba ghanouj my mother used to make when we lived in Lebanon. A while ago I tried the AlWadi al Akhdar brand in a jar, and thought its flavor was a just a wee bit better, a bit more robust than this, Cortas, but Cortas consistency is better and smoother.

review/summary: Let's set the record straight
review/text: A previous reviewer rated this tea 1 star because of problems with tags sticking to the tea bags. This can happen on occasion - obviously something went wrong during the process of assembling that batch of tea bags, but that is no reason to condemn an excellent tea, or to throw it away, Heaven forbid!<br /><br />I have been enjoying this delightful blend for more than ten years, and have never encountered a problem with a tea bag tearing due to the tag sticking. However, that does occasionally happen with tea in general, and that is why there is a wonderful little invention called the tea strainer. I heartily recommend that anyone who loves tea invest in a tea strainer that sits over a cup or mug. It will pay for itself in salvaged cups of tea many times over.<br /><br />Now, for the tea itself, I completely agree with this other reviewer that this is a lovely, subtle blend. The tea is not at all bitter as other brands of raspberry tea sometimes are. My favorite way to use this tea is to add one bag of it to a small pot of my favorite black tea (1 bag in 4 is a good ratio). It adds a lovely hint of fruity sweetness. I highly recommend it. So, if the idea of a raspberry blended black tea appeals to you, by all means indulge in this delightful tea, and maybe add a tea strainer to your order if you don't already have one.

review/text: On the advice of a friend (whose taste in whiskey is now suspect) I purchased a bottle of Amrut Single Malt (peated).  I am generally partial to single malts with a strong peat flavor - I was a fan of Loch Dhu when it was still available. This whiskey, on the other hand, is overpriced about $80 in Washington D.C.) and over-rated. The peat flavor was overpowering - and it tasted less like peat than artificial smoke. The whiskey tasted far too young, very rough, no depth or real scotch character. I drank a few ounces over the course of this week, and finally could take no more. For the first time in my life I poured a whiskey down the sink. A waste of money, but really no use trying to drink the undrinkable.

review/text: I grew up in New York City, and fondly remember the jingle, "Conta-dina...tomato...sauce....New York's...best...selling...brand!"<br /><br />This is Contadina Tomato PASTE, of course, not the sauce -- but it's made by the same people, and, unlike the tomato sauce, I have actually tried the Contadina Tomato PASTE.<br /><br />Tomato paste is similar in all brands.  Look at the ingredient panel.  The ingredient (usually), is just "tomatoes".  The only exception are brands like "Muir Glen", (also sold on Amazon.com), which is Organic. (Sadly, "Del Monte"-a large corporation -- also sold organic tomato paste for a while, but no longer does.  Please sell it again, Del Monte -- and I, and I'm sure many others -- will buy it!)<br /><br />In the meantime, Contadina tomato paste is as good as any other.  In some ways, it is preferable to other brands. Why?  Well, one reason is the picture on the can.  Instead of just tomatoes, as other brands have, Contadina tomato paste features a pretty lady, and in the background, an Italian tomato grove.  It's buildings seem beautiful, and somewhat mysterious, as Italian buildings sometimes are.  If one is of a creative mind-set, looking at these buildings, (and the pretty lady), could, possibly, be the start of an interesting story to write...which might even become a best-seller and featured on Amazon!<br /><br />A more practical reason why (another type of) Contadina tomato sauce might be purchased is this:  Contadina ALSO makes, (in 6 ounce cans), an "Italian Style" tomato paste.  Though not the item featured here, it is certainly something to look for....hopefully, in the future on Amazon, and right now, in your local supermarket or warehouse store.  "Italian Style" Contadina tomato paste, in addition to mainly consisting of tomatoes, ALSO has a few spices and herbs.  These (to me), expertly chosen and blended herbs, add to the flavouring, and make for a tastier dish!<br /><br />As for the plain tomato paste being reviewed here, it's as good as any other brand -- plus you get that nice picture on the label.  It's not organic -- but it IS all-natural.  Just tomatoes.  The 12-ounce size means you don't have to open the can as often, you have plenty, (if you are preparing more than 2 servings at a time), and a 12-ounce can, because of it's size, will probably last longer on the shelf than a 6-ounce can, as smaller amounts of any food will spoil faster than larger amounts.<br /><br />Tomato PASTE -any brand -- is, I think, far more economical than tomato sauce.  Tomato sauce usually includes "water" as an ingredient, and most people can add that themselves!  Diluted, and with different ingredients added, tomato paste can become tomato soup, tomato juice...even tomato sauce!  If you don't want the bother of growing and/or canning your own tomatoes, just buying tomato PASTE at the store seems an economical, tasty, and very easy-to-prepare choice!<br /><br />"Contadina Tomato Sauce -- New York's Best-Selling Brand."  I haven't heard that jingle in quite a while...so it might not be true any more.  Still, this is inexpensive, and quite delicious tomato paste.  Not organic...but all natural.  With that "possibly imagination-engedering" picture on the can, it is, I think, quite a good choice!

I am so thankful for Bette Hagman's Gluten Free Gourmet books - the recipes are awesome, I don't find I miss much (except for "real" pizza crust and bagels - I just can't seem to find a good recipe for either!) Teff is higher in nutrients than rice, corn, or potato flours, and is very tasty. It is kind of like graham in flavor. I use Bob's brand of teff regularly in Bette's zucchini pineapple bread, gingerbread waffles, and sweet potato cranberry loaf recipes, and it is great! I really encourage celiacs and those with wheat/gluten sensitivities to do their own baking - I can't begin to tell you how much the taste is worth it compared to the gluten free convenience foods available. Yes, it takes time, and you will have to buy several kinds of flours, but it is SO worth it! WFGF convenience foods are SO expensive, the flours you buy to do your own baking will pay for themselves. Make recipes in large batches and freeze for comfort food  breads and muffins you never thought you'd have again.

review/text: Great teff flour for making a teff pancake that I eat with everything from stews, to eggs, to cheese, to ethiopian style vegetables.  I mix it with slightly more that half filtered water, and let ferment in a 1-1/2 quart covered glass casserole until real bubbly, with a touch of salt and a bit of oil.  The trick is in the fermenting.  I keep using the old batch as starter and it gets better and ferments faster after several time. (Once you get your starter, it will ferment faster.)  I also find the pancake is lighter if you start in the center and spiral the dough as you pour it into a hot pan.  If you need it a touch lighter add a pinch of backing soda. Its easy, has more protein and fiber than wheat flour.

review/summary: If you want Teff, you want this
review/text: Teff flour is used to make "injera", an Ethiopian, crepe-like bread. If you want Teff flour, then this brand is the best one around for the quality of the grain used and also for the fine ground texture especially since the texture plays a lot into the final injera product.<br />If you are not used to Teff or are experiencing some indigestion-like symptoms, your body is not used to it. You may try mixing all-purpose flour or pancake mix to dilute the Teff's effects. Slowly you may increase the Teff intake. LOVE it!

review/summary: Whole-Grain Teff Flour
review/text: I bought Bob's Red Mill Whole Grain Teff Flour from Amazon.com. I made injera (Ethiopian flat bread) with it. It was great. It is a healthy whole-grain flour with more fiber than white flour.

review/summary: Another great gluten free flour from Bob's Red Mill
review/text: I originally bought a bag of this flour for a dollar extra from the local health food store because I saw it listed as one of the four gluten free flours in a grape nuts recipe. It came out so good that I jumped right on amazon to see if it was here and voile, saved 4 dollars by getting the pack of 4. The teff flour adds a nice darker color to baked goods and it blends very well with other flours. I've used it with quinoa flour, brown rice flour, sorghum flour, and oat flour. This is a very tasty and versatile flour.

review/summary: Love this flour
review/text: This flour is amazing for its versatility.  My body and wheat don't get along, but I LOVE baking.  Before I found this flour, I would bake with wheat and deal with the side effects, but I've had a much easier time cutting wheat flours out since I found this.  I mix with almond meal for a nutty pie crust for desserts, add water and ferment to make injera for curries, and blend this in with other flours with other baking.  I'm still experimenting with teff, but I'm finding I like it a lot more than other starchy gluten-free options.  As a vegetarian, the high iron content of teff is an added plus.

review/text: I don't really care to have to drag my two children into multiple stores to look for specific items. I've seen numerous gluten-free recipes utilizing teff flour and really wanted to try some and see how its texture and flavor enhance my GF baking. I can't wait to make glutenfreegirl's fig cookies with this (I used buckwheat flour in its place the first time, and the buckwheat flavor overpowered the rest of the flavors in my mind)! Which reminds me...I should probably set the figs to soak in their special mix....

review/summary: Not what I had hoped for
review/text: If you're hoping for a quick and easy way to make the bread they have in Ethiopian restaurants, there isn't one that I've found so far. I've tried several different recipes, and none has worked.  I'm not patient enough to make this bread the real way, so I've tried a variety of pancake recipes.  The good news is that such pancakes are quite tasty, and if you're like me and can't eat gluten without some nasty side effects, then you'll appreciate having a quick and easy way to make pancakes that are very nutritious and quite unique-tasting.  The bad news is that making Ethiopian bread (Injera) is really difficult, time-consuming, and complicated.  I guess that means it's a good idea to tip your server generously at an Ethiopian restaurant?

review/summary: Golden Torpedos of Deliciousness!
review/text: How can you not love the Twinkie?  It's compact, delicious, and aerodynamic.  If you actually look at the ingredients, Twinkies are made of flour, water, shortening, eggs, sugar... sound familiar?  It's cake.  There are some preservatives added to increase shelf life, but they make up a very small percentage of the overall treat.  The air we breathe probably contains more dangerous 'additives' than a twinkie.  Let us face facts; if one were to eat slice after slice of chocolate cake baked using organic ingredients, that person is going to end up in coronary bypass land just as quickly as if one gorged on Twinkies.  Twinkies, like anything, in moderation are just fine.

review/summary: Have a couple anyway and forget the oncoming diet debacle...
review/text: Hostess Twinkies were all the rage back in the 1960s when I was a child growing up; and they still sell well today. They make for a delicious after school snack; and they are compact which makes them good for a sugar boost for adults on the run.<br /><br />Twinkies fit easily inside of lunch boxes, too. I would suggest, however, that anyone carrying these wrap them in something that will not allow Twinkie crumbs from the outer cake to spray all over the rest of whatever you are carrying.<br /><br />Twinkies are made of a golden cake filled with a creamy soft substance that is also delicious. Awesome!<br /><br />Of course, the fun just might stop there. These treats are loaded with sugar; and sugar turns to fat inside your body if you don't get enough exercise. Moreover, Twinkies have partially hydrogenated ingredients and this means that they DO have trans-fats even though the nutrition label says the opposite. Perhaps the trans-fat content is small; but you should know that trans-fats are VERY bad for you. I wouldn't eat these Twinkies every day.<br /><br />Overall, however, Twinkies make for a nice dessert treat, an occasional after school snack or a sugar boost for busy adults on the run. Be careful not to eat too many because of the fat and sugar content. Nevertheless, get a box and enjoy one or two tonight!

review/summary: Disaster for Diet, but Tasty on Your Tongue
review/text: Twinkies rank high on my list of pure junk foods.  The sugar and corn syrup in Twinkies help push the calorie count to around 150.  I do not care to think about what kind of fats and carbs go in to the 150 calories.<br /><br />On the other hand, I grew up with Twinkies.  I used to eat them as fast as I could get my hands on them.  Unfortunately, I am unable to do that any more.  You get older, you get smarter, I guess.  But I still like an occasional Twinkie.  Yes, they are sweet.  Yes, they have too many calories.  But, they taste good!  I wish they still offered banana creme Twinkies.<br /><br />More recently people have actually enhanced the calories in a Twinkie by deep frying them.  Cooking a Twinkie should be something you do only with great care.  There is a process to successfully making a deep fried Twinkie, and there are many processes that do not work.  To the best of my knowledge all of the processes yield even more calories, but even better flavor.  You get the general idea.  The better Twinkies taste, the more calories they have.  Go figure.<br /><br />Twinkies in their current form will never be mistaken for a health food.  But I will probably continue to indulge in one periodically for as long as I can.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Tasty, tasty science
review/text: Sponge cake with a creamy filling! These carefully scientifically designed treats stick to the original flavor as much as possible while increasing the shelf life considerably. The cream filling is actually shortening, because milk doesn't stay good on a warm shelf, the cake has all sorts of wonderful chemicals in it to keep it moist, fresh and light in texture. Corn syrup replaces sugar, soy lecithin is the most well known of the trace chemicals that help create that very smooth mouth feel- it's used in chocolate for the same reason.<br /><br />If there is ever an award offered to the scientists who find less expensive ways to chemically reproduce flavors, it should be a Golden Twinkie Award. You know they aren't healthy, but who can resist having one every so often? Even deep fat frying them when you're feeling completely decadent.<br /><br />Nothing tastes quite like a Twinkie. Best frozen and it's fun to dip frozen slices in chocolate and watch people try to figure out what they are eating.

review/text: Come on, this is 2005. Twinkies aren't "food" anymore than Cheez Whiz is. Twinkies were invented back in the 30s before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies. Consider that in those days doctors were used to advertise cigarettes in magazines. Everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while - I'm just as guilty of that - but eating Twinkies is practically self-mutilation. Look at the ingredients list and do some reading. Yikes! Everyone's family deserves tasty snacks that happen to be healthy too. Sorry Hostess, that definitely does not include Twinkies.

I will definitely buy some more.

review/summary: 30 oz of spice is a lot of spice.
review/text: This was a little saltier than the McCormick fajita spice I have used in the past.<br /><br />To be honest, I can't tell if it's the spice itself, or the fact that the jar is 30 frickin ounces, and I felt the need to use more of it.<br /><br />Wait until next time to be sure.

review/summary: Could be great...excess salt takes over taste!
review/text: This seasoning could have ben a 5* star rating but 590mg sodium per serving (4 servings per packet of 1.25oz ) is excessive, unnecessary & overtakes the good mix of flavors in the blend. You can always add some salt if needed but you can't take it out! I ground more spices & added to the mix (I bought this for convenience & still had to grind !) I used it to season a large pot of rice. Tasty! The ingredients are listed but the 'nutrition facts' are not. I also purchased their cans of chopped chile peppers & quality of taste is there without all the salt. Wish Casa Fiesta would reconsider their sodium levels for the Fajita, Taco & Guacamole packets.

review/summary: Best tasting, natural seasoning I've ever tried!
review/text: My son is on a restrictive diet so we tried this seasoning and fell in love with it. Not only is it free of all things artificial but it lacks the MSG usually present in commercial seasoning mixes. I recommend this product to everyone and they all switch to the Casa Fiesta brand as well.

review/summary: Hmm
review/text: Diet Coke is delicious, and I drink it pretty much all day. Cross your fingers I don't get kidney stones or something. My experience drinking Diet Coke has lead me to get plenty of caffeine in my system without getting fat from the sugar, which I happen to like.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />Buying 24 cans of Diet Coke at ~$40 shipped works out to $1.62 per can. This is well above the accepted price for Diet Coke, in fact... like 6x more. If this vendor could get their price down to something reasonable I'd be happy to order a bunch. If they expect me to pay 2x what it costs in an expensive vending machine, I'll just stick with that, thanks.

review/summary: Fridge packs rule!
review/text: I won't bore you to tears with a review of Diet Coke as a beverage.  Its good - 'nuff said.  I would like to comment on these "fridge packs" though.  In my opinion these are the greatest thing to come along since the aluminum soda can.  Here is what I like about them:<br /><br />1.  Fridge packs slide right onto any shelf in your refrigerator and they take up very little room.<br /><br />2.  This type of packaging not only provides an easy way to carry the sode home, but it allows you to store the soda "at the ready" without having to unload the box ahead of time.<br /><br />Try one of these packs, you'll like it!

review/summary: A "HELPFUL" IDEA - HAVE A CASE OF COKE AND A SMILE
review/text: These new fridge packs do make it easy to just slide the pack right into the fridge and voila, COLD DIET COKE FAST! For an adult household this is an ideal convenience and other reviewers have very amply described this new feature. However, the downside to this is simple, it encourages children to pick a soft drink over milk, juice, gatorade or water. Which is why, in part, the marketers came up with this "helpful" idea. I noticed when I bought 8 of these packs on sale, they were gone in just a couple of days instead of a couple of weeks and all I could think was, "AT LEAST THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF SUGAR IN IT". Having said that, there is much to recommend Diet Coke and I have consumed it since it was introduced in 1982.<br /><br />The best thing about Diet Coke is basically the best thing about Diet Pepsi, you can find it anywhere and everywhere and it is always basically the same product. To a consumer that means one may safely buy and consume this hermetically sealed product with the reasonable expectation of not getting sick from the local water. This is the advantage of the can over the fountain. Canned "Diet Coke" also will not go flat as fast as a two liter or even a twenty-ounce bottle. Now, all the hermetically sealed products [cans and bottles] have expiration dates on each sealed container, further insuring the safety and freshness of this universal product.<br /><br />As far as contents go, the exact ingredients are on the can. However, unlike Pepsi's informative website where I found the milligram amounts for all ingredients per 8-ounce serving, Coke's website [www.cocacola.com] dealt more with the history and lore of Coke products. Where Pepsi's site clearly stated exactly what was in the can, I can only assume from the list of ingredients on the can of Diet Coke, which is an almost exact match of Diet Pepsi's, that one will find roughly the same amounts of caffeine and sodium in Diet Coke as Diet Pepsi. At Pepsi's website we quickly see, that there are 30 mg. of sodium and 24 mg. of caffeine per 8-oz. serving. A 12-ounce can = 1.5 servings or 45 mg. of sodium and 36 mg. of caffeine. The exact amounts of these ingredients are important if you have family members or guests with high blood pressure [sodium] or young children prone to hyperactivity [caffeine]. It is important to remember that fountain drinks are reconstituted where they are sold and no bottler [Coke or Pepsi] guarantees the exact amounts of caffeine or salt or anything for that matter in the drink, or the purity of the water used in reconstituting the fountain product -- a great argument for cans and bottles!<br /><br />As far as which brand is best, some think Diet Pepsi goes flat quicker than Diet Coke. Maybe, however, the smallness of a 12-ounce container would negate any difference if it exists since it is quickly consumed. As for myself, I rarely drink carbonated beverages, but when I am on the road with the kids and we all need to rehydrate, I know that canned Diet Coke [or Diet Pepsi] is safe and effective and most of all available wherever we might be.<br /><br />[PS- I am not affiliated with Coca-Cola, Pepsi or any other product]

review/summary: An American Classic - The Diet Version
review/text: There are two soft drink giants in North America, and I assume they are the two biggest world-wide, the Coca Cola Company and the Pepsi-Cola Company.  The battle between these two giants has many fields, including fountain drinks, schools, and grocery stores.  At various times the two players have held varying percentages of the market, with Coke currently being ascendant.<br /><br />We drank Coke in our house from the time I can remember.  There were numerous brands of soft drinks and colas to which I have been exposed, but I have always returned to the original, Coca Cola.<br /><br />Coca Cola is more than a soft drink; it is frequently synonymous with America and freedom in many parts of the world.  In fact, you can say that Coca Cola has become an American icon, though it is available world wide.  Coca Cola memorabilia has become popular as collectibles, with various items dating back to the first half of the last century going for incredible sums of money.<br /><br />At the core of the company name, the memorabilia and the attributes associated with the name is the product itself, the one and only Coca Cola.  The product itself started life as a tonic in 1886, growing steadily in popularity and distribution so that it is probably the American brand with the greatest world-wide recognition.<br /><br />The original Coke contained sugar and remains a yummy soft drink.  However, for those of us who like the flavor of Coke but do not need the calories, Diet Coke is my preferred alternative.  I remember when I first started drinking Diet Coke that I had a little bit of difficulty becoming accustomed to the flavor, but now that I have become accustomed to the flavor of Diet Coke I find the flavor of classic Coke to be a little strange.  I drink far more Diet Coke than classic Coke.<br /><br />I think I prefer Diet Coke over Diet Pepsi because Diet Coke has a slightly stronger emphasis on carbonation.  The mild burn as the cold carbonation goes down your throat is somehow enervating and refreshing, and reminds me of good times and good things.  All my associations with Diet Coke are positive.<br /><br />The 12 can Fridge Pack is a one of the numerous ways in which Diet Coke can be purchased.  The biggest advantage to the Fridge Pack is that it is specifically intended to sit on a refrigerator shelf and be a dispensing unit for cans of Diet Coke.  The only problem with the Fridge Pack is that you must remove one can of Diet Coke when you open the box, so you either have to sit the single can on the shelf or you have to drink it, if you plan on using the box as a dispenser.<br /><br />I still prefer 12 ounce cans over the various other size configurations because I can usually drink an entire can, thus preserving the carbonation and fresh flavor of the drink.  The two liter bottles are fine if you are having a party or drink a lot of Diet Coke, but it seems to me that as the bottle gets near the bottom the Diet Coke seems less fresh if the bottle has been around more than a day or two; the same with the 20 ounce bottles, which I am unable to drink in one sitting.<br /><br />Diet Coke is a personal favorite, even over the original Classic Coke.  I occasionally will drink another brand for variety or other reasons, but I always come back to the original.  As Coke once advertised, "Have a Coke and a smile!"

review/summary: I'd like to buy the world a Coke, and keep it company...
review/text: Coca Cola has always been popular; and there's no secret why. Both Coca Cola and Diet Coke are very refreshing soft drinks with good carbonation that quench your thirst no matter what! Now the classic Diet Coke beverage comes in "fridge packs;" these thin cardboard containers have a dozen 12 ounce cans of diet coke in them. The cardboard pack even has a handy built in handle for you to carry them almost effortlessly!<br /><br />The idea of drinking diet coke in cans means that the soda doesn't loose its carbonation as it would if you bought a large bottle of soda. Each can remains completely fresh to the moment you open it to drink it. As for the "fridge pack;" you can load the cardboard pack into the fridge and just reach into it when you want a can of diet coke; and people like this. You can also remove the cans from the pack, of course, and then place the individual cans themselves into your refrigerator.<br /><br />The idea of diet coke is very important in today's world where people are becoming more and more health conscious every day. If you can, drink Coca Cola in diet form unless for some reason you believe you need the sugar. As always, if sugar is a health issue for you than please discuss this with your doctor before choosing which type of coke, regular or diet, to drink.<br /><br />The nutrition facts label can easily be found on the outside of the thin cardboard container that they call the actual "fridge pack." The manufacturer clearly states that this is a very low sodium drink and that's good. Unfortunately, this beverage does contain phenylalanine so ask your doctor before drinking this soda if phenylalanine is a health concern for you. Diet Coke also uses aspartame to sweeten the beverage.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderfully refreshing soft drink that many people enjoy for many good reasons. It is particularly refreshing with a hot meal or on a hot summer's day when you've been working outside. The "fridge pack" makes it easier than ever before to store the individual cans of diet coke in your refrigerator.<br /><br />Thank you, Diet Coke!!!

review/summary: Coffee snob
review/text: I admit it, I am a coffee snob and Ruta Maya  makes one of the best roasts I've ever had.  I've enjoyed their coffee on visits to their original Austin, Tx.shop for over 15 years.  Now I get my hook ups from Costco.com and in store.<br /><br />I am sad to see the price on Amazon to be such a rip off, I love buying from Amazon and most often their sellers.  Do yourself a favor, get some coffee, try the dark or medium roasts or their new Cubita but shop around for it.  There are better values where a seller can make some money but not rake ppl over on the transaction.<br /><br />Indigo

review/summary: Ruta Maya wonderful coffee, but don't get fleeced
review/text: We love coffee at our house and by way of our son's trips to Austin, we discovered Ruta Maya.  This is amongst the best, full-flavored, smoothest tasting coffee we have ever had.  We strongly recommend it.  But don't get fleeced by paying as much as Amazon charges.  It is $8.95 per pound at the Ruta Maya website [...] plus shippling and handling.  We recently ordered six bags plus a 12 oz. bag to try their dark roast Cubita coffee and S&H was $11.95.  I am amazed at the Amazon price as we are regular Amazon customers and frequently find its prices lower than most other sources of items.
