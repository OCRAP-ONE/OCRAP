review/summary: Not your typical food, Baby loves it
review/text: I was hesitant to start mixing flavors so soon, but ran out of regular food while on family vacation recently. My husband grabbed this for our baby (7 months old) and I thought, oh great - this is going to suck. Well, it didn't - the baby gobbled this up the first time and every time we feed him this flavor. Even though I try to do all organic, this is one I happily make an exception for because he loves it so much. I appreciate that Gerber really is making the effort to provide healthy, good quality, affordable options for baby's developing palates.

review/text: As it started, I'm not sure why I originally picked this brand over any other at the store - must have been the cute old fashioned looking container.<br /><br />What is inside the can is the important part though and that happens to be a consistently good baking powder; I use this often in baking, especially with my pancakes which would be more like frizbees at my high altitude without a little help from Clabber Girl.<br /><br />I've had the same can for a year or so and it still is active and provides consistent results for my baked goods.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and happy to recommend.

review/summary: Not for Me
review/text: Our neighborhood always have a pot luck picnic each year on Labor Day.  Everyone always look forward to my cakes and I always look forward to baking them for all to enjoy.  This year I could not find the brand I've always been using for years and years so I purchased Clabber Girl thinking that, after reading the ingredients, it would produce the same great results.  No indeed!  My cake layers were awful.  The texture was not the same; the layers were heavy--not light--as usual.  I felt like crying, and I know everyone wondered what in the world had happened to my cakes this year.  I didn't say anything to anyone about my purchase.  I tried it in my always successful cornbread.  Result:  after seeing how my piece of cornbread looked, nobody touched it, except the birds.

review/summary: Not Great, But Much Better Than The Free Coffee at Work
review/text: The Starbucks Via has an acceptable flavor, but they all leave an unpleasant grit on the tongue and lack the aroma of a brewed coffee.  If you are a coffee aficionado, Via is not a great experience.  Even so, it is much better than the free Ronoco coffee we have where I work and is nice to have for travel.  I consider Via strictly a backup.

review/text: This coffee tastes great.  Sometimes a cup of coffee in my office is so bad I just won't drink it.  I don't drink coffee often, so I keep a stash of the Via's around for when I actually do have a cup.  I like to enjoy my coffee when I drink it.<br /><br />The via packets are small.  You can put them in your pocket, purse, or even a wallet depending on the size of your wallet.  All you need is hot water and you will have a good cup of coffee.  They are great for camping too.<br /><br />My wife and I stopped using our french press to make coffee now that we have the 30 pack of Via's in the house.

review/summary: When grading on a curve, Via holds up.
review/text: I've tried both the Italian and Colombian Via varities, and while there's definitely a 'Starbuckiness' to both, neither is a substitute for the real thing. However there are times when the real thing just doesn't work, and at those times Via gets just enough things right to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I'll start out with the negatives. Both varieties remind of drinking from a pot of 'yesterdays' coffee. The kind where you can't finish the pot of coffee and rather than toss it all out, you let it sit and cool overnight and then reheat it the next morning. The next day the coffee is always more bitter and the flavor is flat as compared to a fresh brewed cup. Adding milk or cream helps, but the underlying flavor is still a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Though the worst part about the Via brand is the after-taste. There's something off about it. I don't know quite how to describe it. Almost like a tinge of paper/cardboard taste to it which is a bummer. I find I drink a cup of Via faster than a normal cup of coffee in order to combat that after-taste.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think I'm still likely to continue buying the Via brand. I understand this is instant coffee. I mean I'm tearing open a little pouch (love the design), dropping in some hot water, and I've got coffee. Just like that. That's pretty great. That ease of use, and fairly reasonable pricing means that in circumstances in which convenience trumps quality I can find a place for Via. Camping, too lazy to drive to a coffee shop, otherwise stuck drinking Folgers, quick pick-me-up during a zombie invasion, etc... are a few examples of when a packet of Via could come in handy.

review/summary: Only regret - expiration date
review/text: I don't use VIA packets frequently, but I like to keep them on hand. When I purchased the 12-pack decaf VIA packets in the Starbucks store, the best before date was at least a few months away. The 6-pack of 3-count packets which I received from Amazon has a best before date which is about 5 weeks away. I doubt I can use 18 packets in 5 weeks, but I also saved a good amount versus what I would have paid in the store. It's really a matter of individual usage. Perhaps many people use one packet every couple of days, but I usually don't need it that frequently.

review/text: For being an instant coffee, Via is very good, but don't expect it to have the aroma or flavor of fresh brewed Italian Roast.  Very convenient, and no clean up.  Tried the Via French Roast because there were a few reviews about how it's the best.  Still prefer the Via Italian Roast... the Via French Roast is not any darker as you'd expect in the real coffee world, plus it has a tiny hint of a strange aroma/flavor.

review/summary: Fair Substitute for no local Starbucks
review/text: Overall I've been very pleased with Starbucks' VIA products.  I've only tried the Italian and Columbia varieties.  The convenience is a major factor, and it beats the pants off anything "instant" I've ever had before.  Great for backpacking.  The ability to do a 50-count bulk purchase is the way to go, though, as buying 3-packs locally is steep--but perhaps not so much when one considers the price of a cup of the real thing.  My only beef is that my most recent purchase had a "best by" date just 2.5 months away (a complaint I've seen others make).  I spoke with a Starbucks rep who claimed it was still going to be fine for some unspecified time beyond that date, that they'd take my return if desired, but that they couldn't promise that the date on whatever replacement shipped from the warehouse would be any further distant.  Kind of lame...but I'm going through it quickly enough that the question is probably moot.

review/text: We are northwest coffee snobs.  My husband makes our coffee each morning with our espresso machine.  It makes us happy.  But we have done alot of travel in the last six months.  We had a system of grinding our beans and doing a cup at a time with our coffee that we brought with us.  We ran out in the middle of not coffee country.  We did find a Starbucks and got some Via to tide us over.  It isn't the Americano my husband does for us at home, but it has become a good substitute when we are traveling.  Still love our own beans...but this is good.  Certainly not like any other instant I have tasted...much, much, much better.

review/text: I am a devotee of freshly made espresso coffee every morning which I make at home with a vacuum espresso pot.

Similar to a double shot Cafe Americano at an espresso bar.<br /><br />I am absolutely NOT a fan of Starbuck's overpriced and over roasted coffee. I also despise coffeemaker Folgers coffee, if I can avoid it! And other instant coffee tastes bitter and watery to me.<br /><br />However, these little packets are quick, pack anywhere--like a purse, glovebox or suitcase--and make a fascinatingly GOOD cup of coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, on the strong side but no "Burnt" taste, and close to freshly brewed coffee as -- sheesh, it tastes like a fresh brewed cup. I am impressed. I add water and my half and half and it's better than good. I love Columbian coffee and this is the flavor I hoped for.<br /><br />Starbucks has done this right!<br /><br />The Downside: The cost is really an issue. I paid $5+ at Starbucks for a 3 pack. Then I got a 3 pack at Walmart recently for $2.99. This offer gets you more for about 80 cents each, but for instant? So I give the VIA coffee a 4 star rating even at the cheaper price.<br /><br />The quality is there though, so I plan to get some for my business trips out of town (no more running out for an expensive espresso) or as a backup in my purse. But I still use my espresso maker for my everyday cup.

review/summary: Better than other instant coffees...
review/text: I bought this when I saw that the price for 50 was much better than the price of the 8-pack or whatever in the SB store. I decided to give it a try. VIA coffee has a full flavor compared to other instant coffees, but it still isn't as good as a fresh cuppajoe. I love the convenience of these packages, since in my job, I don't always have time to go and find a cup of coffee. I can pour bottled water into my mug, pop it in the nuker, and then just pour the package into the steaming water. It also seems to be stronger than typical coffee, as far as the caffeine. All in all, I feel like I made a good choice. If I were you, and you were me, we'd be each other, and you'd know how I feel about the VIA coffee. I should mention here that I am NOT a huge fan of Starbucks coffee in general, but I was impressed with VIA. ONE COMPLAINT... the package. When you open the package, the opening is so narrow, that when you try to pour it into your steaming water, the steam makes the coffee powder get all sticky and clogs the opening. Other than that, I'm pretty happy with VIA. (But I'd rather have a nice fresh cup of french-press... or Dutch-press =))

review/summary: Watch out for expiration date and packaging
review/text: Although this is one of the best instant coffees in the world, I second another review here. Although getting a bulk pack of 50 of this at less than $1/pack (cheaper than buying it a Strbux) the expiration is 6 months. So, unless you consume one of these at least 2-3 times per week - which I don't per se - watch out. Also, I shaved off a star bc of the poor packaging design of the individual packets. When you tear off the corner (the way they indicate where and how to open it)  the opening is still very small and a fair amount of powder is still left in the packet unless you shake it vigorously and make sure it all comes out, or simply chop off the top with a scissor.

review/summary: The perfect compromise: Drinkable instant coffee
review/text: Better than all other instants, as good as many brewed coffees, Starbucks VIA is a great balance between fast, easy and good.  Heat your water, tap the powder out of the tube into a cup, pour and stir.  No grinding, no filters, no mudding the beans; it's just as fast, and just as easy, and spooning crystals out of a jar.  But Starbucks VIA is far, far superior to any other kind of instant, and gives a lot of second rate brews a run for their money.  Is it as good as my best beans, freshly ground and brewed?  No.  But it's better than the coffee that comes out of Keurig packs, and better than the coffee from fast-food restaurants.  And it's instant.  Sometimes you'll want to take the time and trouble for the best possible cup of coffee; and sometimes you'll just want a dang cup of something hot, strong and black.  For those times VIA is a great choice.

review/summary: Nice Idea, good flavor, a little bitter
review/text: This product gets a 4 star vs 5 star due to one little factor, bitterness. For the most part making a cup of coffee without a coffee maker couldn't be more easy or delicious, though I find that these Via Ready Brews (all flavors I've tried so far) have often a hint of a bitter after taste. Its not so bad that its undesirable, however, I'm sure that goes with having the ground micro-ground to produce your coffee as opposed to filtering through larger grounds to make coffee. I will say as for 'instant' coffee - this is one of the best I've had. Each flavor has a distinct aroma and taste. Doesn't quite replace a freshly brewed cup of coffee though.

review/text: This coffee is surprisingly good. It's a little pricey in comparison to regular drip coffee, but I am willing to pay that price for not having to clean the coffee pot, grind beans, wait for it to brew, etc when I am in a hurry to get to work in the mornings. One packet makes a large cup of coffee. I use about 14 oz of water and that still has plenty of flavor. In fact, I am drinking a cup of it right now. ;-)

review/text: I travel a lot, often to places where nescafe (ugh) is high end. So my comfort was Via but the packaging is so irresponsible. So I experimented. I have now taken several multi-week trips with a plastic bag of  Bustelo Instant Espresso  measured out from a jar. I used it with just boiling water - or hot milk and water - its as good if not better than Via despite my snobby skepticism about preservation of taste. And I feel I am not adding as much  to a scary pile of non biodegradable waste. Starbucks says they care about environmental stuff but I'm not a crunchy and I can see how marketing has over-run ethic.

In no way is this product comparable to a Starbuck brewed coffee either at home or at an outlet.  I cannot recommend it.<br /><br />FYI:  purchased 12/26/11, expires 04/2012.

review/text: Ordered a 50 pack to be delivered directly from Starbucks.  Two weeks later, received an email from Amazon stating that seller (Starbucks) failed to deliver the product by the date they said they would when purchased, so I should contact them directly for status.  When I did, the Starbucks rep told me they had processing issues on the date I placed my order (for a number of people) and had cancelled it.  When I asked why they failed to even tell me this prior to me reaching out to them, they had no answer.  To compound matters, they then refused to send me a replacement order for the same price I previously paid.  Seriously???  I usually don't write negative reviews, but this experience goes well over the line for me.  Obviously, Starbucks has gotten so big that they could care less about making their customers whole after THEY mess up. Shame on you Starbucks....and I guess shame on me for liking your freakin coffee so much.

With some cream, I almost think I am having one of those expensive lattes from a coffee stand.

I like my coffee strong, rich, smart, flavorful, and easy.... just like my lovers.  You see, I used to be a total coffee snob: roasting and grinding, steeping and pressing,etc. but why make the mess when I can just open a Via and enjoy.  I especially love that I can get two great cups of coffee out of each pack.  I put half of a pack in a cup and then add instant decaf to round it out.  The Via is strong enough,and flavorful enough, to pick up the slack of the decaf.  AND at that rate, a nickle-pincher like me can get a great cup of coffee for about 35 cents, plus half & half.  I run a small Midwest corporation, and do some traveling, so I keep 4 or 5 packs of Via, (and a bottle of Bailey's) in my carry-on.  Try it.  It'll change your life! After your first sip, the sky will open up and you'll find God!  --- (Relax! ..I'm just kidding there.)

review/summary: More for  me!
review/text: For those of you who are freaked out about a little expiration date on the coffee... are you SERIOUS?  Do you know that there is a coffee out there called Kopi luwak ? (seriously, Google it!) yeah, it is pooped out of a civet cat and sold for 600 bucks a pound.  So, really...  this is not MILK for crying out loud.  You all can stop buying it then, and that will be just more for me!  NOW, on to my review.<br /><br />This is the BEST coffee ever.  And you can not beat the price.  If you poured a cup of fresh brewed into one cup, and then made this instant coffee and put it in another cup, I DEFY you to tell the difference... in fact, I would lay odds that you would point to the instant and call it fresh ground/fresh brewed!

review/summary: Use HOT water, stir, let sit, stir again
review/text: I like it so much, I pretty often wait until I'm home to make a cup instead of stopping for coffee at a restaurant or coffee house.<br /><br />I've read some complaints about bitter "sludge" in the bottom of the cup. Try using really hot water - almost boiling - stir it, let it sit 10-15 seconds, and then stir it again. That seems to dissolve it completely.

This is my second or third time ordering it and I'll continue to do so. Mind you, it doesn't taste like wonderful, brewed coffee. But it the first truly drinkable instant I've encountered.

Sure there are some lightweight presses, but this coffee is good and there's no need to carry the extra bulk! I use it at home at times too. I use a small pair of scissors to open the pack rather than the tear open. I find that simpler; have the small scissors in the package of coffee.

review/summary: Expiration Date too close.
review/text: I bought a couple of packs of the decaf and the expiration date was further out to March 2013.  When Starbucks has them (all flavors) on sale for around $25 shipped, I bought a pack of the Italian Roast.  I was disappointed that this package received will expired November 27, 2012.  I was hope to have a further date because I don't drink them everyday.  Emailed Starbucks and they said products still good 75 days past expiration date and if I don't want it, return for full refund.  Amazon do not have a return policy on food items and Starbucks didn't offer to refund my shipping this item back to them.  I just have to take their words for it and keep the package.  Sending it back at my expense isn't worth the hassle.<br /><br />I think I shouldn't worry about expiration dates so close but if Starbucks drop the prices, you know they're getting rid of expire soon coffees.  I probably buy at local Costco next time.

You advertise it as being a 'green' product, but this package had to have used up at least one tree and some mighty tough plastic.

review/summary: Expiration dates - Seriously, ignore them.
review/text: A lot of people have been posting about the near-expired dates on the coffee. First, I'd like to mention that this product is intentionally labeled to have a really short shelf-life, and not to ensure freshness.<br /><br />The funny thing about expiration dates is that for something like this, it honestly doesn't matter. I've gotten batches that are expired (for cheaper) and the taste is the same great amazing taste as it was when it was well within the "Best Until" range. Yes, I have taken two packs, one expired and one not expired, and they both are the same delicious taste.<br /><br />The reality is that expiration dates are a wonderful tool that make people throw perfectly fine food and go out and buy more. Especially with dairy products: If it's a few days over, most people will toss out cartons of perfectly good milk or eggs that could keep for another five weeks, which keeps people buying it more frequently. The fact is, if you would drink it without knowing the expiration date is past (it doesn't smell or look bad) then it's not only safe to eat, but a waste to toss.<br /><br />This isn't true for drugs, however. If your medicine says it's expired, it's expired. Also, condoms. Those do lose integrity over time.<br /><br />So, this is a product that intentionally has a very short shelf-life because it makes ridiculous people go, "Oh, no, instead of getting it cheaper online and in bulk, I'll just buy a lot of more expensive smaller packs for more money." Starbucks enjoys charging their consumers for their instant coffee like it's magical pixie dust, and the only way they can stop people from buying it from other cheaper sources is to give it a tiny shelf-life. Look at some of the other reviews, here. It's working!

The best part is that you don't need hot water... you can add cold water and ice for an awesome iced coffee.  Am going to try the decaf bc I'm obviously drinking a lot more coffee now that I've discovered this.

review/text: I love coffee and I'm a big fan of Starbucks regular brewed coffee which I buy a lot of in the stores. I don't drink much instant coffee but I've tried several other brands in the past and didn't think this Starbucks instant coffee could be much better. I was wrong. Starbucks Via instant coffee tastes as close as you can get to regular brewed coffee. I was shocked at how good it is. It's rich, bold, and flavorful. The only downside is the price - it's significantly more than other brands of instant coffees. I still drink mostly fresh brewed coffee but when I can't and need instant I drink Starbucks Via

It dissolves quickly into a very strong brew.<br /><br />Highly recommended for people who occasionally need just a few cups of coffee.

review/summary: Better than an actual cup of Starbucks
review/text: In my opinion, this actually tastes better than an actual cup of Starbucks coffee.  A real cup of Starbucks will taste burnt but Via does not.  Also, and perhaps most important to me, I can get the temperature of the water to the exact temperature I like before mixing in the Via.  No need to wait for it to cool down.<br /><br />The Amazon price (60 cents/packet when I bought) really makes it worth buying for the convenience alone.  Some people have suggested that this bargain-priced Via is somehow inferior to the one you buy in a Starbucks, e.g. expiration date is sooner, but it looks, smells, and tastes the same as the store-bought.  The expiration date was 10 months ahead, if that's a concern.

In the summer, I also like making iced coffee with this, no need to buy the special iced coffee mix.  I just barely heat the water, mix and add a little cream and some ice cubes.  Works well since I don't use sugar, so can't use the special iced coffee mix.  Recommended.
