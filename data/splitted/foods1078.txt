review/summary: Gluten free cakes for less!
review/text: Tired of paying $20-$50 for a simple gluten free cake? You can make one at home for just a little more than a traditional cake mix. Simple to make just like any Betty Crocker cake. Use Betty Crocker icing--it's gluten free too!. There is no funny taste from those different flours used by other gluten free cake mix makers. You know what I mean.It tastes like a "regular" cake. My only caution is that it is a little denser than regular cakes and like all gluten free baked goods it doesn't last as long as regular cakes do and tends to dry out after a day or so. But I make cupcakes and freeze some for later-they stay fine in the freezer.But if you're planning to eat it within 48 hours its fine. I have bought commercially made cakes that were not as moist and dried out much faster. All in all, this cake mix is the best I've had.

review/text: This cake was actually good!!! It's more dense than normal yellow cake- but I also substituted yogurt for the butter and added a little oil. Less fat! It would be super yummy as cupcakes with some raspberries or other fruit mixed in the batter... or as a coffee cake. Yay Betty for giving us something fast and easy and also Gluten free!!!

review/summary: Better than regular cake~MMMMMMM GOOD!
review/text: I don't have to be gluten free but I had tried it in the past and felt some better so decided to go that route again. A friend told me about this cake mix and I made it tonight but with no frosting, just to eat like a muffin with a summer meal and fruit. Oh my goodness it is so moist and yummy. With the special and the subscribe and save it is way cheaper to get her than in the local grocery like I did today.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this to anyone who wants wonderful gluten free cake/muffins.

review/summary: cake ok
review/text: For a gluten free cake this is ok. I was planning to try making it with oil but have not done so yet. in gluten free butter unless it's in cookies doesn't stay moist. i still prefer kinni kinnick cake mixes. The problem i had was besides just being ok this only makes 1  8x8 which is disapointing. i felt it didn't hold up by the end of the day it was soggy. i would still use it but not my first choice.

review/text: I ordered this sausage because I had it at a christening party. This did not taste like the one at the party that we went crazy over; it was far better!  It has a slight taste of orange that really makes this so unique.  Don't think this is in a class with the sausage you're used to eating! This is in a class of it's own!  Order two packages, I guarantee you'll be sorry if you don't!  Fast delivery, we are very pleased with the whole transaction!<br /><br />Van

review/text: First I want to comment on their extremely fast delivery.  I placed my order and the next day I received it.  The meats I buy are all delicious.  When my son was in town I made a very simple dish with sliced Greek sauage, green peppers and onions.  My son was not planning on eating at home that day for he had plans to go out but once the aroma of the cooking sausage filled the air, he not only had one serving but he came back for seconds.  I highly reccomend this vendor.  They also have a great selection from other countries.

review/text: I ordered these sausages as an experiment, to accompany the Mizithra cheese I was buying.  They were very good, just different from what I am used to.  And I am a sausage fanatic (Knockwurst, Knapwurst, Mettwurst, Andouille, Bratwurst, Chorizo,etc.).  If I were doing another Greek meal, I would order them again.

review/summary: Happy Dogs - Happy Owner
review/text: Sadly, in 2009 I was feeding my dogs Beneful from Walmart. Two of our min pin dogs lost their hair and one died from having (0) blood pressure, which never knew was even possible as we rushed him to the emergency dog hospital. One of the 2 others now has been diagnosed with cancer and is only about 4 years old. At the time, I gave the dog food away then started cooking for them myself for a while which is a real pain.<br /><br />I then started doing research from the site dogfoodadvisor.com and found Orijen's 6 fish from Canada rated 5 stars and went with that for about 1 year and one of our dogs, a 3 year old started growing her hair back. We liked the Orijen's and the health benefits but my dog's didn't. They would sniff it and walk away. The other down side was that in the town in which I live has to ship often resulting in 10 days or so to get it.<br /><br />So I started looking around at PetCo one day because I ran out, looking carefully at the ingredients of various foods and found myself head wagging at corporate marketing compared to ingredients of most dog foods. Anyways, I found this ugly brown bag with the typo - Organix. I continued looking carefully at others still comparing then came back to the ugly brown bag of Kibble called Organix, picked it up and bought the 15lb bag.<br /><br />First thing I did was went to the dogfoodadvisor site to check reviews and it wasn't listed and then became worried. I could only count on the Orgainix's labeling of being honest and accurate - right.<br /><br />What were the ingredients?<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic chicken, chicken meal, organic brown rice, organic peas, organic millet, organic oats, chicken fat (naturally preserved with mixed tocopherols and citric acid), salmon meal, natural chicken flavor, organic quinoa, dried egg product, organic flaxseed, minerals (zinc proteinate, iron proteinate, copper proteinate, manganese proteinate, calcium iodate, sodium selenite), organic carrots, organic apples, organic broccoli, organic pumpkin, organic pears, salt, choline chloride, potassium chloride, vitamins (vitamin E supplement, l-ascorbyl-2 polyphosphate, vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, niacin, riboflavin, vitamin B12 supplement, biotin, thiamine mononitrate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, folic acid, vitamin D3 supplement), chondroitin sulfate, yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), dried Enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried Aspergillus niger fermentation extract, dried Trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, dried Bacillus subtilis, fermentation solubles, rosemary extract.<br /><br />I've now went through about 60lbs of the regular dry kibble with my 4 min-pins and guess what! My dog who is now about 12 years old that had lost her hair from Beneful has about 95% of her hair grown back :). One of our girls had puppies about 3 months ago and we fed them the same as adults > Birth> (youtu.be/FjE3akdY0i8). We just heated up a little water and allowed the kibble to absorb and fed the puppies 3 times a day.<br /><br />Our Min Pins get fed twice a day, only 1/4 cup! They love the dog food Orgainix, they are happy, have clear eyes and a shiny THICK coat. A photo of Baby and her puppy is posted.<br /><br />Also, the food is now listed as 5 STARS at the dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/castor-and-pollux-organix-dog-food-dry/<br /><br />If you look at the way most production dog food is made you would never feed it to an animal. Corporate greed is what it is and lets just hope Castor and Pollux from Organix keep their integrity by not succumbing to the slice & cut tactics of greed and continuing their current pursuit.<br /><br />BTW, It's made in the USA!

review/text: This tea is really pleasant and enjoyable, with a fragrant floral aroma. Herbalists have traditionally used magnolia for mood enhancement, and I find that I feel gently clear, positive and energized when drinking it.<br /><br />I find it best not to steep it for too long (as green teas will get bitter after 1-3 minutes). This one seems best when steeped briefly for one minute or less. The tea bags are quite potent, and I can use the same one again during the morning hours for making several cups, all with great flavor and nice energy.

review/summary: Great Alternative To Fresh Milk
review/text: In remote Alaska we never get deliveries of fresh milk. Unless you have milking goats out here you'll never have fresh milk. This canned milk is a great alternative to fresh milk. It's much thicker, but perfect for baking when watered down. It's great for mixing with fresh berries, drinks like coffee and hot chocolate, and cereal. The taste is much sweeter than normal milk so kids usually really like it. It's perfect for camping and tastes good warm or chilled. I suggest trying it mixed into coffee or with frozen berries.<br /><br />Taste: 5 out of 5<br />Child-Friendliness: 5 out of 5<br />Usefullness: 5 out of 5<br /><br />Great things to try it with:<br />Hot drinks<br />Making milkshakes<br />Baking (when watered down)<br />Cereal<br />Fruit and Berries<br />Chocolate Milk

But it is NOT, it is also made in China. Upon closer inspection it says this product has no ADDED hormones, antibiotics, preservatives... but it doesnt say the product is FREE OF these additives.

review/summary: Highest currency
review/text: Dogs know which treats they like best.  These are my dog's very favorite so I refer to them by saying, "I'll give you a million dollars."  Now that he knows this phrase, it gets him moving when he's reluctant to get in the car, or helps change his mind about an agility obstacle that makes him nervous.  I also use these as high-value treats for classical conditioning; I give these out when my dog is meeting a new person, or when I'm talking to a neighbor in the backyard, to create positive associations so he's less likely to bark.  Of course he also loves getting these just as a treat.  A bag of these treats can be stretched by cutting each one into about 3 pieces to use for training (big enough to still be chewy instead of swallowed whole), but I leave some whole for regular treats.  A whole one is big enough that my dog will carry it away to eat, and he will guard it from another dog, so be aware of that if your dog is a resource guarder.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying these.  Don't be fooled by the tear notch above the zipper; when I open the bag this way the zipper ends up getting ripped.  Cut the bag open above the zipper to make sure you can reseal it.  The thick plastic keeps the treats fresh.

review/summary: Dog Treats
review/text: These Chicken and Sweet Potato dog treats are the all time favorite in our home...not for me but for my dogs.  I was so happy to see them at such a great price, but when I received them I found that all 5 bags (2 priced at regular price) all had expired dates on them and they were not soft but very hard.  They all expired last year.  I realize they're dogs, and I realize the body parts they lick can't be any worse than some expired dog treats, but knowing that most dog treats, including these, come from China, and with the pet food issues that we have had, I just think that the expiration dates should be noted on the item description, and let the buyer beware. Otherwise, bar none my dogs love these treats, I shouldn't make that public than they will really go up in price and be even more difficult to find!

review/text: I discovered Welsh Brew tea a couple of years ago at my local grocery store in the "international" section but they haven't been able to keep it on the shelves consistently so I'm happy to find it here at Amazon. I'd been looking for a more mellow, less acidic tea for many years and this is it. In comparison, PG Tips is very acidic to my taste. It made a good strong cup, I could even say it had a "sharp" flavor, but it left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth. Welsh Brew leaves no bitter aftertaste. It's smooth and leans toward the sweet side of tea flavor. As another reviewer put it, it's a good "anytime" tea. I'll add that it's delicious by itself and needs no accompaniment like milk or sugar but works well with those if you wish to add them.

review/text: What's good about this:<br /><br />1.)  It's a lot of tea--forty bags in each box, and four boxes in each unit.  If you drink two cups a day, it will take almost three months to use all of this up.<br /><br />2.)  This is strong, dark tea with lots of caffeine.<br /><br />3.)  The print on the box is half in Welsh, half in English.  It's very cute, and I have no idea how to pronounce any of it.<br /><br />What's not so good:<br /><br />1.)  The tannin content is so high that you can feel it in your teeth, even when it's cold.<br /><br />2.)  The tannin content is so high that if you let it steep for more than about thirty seconds, you'll be tasting tannins all day.<br /><br />Steep for a very short period of time, and this is a very strong, flavorful tea that's actually inexpensive;  reminiscent of Twinings English breakfast tea, with a strong bite, a little goes a long way. It's bitterly yummy.

review/summary: Wonderful Every Day Tea
review/text: Murroughs Welsh Brew Tea is a tea that the entire family reaches for when they want a great black tea with out the bitterness.  When shopping at the local kitchen supply shop looking for a good black tea which could be had straight or with cream the salesperson said this is great because of the low tannins and this tea is known for it. The salesperson said it that was developed to taste well in the local water in Wales.  Well, hey, we bought that line and tried it out.  She was not wrong.  It's great for Colorado water, too! We are grateful that Amazon is offering it in this package because when we had it we drank it daily.

Hmm, all I know is that when I score him this tea he is a happy man!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!!<br /><br />JTG

review/summary: Tea Extraordinaire
review/text: If you appreciate a good cup of blended British style tea, then you have found your nirvana. This Welsh blend is clearly better than PG Tips, Yorkshire Gold, and any of the Twinings varieties. Its only rival would be Barry's Gold from Ireland. This tea, especially when drunk with cream and sugar, has a nice buttery taste in the back of your palate. Everyone who has tried this tea has loved it. It's only available at certain times of the year so order it when it's available and enjoy it the rest of the year. If you agree with my assessment, share it with your tea loving friends, as I did. They will heartily thank you.

review/summary: Worthy contender
review/text: This makes a strong, dark golden brown tea. The tea bags are large single rounds, about without any staple and string. The tea is packed in a single golden foil for freshness. The tannin content is nearly neck and neck with the flavor, so one must be sure not to steep the tea too long, probably no longer than 3 minutes. Another added bonus for the tea lover is that the box is written in both English and Welsh.

review/text: My wife lived in Wales for many years as well as her Mother having spent most of her life there...drinking lots of tea... when I met my wife, she drank PG Tips which I too began to drink (I was always a coffee drinker prior). PG Tips was ok, but weak, not too much flavor, etc... We tried many other brands but when I found Welsh Brew, I noticed a very distinctive difference in flavor... you can actually taste the tea & it tastes great in my opinion... cup after cup. I drink 2 large cups every morning & love it!

review/text: Amazon has been out of Lifeboat Tea (my all time favorite tea so far) for months now and since I am running really low on my supply, I decided to give Welsh Brew a try. I found it flavorless, not at all hearty or bold and bland and boring. It taste like hot water to me, no kidding. I'm was thinking, "How am I supposed to get my morning "jolt" from this stuff if I can't even taste it?" I didn't.<br /><br />I'm a hard core, leave the tea bag in the cup while I drink it, tea drinkin' fool and found that I'd been fooled by Welsh Brew. Bummer!

review/text: 10/08/12 Update: Someone pointed out that the Anise also comes in these little beveled squares. I much prefer that shape. They are like lovely little red jewels going in the mouth and the taste and feel on the tongue is smoother with no sharp corners. The beveled squares last longer. When it comes to the jagged little chips I can't resist chomping them. - Not so good for the teeth.<br />-------------------------<br />Claeys can always be counted on for great hard candies and this one is no different. The candies are kind of a red, a littler harder than some of the other candies, and comes in little chips rather than drop form.<br /><br />The only reason for not giving it high marks is that the Anise flavor is light and delicate and I prefer a much stronger taste. However, the fact that the taste is not overpowering makes it great for guests. Even people who don't normally care for Anise have said they like these little beauties.<br /><br />This is good stuff, just mild for my taste.

review/summary: Hey these are a little bit spicy!
review/text: I have a special grinder just for red peppers. I grind them up and put them on pizza, pasta, whatever.  Grinding them seems to make them a bit hotter but that's besides the point. I bought these because regular crushed red peppers weren't doing it for me anymore. I got these things in the mail and pulled off the seal under the cap(away from my cat who seemed very interested in them). There was a fine dust on the underside of the seal so I decided it was fine to try the peppers that way.<br /><br />I licked my pinky finger, took a dab of the pepper dust, and put it on my tongue.  The taste was a lot different than I expected, a strong, smoky flavor but not entirely great tasting. I suppose as a spice it would get the job done but it doesn't taste like jalapeno or peperencini or anything.  About 5 seconds in, I experienced the most severe burning sensation in my mouth in my life. These things are crazy hot, not for the faint of heart, and after a few hours recollecting my experience, I've come to the conclusion that these peppers are a great way to ruin food.  Certainly worth the money. Be very careful with these bad boys.

The flakes have a good flavor that enhances the taste of your food instead of overpowering it.

review/text: The taste is very good.  I got the flakes because sometimes the ground pepper would get in the air and make me sneeze 5 or 6 times. These lose one star due to the pieces being mostly too large to shake through the shaker holes of the container. I'm taking them home from work tonight to see if running them through a food processor will make them small enough to shake.

review/text: I used to give my dog one of those green dental bones every night.  They were pricey -- it added up to about $50 a month.  Then I switched to a cheaper brand, but I found he ate those within a couple of minutes.<br /><br />These are actually cheaper and take longer to chew than the various edible dental bones.  (I am not sure why, but my dog can consume normal rawhide faster than these chews).  It takes him a satisfying amount of time to chew, and seems to help his teeth and breath.  I am really glad I tried these!  They may look like rawhide but are much better.

review/summary: Great product but uneven quality control
review/text: After spending over $600 to have my English cocker spaniel's teeth cleaned, I began looking for a product that would help eliminate or delay having this procedure done again.  On the recommendation of my veterinarian, I purchased a bag of these chews on Amazon (the prices are just too high at the vet's office).  My dog loves them!  He begs for one every evening after his dinner (dry kibble).  They are non-staining on the carpet and paws.  These chews, along with 3X a week tooth brushing with C.E.T. toothpaste, will hopefully keep his breath sweet-smelling and delay having dental work done any time soon.  My only complaint with this product is that in the same bag of 30 chews, you will find some of them to be very thick and others to be very thin.  It would be nice if they were more uniform in size as on some evenings my dog finishes his chew in just a few minutes and other evenings he gets to settle in with a good long chew-fest.

review/summary: Lab swallows these whole
review/text: I have five dogs and have been feeding both the medium and large sizes of this product for several months.  I have no doubt that it cleans their teeth.  However, I have two problems with this product.  One is with the sizing.  In the large size, there are always plenty of chews that should be considered medium.  Since I pay extra for the large size, I expect that they should all be large.  Also, there are often ones included that are way too thick, and can't be chewed in a reasonable time.<br />The other problem is with my old black lab mix, Fargo.  He chews for awhile and then proceeds to swallow the whole thing.  Invariably, it gets caught in his throat and I have to fish it out.  He resents this as he believes I am trying to steal it.  I have discontinued using these and am looking for another product that works equally well but is less apt to be swallowed whole.

review/summary: Bad  Tooth Tartar: all but gone
review/text: I have a Rescue Weiner dog with teeth that had very bad tartar from front to back. Simply said, they were total brown. The vet suggested scraping which costs about $90.00. She sold me the large size (bag of 15 each) for about $18.00. Foxie the Weiner dog loves them. I also gave her Cow knees fron the butcher shop. (You can bake the knees to get rid of the grease and rancid smell.)The combination of the two has cleaned the dogs teeth remarkably in about thirty + days. She no longer needs to have her teeth scraped. I searched many internet sources for these products. With the $25.00 minimum Amazon supersaver shiping I saved about 45% off of the vet's cost and about 20% to 30% from many online vendor's.I saved $ by buying the large size, then cut them in half with a sharp knife or poultry shears.To keep you dog from vomiting the chew, use the large or extra large size. Take the chew away after 15-20 minutes before the dog can soften the entire chew, swallow it whole and gag/vomit!<br /><br />  Bob Howard, Seattle Wa

review/summary: UNSAFE - choking hazard - try VeggieDent chews instead
review/text: Our vet recommended getting "C.E.T. chews" to help clean our dog's teeth, so I looked around online and came across the VeggieDent chews and the HEXtra premium chews. Both of these met the requirement of being "C.E.T chews" but they looked (and sounded from the description) very different from each other, so I wasn't sure what kind to buy. Based on the reviews for each, it still wasn't clear what would work better, so I ordered one pack of each. I was worried that the VeggieDent chews would too easily be consumed and therefore wouldn't do much for cleaning her teeth, and I was worried that the HEXtra chews would be a choking hazard because they wouldn't come apart easily enough and she might swallow them whole.<br /><br />The VeggieDent chews were definitely easy for her to break pieces off of, but she was quite happy doing so, and it took her about 15s or maybe a bit more to eat it. She chewed each little piece that broke off while she ate it, and it was definitely cleaning her teeth. The HEXtra chews, however, are a choking hazard, and I will never give her another one. She was very excited to get the HEXtra chew (they smell terrible but apparently good to a dog) and chewed on it for a second or two, and then in one quick gulp it was gone. The whole chew, still in one piece. It was in her mouth for about 2 seconds. She is a VERY strong chewer (she can take chunks off of a black kong easily in 30 seconds or so, and she's a medium-large dog), and had no desire to chew pieces off of the HEXtra chew, I'm guessing because the moistened chew seemed like something to be swallowed whole. The HEXtra chews were useless for cleaning her teeth and a choking hazard, and I would never give her another one.<br /><br />In summary, the VeggieDent chews were great for cleaning our dog's teeth (though they didn't last particularly long, but if you're looking for something to last long, try a kong product), while the HEXtra chews did nothing for our dog's teeth and were also a choking hazard because she swallowed it whole within a second or two.<br /><br />Note: I've posted this review for the VeggieDent chews as well, in case it's useful for people who may be debating between these two types of C.E.T. chews.

review/summary: Throw That Beef-Flavored Toothpaste Away!
review/text: Let's face it, the finger-brush & beef-flavored toothpaste is a nightmare.  My sweet, gentle dog, who seems ok with just about anything that comes her way, drew the line at the fingertip toothbrush.<br /><br />She loves these chews though.  I know because when I give her a treat that she's not crazy about, she'll eat it and stand there looking at me like she's waiting for something better.  If I give her a treat that she likes, she'll trot off happily to the other room to enjoy it. When I give her these chews, she takes off like a bat out of Hades, and she stays occupied longer than with most other chews we've tried.<br /><br />Plus, they really do help keep her teeth healthy & clean, and the vet even mentioned her healthy teeth during her last visit.  Great product.

review/summary: Great Chews for Teeth and Health!
review/text: My Beagles are very picky about their chews. I'm very picky about what chews I give them. No pig's ears for MY girls! I was looking for a happy compromise-a chew they would love, but one that would have some beneficial properties for their teeth & gums, as they seem to need to get their teeth cleaned often.<br />These chews have made a viable difference-their gums are much less red, and their teeth seem to stay tartar free longer.They last longer than other chews as well. What more can you ask for?

review/summary: Good but Virbac has reduced the size
review/text: My dogs have been using these for nearly 4 years, and they love them.  They seem to reduce plaque to some degree.<br /><br />The gripe I have is, Virbac has made them smaller.  The medium chews are smaller than before, and the large chews are about the size that the mediums used to be.  The extra larges are smaller too.  I am not imagining this; I have a bag from about 6 months ago and the new ones are considerably smaller.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind, if they had reduced the price...but they didn't.<br /><br />Conclusion:  smaller product for same price

review/text: I have purchased this product many times. But this time I was disappointed. The large dog chews have always had different thicknesses, but this bag was all just above paper thin. The point of the chew is not just the chemical for tarter, they have to chew on it for a while, ant that thin of a stripe results in very little chewing.

review/summary: Doesn't have same effect on humans.
review/text: This seemed (at first) like a cheap alternative for tooth brushing, but after a few weeks without substantial results I'm beginning to have my doubts. I've received numerous complaints regarding bad breath from my girlfriend, and have discovered a noticeable increase in salivation as well as unsightly hair growth. I've read that many dogs have choked, gagged, and even puked while eating these hygiene chews. Unfortunately I can report the same problems during human consumption. This is mainly because they are a little too big to be swallowed whole, and sometimes when you're eating especially vivaciously they'll tend to slowly clog your throat if you forget to swallow often enough, triggering your gag reflex. It does merit three stars however, because they taste DELICIOUS. The taste itself is worth the negative side-effects. I've seen no reviews so far covering effects on humans, so I just thought I'd throw in a few of own my personal experiences.

review/text: These dogs chews are the best for my three dogs!  I've noticed that it has cleared up the plaque in their teeth. The trick is to buy the chews that have the "Chlorhexidine." I highly recommend this product to any dog parent. However, one thing to keep in mind is that not all dogs' stomach may agree to the chews. My other dog that lives with parents can't eat these chews because it upsets his stomach.

Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews. they are just as good for the dogs teeth without the chance of staining plus are less costly. also my dogs do tend to gag on them once they've chewed the large size piece down small enough to where they think they can just swallow it whole. eventually they do spit it up and realize they need to chew it a bit more. the product and my dogs vet mentions that the C.E.T. chews are easier on digestion than other rawhide chews so i don't feel as concerned with my dogs swallowing the small pieces.

review/summary: Same as the pros sell!
review/text: This is our first on-line purchase of the CET HEXtra chews after getting them from the Vet for years.  Our 21# Scottie-girl prefers the large, as do we.  I don't care for the smaller size in a chew like this.  I'd rather be able to see it while she's chewing.  I reckon the chlorhex-a-stuff gets chewed/licked off pretty quickly and it's certainly a distinctive aroma.  Our Scottie-girl has a collection of these in various places around the house and she picks out her 'favorite' from time to time.<br /><br />While we have found a skinny-er-than-normal chew occasionally(one or two per bag), they are usually still large enough to call 'large', I suppose.  The problem with the really thins ones is their propensity to go 'limp' rather quickly.  I usually nab these while the young lady isn't looking and dispose of them straight away.  As such, she will get one or two 'outings' with the skinny ones and in the trash they go.<br /><br />The savings over our vet's price is about $10/bag; so I do feel a little less guilty when ordering from the 'zon for such a savings.  I could see us doing this about half the time if the prices stay the same.  I'm still happy to support our vet with retail purchases since the office has been very kind and helpful with our little 'girl'.<br /><br />Product was as described and delivered in a timely fashion...two paws up!

review/summary: Bad Breath gone in days!
review/text: My dogs were in desperate need of some breath freshing (as well as teeth cleaning). I have been using these for about 4-5 days now giving each of my two dogs one after dinner every night and I have noticed a difference in their teeth and breath already! Also if you are worried about a finicky eater- DON'T. My rescue dog doesn't like raw hides or any chew toys but he actually chews and finishes these and in about 15 minutes! I plan on making this an after dinner ritual from now on! I wish they were a little cheaper so it may be more of an every other day ritual :)<br /><br />***Update: So my golden retriever just had his annual exam and this is the first time that our vet has said his teeth looked great! He usually pushes us to have a dental cleaning and again...this is the first time he has not told us that Ramsey needed a dental cleaning! I am just amazed at the amount of tartar that this has removed. Other than a few brown spots around his gumline on his back teeth his teeth are white and shiny! Oh and that knock-you-out bad breath is a distant memory!

review/summary: DANGER TO DOGS
review/text: My dog was chewing on these chews and since they seemed thinner and smaller than the last batch, I kept a close watch on him. Last night he started choking and gagging as he tried to swallow the partially eaten, soggy chew.<br /><br />I first tried to give him the Heimlich, then had to pull the part of the chew sticking out from his throat out! There was blood all over his blanket. It was very traumatic to say the least. DO NOT BUY THESE!!! Get Greenies or something else that's not a choking hazard.

review/summary: Not the same as they used to be
review/text: I have purchased these a couple of times before, my dog loves them and they help his breath greatly (if only briefly). However, the last time they seemed to be so flimsy my dog gagged on them because they bend so easily. I buy the large size and although they are big enough, they are definitely not thick enough for a large dog. The last bag I bought is pretty much sitting around and these are waaay too costly to purchase again unless they improve them. I did read the same in other reviews, wish I had listened :(

review/summary: Great Product , Just A Little Over Priced
review/text: These are a great product, they do remove the plaque from your dogs teeth but it takes time. I've got 2 Golden Retrievers , and if they don't get one of these after Dinner, they think they're in trouble and pout all night.  They're a great product but do get pricey if you use them on a daily basis like I do.

review/summary: A favorite in our house-with good medical benefits!
review/text: My finicky pup loves these, and they are (per my vet) good for his teeth. I pay the extra for the HEXtra...I think it's worth it compared to multiple teeth cleanings.

review/summary: I swear by it- it works!!!
review/text: I have a 3yr. old female border collie and she absolutely loves these treats! I got her the one with the chlorhexidine since I know it will work on reducing her calculus and it has! I have been giving her these 2x/daily after her meals and she chews it up right away. I agree that any type of treat you should supervised your pet accordingly but knowing my dog she's very smart and knows not to swallow it whole- she takes her time chewing and licking the taste. There is a strong smell to these treats which make them more attractive to the dog but honestly the smell isn't that bad. Overall it really does work and I'm so glad that Amazon offers it at such a great price and speedy delivery! =) Will definitely be buying more for sure!
