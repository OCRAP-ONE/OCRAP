review/summary: Other Comment misguided
review/text: I just read a reviewer who said this is sauce is not authentic. Then the reviewer went on to list their version of authentic Pad Thai sauce (that they had obtained online. As if this meant it was authentic. Ha!). Their recipe had rice vinegar and paprika. Odd.<br />Most Pad Thai sauces in Thailand are made with tamarind, palm sugar and salted radish -as Taste of Thai's sauce does.<br />There are numerous variations on Pad Thai sauce throughout Thailand. Every chef makes his or hers in their own way. However, usually tamarind, garlic, shallot, fish sauce, sugar, chili pepper play roles in their creations.

review/summary: Boat load of Pad Thai
review/text: This is an awesome sauce, for a quick dish of pad thai for two (per packet).  My family loves when I make pad Thai with all the fixings.  I've tried a lot of store bought sauces and this is ranked at the top. Is this restaurant quaility, NO!, if you want that go to a good Thai restaurant.  I don't always want to travel 50 miles into Chicago to seek one out. I would highly recommend this for a good pad thai meal at home.

review/summary: Tasty, I was surprised!
review/text: I bought this product at my local grocery store because I couldn't find an ingredient on our "from scratch" pad thai recipe.  I was super surprised, this sauce is pretty tasty.  I followed the directions on the back of the package (with chicken) and everyone in my family liked it.  My husband even commented that he liked the flavor of this more than our local take-out Thai place (which we LOVE).  In the future I think I would add two packets of sauce, but seriously I'm planning on keeping this as a pantry staple from now on!  Very yummy!!

review/summary: Meh, too sweet for me
review/text: I love pad thai.  I bought this sauce hoping to recreate my favorite dish from a local thai restaurant.Conlusion? It just isnt the same.  Reading the ingredients, this is definetly not "authenic". Palm Sugar, Tamarind, Soy Sauce, Shallot, Pickled Radish, Garlic, Soybean Oil, Salt, Chili.<br /><br />Its too sweet for me.  I just dont really like it.  This sauce uses ALOT of tamarind, you can see the chunks in it. I'm pretty sure that my local Thai restaurant does not use tamarind, their sauce is not as dark brown. (Maybe thats the Americanized Pad Thai?)<br /><br />I found a Pad Thai sauce recipe online and I think I will use instead of this sauce.<br /><br />2 1/2 Tbs. brown sugar<br />1 Tbs. lime juice<br />2 1/2 Tbs. Thai Kitchen Premium Fish Sauce<br />1 Tbs. rice vinegar<br />1 tsp. paprika (optional)

review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best "bang for the buck" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

The other value brand that comes in the bright yellow pail is its closest competitor in price and I find it very had to scoop. This is so much easier.

review/summary: False Labeling!!
review/text: This stuff is called "Cook's Organic PURE Vanilla Powder" but it's definitely nothing of the sort. First of all, anyone should be weary of a "pure" vanilla powder that isn't dark brown/blackish in color. That should be the first give away. Cook's PURE Vanilla Powder is a white powder, and anyone who takes a moment to read the ingredient list should not be surprised to find that the #1 ingredient in this "PURE" Vanilla powder is, in fact, sucrose. That's right folks, it's sugar. Corn sugar. Cook's calls this product "a revolutionary vanilla and the first real alternative to pure vanilla extract" but the truth is there is nothing revolutionary here, and this is a horrible alternative to a perfectly fine product such as pure vanilla extract. As white as this powder appears by looking at the jar, one has to wonder just how much vanilla powder is actually even in there. It can't be much. Or maybe they bleached it?<br /><br />Anyone willing to shell out $55 for 4.9lbs. of corn sugar with a splash of vanilla will be very pleased with this product, but if one were to actually care about their health and well-being, it would be wise to stay clear of this product and purchase some REAL vanilla powder or a vanilla extract instead. (They do make vanilla extract without alcohol, for those trying to avoid it.)<br /><br />What we can learn from a product like this is the importance of reading labels. Always read the labels of products you intend on purchasing. Lesson learned? This stuff's junk. Go with another product.

review/summary: Hemp Super Food...
review/text: This is organic, costs more so it is not sold in bigger quantities. Manitoba sells the 5lb container, conventional not organic, with bigger saving but it all depends how much you consume. Manitoba sells the 5lb container with bigger saving but it all depends how much you consume. I consume these straight from the container with spoon, an hour before my work outs without mixing in a bowl or as dressing. I consume it first thing in the morning or when I need a quick burst of energy regardless of the time of the day. For years I have consumed 1)raw sunflower seeds, 2)almonds in water 3)organic sesame+flax seeds grinded in coffee maker + cocoa powder + unflavoured protein isolate on daily basis and now I have added hemp to my diet. Seeds all go rancid due to the oil and the germ inside the seed so regardless of the type or brand, seeds need to be stored in freezer, in a dark, cold, sealed container, away from any moisture. If plastic container it needs to be #5 or much safer in glass containers. I consume seeds within two weeks but the hemp seeds within the most three months since I can not get it in small quantities and it will lose its nutritional value. This is an unbelievable product and you can not grow it in US since it is illegal and big business does not want to see you healthy and there is no profit in hemp for since it is so cheap to grow with so many benefits that scares big pharma, plastic industry, fabric-cotton industry, pesticide producers, etc... so if you live in US, Canada becomes your only hope. Hemp increases my level of energy without an other artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar. More energy with less empty calorie fillers, like sugar and saturated fat, and common energy bars. Contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies, a component of a healthy immune system. Healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, fibre, vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories, starch and sugar. One of the best natural boosters that I can get when doing all different type of sports or when I need energy without a big meal. Hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in US. Victim of its own success. This is a super food next to quinoa, kale, broccoli, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc... Thank you Canada.

review/summary: Super Food!
review/text: I recently heard about Manitoba Harvest Hemp on an interview with Riley Cote (former Philadelphia Flyer)- He boasted about the health benefits of hemp (and how he has got a lot of NHL players taken it for a natural supplement), so I needed to do a little more research myself.<br />After researching, I saw he was right one! This is a great supplement for adding Omega 3/6 into you diet.<br />It tastes like shelled, unsalted sunflower seeds. So they actually add more texture to food than a taste.<br />I usually add it to my cereal or yogurt in the morning - and I generally try to throw a tablespoon of it into whatever I am eating.<br />If you have high cholesterol, Omega 3/6 are good to add to your diet, this is also a great source of fiber for you too.<br />There are lots of sellers, but what draws me to Manitoba is that they seem to be the most pure and freshest you can get. I like the Raw organic for the freshness and also to get a more pure product (why have unneeded additives in my supplements?)

review/summary: I finally discovered what a difference good cinnamon can make (Updated)
review/text: I used to buy the little cans of cinnamon in the supermarket and occasionally would sprinkle it on toast or cereal.  Basically, I could take it or leave it.  However, the smell of cinnamon buns in the mall has always seemed so enticing but I thought it had more to do with the baking process than the cinnamon.<br /><br />I recently started to notice that commercials for certain products emphasized the brand name of the cinnamon used and began to wonder if there really was a difference in cinnamon.  I read the reviews here and decided to try this brand even though I thought 32 ounces was a huge amount that would take years to use.<br /><br />This cinnamon has been a real eye opener for me.  I think the reviewer that mentioned the Red Hot candies intrigued me the most and , yes, it does remind me of that taste.  I absolutely love it and use it liberally now, especially on oatmeal.  Instead of lasting years, I use so much that I am ready to subscribe for automatic shipments.<br /><br />Update September 10,2011<br /><br />I just opened a subscribe and save shipment that I bought last month.  What a difference in quality.  This one was so bad that I can see why a previous reviewer said that he would give it negative stars if possible.  I am changing my rating, 5 stars for previous batches but this current one reduces the average to 2.5 being generous.<br /><br />There needs to be more quality control at this company :(

review/summary: Guinness Bread
review/text: Tried this on a whim, it sounded tasty.  I ended up using Guinness Extra Stout rather than the Draught called for but the bread came out fine.  When it first emerged from the oven it smelled heavenly and looked lovely.  It came out of the pan very easily.  When it had cooled I attempted cutting it and beware!  It's very crumbly. At first I did not like it, the flavor was very bland and reminiscent of what I'd think chewy cardboard would taste like. Disappointed I put it away overnight.  I tried some later the next day and voila! Flavor! It was very tasty after having a night to sit.  It's still very crumbly though, more of a breakfast-y bread then something you could use for a sandwich. Tastes very good with butter slathered on it, just remember if you don't care for it initially...let it rest, it may surprise you.

review/summary: Do Not Purchase
review/text: Save your money and do not purchase this product as it is a complete rip-off.  I purchased this thinking it would be an interesting bread for St. Patrick's day, however, it is not.  There is nothing proprietary to Guiness Beer in the ingredients, no interestig flavorings added etc...the ingredients are flour, oatmeal, baking soda, salt and brown sugar.  You must provide the Guiness beer, butter, milk, and molasses.  To make matters worse, you only use 1/2 a cup of Guiness beer - and are left with 3/4 of a bottle of beer.  This is nothing more than a few inexpensive ingredients and a recipe to make aweful beer bread.  The packaging would lead you to believe that it is something more than it is, but in fact, it is deceptive and a complete rip-off.  I have a beer bread recipe which calls for a whole can of beer which results in fantastic beer bread, and I will be using this recipe instead...total cost of ingredients to make beer bread from scratch is about 25 cents.  Amazon should be ashamed that they are participating in scamming consumers with this product.  By the way, the bread that this mix produced is aweful...dry, tasts like cardboard.  We threw ours out.  If you want to make beer bread using Guiness, find a basic beer bread online that calls for 1 can of beer and use that recipe...you will save youself about $16.

review/summary: A delicious bit of Ireland in your own home
review/text: We love this bread mix.  We use a little extra dark molasses than the recipe calls for, and that, combined with the flavor of the Guinness, gives you a rich, tasty loaf that works well<br />with sweet butter, or as an appetizer with smoked salmon and a<br />dab of horseradish cream.  Sometimes I add golden raisins to the bread before baking.  You can't go wrong here, this is<br />delicious and easy to make.

Instead of telling you all about something as subjective as the flavor, I will instead tell you about how this tea is packaged.<br /><br />The tea comes in triangular shaped satchels which appear to be all well made and after 20 bags, not one has ripped or come apart. Extremely pleased and impressed with the tea and packaging. I hope to try some more of White Lion's offerings soon.

review/summary: My Dog Likes Them But...
review/text: My dog likes them, but I do not. I mentioned in a couple other reviews that I have an older dog who is missing quite a few teeth. I look for soft treats that can be broken into smaller bites. I also prefer ones that are not wet or gooey. Our go-to favorites are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I9SEO8">Canine Carry Outs</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K8X6LC">Milk-Bone Healthy Favorites Chewy Treats</a>.<br /><br />These Beggin Littles are small of soft. My dog likes them. Unfortunately I don't like the smell. They are quite strong and stinky.<br /><br />I will buy these again for my dog since he likes them. I just wish they weren't so pungent. Dogs have great noses. They don't need to be blasted with such a strong scent.

review/summary: My Dog Loved the Taste - I Loved the Quality
review/text: My Great Dane is very sweet, but he is extra hard on toys and treats, destroying both in a matter of seconds.  This Zuke's Z-Bone was a different story, though.  While it didn't last for a tremendous amount of time, it kept my dog working for a while longer than his usual time.  He loved the taste and, although he had never had one before, after sniffing it, he jumped right in.  I loved the quality ingredients (I recognized what I was feeding my dog) and the fact that it freshened his breath.  I also appreciated that it was grain-free as my dog has sensitive skin.<br />I will definitely continue to buy these!

The only sweetener is grape juice and apple juice concentrate. Lemon juice and fruit concentrates mingle with the sparkling water to create a delicate, smooth, slightly tingly and delicious drink.<br /><br />Perfect for drinking with dinner or taking along on a picnic.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: A great healthy alternative to soda pop...
review/text: My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon!  They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.

review/text: I have been looking at every store to find the sugar free Coconut Torani because I really enjoy the coconut flavor of the regular Torani Coconut but sugar and I are not friends. When I found  the sugar free on Amazon I was happy to order the extra large bottle expecting I was going to really like the "Intense tropical flavor". As soon as I received the bottle I poured a cup of coffee and then added the same amount of Torani as I do with their other sugar free syrups and it didn't taste of coconut; just slightly sweet. I added double the normal amount I usually add and the result was a very sweet cup of coffee with very little coconut flavor. Even straight from the bottle it lacks "Intense tropical flavor". Very disappointed!

review/summary: Jasmine Green Perfection
review/text: It seems that jasmine green teas fall into two disappointing categories:<br />No matter how pretty the packaging, they are either harsh and bitter with jasmine dust and tea stem rather than flower and tea leaves, or they are gussied up by the addition of some other flavor, usually citrus.<br />Then there is Triple Leaf.<br />It gets it's own category and it stands alone.<br />This jasmine green tea delivers consistently in it's perfect blend of perfume and tea.<br />One never overpowers the other.<br />I brew 3 bags (torn open & loose) in a 32 oz. french press every morning and leave it on the counter to sip all day long. It never develops a bitter flavor, but seems to ripen to a full, beautiful taste.<br />The only drawback to Triple Leaf is that it isn't sold in loose form.<br />I buy it by the case and find that the unused boxes store very well.<br />The last box is always as fresh as the first.<br />Happy Sipping!

In some of the nicer stores the same type of team would be 4 - 6 times more expensive.<br /><br />That keeps me purchasing from here.  Highly recommended if you have expect to drink a lot of tea.

I sweeten it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGWIH0">stevia</a>, which blends very well with it.<br /><br />I personally prefer green tea that is not decaffeinated because it perks me up in the morning without the caffeine "jitters" that I get from coffee. I also drink green tea because of the antioxidants it contains. Studies have indicated that antioxidants are helpful in preventing diseases such as cancer, coronary heart disease and maintaining general health, which means green tea is nutritious as well as delicious.

If I could afford espresso all the time, I'd do that, but this is a very close second and the taste is consistent.  Not one ground has come through into the cup (whereas other k-cups do).

review/summary: Love the coffee but...
review/text: My wife and I love the Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) coffee and have been ordering it for our Keurig for months but have always purchased it in the smaller boxes (25 K-cups).  When we saw this box of 50 K-cups for about the same price per cup, we decided to order two and that way place fewer orders.<br /><br />However, we have thrown away more defective K-cups from this one box than we have from everything else we've purchased in the 6 months since we bought our Keurig machine.  And we have bought A LOT of coffee & tea, much of it from Green Mountain.  I don't know if its a problem at the factory or if its an issue with the packaging but 1/3 of the K-cups in the first box had to be thrown away.  Frankly, these things are too expensive to accept that kind of waste...not to mention the hassle of cleaning up the mess they make first thing in the morning when all I want to do is sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and wake up.<br /><br />I hope that its from the packaging (the K-cups are not as tightly packed and therefore get bounced around a lot more during shipping - I HOPE that's the root cause of the problem) and not an issue with manufacturing because I would HATE it if we had to stop buying Green Mountain products altogether. Dark Magic and Triple Black Diamond have become our two favorite coffees, replacing Newman's Own Special Blend. As it is, I will go back to ordering the smaller packages and hope that this solves the problem.<br /><br />I give the coffee five stars but only one for the packaging so I compromised by assigning 3 stars to this product.

I almost gave it 4 stars, but then realized that out of all the x-bold offerings I've tried (and I've tried quite a few), it's one of my favorites at its price point.  It is a good coffee with good, bold flavor... and I did just put in an order for a second box.  My favorite from Amazon was Coffee People's Oraganic x-bold coffee (yellow foil cap).  Not sure what happened to this one, but I only see it rarely, and then at a ridiculous price (just saw it at $99 for a 24 pack... that's over $4/k-cup!!).

review/summary: My go to brew when I need a kick in the am
review/text: If you like good bold coffee to get you moving, look no further.  A bit smoother than Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond but stronger and more complex than both Nantucket Blend and Newman's Own Bold, it is full bodied even when brewed on the 14 oz setting.  It is my first cup, make that mug, in the morning as I sit in my sunroom and watch the fox make tracks into the woods and the finches and cardinals arrive at the bird feeder.  It's coffee to greet the sunrise and help you face the day ahead.

I find it a little difficult to describe, but it's kind of like the difference between milk chocolate and dark chocolate, with the Dark Magic being the dark chocolate.  I intend to pick up a box for those days when I feel like something a little different.

review/summary: Dark Magic is a great cup of coffee
review/text: I am just 1 week into owning my Kuerig B60 and this was in the sample pack. When I brewed it up, coffee grounds were in the cup and I was hoping this was just one faulty package. It smelled so good and I didn't want to throw it out I strained it twice added my cream and it was really good! This was a keeper and I went back today after church to B3 with my 20% off coupon and purchased a box and promptly had a cup while I was preparing my lunch.  I determined I could buy 3 boxes-18 count each with coupons for $24.28 once I finish this box and the two others (French Roast and Butter Toffee) I bought at the time I purchased my Kuerig. Dark Magic along with French Roast are my morning travel mug brews, and I will usually finish the evening with a smooth Butter Toffee.<br /><br />Update 7/25/12: Dark Magic is the only K Cup I am drinking.Truly a great cup of coffee, I have a 10 oz travel mug on my morning commute and then a 6 oz in the evening either before or after dinner. At either amount and a little cream it taste great, not bitter or weak. Love it!!! New owners definitely want to register your Kuerig and receive the  buy 2 get 2 free k cup offer, I paid $29.68 for 4-(24)count Dark Magic k cups

A friend warned me to check the expiration date--mine had plenty of time left. All is good in my coffee world.

review/text: What a great purchase.  I was originally looking for the ice coffee k-cups but they are ridiculously expensive (I feel).  After reading that their is not much of a difference and I was most concerned of the "watered down" taste so I thought and "extra bold" strength would do the trick, which it did!!!! I will be buying more soon and in a larger quantity now that I know how well it works ;)p

review/text: I love bold, robust coffee and decided to purchase Green Mountain Dark Magic k-cups. Definitely a bold coffee, but so acidic it's not enjoyable. Severely disappointed in this coffee. Am trying other brands but because of this experience trying to steer clear of all coffees distributed by Green Mountain; and that's a shame because they offer so many choices. Money is too hard to come by to blow it on coffee you can't drink!

review/summary: Gave this a try after GMC Espresso Blend was discontinued...
review/text: I'm on the second k-cup in the box and find myself comparing it to Green Mountain Coffee Espresso Blend which I've been drinking for over a year now.  The box reads, "offers the rich aromatics and flavor qualities of espresso".  Even Keurig is recommending Dark Magic to those who previously purchased the Espresso Blend.  Another reviewer wrote this coffee was: "Strong but flat, lacking definition".  Well, it does taste watery compared to the espresso blend and lacks that burst of flavor in every sip.  I'm not a big coffee drinker but love making daily lattes and cappuccinos from my Green Mountain Espresso Blend and now Dark Magic coffee.  This coffee is barely acceptable for this purpose but it is acceptable for someone who likes a strong/bold cup of coffee.

I would recommend this but then again it's the matter of personal taste.

review/summary: Nice Bold Flavor
review/text: Not as strong/bold as I was expecting based on other reviews, but still a nice strong flavor when brewed at the standard 10oz setting. I like a nice strong cup of coffee, black. Dark Magic (Extra Bold) competes with Starbucks Verona and also Barista's Italian Roast for my "go to" morning coffee choice. If I was to rank these 3, I would say #1 Barista's Italian Roast, #2 Starbuck Verona, #3 Green Mt. Dark Magic. Emeril's Extra Bold dark roast is also a good choice.<br /><br />Costco (my local store) sells Starbuck Verona. My next purchase will probably be Barista's Italian... If I catch Dark Magic on sale, I may buy some more of that brand.<br /><br />I give it 8/10 on 1-10 scale. If you like strong coffee, you will probably like Dark Magic.

This is definitely one that I brew on the biggest cup size (12oz on my unit).<br /><br />The only negative I have is the lingering flavor is not quite as good as some of my more favorite k-cups.  However, I still put this in my top 10 and will continue to order occasionally for variety's sake.<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this to anyone who likes a strong, dark brew.

It's perfect for a 12oz cup or even a 14oz travel mug.
