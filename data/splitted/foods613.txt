review/summary: We Both Love It
review/text: My Husky/Samoyed mix, The Lovely Marie, adores this food. As soon as I open a can, she starts dancing in circles. I think she especially loves the smell of it, although that occasionally puts me off a bit because it does contain fish. Some cans are stinkier than others, but it's all perfume to Marie's nose. She gobbles it up. I do vary her diet to include some grain-free products, but this is the food she gets most excited about.<br /><br />I love it because I trust this company, and I believe that Newman's Own products are of high quality. (I hope I'm right.) I also like their mission to bring good green and fair trade products to the market, and to use their profits to support charitable causes. Bottom line: I feel confident that I am giving my girl something wholesome and good.<br /><br />I stock up on this food because the chicken they put in it is "human grade." I hope the fish is "human grade," too, because I have several cases of this in my garage. I'm thinking that when the "Big One" (earthquake) hits here in California, I'll just break out a case of this food and Marie and I can both survive on it until help arrives.

review/summary: My Yorkies love this stuff!
review/text: After researching the ingredients on my dogs' old dog food (Beneful & Cesars),I wanted to get my pups on some healthier food and I also did not want to break the bank doing so. This turned out to be a great alternative that met all my nutritional and financial requirements I had set forth. For a well rounded nutritional meal, I mix the following <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK339Y">Newman's Own Organics Chicken & Brown Rice Formula for Dogs, 12.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PMDYZA">Newman's Own Organics 100% Organic Liver for Dogs, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>. The dogs really go nuts for this stuff and seem to enjoy it. It appears to me that the dogs have more energy and are in an overall better mood. One of Yorkies had a licking issue and that behavior has decreased dramatically since I made the switch to Newman's. It keeps their stool very solid as well. Overall this a great, nutritional meal at a good price......5 STARS!

review/summary: Turkey and Chicken Formula smells like fish
review/text: Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that "Turkey & Chicken Formula" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as "contaminated".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.

review/summary: Too Rich for my dogs
review/text: I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the "organ" meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake. So personally I feel it is a good food, just be careful as it is much richer than most any other canned food you will feed and a tablespoon goes a long way!

review/summary: My picky eaters love it!
review/text: I have two Yorkies that are very picky eaters.  After a period of 2-3 days up to 2-3 weeks they will decide they don't like the food I am giving them and just stop eating.  I went through a real struggle when one of them got a stomach bug and got real sick with vomiting and diarrhea.  I started cooking fresh turkey with brown rice and his stomach healed up in no time.  But them I couldn't get them back onto dog food!!  I found the Newman's Organic Turkey and Brown Rice formula and they LOVE it.  I still give them a good quality dry food for little snack times.  However, they usually wait for their turkey and rice and gobble it up.  They have lots of energy and for the last two months have not gotten tired of the food.  I think we have found a keeper!

review/summary: Good food but...
review/text: I do think this is a good food.  However, it is just too mushy to serve alone.  I give the feline version to my cats and they love it, but cats don't mind a softer food.  We give our little poodle canned food for the low carbs and since our cats love Newmans we thought we would try it for him.  First I got it in the big cans, which is enough for 2 days for Joey and I was OK with that.  The first can I used was OK, not great, but OK when I opened the can and gave him the top 3 ounces.  His dinner with the second 3 ounces wasn't as good.  Next day it was even mushier in the second half of the can.  I liked the food though and he did well on it so I ordered the smaller cans to see if there would be a difference there.  I used half of a can this morning for his breakfast and it was OK, but not stiff enough to make it easy for me to chop up and him to eat.  I am going to use this food as a mixer with his Tiki dog food until it is used up and then I don't think I will buy it again.  I don't get it either because it is the same 78% moisture as his California Natural and By Nature dog food but it just doesn't hold up.  I will continue to give it to my cats in their rotation, but little Joey will be sticking to his other good foods.

review/summary: My dogs love this stuff from Uruguay
review/text: OK, I admit, if this hadn't been offered during an Amazon lightning deal I would not have bought it due to the high price.  However, this morning I opened a can to use for one of my dog's medicines.  Each of our three dogs got one-third of a can.<br /><br />And oh my, all three woofed it down and waited for more.  Even the cat chimed in and wanted some.  My dogs don't get this excited over canned Pedigree, which is what I usually feed them as a supplementary food source.<br /><br />Although the pureed liver comes out of the can looking and feeling like something that comes out of the back end of a dog, it doesn't smell offensive.  I'm just not used to these more organic ingredients:  liver, beef broth, minerals and vitamins.  This is definitely something I will buy more often for special meals.<br /><br />Interestingly, this product comes from Uruguay.

review/text: I bought a case just to try out on my wiener dog, Oscar.  He has lost weight.  Now he is much more energetic and can jump higher which means he can get into more trouble.  Before going up stairs was slow and sometimes I had to wait. Now he is the first up the stairs just like the old days.  Keeping weight off of Dachshunds is very important for their back.  It costs a little more but I think I will make it up in vet bills and also have my buddy around for a longer period.<br />Doesn't have that dog food smell and you can actually see the ingredients.

review/summary: Glad we tried, has made a difference
review/text: My family rescued a pug mix from a shelter a couple months ago.  We used the puppy food they gave us and then matched the brand at our local store later.  A couple months went by, wouldn't say our dog didn't like her cheap dog food, but she did develop demodex and a whole new world about dogs and health opened up to us.  Bottom line, we were feeding her, but our vet compared it to us eating spaghettios every day for every meal for life.<br /><br />Demodex is not contagious but inherited and a skin disorder we had to treat.  We talked to our vet about her immune system and how we would want to keep her as healthy as possible during treatment and after.  While he didn't really recommend any particular brand, he did encourage us to educate ourselves about what's out there.<br /><br />After some research and with the idea that we buy Newman's Own brand foods for our human selves, we ordered the dry kibble and mixed it with the active dog and puppy formula canned food they make as well.  Our dog does love this food, and clearly prefers the canned to the her old cheap foil top square packages we'd pick up each grocery visit.  We have noticed that her fur, while always been soft, has become thick and buttery soft when you pet her.<br /><br />I know the vet warned us that the treatment might have adverse effects, but she has been fine.  I credit a healthier diet for getting her through this.  And it clearly has done wonders for her skin and coat.  Added bonus, the food actually smells good with minimal odor as opposed to the cheapy stuff which made me gaggy.

Did she wolf down the Newman's the first time I gave it to her? No.  Just like us, it took time to retrain her palate and appreciate the lack of salt and msg, artificial flavors and colors, and to relearn better eating habits.  Two years down the road, she is allergy free, healthy, energetic and has a beautiful coat.<br />Highly recommended.

I am also a firm believer in feeding the best grain free diet to my Labs, and 95% organic beef went well with that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the product is disgusting.  The consistency of what comes out of the can is disturbing.  Try to imagine dried out peanut butter that is impossible to separate or spread.  No amount of water that I added would allow me to use a fork (and knife) to try to separate the product and mix it with my dry kibble.<br /><br />Instead, I am trying the new Castor & Pollux Organix Grain Free product, and hoping for the best.<br />[...]

I didn't miss it,but Amazon has proven they are wonderful when it comes to taking care of their customers if they feel there was an error or communication problem.

review/summary: GOOD FOOD ...BAD PACKAGING
review/text: just received a case of 12 chicken & brown rice formula...every single can was dented beyond use...this was a problem before and supposedly amazon was to get their shipping problem with this item corrected...it states that this item is not returnable although damaged, i wrote to amazon requesting a return label and credit ...will see what happens...i want to return the case of food so they can see the damage, there were 4 air pillows in the box but they had holes torn in them so they were flat and just laying on top of the food...ordered this product from another website while waiting for amazon to straighten out their shipping problem, the other company sent the order UPS and the case of food was surrounded by the Styrofoam pellets and not a dent one !...UPDATE... Amazon replace order, came UPS this time instead of USPS, air pillows were again torn and flat, but only one can barely dented,...Also, i opened one of the dented cans from the first order, bad smell and food was pulled away from the sides, so take care with dented cans of dog/cat food

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: I've had a few other brownies like this...the fat-free mixes that you just add yogurt to. This is by far the best. I have to confess, though, when I made them I used plain greek yogurt which is not the same consistency as a standard vanilla yogurt, so I ended up adding just a little bit of vegetable oil. I know that ruins the fat-free part, but it was just a tinsy bit. And also, after putting the batter in the pan, I swirled in some reduced-fat peanut butter. I know, I know. More fat. But again, it wasn't that much and really added the deliciousness while not really adding too much guilt. I also used a 9" pan and only cooked them for about 15 minutes instead of 22 or whatever the directions say. They were amazing. And my hubby, who would have hated them had he known they were "reduced guilt" loved them. Haha...got him!

When I first purchased them, I wasn't aware of that or I would not have bought them. My little doggie tore her gums all up on the bone part, plus I was concerned about her biting off a big chunk. I won't buy these again for my little dog, but they may be okay for big dogs. If you want something less hard, get the other Beefeater sweet potato products. They're great!

review/summary: best of the Wabash I tried
review/text: Went to the store in downtown Lake Placid. Bought a large bag of the extra-large caramel style, the red, and the purple. My wife and I agree the purple is the best. It is more dense and not chewy at all. It has a richer flavor. The red was second place, great but just not quite as good with poor popping. The extra-large was third. The extra-large was large and popped great, but it lacked the flavor and was slightly chewy. You could see that it would be great for caramel popcorn, but not for simple butter and sea-salt popcorn like we prefer. Still, they were all good.<br /><br />The correct way to pop: High heat on canola oil in a pot. Add 3 kernels. When they pop, add rest. Cover with spatter shield, this will keep the kernels in but let the steam out.<br />Enjoy!

It is the same variety as that sold as Fireworks brand Orchard Harvest, but seems to be a bit crisper after popping and the taste is better.  It is nearly hulless, smallish kernels, good flavor.  If you prefer "Orville Redenbacher" type flavor, this may not be the popcorn for you. Pops beautifully in a hot air popper.  We'll buy this again.

review/text: It pops into large kernels, but the flavor and texture of this popcorn just isn't as good as the Baby White from Amish. If you're looking for the perfect movie theater style popcorn, get the Baby White and skip this one. However, this popcorn isn't bad and I would prefer it over the grocery store Orville crap. I didn't have many unpopped kernels but this popcorn has fairly large hulls.

review/summary: eye popping results
review/text: This is excellent popping corn with a light rich flavor, it pops well, has significantly less hulls than most other popping corns we have tried, tastes great, and holds flavorings and cheese well. The popped corn is smaller than many other brands and we like the flavor better.<br />Cons:<br />The un-popped kernels are lighter than many other popping corns, so a few more get blown out un-popped by our hot air popper... towards the end when the number of kernels remaining to be popped in the air-popper gets low. If you don't mind having a few un-popped kernels it's works just fine in the air-popper.<br />The quantity of each order is bit large - twelve pounds at a time (you get six two pound packages per order) which  makes this premium corn price very competitive with lesser popping corns (when buying through Amazon.com).<br />We find the quantity not to be problem though, as we like this corn better than other corns we have tried, so we use it up faster. Of course dried corn keeps very well, and we have found that our friends love receiving a package or two when we visit, and it also makes a great remembrance gift for soldiers overseas, or college students away from home.

review/summary: Great Vibrant Orange Flavor Tea
review/text: I've had lots of hot and iced teas, and this is one of my favorite teas.  I prefer iced tea and this is really good for iced tea.  It comes in regular tea bags, but can easily make iced tea by using a few of the bags in hot water, and then once cooled adding with 2 quarts of water.  Arizona did a great job of making a good blend.  I would also recommend trying the AriZona Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai.

review/text: This tea is so delicious. Sometimes green teas are a bit bitter or need some type of sweeting. Not sure if it is the mandarin orange or honey but this tea is naturally sweet  - but not too sweet.

review/summary: Arizona Mandarin Orange Green Tea w/Ginseng, honey,jasmine
review/text: I have tried many teas in my lifetime, but this has become my alltime favorite. This tea is great to have any time of day. I especially like it in the evening, with a snack. It's also healthy because it is a green tea. The flavor seems to be just the right amount of sweetness and tang from the honey and mandarine orange. This tea is also great because it is soothing, and doesn't keep you awake at night. Try it any time of day, you'll like it!

review/summary: good health, great taste.
review/text: They say that green tea is very good for your health.  Assuming that to be true, adding a Mandarin Orange flavor for good taste was an act of genius.  Some might want to add a bit of stevia for sweetness, particularly when making ice tea.  Bottom line, a wonderful early morning hot jolt and a delightful all day cooling refreshment.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I decided to try this tea because I like Arizona's bottled iced teas, but they have too much added sugar for me to drink very often.  I didn't expect this tea by Bigelow to taste the same.<br /><br />It doesn't, but it's still quite good, with a very powerful orange flavor.  I like it both hot and inced, unsweetened.  I'll definitely be trying their other flavors in the future.

review/summary: when you want a portion controlled sweet....
review/text: These are delicious! I've tried both the milk chocolate and dark and wouldn't turn down either one, but these are my favorite between the two.  You get a small pouch with little turtle-like candies that have a delicious gooey carmel center.  Perfectly done, well portioned and 120 calories per pack.  Is it a health food?  No, but if it is a choice between diving into a pint of ice cream or having a candy bar, this will fill you up for far fewer calories and will satisfy your sweet tooth.  My dad, who can be a bit particular tried these on my recommendation and mom now has it on the weekly shopping list.  Definitely a hit if you are looking for a small treat while you are watching that waistline!

review/summary: Tea Drinker Or Not, You Gotta Love This
review/text: Old timers scoff at the foolishness of buying brewed tea when I surely ought to be able to soak my own teabags, but I can testify that my own is never this good or this reliable or even this available. On my own I like as not grab a bottle of something less healthful before I take the time to sort out which box of bags is right for what tea. Far better is that Honest Tea -- very reasonably priced by the case in the half gallon, free shipping -- saves me from the headache of fructose and gives me a beverage I can offer (iced or heated) to a friend. And if it turns out we can't do without sweet tea after all I just dump in a dollop of agave syrup and there we all are, in smile city.

They were nicely salted, but not overly done, and they were roasted perfectly.  The color was nice and green in almost every case, and there were very few inedible ones.  These are about as high quality as any other type I've had.  I highly recommend them.
