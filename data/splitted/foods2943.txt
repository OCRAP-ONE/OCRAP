review/summary: Easiest product!
review/text: I love that I can steam, puree and reheat all in the same machine.  I also love that I don't have to keep my eye on the food that I am steaming.  I just add the water and get back to playing with my baby girl.  I couldn't be happier with this product and I think it was well worth the money!

review/summary: Insufficient blender
review/text: Got this babycook as a family gift and am very disappointed. The steamer works well, although the reports about the steaming well developing odor are scary. The blender works for about a half second until it spins freely, all the food stuck below it, not processed to where I can feed it to the baby. Maybe I'm not getting this right? I am following the instructions from the cookbook (small portions). So the rest has to be mashed with a fork and then there is still cleaning to do. I don't see how this is easier/faster than a proper blender...

review/summary: Worth it.
review/text: We've been using this product for about a month now and are very pleased not only with its performance, but the resulting foods.  We have a small apartment, and no dishwasher so even the thought of breaking out pots and pans for steaming, then the blender or food processor for blending seemed dreadful.  Especially because if we wanted to make batches of a couple of different types of food, we'd have to clean all of those big things in between each type of food!  The Babycook is nice because you steam and blend in one machine that has a very small counter footprint, and is very easy to clean.  If you want to make multiple foods in one evening, you simply rinse the basket, blending bucket and spatula b/w each food.  I should also note that my husband works full-time and I work out of the home 3-4 days a week and we still find this very convenient.  It doesn't take long at all.  Also, we definitely have not seen any of the "mold" other reviewers mention.  We've descaled with vinegar once in 4 weeks.  It isn't always possible, but I find it's best to get to the machine as soon as you can after it's finished steaming.  Then you unscrew the water reservoir's top (CAUTION: this can be very hot.  I use a dishtowel or pot holder) and let it dry out completely while it is still hot.  VERY LITTLE moisture will remain in the reservoir.  As for cost...locally our organic baby food costs about .85 a jar.  We would need to be able to make roughly 142 jars of food for this machine to pay for itself.  Each time I make food (every 2 or 3 days)I make about 8 jars.  So in about 17.5 evenings, we will cover cost.  As I mentioned earlier, we've had it for a month, so this great machine has almost already paid for itself.  Suffice it to say that if you have limited space and time, but really want to know exactly what is in your baby's food (and be able to feed them what you're having as a family, just as a puree) this machine is worth it.  Lastly, I have given this product 4 stars (instead of 5) because I have not found it super convenient for reheating - a feature that is advertised for it.  If you want to defrost or reheat something, it cannot be in a plastic container (makes sense...) it must be in glass or some polycarbonate container.  Well, everything I use for storing my son's food is plastic...and once it's frozen there's no getting it out of the plastic and into glass just to defrost it.

review/summary: I love this thing!
review/text: I love using this thing, yes it makes small batches, but 1 batch makes 12-14 ice cubes which is 12-14 ounces of baby food. Typically when babies start eating they eat 1-2 ounces a day of baby food, so 1 tray lasts 1 week or more.<br /><br />You don't need to make huge batches when they are little and when they are big you just put when you are eating in there and dice it up!<br /><br />People have mentioned issues with cleaning, but I follow the rules for cleaning and make the food with boiled water or nursery water.....and I clean it with baking soda....no mold problems what so EVER

review/summary: Customer service SUCKS!! Breaks easily!
review/text: OK, so the machine itself when we first got it was good. Then i washed it and saved it for baby number two and all went downhill. It was not even over a year before I used it again. The steam didn't steam properly and the blade got dull fast. I called customer service and got condescending answers and telling me i needed to re purchase all of the items. Then they said it should be better. I told if it doesn't will you give me my money back or may i return the items and she said no. I needed to redo it many more times and I am not doing it right. I don't get how many ways you can push a friggin switch but regardless I am going not recommending this or will I buy another one ever again.

review/summary: Makes making your own baby food easy!!!
review/text: I never write reviews, which is interesting, because I live by them when searching for quality products.  That being said, if I do write a review it is because I have extremely strong feelings about a product.  I have been making my own baby food since 2008 when my first child was born.  It really isn't that hard once you have your system.  But than a friend gave me the Beaba Babycook and it changed everything.  It takes all of the guess work out of the process, and is much easier to clean up than my previous system of using large pots and pans, a strainer and a food processor.  If you are thinking about making your own baby food for more than one child this is an investment for you, totally worth it's price.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Makes life so much easier!
review/text: Whenever I read recipes for baby food, the amount of work that goes into them--chopping, cooking, blending, pureeing, etc.--seems really daunting. So I was really happy to find the Babycook, which does everything: you just steam your fruits or veggies, dump them out of the basket into the bowl and puree them. Ridiculously easy to use. It's also very easy to clean, as the blade is detachable. I've experienced the lime buildup that other reviewers have complained about, but descaling it the night before I plan to use it keeps it perfectly clean.

Watch the mechanism for snapping bowl onto stand as the first one I purchased came cracked and probably from someone not watching as the parts line up to snap into a locked position. Worth the money as I can set it to steam and walk away-and I have twins so anything that cuts down on time is a huge plus!

review/summary: Just got my Beaba!
review/text: I have read through the entire instructions for the Beaba. It is very basic and lends to common sense.<br /><br />I was under the impression that the Beaba did the steaming and blending in a complete cycle. You have to steam, then pour the chopped food into the blending bowl. So, two separate steps for the operator.  FYI<br /><br />I would like to mention an important note, it says to NEVER place anything other than water or distilled white vinegar in the water steamer.  CLR is a chemical, please DO NOT put this in the water steamer to clean the machine. I think we are all using the Beaba to keep a very clean,  "chemical-free" diet for our babies. Why would you use a chemical in the water steamer?  To properly maintain the Beaba I would recommend leaving the lid off of the water steamer AFTER you have completed your cooking. This should ensure that no mildew or mold grows in the water steamer by completely drying out or at least by not promoting a ideal environment for growth.<br /><br />Also, the baby cook book that come with it only has 12 recipes, 3 for each stage of food for the baby. Not all that great. FYI<br /><br />I will update after frequent use (=

review/summary: Convenient, Easy to Use
review/text: I love this machine! Just reading the directions at first I was slightly intimidated, but once I actually used it, it was very straightforward. It's so easy to just throw in whatever I want to cook for the baby (usually whatever we're cooking for ourselves) into the little machine and turn it to "steam." While it's cooking, I can do whatever else I need to. After 15 minutes, when it's done, I can either just give the steamed food to the baby if it's mushy enough, or tip it over into the blender part and puree. Mold has not been an issue. Carrots did stain the cooking tray slightly. Some people have said it will be useless after the baby gets to solids, but I think it will be convenient for me to steam single-portion vegetables for myself. One flaw I'm not a fan of--it would be nice if when it was done cooking/steaming, it made some sort of "ding" or alarm sound. As it's designed now, the light just turns off.

review/summary: Awesome Product!!
review/text: Hey,<br />I'm a first time dad.  This product is GREAT!!  We could either be spending 50 cents or more for each premade baby food container from Gerber, or you can use this!  So, to list off its pros and cons:<br /><br />1.  Really easy to use.  Put some water into the steam side, put whatever you want cooked in the basket, turn it on, come back ~10-15 minutes later, chop it up in the blender side (we add more water and oatmeal at that point too), and then serve!  Start to finish is about 20 minutes tops, and only about 5 of those minutes are you actually there doing anything (the rest it's steaming so you're free to do whatever while it works).  Cleanup is very easy, just wash it out, which also just takes minutes, tops.<br /><br />2.  Cheap to use.  Fruits and veggies are cheap to buy at the store, certainly cheaper than buying pre-made baby food.  You'd be amazed how many meals one sweet potato will provide for a baby, I know I was!  Plus, you can theoretically cook anything in it for your baby, although we have yet to expand past fruits and veggies.<br /><br />3.  Expensive to buy.  On the other hand, we got this as a gift, so that wasn't a factor for us.  The little bit more effort this is over buying premade food seems like a tolerable cost to us (we both work and this seems well worth it to get her quality food we make ourselves...plus it's kind of fun, haha.)<br /><br />Ok, so that's pretty much it.  My wife and I are really happy with this product, and would totally give it to other people in the future (if we liked them enough to spend $135 on them, at least, haha!)

I cut up the veggies, put it in the steamer basket to steam cook, by the time I get out of the shower and change, the food is ready and I just puree it for 20 seconds and my daughter has fresh yummy veggies for the day!  It  is super  healthy  for her and she LOVES it!

review/summary: not really worth it.
review/text: this product is o.k. but i think you can get away w/out it and be fine ...not really worth the money. CONS: it only makes a very small amount of food at once. if I am going through the trouble, i'd rather make a bigger batch and freeze it. Also, the lid on the resevoir gets so hot and is shaped oddly so that it is difficult to get a grip of it to take off. a serious caution, the booklet i got w/ mine (purchased in 2008) has recipes that include foods that you are not supposed to give to babies under a year old!!!!!finally, the blend mode does not have an optional 'stay on' so that if you want to puree something, you need to stand there and hold the button. you can't do something else while it's blending b/c you need to be right there to keep it running. PROS: technically, it does what it says it does, and it is easy to clean. I find that even though i own this, i tend to use my good old pan w/ a steamer basket and then puree in my food processor. works just as well, saves time, and makes more at once.

review/summary: Amazing Baby Cook
review/text: This product is simply amazing. Steams fruits and veggies perfectly and the food processor is phenomenal. Very easy to use and even easier to clean. I truly enjoy making my baby's food. One tip I have found is to remove the water left after steaming into a glass cup and slowly add it back to the bowl while processing. The lid must be on to blend the food, so it will take you a few times to remove the lid to add the water; however, you can control the consistency of the food this way. Mommy and baby are really happy with this purchase. :)

review/summary: Great for fresh cooking not for freezer user
review/text: If you are like me and you don't like to freeze food, the babycook is just great.<br />I cook every night for my daughter (she is 10 Mo) some vegetables (swiss chard, leaks, brocollis, sweet peas, squash, carrots, spinach,....), meat (mostly chicken with lemon and thym and then I mix it with yoghourt).<br />The cleaning is easy.<br />Though when I cook apple sauce I usually use a larger pan, as I cook a very large protion of it. Still she doesn't eat the vegetables if it is not freshly cooked.<br /><br />If you want to cook large portion and freeze them this is certainly not what you are looking for.

I don't have a lot of freezer space and I like to offer my daughter a variety of foods, so, making a pound of sweet potatos at one time would do me no good. I rather prepare a few carrots, a few apples and oranges, and other small recipes, than have a whole lot of one thing. It's easy to clean and saves you time on having to clean out a steamer, and processor. I LOVE IT! ALSO, IT IS BPA-FREE!!

review/summary: This thing is the greatest
review/text: I made my 1st child's food using a pot of boiling water and steam basket, then transferring it to a bowl and using a kitchen aid hand blender. It was such a chore and so much clean up. I always felt I had to do 10 pounds of carrots to make it worth my time thus making it an even bigger chore and there'd be a few chunks I just couldn't get. Then of course freezing in ice cube trays and all that hassle. Plus when boiling water on the stove, I occasionally would forget about it and burn my pot. Now that I have a toddler and 6 month old and working full-time, I was tempted by the baby bullet commercials, did some research and decided to try the Beaba instead.<br /><br />I LOVE IT!!! It's no longer stressful and a huge chore. I can easily throw in a couple carrots while I'm cooking dinner for everyone else and now there's dinner for all. The food comes out so smooth. I don't have to pay attention to water boiling on the stove. I can just let it steam and it turns itself off when ready and then I can puree when I'm ready. Clean up is as easy as top rack dishwasher. I leave the lid off the water container when I'm done as I read the reviews on mold, so I've had no problems there. If you question whether to spend the money, I would say it is totally worth it. It pays for itself in a couple weeks/vs buying baby food especially if you have a big eater like I do. Highly recommend this thing.

review/summary: Want to love it more but there are issues
review/text: Intended to make baby's food, thought I would just use my steamer basket and food processor but got this for Xmas and use it daily. I've steamed and pureed fruit, veg, meat, fish, grain and used it to reheat. I like that you just set it to steam and walk away (you have a baby after all). It's generally easy to use and clean. Complaints about big batches are funny because I can't do SMALL enough batches! I like to make just one or two servings to eat that day. I don't want to serve frozen food all the time or the same food day after day. Babycook does not blend small batches, I have to mash by hand! This is exactly what such a tiny appliance should do!<br /><br />There are also design issues, not how it looks (it is cute) but how it works (it is finicky). The spatula and mixing lid are awkward extra pieces to keep track of and clean. The mixing lid is useless. When removing the lid to stir there are two messy lids to remove, set down on the counter and clean, etc. It works just fine without it. The spatula is not great at scraping the bowl and if it is only intended to lift a hot basket, this could be solved more intelligently. Teardrop lid handles are slippery and difficult to grasp. Blades are not easily removable.

review/text: I got the Beaba Babycook last week for my 5 month old baby.  It worked GREAT!!  I read many mixed reviews here in Amazon but was willing to take the chance so I can make homemade food for my baby.  I used apple as the first start and it turned out to be so tasty.  Since I just started introducing her solid food so I ended up finishing the rest of the batch myself.  It took a little time to figure out how to use it first as the instruction is not very clear.  Anyway, after you have figured how this product works, it does a great job!  I used a medium size apple and it could make about 3 servings.  It is so compact that it takes so little of counter space.  I love it and I am so glad I brought it.

review/summary: Very disappointing
review/text: I was very excited about this product when I bought it - the idea of steaming and blending the food in one gadget seemed like a big time saver. However, it's not nearly as much of a time saver as it seems. The bowl is tiny, so to make enough food for just 2 days or so, I had to fill the bowl at least twice to steam the veggies(and that's about 10-15 min of steaming each time). An average-sized cauliflower took me 3 steaming session to get through, so that's almost an hour of steaming. Then the blending... unfortunately, this product is not nearly powerful enough to blend veggies quickly. Even with adding a lot of water, the food seems to get stuck and the blades are just blending what's on the bottom of the bowl and not moving the food around at all. You also can't move the food around without taking apart the whole contraption - likely because of it's baby-proof design. Several times already I ended up pulling out a regular blended and transferring the veggies to finish blending them. I've now given up on this disappointing product and will have to return it. I'm hoping that a regular-sized food processor and a steamer will do the trick in a lot less time and with much less effort.

Then, about a month ago I noticed that when I steamed the food there would be a puddle of water that formed underneath the mixer on the counter.  This worried me a bit because I'm not a huge fan of electrical appliances sitting in puddles of water!  I tried to tighten the blade so that it wouldn't leak, but no use.  I contacted the company, and they told me I needed a new rubber gasket which forms the seal around the blade hole.  I ordered one, and after I replaced the old gasket it worked fine for one steam, but then the very next time I used it the thing leaked again!  I ordered a five pack of the rubber gaskets, thinking that if I'm going to continue to use this thing I'll have to replace the gasket every time (absurd, but I really liked the product).  Well, I put in a new gasket, and it STILL leaked!  So now I'm left with a package of gaskets and a leaky baby food maker.  I'm going to attempt to contact the company, but I don't have high hopes for a refund or replacement.

review/summary: Recipients Were Very Pleased
review/text: I cannot personally attest to the performance of the food maker.  I can only attest to the enthusiasm of my daughter and daughter-in-law when both received them as a gift from me.  They report big buck savings on feeding their three daughters (a twin and a single born within 5 days...yes, to different families).  They find the Beaba easy to use and most importantly, their daughters seem to be thriving on their food.  Happily, I have been left out of the prep of food, but take great pleasure in playing with and even feeding the girls.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to make food for their baby. Well worth the investment for any child.

review/summary: Sparx have saved my teeth.
review/text: Sparx is a mild fruity mint that has a nice taste. After Radiation treatment for cancer I relied on Sparx to keep my mouth moist. Because I had chronic dry mouth I used Sparx under my tongue to stimulating my sublingual saliva gland. This was the only one not destroyed by radiation. With sparx I also got the benefit of Xylitol which is used for sweetening the mint. Xylitol is proven to have as good or better benefit for preventing cavities than floride. Dry mouth makes it more likely that you will have dental problems. Sparx has helped me with my dental care and it definitly works.

review/summary: The best Japanese milk candies; taste like sweetened condensed milk!
review/text: I fell in love with these delicious little hard candies after a trip to a small Japanese import store. If you've ever enjoyed tres leches cake, eaten a spoonful of sweetened condensed milk straight from the can, or delighted in the taste of dulce de leche, then you will likely adore these candies as well.<br /><br />About the size of a small marble, these cream-colored hard candies melt slowly into a rich, sweet milky flavor that manages to avoid being too cloyingly sweet. If you're the kind to crunch your candies, these will offer a pleasant resistance and crack/crunch satisfyingly under your teeth. The flavor is superb; I prefer to savor mine slowly, sometimes enjoying one along with a rich cup of dark coffee to enhance the sweet milky taste.<br /><br />Unlike any candy flavor found in traditional US markets, Japanese milk candies are a special treat. These Mikakuto Tokuno UHA 8.2 milk candies are the cream of the crop--the best of the best! You'll definitely want to purchase these in bulk.

review/summary: love wellness
review/text: When we were waiting for our Mini-dashund to be old enough to come home I did a lot of research on foods and things for him. The breeder had him on a food called Life Abundance- which though better than grocery, I wasnt impressed. That and the fact it's 20 bucks plus shipping for an 8 lb bag and it shipped. I call it the Avon of dog food. Good stuff but I can find it cheaper at the store. I went with Welnees small breed puppy, its ingredient list is really good. At first Fenways stools where soft but as we went through our first bag and transitioned completely into the new food, it was the breeder food casuing the diarhea. I will keep him on Wellness despite the price, though I am going to try the regular Just for Puppy. According to the bag's ingredience the only real different is the size of the kibble and I read reviews that someone was feeding it to a morkie so I imagine its not going to be an issue for my 4.2 lb pup.

I usually have a bunch of other groceries to carry and this is one less trip. Bottom line I love it for the convience.<br />I have raised my chihuahuas on this and they are healthy and full of energy and like it. I have researched the product and know I'm feeding my dogs one of the highest quality foods.<br />My pitbull eats the senior and he loves to scarf the puppy food when I'm not paying attention.<br />They all love the wet food too.

review/summary: Marginally Chocolate Ginger
review/text: While technically, the Product description is accurate, the Product picture is unfortunately very misleading.  As one reviewer noted, the pieces are tiny and the picture seems to imply pieces about the size of standard Bridge Mix.  This is NOT the case.  The pieces are barely large enough to contain any identifiable pieces of Ginger, but the chocolate coating is very tasty.  Unfortunately, I would have preferred to have real pieces of ginger inside the chocolate.  If you are familiar with the size of chocolate covered raisins, most of the pieces of this product are half that size or smaller.  You can taste the ginger in the larger pieces, but you might as well classify this product as Ginger flavored Dark Chocolate.  I can't fault the dark chocolate taste at all, but if you are expecting to bite into a piece of ginger inside, forget it.  In the future I will have to stick with the more expensive British Chocolate covered Ginger where you get about 24 pieces per box.

review/text: I shop for groceries at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and they have a good selection of gourmet items that I like to try from to time. One was La Panzanella Croccantini. The name sounds like something that would be an italian import, but they are made in Tukwila, WA. Well, in any case, they're a really good large cracker or hard-bread. I tried the rosemary variety first and just loved it. The items were so good, in fact, that the next time I went back I picked up a 5.5-ounce box of the Original Croccantini. Well, it's equally good. What can I say? These are the best crackers I can ever recall eating. They're lightly salted with sea-salt crystals. Does that do it? I have a slight preference for the Rosemary ones, but these are just excellent too. Use them with anything you might use a cracker with. The only difference is that these are much better.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I have bad reflux and have been on PPI's for years.  It's to the point that I can't take even a sip of anything acidic, yet it was difficult for me to give up morning coffee.  I tried this totally on a whim, and didn't have high expectations for it, but now I'm totally hooked.  It is not TEA.  It makes a dark cup, identical to coffee.  It's delicious with a coffee creamer.  It's 18 calories per cup because there is carob in it (which also gives it some substance and a slight choco flavor).  It is truly non-acidic and non-caffeine (no problem lying down and sleeping after drinking).

review/summary: Love Teeccino... the perfect way to start your morning, have an afternoon delight, or end a meal.
review/text: My husband and I have become huge fans of this during the past year. For my husband, it was love at first sip. For me, although I really enjoyed it and would drink it here and there years ago when I first stumbled upon it, it wasn't (at the time) the perfect coffee replacement to me. Then again, I was such a hard core coffee lover, I didn't think anything would ever compare to the real thing. That being said, here I am, loving Teeccino - big time! I can't imagine not having it. In fact, I don't know what I was thinking years ago by not thinking this was an awesome coffee replacement. Not only does it taste great, but it's not acidic and safe for pregnancy and breastfeeding. It's high in potassium, helps restore alkalinity, and the chicory root can help improve digestion. We enjoy all of the varieties and flavors, and lately I'm loving the chocolate one big time. The tee-bags rock, too! I can take them with me to Starbucks or restaurants when we're out and just order a cup of hot water.<br /><br />We love it plain (black), and we also enjoy it with Raw nut milk or other non-dairy milk for a nice creamy experience. Teeccino is much better for your health than regular (or decaf) coffee, and can help transition you away from coffee. I've even brewed coffee mixed with Teeccino for some of my coffee addict friends to reduce the caffeine and help them transition. They love it.

review/text: Many of my friends love this, which is lucky for me because I foolishly ordered the 6 pack. The price was so much better buying 6 and I was sure I'd love anything chocolate (I always have). The 3 star rating is because of the friends who like it--for me it would have been a 1 because I really don't enjoy the taste of carob and that's what I smell and taste in this drink. I didn't want to say anything negative about this, it's a fine product as long as you like carob, but thought it would be a good idea to warn people in case you're thinking of ordering 6 of them and you don't care for carob.

review/summary: Can't have caffeine, but love a good hot drink
review/text: What's better than a good hot drink that tastes like a chocolate coffee but is not fattening like old-fashioned hot chocolate?  I like coffee, but get tired of decaf.  My body cannot tolerate caffeinated drinks.  I've tasted countless decaf blends of both teas and coffees.  Teeccino has several flavors that can purchased in the form of grounds for the coffee-maker or packaged in tea bags. Read the label (product specs) for the exact ingredients, because it is too redundant to go into here.  The unique ingredients are actually soothing to the tummy.  The tea bags are very convenient, but I would like them better if they were round instead of square.  Round bags "dip" better than square because the square ones tend to cause the liquid to run over the edge of the cup.  However, this is minor and the flavor of the chocolate Teeccino "coffee" is definitely worth the little dribble (just put the cup on a paper towel).  I put a tea bag in a mug of water and pop it into the microwave for about 1-1/2 minutes.  Remove the bag fairly quickly because it steeps really fast for a robust flavor, and you can reuse the bag at least two more times!  The local health food store cannot keep this product in stock, so that is why I buy it on-line (in bulk).  To sweeten the drink, stir in a single-serve packet of NuStevia (80mg Stevia Leaf) and add a spritz of whipped cream on top.

review/summary: These lemon drops pack a powerful punch
review/text: probably the strongest lemon flavored candy I have ever come across.  The initial lemony flavor really makes your mouth pucker, but after a minute or so you reach the middle which has a complement sweetness making this can be one of the best I've ever had.  I tried lemon drops, but nothing compares to this one.  I am on my second box and I'm sure before the year is through I'll probably order several more.  I haven't been able to find this anywhere else except on Amazon which goes to show that you can pretty much find anything on this website.  You get 6 packs per box, and I just opened a new pack and counted (for the sake of accuracy). There are 22 individually wrapped candies in the pack, for $15.  I would consider this a pretty good deal considering the novelty of this candy, it is made and distributed from Japan so it would be pretty hard to find somewhere else for less, and the candy is the best lemon drop I've ever had.  So if you like lemon candy you might want to try this one out.  I would highly recommend.

review/text: I first ate this many years ago as a teen. It was the best sour candy I had ever had. By far better than the sour candy out there today. I bought some for my son for Xmas and he loves them. He has since passed them all out to his friends and now I'm on a new batch for him. You won't regret purchasing this candy.By the way, you don't want to eat the whole bag.It's not good for your tongue!LOL! And be prepared to watch people pucker and cry!

review/text: I have to say that The Super Lemon Candy is the best hard candy around. It brings back memories of elementary school when I first ate this candy. I love it where the candy is a little sour at first and after a few seconds of sucking and licking it becomes nice and sweet with a strong lemony flavor. You must try them, there will be no regrets.

review/summary: SOLID GOLD NUTRITION with MASS MARKET PRICE
review/text: If you are looking for taste, nutrition and low carbs/calories, this beverage is for you. Add to that, low sodium in this particular variation, and you have a drink we should all be drinking. I was always a bit reluctant to indulge in this yummy veg-fest because of the huge amount of added sodium, but now the low-sodium product has become much more available and costs only 30% more than the original high-sodium version. Typically, this low-sodium, mixed 100% vegetable juice is the type of drink that sells for $2-4 at a juice bar per 8-ounce serving or about $8-$10 per quart from a health food store in bottles. WHY?<br /><br />There are more than 8 reasons WHY V8 is so special -- Tomatoes, Beets, Celery, Carrots, Lettuce, Parsley, Watercress and Spinach are the first eight. Low carbs/calories and no added sugar are the 9th and 10th reasons. Low sodium and the resulting favorable potassium/sodium ratio give this particular version an 11th reason to become a truly 5-star product. Also, the 17 mg. of naturally-occurring lycopene in an 8-ounce serving is more than the average amount that you would find in single nutrient lycopene supplements which cost an average of 16 cents per pill and which are less bio-available than the naturally-occurring lycopene in the V8 juice.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are not allergic to the ingredients [e.g., tomato allergy], this is the most practical and convenient way to add a very healthy serving of mixed vegetables to your diet. Your body will thank you.

I didn't realize having 75% less sodium in the bottle would make such a huge impact on flavor but it sure does.  Both my husband and I bought a huge bottle and after two glasses cannot stand the flavor.  We're likely going to toss the rest down the drain, what a waste!

review/summary: Our Son Loves Them, Very Convenient
review/text: We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the mish mash out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added. He'll eat the sweet potato and other veggie pouches when he is more hungry, but probably because of the sweetness of fruit, he far prefers the fruit mish mashes to the veggie ones. For smaller children, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3 oz size rather than the bigger one like this (4 oz) because it assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. They only keep for 24 hours after opening and need to be refrigerated if not eaten, but then he doesn't like them cold, so they have to be warmed up a bit in warm water to reuse, so a bit of a hassle. You can also take the 3 oz size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger 4 oz pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store.

review/summary: Only Plum Organics with Vegetable as First Ingredient
review/text: I wish we had never fed these pouches to my daughter.  She prefers these over anything I make because she loves to hold the pouch and suck it down.  She is drinking calories and in my mind this is tantamount to getting her hooked on juices.  Just a warning if you're a first time buyer. Like other reviewers for Plum Organics, I find it misleading that the product name always mentions the vegetables first, when fruit is almost always the first ingredient.  I do not consider most of these pouches a health food whatsoever. However, I will buy this particular flavor because sweet potatoes are the first ingredient.

review/text: Before buying a case of these through Amazon, I bought one pouch at my local Target. Thank goodness I did! This sweet potato, corn, and apple flavor is absolutely disgusting! The ingredients list states lemon juice as the last ingredient. When I tasted it, it seemed like it was the main ingredient. No wonder my son made the most disapproving look after one spoonful, which prompted me to try it for myself. I usually like most of the flavors in the Plum Organics line, but this one is extremely sour (as one reviewer noted on Feb 11, 2011). There is no trace of sweet potato, corn, and apple flavors. It should be called Plum Organics Lemon.

review/text: You know that commercial, "What would you do for a Klondite bar"?  Well, my kid would do ANYTHING for a these things that we call "pouch."  I have him "earn" pouches by doing helpful things around the house, following directions, being safe in the car.  It just works like a dream!  I put it in front of him (he can't take off the cap on his own) and say, "When you finish your dinner, you can have this for dessert," and he gobbles everything up.  The funny this is, is that I usually give him the SPINACH pouch!  Ha ha!  So he eats his veggies and then gets a pouch of spinach!  Oh, boy, it's great!<br /><br />I wish I could reuse them though, even if I bought more product, because I feel a little guilty throwing them in the trash (I'm one of the people who compost and recycle).<br /><br />But these are great for the car and the plane because they don't need refrigeration.  Going through the security on the plane, you need your kid with you or they won't let you take them.  My husband met up with us at the airport and I packed a whole bunch of pouches in his bag.  When he went through security, they said, "Where's the baby?" and when he explained that our son was with me, waiting at the gate, they said it was a no-go and had him chuck the whole thing.  :(  But aside from that, this is a great product, a great invention.<br /><br />Imagine, getting your kid to eat his veggies so that he can eagerly have a spinach pouch!  :D

I thought, how could sweet potato, corn and apple be bad?!  Well folks, I am here to tell you...it's BAD.  I am slowly getting rid of it by adding a dollop of it into something else...masking it with vanilla yogurt and cereal, applesauce, etc.  It makes everything taste very sour, so the yogurt kind of neutralizes that.

review/summary: Amazon comes through with the best price...againl
review/text: It is hard to find organic canola oil at a regular store.  The specialty stores have it but the prices are really high and the bottles small.  LaTourangelle has a nice line of oils from Europe but they are generally quite expensive.  Amazon once again comes through with a fantastic price.  I usually buy three or four packs or however many Amazon has "in stock" so I don't run out.  The cans are pretty enough to leave on my counter (one at a time) and while at 16.9 ounces they aren't large, the size is consistent with other brands of organic oils and getting three, or nine or twelve cans at once is very convenient for me. I've been using LaTourangelle exclusively for almost two years.  I periodically check locally for less expensive organic oil but I've never found any store who can beat Amazon's price.

review/summary: great oil
review/text: I love this oil so much, I now have it on my subscribe option. I go through about 1 can a month. It is canola, which is a superb cooking oil, the only problem is that most canola oil is GMO and chemical expressed. NOT THIS ONE! I highly recommend, everything a low flavor, high heat oil should be.

review/summary: Good oil but the price has skyrocketed
review/text: This is a great oil for cooking and baking, and I even like the tins (I use a can opener to remove the top after they're empty and use them for cute storage).  That said, I get this through subscribe and save and the price DOUBLED since my last shipment one month ago.  It was around $9 per 3 pack (an excellent deal!) and now it's around $18. These are rather small containers so that puts them out of my price range.<br /><br />There seems to be a pattern on Amazon that as soon as something is well rated, the price goes up substantially. Ironically, I switched to this oil because my last regular subscribe and save organic oil (Zoe organic olive oil) jumped way up in price so I went looking for another good one.<br /><br />I guess I'm off to find yet another organic cooking oil that won't break the bank...

review/summary: Classic kitchen staple
review/text: From pancakes to pies Bisquick makes baking easier as the hard work is pretty well done. Bisquick is a baking mix that has flour, shortening and leavening already mixed up and ready-to-go for making biscuits or pancakes. In fact, if you read the history of Betty Crocker, and General Mills, you will discover Bisquick was developed after a company employee enjoyed hot biscuits while traveling on the train. The employee wondered how the train's cook was able to bake up the biscuits so quickly. The cook showed the General Mills employee his pre-made biscuit mix. Bisquick was created after the General Mills employee returned from his trip.<br /><br />Today, you can use Bisquick to make pancakes, waffles, muffins, quick breads, cookies and Impossibly Easy Pies. It is a true workhorse in the kitchen.<br /><br />Books you can read about General Mills and Bisquick include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0816650187">Finding Betty Crocker: The Secret Life of America's First Lady of Food (Fesler-Lampert Minnesota Heritage)</a>; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605298166">Betty Crocker Ultimate Bisquick Cookbook Exclusive Deluxe Edition 323 Delicious recipes for breakfast, dinner, dessert & more!</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470916575">Bisquick to the Rescue: More than 100 Emergency Meals to save the day!</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764559176">Betty Crocker Bisquick Impossibly Easy Pies: Pies that Magically Bake Their Own Crust</a>.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: One of the Best milk chocolate bars with almonds....
review/text: Have no clue how old that bar of chocolate was the person who gave this bar 1 star got or what kind of radical temperature changes it went through to make it grainy because Green and Black's milk chocolate bar with almonds is one the best, creamiest, smoothest, richest chocolate bars I have ever eaten.  Not only is the flavor and texture of the bar outstanding but the amount of whole roasted almonds they pack into this bar make it a cut above the rest. It is a perfect balance of milk chocolate and nuts. I have in fact brought my mother over to the dark side.  She would normally prefer popcorn or an apple over a candy bar until she tried this. Pricey but in this instance  you get what you pay for and if you eat it slowly you will enjoy every bite.

review/summary: One of the better almond bars
review/text: Most other almond bars disappoint me because there are barely any almonds in it.  Boy is this different!  Each bar is loaded with whole almonds so very nearly every bite is a nice combination of chocolate and almond.  As far as the chocolate part goes; yeah, I agree with most other reviewers, it sure beats Hershey's.

review/summary: Great Flavor - Great Value
review/text: This Green&Black's Organic Milk Chocolate Bar with Almonds has to be the very best milk chocolate bar I've ever eaten. I had to quit eating the other "British" milk chocolate bar from the big box store because it was causing me indigestion - I don't know what ingredient caused the indigestion but after learning that this "British" product is made by a U.S. company I figured I could take my pick of substandard ingredients. This Green&Black's Organic Milk Chocolate Bar with Almonds, on the other hand, causes no indigestion and is in every other way simply sublime.<br /><br />Why is this bar a great value? Because I can eat one or two SQUARES of this bar and get more satisfaction than eating an entitre BAR from one of the cheaply made bars. This is the good stuff, my friends. Fair trade is just an added bonus.

review/summary: Totally addictive
review/text: I almost do not want to purchase Green and Black chocolate as I cannot stop at one piece but devour the entire bar.  ALL their chocolate has this effect on me but particularly this almond one as the almonds are whole, not pieces, and the chocolate is SO SMOOTH that it truly melts in your mouth.  I consider it health food as it has almonds, right.

review/text: I first got a hold on this chocolate while living in England.  I can't stand the sickly sweet bars of other companies. This hit the nail on the head.  Such a lovely combination of chocolate and nuts, and now, I finally found it at Wal-Mart.  I could not be happier. I don't eat it because it is organic; I eat it because it is FANTASTIC!!

review/summary: The BEST
review/text: Be forewarned:  These are the best chocolate bars I have ever tasted.  I don't say that lightly.  Amazing, creamy, totally, absolutely addicting.  I have had a good amount of experience with high end chocolate.  This is the best.  I am hooked.  Hopelessly hooked.  Sadly, i buy them in bulk and hide them from my children and husband.  Well, sadly for them.

review/text: This is the absolute best milk chocolate bar with almonds. It is not too sweet. Has a wonderful rich chocolate flavor and WHOLE ALMONDS and lots and lots of them. Almonds in every bite.  In 2011 this is almost unheard of.  I will never waste my time, money, calories, fat, sweets on any other chocolate candy ever !!!!! THE BEST !

review/text: I've always enjoyed Hershey's Chocolate Almond bars, but found this and tried it.  It was really delicious--smooth, creamy taste, and none of the "raw throat" effect I've had after eating a Hershey bar (whatever that is!).  This is my new, favorite chocolate bar.

review/text: This is my treat after dinner along with some red wine.  I wish it wasn't so spendy but I guess that's the price you pay for quality chocolate.  I can't eat the waxy Hershey's type after this.  Love the almonds, they don't skimp on them.  Hee, gotta laugh at the guy that uses his review as a slam to our President.  I'm thinking buying it at this 10 pack price with free shipping is a better deal than the health food section of my grocery store.  I will have to confirm.  I'm glad I checked out Amazon to see if they carry it.

review/summary: Not so sweet that it makes your throat burn...
review/text: I enjoy chocolate like wine, coffee, salt.  Many types, each with their own nuances and distinctions...this milk chocolate has a pleasant "tang" to it that prevents it from being too sickeningly sweet, like 99% of the milk chocolate out there.  Very balanced, fruity, and tasty.
