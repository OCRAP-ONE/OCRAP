review/summary: My daily driver
review/text: This was the first coffee I tried on a Keurig.  At first I wasn't a fan.  Then I tweaked the cup size a bit and found a nice blend.  I personally like this on the 10oz setting.  This gives the best balance of flavor and fullness.  The key here is this is a medium roast, even though it is listed as 'bold', it is more of a medium through and through.<br /><br />The flavors are good.  There is a nice tail on this one.  It is a tiny bit on what I consider to be the tart side.  Not necessarily bitter though.  However, I am the only one in my family still drinking this one.  They've all moved on to the dark roast all the time.  For me, I like slightly less strength for my first cup of the day.  Yes, I do drink 3 cups a day... So there is still plenty of time for the stronger cups later on.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o flavor<br />o smooth tail<br />o great for 10oz or less<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit on the tart side<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this coffee for smaller cup sizes.

review/summary: Fantastic tea, fabulous flavor
review/text: I had a small tin of this tea at home and one day, when my husband was sick, I made it for him.  He was so in love with it that I had to purchase it right away as our tin was running low.<br /><br />This is a black tea, with caffeine.  It has a gentle honey flavor to it, with an aroma (more than a flavor) of vanilla.  It's most certainly smooth with no bitterness.  There's a freshness to the flavor from the bergamot, which is very, very light.  All together, it's a really wonderful cup of tea.

review/text: This is not tea. This is a package of lingerie sachets with tea written on the tag. It tastes and smells like you are drinking your mother's pantyhose drawer.<br /><br />I suspect this tea originated in "Hitchiker's Guide", as it tastes almost, but not exactly, completely unlike tea.<br /><br />The tin is very nice. But if you're buying anything other than the tin for this price, I recommend this tea to habitual medicinal herb "tea" drinkers only.<br /><br />I would give this product zero stars if I could, because I really expect much better from Harney & Sons.<br /><br />Right. Sticking with the Frisian Blend in the black square tin. If it ever comes back in.....

review/text: I looked at the size of this item and realized that this is the 1.75 oz box. I thought it was a mistake, but, no - this is really that tiny little box with abut 4 pieces of candy  that sells for a dollar or less at most stores. So if you ordered this item it would cost you $13 with the shipping, at a time when most stores sell the 10-12 oz box for $5. What's more, although this box is less than 2oz in weight, the seller is charging 6 dollars to ship it! I cannot understand why  Amazon is allowing this merchant to get away with such fraud.

It is absolutely divine.  I found the restaurant's recipe on Google and have made my own pasta several times - but it is HOURS of work.  So, one day I found that Ciao Imports actually has this very special filled pasta made in Italy and can send it flash frozen.  Well, I tried it and it is amazing.  It is as good (or better!) than my own!

review/text: Following the directions out of the box, the mix worked "okay".<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Top quality ingredients.<br />- Whole family ate until we couldn't eat any more. Still that always happens with pancakes and waffles. Strange.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- With no oil content, I had to follow the suggestion of adding a small amount of oil to each batch to prevent sticking. Even with this and a well-oiled Waring Pro, it still stuck. Not sure if this is strictly speaking the mixes fault though, lol.<br />- The real issue is that this is an overly sweet mix. I would suggest buying one with less sugar and just adding additional sweetening if you need it. Try their multigrain component.<br />- Building into the "pro" that they use high quality ingredients, I think they could have just gone the extra little bit and made this organic. Why not?<br /><br />Conclusion: Good USA brand. Try the multigrain. Suggestion to brand: go organic.

review/summary: Deliciously Healthy
review/text: This thick, rich chocolate syrup is so delicious and satisfying.  I have been dieting for a month and have lost 21 pounds.  I am basically following a low glycemic diet and having this chocolate treat has been wonderful!  Just a spoonfull right out of the jar is such a treat.  It is also very good drizzled over strawberries or other fruit and I also mix it into my 8 year old son's milk for a wonderfully healthy chocolate milk.  It takes longer to stir into cold milk than the other syrups made for cold milk, but it does slowly dissolve and my son loves that some sticks to the spoon and he gets to lick the spoon after he drinks his milk!  Haven't tried it in warm milk yet, but I know it will make amazing hot chocolate as well.  Can't say enough good about this Chocagave!

review/summary: Unfortunately too good to be true...
review/text: I bought Chocagave based on the rave reviews and "healthy" claims (based on being organic, raw, and using "natural" sweetener). It really is very tasty as a chocolate syrup and excellent for making hot chocolate. It's fairly liquid, so drizzles well on top on dessert, while not being watery (for example, I think Hershey's syrup seems runny as well as tasting yucky).<br /><br />The unfortunate part comes in the "natural" raw agave syrup used in this chocolate. Yes, I'm sure it's organic and raw like the maker claims BUT I've recently started reading about how UNNATURAL agave nectar really is. Agave is apparently a created sweetener concocted sometime in the 1990s by manufacturers using the same process as high fructose corn syrup, except with the starchy part of the agave plant rather than corn. As a result, agave nectar is made up of same unhealthy fructose (a higher percentage than high fructose corn syrup) that experts claim increases obesity, insulin resistance, etc, etc. (You've probably heard the arguments if you're looking for more natural sweeteners because you do believe high fructose corn syrup is bad).<br /><br />So, fructose might be a low glycemic sweetener, but I'm disappointed that the healthier alternative chocolate syrup that I bought isn't as healthy as I thought it would be. Sure, it's chocolate dessert and should be used in moderation but I was not aware that agave syrup being a "natural" alternative is mostly hype.<br /><br />Know what you're buying and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH on whether this is a good choice for you. It might be great for a diabetic without any other good options (since I think fake sweeteners taste funny and are probably even unhealthier). For me, I don't think it's really worth the additional expense to buy something I know isn't necessarily any healthier than organic chocolate with real sugar.

review/text: Perfect replacement for hot fudge topping. Deep, intense, rich semi-sweet chocolate flavor.  Only 70 calories for two tablespoon serving.  You don't really need two full tablespoons though.  I like this better than hot fudge.<br /><br />Low glycemic and only 5 calories from fat and 5 mg of sodium.  Maintains it's nice consistency when refrigeration.<br /><br />Got a sweet craving?  Just 1 teaspoon straight out of the jar will satisfy you!

review/summary: Wonderful Chocolate Agave!
review/text: This Raw Cacao Chocagave Dessert Syrup is fantastic! I am a diabetic and this little jar of chocolate goodness has really helped to curb my unfortunate sweet tooth. When the urge is upon me I simply scoop out some on a spoon, and enjoy. I also spread it on various crackers and fruit.<br /><br />You are buying three jars (unless Amazon changes it). Each jar has eleven ounces of Chocagave. A serving of two tablespoons has 70 calories, and if you eat the whole jar at once (which I don't advise, but can understand) you will have consumed 770 calories. Minimal fat (0.5 grams per serving) and very low sodium (5 mg per serving).<br /><br />The Amazon deal is great: indeed, when I went to the manufacturers website I found that they actually were charging more per bottle (plus shipping!) than Amazon. My wife and I liked the first three bottles so much we quickly ordered two more sets of three.<br /><br />I have not tried Chocoagave in cooking. There is another agave syrup on market, also with cocoa, that is excellent for cooking purposes (search on Amazon for chocolate agave and you will find it, and see my review; note that I buy this other product from a health food store, since Amazon itself does not sell it, to date).<br /><br />I have been using Agave syrup for several years due to its low glycemic value and great taste. Now, with Chocoagave, it is even better.

For those times when you need garlic salt, the garlic component of this salt is so much more intense that any other garlic salt or powder I've ever tried, there's really no contest. I assume Sylvia's Garlic Powder is equally awesome.  I'm never without fresh garlic, but there are occasions where garlic salt or garlic powder is appropriate, and this one can't be beat.

review/summary: Pretty Good Puer Tea
review/text: This is a pretty good puerh tea.  I think the price is a bit high though.  The packaging is very wastefull.  It has a double lid like Rishi teas except the lid drops a little deaper in the canister & sometimes the little tab hurts my fingers.  The tins are not filled to the top either.  Rishi fills them all the way up.<br /><br />There are other Puerh teas that I think are better like a lot of the big cake styles.  I don't know why but almost every puerh I've had in the big cake has been amazing!  And more expensive...<br /><br />These come wrapped as little tuocha's which means bowl.  They are compressed like little itty bitty cakes.  You unwrap it & toss it in your infuser to brew like any other tea except you brew it a bit longer & you don't have to measure it out because it's not loose.<br /><br />This is a very dark tea.  Probably the darkest.  Like coffee.  When you have it with cream it looks just like coffee.  It stands up to cream very well.  I like to add honey & cream.<br /><br />Puerh tea is a fermented black tea.  It is allowed to "compost" a bit or a very long bit.  The older it is, the more expensive it is.  Kind of like wine.<br /><br />I have been hearing more news about puerh lately.  Some articles claim it is the healthiest of all the teas.  Who knows?  I drink all varieties of tea, but when it comes to a hot cuppa I only drink puerh & have been doing so for years now.  I was totally hooked on my first sip!  I don't think anything can compare.<br /><br />Be warned I have noticed some people seem to almost violently hate this tea while others love it to pieces.  I have rarely met someone who is on middle ground with it.  I think it's one of those love it or hate it situations.

review/summary: A nice entry-level pu-er
review/text: I've been drinking this pu-er for a while now. It's not as intense as some other pu-ers (definitely fermented, but it doesn't have the fishy/compost overtone). I find it is richer than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5L0I">Rishi's Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha</a> but the difference is slight.<br /><br />The leaves are broken, but not dust. One can easily get two or more brewings from one tuo cha - you will get a better result if you slosh the ball in boiling hot water for ten seconds or so to loosen the leaves (and then pour out the rinsing water). (The title on Amazon says "loose leaf" - ignore this).<br /><br />WRT the packaging, the inner-lid/outer-lid is a fairly common Asian design, and keeps the jar from accidentally opening if it is dropped, while at the same time preventing a rush of air from entering the jar every time it is opened intentionally. I like the packaging, and reuse the tins for bulk teas. (I wish the tins weren't made in China, but since the tea is made in China, this is a little unrealistic). The tuos are wrapped in heavily bleached white paper (Rishi's are brown), which is unfortunate, but not a deal breaker.

review/text: Back when I was a destitute college student, I and a fellow student worked together would share canned soup and rice meals to save money. He was from India, and he had these fantastic spicy pickles that would jazz up our otherwise bland meals.<br /><br />I've searched for those pickles for 20 years and I think I've finally found them--hot mango relish!<br /><br />If you like a little spice, then you will love this relish for making your meals have more kick. It has a lot of chile powder, so it is very similar to a Chinese chile sauce, except that it has chunks of mango fruit as well. Yow! My mouth is still burning! I love it!

review/text: This pickle is quite hot; sharing with friends tells me it is too hot for people who aren't used to spicy food. For people who enjoy/are used to spicy food, it is delicious and very flavorful. The mangoes are unripe, so they are tart and with a green-olive-like texture; *nothing* like a sweet ripe mango. This relish nicely balances salty, sour, bitter, and chile flavors with a good blend of accompanying spices. If you like Indian pickles, try this. I put it on eggs, quesadillas, rice, Indian style flatbreads, vegetables, fish, etc. Basically, everything but dessert. I will warn that it is addictive!

review/text: My cats love these so much that one of them stole an entire bag off the kitchen counter, tore out the bottom, and ate most of it while I was away one morning. That said, I'm not terribly happy with these treats. The 2nd, 4th, and 6th main ingredients in the treats are ground corn, rice, and wheat flour -- starches I'm not stoked about giving my cats. The ingredient list is also very long. These were the best I could find at my local grocery store, and the cats definitely like them, but I'm hoping to find better ones through Amazon. I'm looking for a poultry-based treat with few additives; I picked these out because, despite the 'real salmon and garden greens flavor,' the ingredient list begins with chicken by-product meal; for reference, salmon meal is the 17th ingredient and the first green comes much later.

review/summary: My male cat goes nuts over these!
review/text: My male cat is one of those take it or leave it kinds of cats.  He doesn't overeat or snack if he's not hungry.  The previous treats we used, he liked them but again he could take it or leave it.  These however, he goes nuts over them.  We highly recommend them.  :)

review/summary: Perfect Little Treat for Entertainment.
review/text: I got this product from a seller on Amazon.com as a sample when I purchased some Fancy Feast Kitten food. My new kitty, Mo-No is just loving it! He was a little skeptical at first, so I left them on the floor in the middle of my office. He got into them later in the evening, and we must not had seen him. He was so festive when a friend came to visit! Then this morning, I watched him nibble just a tad bit at them.. and at this very moment.. he is running around the entire apartment bouncing off walls, literally!! I love this stuff! These treats are safe (research was done) and nutritious for my love... I will be purchasing more of these, now that I know what the good stuff is!

I could get them to come into the RV anytime I wanted all I had to do what make a noise like I was opening the bag of Treats and they came running.  They turn their nose up at all the other one's now.  I live in Canada and can't buy them here, so I have to order them from Amazon.

review/text: I can't vouch for how healthy these are, I haven't done that research.  But my cat LOVES these (as does my mother's cats) and with the help of these treats I am able to clip my cat's claws, which otherwise I'd have to ask the vet to do because my cat hates claw clipping.  But honestly, if I put a few of these treats in front of  him, he lets me clip him no problem.  For that they get 5 stars.

review/summary: Perfect For My Cat With Severe Skin Allergies.
review/text: Let me tell you about my crazy story, I have a 2 year old beautiful Cat ... white silky fur with big blue eyes.  She was in perfect health until 6 mos when she started to develop a severe skin rash and scratched it until it was raw....her cheeks, neck and back were all bloody, her Father also has the same skin rash since I got her from a family member who's cat was bred.  I tried everything, putting a collar on her, changing her food, hydrocortizone spray... etc... nothing worked, she ended up having to live with a huge cat collar around her head and a vest one her back... this is no way for a cat to live.  I went to several vets, they suggested changing the protien in her food to something like duck or rabbit, so I bought D/D science diet ... that still didn't work... finally i was online and read that cats can have a wheat or gluten allergy... I decided this was my last shot... All cat foods bought at the supermarket contain wheat and other grains... so I quickly went to pet-co... bought a salmon and green pea diet from natures best... She ate it but threw up a lot... so i returned that ... and went to another small pet shop which gave me samples of a few grain free foods including this one... I tried the others... she wasn't into them... and only ate bc she HAD to... finally I tried this... she loved it... it's not too hard on her teeth so I think that's part of why she likes it... and I'm guessing it's tasty bc she even goes for it over her canned food sometimes... AND BEST OF ALL... no allergies... after 1.5 years of suffering with this horrible rash and I'm sure it was itchy and annoying as well as painful... SHE is living like a cat should, with no collars, no rash ...etc.<br />I went back to the store to pick up a big bag of this food and to my surprise they don't have it anymore and it's special order bc not many people get it... I found that weird so i ordered it through Amazon... and felt the need to write this review so more people would try this great food.

review/summary: Palatable and stopped the gas problem.
review/text: A few months ago I adopted a pair of cats. I carefully fed them the diet that had been used at the shelter from which I had adopted them. Over the course of several weeks, I noticed that one cat had really bad breath and some truly epic farts. These were serious, room clearing episodes of gas, which were occurring at least once a day. I took kitty to the vet and had her checked out. Her teeth looked great, but I had them cleaned anyway. Her general exam and fecals were all clean. The doctor suggested changing their diet. I went to Phydeaux [...] and asked them for as many free dry food samples as they would be willing to give me. Came home with 14 different foods, yay Phydeaux, and discovered that this herring and sweet potato formula was the only one the cats would eat. I went back and bought a 15 lb bag. The cats have been eating it for 3 weeks now, and during that time the gas has stopped. Her breath isn't great, but I'm grateful for a general decrease of bad odors in the house.<br />I hope California Naturals continues production of this product as I intend to feed it to the cats for the rest of their lives.

review/summary: A Decadent Chocolately Granola
review/text: For a premium chocolate granola, this was yummy, let lacking something special to put it over the top. The somewhat sparse pieces of strawberry and raspberry add extra accents of flavor to the rolled oats and coconut mix. It makes a nice addition to plain or vanilla yogurt, or even ice cream. Perhaps it is from being shipped, but there is a good bit of the granola that was crushed and crumbled, taking away from the enjoyable mouth feel and texture evident in the few larger chunks in the bag.<br /><br />Love Crunch doesn't quite have the 'crunch' I would expect from a quality granola, and the chocolate flavor is muted somehow. The small chunks of dark chocolate seem to be of good quality however. It is fairly healthy when limited to the 1/4 cup size, though it's hard to stop munching after those significant 140 calories.<br /><br />This is a satisfying cereal that I would consider more of a dessert than a breakfast food. See if you can purchase it locally to minimize the amount of crushing I experienced. 3.5 stars.<br /><br />~ Kort ((review of the 11.5 size bag))

review/summary: YUMMY ... right out of the bag!!
review/text: I am a huge fan of granola and have tried many brands. I especially like to add granola to my Chobani Greek Yogurt. I do have to admit that while most of the granola mixes taste good in yogurt, they do not taste as good straight out of the bag. Love Crunch's DARK CHOCOLATE & RED BERRIES, however, is absolutely delicious and I loved it by itself (right out of the bag). There are not a lot of dark chocolate or red berries pieces inside, but that is ok because the granola is very tasty on its own.<br /><br />My only problem is that the granola tastes so good that it is very easy to eat the more than the 1/4 cup (140 calories) serving size. The DARK CHOCOLATE & RED BERRIES granola MIX has all of my favorite ingredients ... granola, cocoa, flax, and coconut. I especially like that there is NOT any high fructose corn syrup. I think I have found my new favorite granola mix. I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors also. :)

review/summary: Good quality, tasty, but too sweet for breakfast
review/text: Nature's Path Organic Love Crunch is a rolled-oat granola with little chunks of dark chocolate and bits of freeze-dried strawberries and raspberries. I had the opportunity to try it through a sample provided by Amazon Vine. The quality of the ingredients is very good so it does tastes fresh and it is quite crunchy.<br /><br />My primary criticism is that it is much too sweet to eat for breakfast: it even turns the milk sweet and gives it a slight chocolate flavor. This granola is much better eaten dry as a dessert. It would also be good as a topping for apple crisp.<br /><br />The suggested serving size of 1/4 cup has 140 calories and I would think a normal serving would be much larger than that, possibly a full cup or 560 calories. About half the bag arrived in tiny pieces from shipping so even the suggested quarter cup would probably contain more calories and it is not low-fat, either. 3/4 cup has 27% of the suggested daily value for fat.<br /><br />Note: "evaporated cane juice" is better known as "sugar".<br /><br />Ingredients: Rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, soy oil, spelt, dark chocolate chunks (evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, vanilla), flax seed, dried coconut, cocoa, freeze dried berry blend (freeze-dried strawberries, freeze-dried raspberries), rice starch, sea salt, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor, tocopherols (natural vitamin E).<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving size 1/4 cup (30g)<br />Servings per container: about 10 (total in package is 11.5 oz or 325 g)<br /><br />Per serving:<br />Calories - 140<br />Calories from fat - 55<br />Total fat - 6 g<br />Saturated fat - 1g<br />Trans fat - 0 g<br />Polyunsaturated fat - 3 g<br />Monounsaturated fat - 15 g<br />Cholesterol - 0 mg<br />Sodium - 55 mg<br />Potassium - 105 mg<br />Total carbohydrates - 20 g<br />Dietary fiber - 2 g<br />Sugars - 6 g<br />Protein - 2 g<br />Vitamin A - 0%<br />Vitamin C - 2%<br />Calcium - 0%<br />Iron - 4%
