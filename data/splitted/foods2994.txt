review/summary: Delicious! I will never miss wheat flour!
review/text: I just made waffles with the multi-blend flour, and unlike other gluten-free flour blends, the waffles didn't have that telltale grainy texture. My family could not tell they were eating gluten-free! I actually think the waffles were even lighter and fluffier than had I made them with wheat flour. I have found my gluten-free baking solution. Thanks Authentic foods!

review/summary: Worth the Cost!
review/text: If you are cringing at the cost, I recommend you bite the bullet and give it a try!  I was very skeptical and agonized about the decision to order the first time, thinking it was just too much to pay for flour.  But then, gluten free products are always more expensive.  Hopefully, they will come down over time, especially as more and more people go gluten free.  In the meantime, I will happily pay a little extra for a better product.  This is by far the best flour blend I have used for baking.  And like most other gluten free bakers, I have tried more flours than I care to remember.<br /><br />This is great in pancakes and waffles (Joy of Cooking recipes), and I made my mom's traditional coffee cake recipe this morning and it was delicious.  However, I don't necessarily use a one-to-one substitution.  I usually back off a quarter cup or so in a standard two cup recipe and like the texture better, but that may just be personal taste.  I would definitely recommend experimenting with the quantities, though, to get it just the way you like it.<br /><br />It's good in cookies, but to me it shines best in the more leavened baked goods - pancakes, waffles, breads and cakes.  Again, that might just be personal taste, but I've found certain blends work better for different types of foods (bread vs. frying vs. baked goods), so we have experimented a ton and keep around several different blends for different types of cooking.  This is definitely my go-to blend for baking.

review/summary: Tastes just like the real thing!!!
review/text: Having just gone gluten free on the recommendation of my physician, I was worried about not gettting to eat all of the things that I love (i.e. cookies, cakes, etc). I enjoy baking so I thought I would try making chocolate chip cookies with gluten free flour as a trial run. I'd heard all kinds of horrible things about gluten free baked goods, especially bread (try Kinnikinnick Gluten Free Bread (frozen) - it's fantastic!!). I stumbled across Authentic Foods Multi-Blend Gluten Free Flour while searching on Amazon and although the price was steep, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />All I can say is WOW!!!! This is the real deal - - I could not taste the difference at all. The cookies were soft with just a hint of crispiness on the outside. I'm pretty picky about ingredients when I bake and I was completely and utterly won over. My family even commented on how yummy the cookies were (I didn't tell them they were gluten free until they were licking their fingers!). I will definitely buy this flour again and am going to try making cupcakes next. Can't wait to try them!!<br /><br />P.S. It does say on the package not to use this flour in yeast recipes UNLESS the recipe is specifically gluten free. Not sure why, but I guess just don't substitute this gluten free flour in a regular flour yeast recipe.

review/text: This flour is incredible.. I trick all of my friends and family with this flour and they have no idea it's gluten-free. My husband prefers baked goods made with this flour over regular wheat flour! I've tried every gluten free flour out there and this one tops every other one hands down. It's never gritty or grainy.. it always has excellent texture and no funky gluten free flavor - like Better Batter! I will never buy any other flour again. I swear by this stuff, it's delicious! :)

review/summary: Amazing gluten free substitute for all purpose wheat flour
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112CND8">Multi-Blend Gluten Free Flour - 3lb</a>If you miss baked-good recipes which were based on all purpose wheat flour then you must try this product. The manufacturer recommends that you replace each cup of all purpose wheat flour with 3/4 cup of the Multi-Blend Gluten Free Flour. I was quite skeptical because of earlier disappointments with gluten free products. To try the product I used my favorite corn bread recipe (old fashioned New England style with low fat/low sugar). When the corn bread came out of the oven it looked exactly like the corn bread I would make with wheat flour. The taste and consistency of the gluten free corn bread was equal to or better than the wheat based recipe. It was also as light as the wheat based recipe. On the down side this flour does not work with wheat based recipes for yeast breads. The manufacturer indicates that you should try gluten free recipes for yeast breads. I need to do some more research on gluten free recipes for yeast breads. If I find recipes that I like, I will note them here.

review/summary: great flour
review/text: This flour blend is amazing.  There is no after taste as with other flour blends I've tried and you can use it cup for cup in your own family recipes.  I will say that it is best in cookies, nut breads and cakes (heavier items).  It does produce a heavier product than regular wheat flour but I can over look this as I thought there was no hope of making good baked goods until I found this.  My problem now is the store that I usually get it from isn't going to stock it anymore so I need to look elsewhere.  I can't believe that the shipping costs more than the product.  I guess that Authentic foods never heard of the post offices $7 if it fits, it ships!!:)  I refuse to pay that much shipping so I'm looking elswhere to  purchase this product.  If you don't mind the price buy it.  It is a great product.

review/summary: Convenient, easy to use
review/text: This is an all-purpose gluten-free baking flour blend, used in many recipes found in gluten-free cookbooks or magazines.  Like other Authentic Foods' products, the flours are finely ground so the texture is just as it should be.  The blend is generally a bit more expensive than the flours purchased separately, but it saves time and reduces the mess that inevitably occurs with beating together several kinds of flour.

review/summary: Happiness!
review/text: I followed Micki's lead on this one because we love Toll House Cookies and being gluten-intolerant has kept us from having them. We have tried alot of brands and they always have a weird lingering flavor or the texture is odd. This mix is exceptional. We are very happy with the results and will never have to feel deprived again. LOVE this flour mix and so thankful we can have satisfying chocolate chip cookies!!! I am also dairy intolerant: This worked amazingly well: Replaced the 1 cup of butter with 1/2 cup virgin coconut oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and we used Enjoy Life dairy-free chocolate chips. Pure heaven!!!! No funny aftertaste or texture problems.

review/summary: Not as advertised
review/text: I have a few gluten free bread cookbooks. My cook books gave recipies for various gluten free flour recipes. While shopping for the ingredients, I found this blend. Excited not to have to order several different flours, and mix, I ordered tihs. The description claims it is super easy, just use as you would wheat flour in any wheat flour recipe!! Great! I have several wheat flour bread cookbooks, and was planning on giving them away and replacing with gluten free ones. This way, i can keep them, and save money, I thought. But not so. When I received this flour, I was dismayed to read on the label that this flour does not work in yeast recipes. All the recipes in my regular bread cookbook have yeast in them, so no go there, pretty disappointing given the fact that the description on Amazon claims that this flour will work in place of wheat flour in any recipe. And, not only that, but it says it will work in any gluten free recipe. But, the ingredients are different that the gluten free recipe I have, and the label does not give preportions so I cannot tell if it will work in the other gluten free recipes I have which gives specific preportions. The label recommends a certain cookbook, that this mix is exact to the flour mix used in that book. So, now I am expected to spend money on another cook book? Just so I can use the flour i bought (to use as advertized) in wheat flour recipes? I greatly dislike scams of that sort, that adversited something easy only to require associated tools or books. I will not be buying yet another cook book. I will try to use this flour somehow, but I will not be buying again. Next time I will purchase all the seperate flours as indicated in my gluten free cookbook and mixing my own.

review/text: My dogs love these sweet potato treats.  I feed my dogs grain-free diets and other high-end supplements, so of course I wanted a treat that followed our feeding ethic. This is low in protein and fat, so it is gentle on the stomach of puppies and sick dogs alike. My dogs go crazy over these. They love the taste and since these are a little tough, it takes them a bit longer to finish them, which is great because dogs usually swallow treats whole. They are not extremely tough though. Puppies can eat them. Even though the bag does not have an indication to refrigerate after opening, please do so. They will last longer and remain fresher. Plus, you could prevent mold growth. Amazon sells these by far at the most affordable price. Specialty stores sell these treats up to twice as much as Amazon does, so I suggest you buy them from Amazon. If you want a healthy treat, this is the way to go. :)

review/summary: Sweet Potato Treats had mold on them
review/text: I have stocked our dogs' treat pantry with Plato's Farmers Market products for about a year. My dogs love their Salmon and Salmon with Vegetable treats. I recently purchased their Sweet Potato treats, which have a "Best by" date of 9-22-10. Shortly after opening the bag we saw that treats were covered in white & blue mold. Unacceptable & disgusting. The bag's sticker has "X00133D6P" on it. I have bought Plato products many times previously and have been pleased, however, these are supposed to be safe and quality treats. I absolve the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet, of responsibility of this issue as they have taken swift steps to rectify the issue. However, I do firmly assert that Plato should have done a much better job of notifying customers of a bad batches of Sweet Potato treats.

review/text: My two dogs love these.  I bought them along with the regular Plato chicken treats when I saw they were USA made.  The only reason I gave these four stars instead of five is that they are somewhat crumbly when you get them out of the bag. I assume it's due to the vegetable content so I'm not really complaining. It's great to find products that are not only good tasting, but good for them as well.

review/text: They're different looking from the other's I've seen. They're smaller and darker in color then other Chicken Strips. They look more like beef Jerky.<br />Nonetheless, our doggies like them, and that's what counts for us.

review/summary: Not for dogs with food allergies
review/text: I have a dog with all kinds of allergies. She loves sweet potato treats and I love giving them to her because they're so healthy (the more I read about all the dangers of processed treats found in pet stores, the more resolute I am in my decision to never, ever feed her that garbage).<br /><br />The only problem I have with these treats is that they contain eggs and salt in addition to the natural sweet potato and probiotics. Eggs are a big no-no for any dog with food allergies, and salt is just something you shouldn't really be feeding your dog anyway. At least not in excessive quantities. These treats are a thousand times better than regular dog treats, but they didn't work for my dog.<br /><br />I've decided to stick to Snook's sweet potato treats. They're 100% dried sweet potato and nothing else - also made in the USA and my dog absolutely loves them.

review/summary: Dog Loves Them, We Love Them - Made in the USA
review/text: My dog loves sweet potato treats, but after discovering a lot of additives in her previous treats, as well as the fact that they were made in China, we started searching for a new treat. She loves them, they are pricier, but that's basically what it comes down to if you want a low number of ingredients and products made in the USA.

review/summary: Natural Treats made in the USA
review/text: I will no longer buy anything made in China for my dogs. I searched for a treat for them and even the ones in places like Petco were made in China. I finally found a link to Plato's Farmer's Market and then to them being sold on Amazon. They are made here in the USA and all natural. My vet told me to feed my dogs sweet potatoes or pumpkin and these treats fit the bill. So I ordered them through Amazon. My dogs beg for these. I have now ordered them three times and will continue to do so.

review/summary: Loved the flowers!
review/text: I ordered the bulk carnations for my husband's church group to present to the ladies of our church. I wasn't sure what to expect...unless you see the flowers in person, sometimes you aren't sure how closely the flowers will resemble the image. I took the chance and it turned out to be a great decision. The flowers arrived two days after I ordered them and they were beautiful! Long stem (approx. 22"), nice size flower head (approx. 2.5") in beautiful colors. They arrive with the buds partially opened. After following the care instructions, they opened beautifully.<br /><br />I was a little concern about when to order them - I wanted to make sure we had them in time for the event, but didn't want them too early that they would have begun wilting before the presentation. The one day shipping ensured that we received them close enough to the event and in time to allow the flowers to be presentation-ready for the event (nice bloom in approx. 48 hours).<br /><br />Next time I need bulk flowers, I'll definitely order these again.

review/text: I buy this product for my two cats. I know there are dogs on the cover, but they sure go ape $#!^ for these chicken bits. These are great treats to reward any animal, they are healthy and don't have any invasive odors like a lot of other pet treats. I hate to admit this, but I have tried these treats as well, don't judge me too much I know you have thought of it as well. Aside from being a little bland, they are pretty good, put a little hot sauce on them and it could pass along with most of the frozen snacks that kids eat. If you are looking for a premium treat to give to your pets I suggest Pure Bites.

review/summary: 2 bags rancid! calling company today!
review/text: UPDATED APRIL 2012: I'm returning 6 more pouches of PureBites Chicken today, after first calling the company for instructions. The same rep (female) who responded to my complaint in  Dec 2011 took my call today, but not knowing I had called before, she kept insisting there has never been a complaint about rancid bits before. I told her I called in Dec and she said "someone else likely helped you". Not wanting to argue, I moved on, but she clearly lied to me so I thought I should update about this. I was asked to include a note this time, to say where purchased but that has nothing to do with the fact that the company thinks it's "acceptable" that some fat is getting thru via processing. Fat cannot be freeze-dried so it will turn rancid even if freeze dried - read my original review and see how this was answered the 1st time I called last year...Very disappointing that the company doesn't care to hold the processing plant's feet to the fire about fat getting in, but then to lie to a customer is not good. But they will honor their satisfaction guarantee! So the only way to get this issue resolved is for all of us to get refunds. All you need to do is send the proof of purchase and your invoice to the address on the bag, along with your name & address. I find that about half of the bags are rancid. Dogs don't care, but cats won't eat rancid anything so very expensive if issue is ignored. Pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund. Companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit. I hate to do this, but my cats beg for these and I'm going broke replacing rancid bags!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought two 6.2 oz bags of PureBites Chicken for dogs, first trying out a small cat size pouch found at PetSmart, and then moved up to the dog-sized bags/chunks, which I crumble with my fingers to get them smaller for my cats, who love this product BUT both of these bags purchased on Amazon had rancid chunks that smushed into slimy/greasy mush when I crumbled them.<br /><br />The company admits this happens, said it's part of the processing, nothing can be done, but it's not acceptable, and they will refund once I send proof of purchases & invoice to them.<br /><br />So it's hit or miss, and the company agrees...so just an FYI to warn others to check their bags!<br /><br />For those feeding this to dogs, and not breaking up the chunks like I do, please take note of this and check on the chunks before feeding. You can also detect a faint rancid odor if there are rancid bits in your bags.<br /><br />The reason for the rancid chunks, according to the company is that pieces of fatty chicken do get in, and fat doesn't freeze-dry, so without preservatives, it will go rancid. I knew that, but had hoped they could offer a promise to correct this; they can't and have no intention to do so. So I'll keep buying and hoping I get good bags, but will certainly take the time to get refunded whenever this occurs.<br /><br />The product is excellent when you get a good bag..just check each piece before feeding, or if you have a good nose for rancid odors, take a whiff and you'll smell the slight rancid odor, and can return the product.

I highly recommend these treats for cats.<br /><br />Update:  I have continued to purchase these and they are still the only treat either one of my cats will eat.  The older cat has apparently taught the kitten these are the only treats worth eating.  Still a great product and I have never had problems like other reviewers had.

review/text: I rate this a 4 star because of how it tends to have a great quantity of powdery crumbs in the bottom of the bag. The dog will lick it up, but with a powder, he tends to inhale and cough so I end up with unusable powdery crumbs that I can't give to the dog straight from the bag. Overall, this is a great product because it is just chicken and both the dog and the cat love this stuff. I frequently buy the biggest bag and will continue to do so. The good pieces are cubes of chicken, and are dehydrated and crunchy. Since its dry, its easy to handle and give to the dog or cat as a treat.  The bag has a zip closure to keep it fresh.

review/summary: Wonderful natural treat Made in USA
review/text: We got these as a x-mas gift and this is the BEST treat! I am very careful about what I give my Shih Tzu who is a puppymill rescue and has health issues. This treat is a 100% natural made with 100% chicken and also VERY IMPORTANT is that it is NOT MADE IN CHINA. I never give my dog anything that is made in China (I have relatives in China and trust me you do not want to feed your dog anything that is made there) so there have been very few options out there for my dog. The added plus is that both my dog and cat LOVE these treats. My dog is more finicky than my cat and they both go crazy over these and b/c I know they are 100% natural chicken I feel confident giving them the treats. There are, however, two drawbacks and that is why I can't give it 5 stars. 1) A lot of the treats are wasted b/c they crumble and at least 1/4 of the bag looks like it is filled with sawdust (crumbs from the broken treats). Many of the pieces also crumble into pea-size pieces which are too small for a dog. Fortunately my cat does not mind the tiny pieces so I give these to him. These treats are also very expensive which I don't mind b/c the quality is so good but for this price, I wish so much would not go to waste. 2) Like another reviewer said, you do need to be careful b/c I have found a bone in them as well. I found a bone about an inch long embedded in one of the treats so now I am careful to inspect the treat before giving it to my dog. Even with these drawbacks, I still feel these are the best treats out there if you are looking for 1) healthy, 2)natural, 3) tasty treats that are 4) MADE IN USA. In my experience, it is nearly impossible to meet all 4 criteria. This is the only treat that does (at least for my pets where taste is concerned. My pets refuse to eat Newman's treats even though they are healthy).

I used to give him smelly wet food, but I just couldn't handle gagging 2 times a day...<br /><br />Since I ground it into a fine powder, I did notice some pea-sized bits of hard something, most likely bone. This might not be an issue for a big dog, but for my small, old cat, I have to be sure to pick these pieces out. Just be observant when feeding your pet.<br /><br />I used to buy this product locally, but I found they were selling it for over twice the price per ounce, so this is a GREAT value!

review/summary: The quality of the chicken is questionable
review/text: I just discarded 20% of the bag.  Some of the pieces had chicken veins (dark purple spots), others had fatty parts to them. A few pieces weren't completely 'dry.' This is the first time I've tried this brand and it looks like they use thigh meat in their mix, whereas the other companies I've purchased in the past seem to use only breast meat? It just looks much more yellow -- I don't know exactly what it means -- I guess I'm just used to seeing bright, white, crispy pieces when I buy the other brands that Amazon offers.

review/text: Our 2 dogs (humans) love these treats. I could not find this larger bag anywhere except on Amazon for this price. Bought 2 bags and got free shipping. Don't have to pay more for the smaller bags at the pet store. These are the only treats we give them. Pure chicken, nothing else. Love 'em.

review/summary: Cats & Dogs Love them & Made in USA
review/text: With the recent recalls and bad health-related notifications of cat & dog food treats, I wanted to try a new treat that seemed healthy, easy to store, and above all...Made in the USA!  I tried these PureBites.  Both my cats & dog absolutely clammer for them.  You get a lot of bite sized freeze-dried chicken breast pieces & they are low in calories.  With 3 pets, the bag will last through a month. The cost is worth it to me....for the safety and happiness of my pets.  Will continue to order these.

review/text: This review isn't about the product, which is great.  It's about Amazon jacking up the price 33% in the last three weeks.  Here's a big F-U to the greed which is destroying this country. How can 3oz of freeze dried chicken cost $10?  From $6.50 to $10 is a joke.<br /><br />Thanks for a great product. Best way to keep loyal customers is to F*** them over.  Keep up the good work!

I need to break it into smaller pieces before feeding them to the cats and they go crazy for it. I'm surprised because the food itself doesn't have a very strong odor (like some of the other cat treats) but it was enough for the cats to know it's "treats time". Will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Great for ferrets to!
review/text: All 4 of my ferrets go nuts for this stuff. Even though theres a picture of a dog or cat, it isnt specific to just one species, its great for all of them! The ONLY ingrediant is 100% chicken breast which is perfect for ferrets an is the most healthy "treat" out there, better then the other junk like N-bones, bandits etc. They say the best treat is meat, so this stuff is PERFECT! It takes time for them to get used to it but once they did, they started doing tricks the 2nd they see the bag.<br /><br />There has been a huge increase in there coat and there energy levels. And since i started putting it in there food they even eat alot less because there getting filled more with meat as well. I support this treat for dogs, cats and ferrets :D!

review/summary: PureBites freeze dried chicken treats
review/text: I bought a small package of this some time ago as I was having trouble finding something to hide their meds in (both cats and dogs). They love this stuff!<br /><br />They haven't gotten bored with it, or learned that I sometimes bury their meds in it.  Works way better than pill pockets, pieces of cheese, peanut butter, or even a bit of roast chicken. When using it to hide meds, it's easier to soak a piece in a little broth. The pill doesn't have to be completely hidden, just kind of indent it in a bit, let the dog smell that treat and he'll gobble it right down.<br /><br />Also, there are always crumbs and bits at the bottom of the package that I sprinkle on their dog/cat food and they seem to enjoy that a lot - one of my dogs won't eat anymore unless he's got the chicken crumbles on his food.<br /><br />I'm completely sold on this product.

If you don't like that, try Prime Taste Treats - they are more expensive, but not as much "crushed" product.  I'm a fan and more importantly, so is my doggie!!

This is her reward and she knows that if she puts up with me she gets a nice, fat free, carb free delicious treat.  Take care of your pets and give them nutritious freeze dried meat/chicken rather than the junk food treats that are loaded with uneeded carbs.<br /><br />Also, this is a great price and a large bag lasts for a long time.  Cat and dog Pure Bites are exactly the same with larger pieces in the bag for dogs.  Just break them up and kitties love them too.  I also use the crushed treats to top off a meal and make it tastier.<br /><br />When my friend's bring their dogs by, they always get some too.  All of the pets love this product!!!

review/text: My 13 year old Lhasa makes the title Prima Dona seem tame.  She is so finicky, we're at wits end.  I got tired of making her treats and needed something to bribe her with. What makes it harder is that she can't have salt due to her severely enlarged heart. We went to a doggy boutique and the lady "knew" that she had something she would like.  She tried EVERY treat she had and Michi just turned her nose up at everything!  The lady finally said, I'll bring out the big guns, and indeed, Michi loved the freeze dried chicken breast treats.  Unfortunately, I had to pay $12.95 for 2 oz. We were desperate so I paid it.  PureBites are a God-send!  Not only is the price more than reasonable, but Michi will do just about anything for them.  I recommend these highly for anyone with a finicky dog, especially one with heart problems, such as Michi.

I have a timed treat feeder that is in use when we are away from home, and this is a big favorite with the group.  Short of fixing them some freshly cooked chicken breast (tough to do when we're not home!), this is one of the healthiest and tastiest treats around.

They sell Purebites at my local petshop along with various hollistic brand dog food, so I know it's good. When Gizmo became picky about eating his kibble a pet shop worker suggested I sprinkle pieces of this onto the kibble, and it worked wonders for his appetite. The chicken is easiest on his stomach, I've noticed with too much liver Purebites he begins to have diarhia. Otherwise, I higly recommend this.

I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: Tastes ok, good for ya!
review/text: This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.

review/text: I have a hard time finding nettle leaf tea at regular grocery stores, so I purchased mine from Amazon.  I generally enjoy English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Japanese green, and Oolong teas; this is a great addition to my current mix.  The tea bags make it easy to enjoy at work.
