review/summary: Great Salt
review/text: I switched to this salt years ago as I was cutting refined foods out of my families diets. At least to the extent that I can control at home. This tastes good, has a full spectrum of natural minerals and comes from right here in the good ol'USA. I have had a couple of bags that had some sandy grit in it though. Not enough to bother us or make me quit using it. They make a coarse grind too that you put in a salt grinder. I actually like it more for table use and the fine grind for cooking.

review/text: Great flavor but just can't stand the hard pieces of sand (I think it's sand anyway)<br />I have sensitive teeth and this sand will actually put tiny chips your teeth.  It's not just one piece of sand per teaspoon either, it's several.  Maybe I got a batch that's worse than normal but I'm not ordering anymore.  If there was a way the company could filter this out it, this salt would be great!

review/summary: Positives: it's absolutely sea salt.  Negatives: the sand in it proves this fact.
review/text: I got two bags of this sea salt after I had a small sample shaker that I really loved. It has excellent flavor, is genuine sea salt, and you use less sea salt than regular salt when seasoning food because it is a stronger flavor. All good things.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after many, many tries to ensure it wasn't my imagination...both bags contained sand as well. Something must have been wrong with their filtering system to eliminate sand from the salt during manufacturing. But, because it happened in both bags I had bought I felt it must not be too uncommon.<br /><br />Imagine when I cooked an egg dish to share with the office at breakfast...you know how it is when you eat something at the beach and, no matter how careful you are, some sand gets in so you bite down on grit? That was take one.  Then I made soup...with sand...take two....After two more tries I knew it wasn't a fluke of the kitchen or the dish or some odd salt. After all, salt dissolves in cooking. I tried both bags and gave up.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's awful. The taste was good and I might try it again in the future...but this is a fairly exceptional flaw so I gotta pan the cooking results it produced for now.

review/text: I've been using RealSalt for a year or more, as well as several other brands of sea salt, and RealSalt is one of the finest I've tried. I like using this salt for cooking, and use the RealSalt Kosher salt (also available here, I think) as a finishing salt - for sprinkling on food at the table. The kosher variety has a larger grain size than the plain RealSalt, and a slightly mellower flavor. I still use the other brands as well when I want a different flavor profile. All of the standard salt in the kitchen now goes for salting pasta water, since it's flavor doesn't compare.

review/summary: gritty, unpleasant texture
review/text: I was really excited to find this salt, because it is supposed to be so pure, but I was really disappointed. I realize that the company refers to the grit as mineral, but to be honest, the impression I got was of trying to eat after a sandstorm. Possibly I got a particularly sandy batch, because after I gave up on eating this, I used it for bath salt, and the tub looked like I had been to a beach party. To be clear, for me it isn't the idea of dirt that bothers me (I have used clay-based toothpastes), but this grit doesn't even break up and is unpleasant to chew. All in all, I'll stick to Himalayan Salt.

If you like adding sand to your salt before sprinkling it on your favorite foods, this is the salt for you! If you like a salt that is loaded with minerals and flavor without the grit, get Spice labs Himalayan salt. That's what I did and I will never again spend my money on this gritty crap that they could have filtered but that would take too long and cost too much?<br /><br />Yet another company out of Utah that cuts corners and compromises our health...the other company is concentrace mineral drops ... that product was endorsed by a scientist who now removed his endorsement after seeing the filthy conditions that company now uses!

review/text: I agree with the other reviewers who noted that the salt has insoluble particles in it. These can really hurt your teeth! OK it's supposed to be natural, but I do not see why I have to pay so much $$$ for salt that has sand in it, no matter how much more tastier it is. I mean seriously people, it's SAND... in your FOOD! Do you eat manure fertilizer with your organic produce? I don't think so.<br /><br />Maybe realsalt has sand in it so that it boosts the company's profit margins... I mean it adds to the weight that would otherwise be used by REAL salt.<br /><br />I also find the pitch about the natural minerals to be hogwash. I mean, yea it does have some trace amount of potassium, but also aluminum, tin and so on.

review/text: I bought this product believing it to be a healthy product.  While it may be healthy, the salt does not dissolve--or maybe it's sand others have referred to.  Eating a casserole or pasta dish with this salt is horrible--it ruined the dishes because it was so gritty.  I prefer not to feel like I am chewing something that sand was sprinkled on.  The salt (or sand?) does NOT dissolve in meals where it's added & cooked with the meal.

This will be the second time I have ordered the caramels and will continue to do so.  I limit myself to one or two a day which is really hard to do, but with the cost I want them to last a little while before having to order again.  Try them, I assure you, you will not be disappointed.

I have to say the thought of a BLK water made me a bit apprehensive but I wanted to try it. The bottle itself and design is really nice, packaging great. The color of the water looks almost like a flat coke. There is no smell to it really. However, I am so disappointed to say, the taste is really bad. It has a metallic aftertaste that does not taste good at all. I purchased one bottle for $6.99, this is not cheap water. And, I guess we don't even need Fulvic Acid to survive nor does it really do anything for us (based on opinion from what I have read online,not a Doctor). All in all, overpriced, tastes pretty bad with not good aftertaste that lingers for awhile. I am so sorry, I wanted to like it!

I left the bottle in the fridge for a day after it arrived in the mail. It tastes just like clear water, no weird after taste. However, I still can't get my mind wrapped around the fact that it's "dirty" - not clear. Even though it tastes just like clear water to me, the color of the beverage plays a trick on my mind. "If it's water, why isn't it clear?" If you're considering purchasing this product, you should go ahead and do so. It's worth a try. After all, you'll never know if you really like it or not unless you try. Right?

review/summary: Metallic taste
review/text: Tried it out of curiosity, (free sample tasting) well to be honest it was very bad. Just awful, tasted like tin foil!  The metallic taste lingered for a long while afterwards too.  The color is quite gross and it had a funny smell too. It gave me nausea!  My friend who also sampled it said she had gas pains from it!  So make sure you sample it first to make sure you can stomach it. To sum it up in one word - YUK!

review/summary: Taste bad and overpriced
review/text: I am familiar with the benefits of fulvic acid so I was curious about how this product would be. First off, it looks totally unappetizing. At first it taste like regular water but then it has an aftertaste that almost reminds me of charcoal.<br /><br />Plus, it is way to expensive. You can buy a good fulvic supplement for pennies per serving compared to this stuff which is pricey at the health food store and a little better priced here on Amazon. I can say that I will not be buying this product again.

review/summary: Fulvic acid has many good qualities for health
review/text: Once you get past the color the water is fine, tastes normal to me.  Fulvic acid has many good properties and you should really read up before you decide "tap water" is just as good.  Tap water is full of toxins that the govt says are "fine" but why risk that.  Distilled water is the best, fulvic acid is worth trying more than once.

review/text: The Panni dumpling mixes enable me to have potato dumplings any time that I want. Unlike making them from scratch, which is labor intensive and occassionally prone to failure (resulting in a watered down soup), this mix is almost foolproof. I have used this product for at least 30 years and have never had a problem. I get consistent high quality dumplings each time. This makes preparing a special German meal for friends so much easier. I highly reccommend this product.

review/summary: Very Authentic Taste
review/text: Having lived in Germany, I've always loved this type of dumpling, which is a bit different from other (usually drier) types.  The slipperiness is not for everyone, but I love them.  My sister-in-law makes the best dumplings, and though I've tried using her recipe, I end up with either very slimy dumplings or they fall apart and make the water thick and nasty.  I gave up.  I went back to Panni, which I had used many, many years before, and was sooo relieved that they were as close to my SIL's dumplings as one can get.  Yum!  Bon Apetit!<br /><br />P.S., I cook them in water, so that my son can add them to stew or chicken noodle soup, and I add mine to either vegetarian broth or smother with vegetarian gravy.

review/text: If you like German cooking and remember the days of potato dumplings, sauerbraten and rich gravies, then you will love these! I made my own dumplings for over forty years, and sometimes, depending on the potatoes, they did not come out that great. But this mix never fails! I just add an egg and some parsley flakes, sauteed breadcubes in the middle when I form them, and my family and friends all love them. Sooo much easier to make than from scratch. If you have a little German in you (or just love German cooking), than you have to try these, absolutely the BEST!

review/summary: An acquired taste
review/text: Both the 5-Star and the 1-Star reviewers have a point.  German potato dumplings are an acquired taste.  I married a good German(-American)girl and we were stationed in Germany (Bavaria) for four years, so I've acquired the taste.  The mix isn't quite as good as the Gastehaus staple, but the dumplings are pretty darn close.  If you try them on your redneck dinner guests without warning, however, you're liable to get a 1-Star reaction.  They are heavy and gummy.  With Sauerbraten und Rotkohl, that's what makes them great.

review/summary: Got these for my Mom and she was thrilled.
review/text: Got these mixes (12 boxes)for my Mom when she was no longer able to find them locally.  She was thrilled.  I asked her what she liked about them and said "they make a meal festive".  She's 89, lives alone and still makes most things from scratch but, after giving this mix a try several years back, she said she preferred it to all the work that was involved.  She said the mix is similar, if not the same, to what she made from scratch -- I agree.  And I'm happy that it's much less work for her.  I think she makes dumplings more often than she normally would because they're so easy.  And since she really enjoys them, I'm glad.<br /><br />She said they have a new box that suggests substituting milk for water and she's said that although she always liked this mix with water, she likes it even better with milk.<br /><br />We used to get this mix in NYC and bring it to her whenever we visited but now, with Amazon, it's so easy to just order 12 boxes and have them shipped directly so she never runs out.

review/text: When my German mother-in-law discovered this more than 40 years ago, she was so happy. After years of grating potatoes for her much loved dumplings, she could finally do it the easy way. Only she made a change. The box says to add water, she added a beaten egg and half milk to the recipe to make the necessary ounces. It makes all the difference. I have been doing it ever since she taught me long ago. I never did learn to make it the old fashioned way. If it was good enough for Grandma it is good enough for us!

Since I am not as adept at it as she was, Panni Bavarian Potato Dumpling Mix is an exceptional addition to my mashed potatoes to make a dough that holds together for my dumplings.

review/summary: Non-vegan, health-food alternative to Kellogg's Raisin Bran cereal
review/text: This cereal is made with the following ingredients, per the listing on the box: "Whole wheat flour, raisins (raisins, vegetable glycerin, vegetable oil [canola and/or sunflower oil]), wheat bran, milled cane sugar, barley malt syrup, whole rolled oats, vegetable oil (canola and/or safflower and/or sunflower oil), rice flour, oat fiber, salt, honey, annatto (for color), turmeric (for color), mixed tocopherols (natural vitamin E to maintain freshness), cardamom seed, fennel seed, fenugreek seed, nutmeg. Contains wheat. Produced in a facility that processes tree nuts, wheat and soy."<br /><br />Each one-cup serving is 190 calories, about 80 calories more than Kellogg's Raisin Bran (KRB). It has more fat than KRB, but also more fiber and more protein. This bran cereal contains 2 g fat (18 calories), 44 g of carbohydrates (176 calories) of which 8 g is fiber. The fiber is equivalent to 32 calories, which are not digestible by the body and can effectively be subtracted from the 176 calories for carbs, bringing it down to 144 calories. It has 6 g protein (32 calories). That comes to a total calorie count of 194, which is very close to the 190 calories listed. The minimal difference is because carbs and protein are slightly less than 4 calories per gram, and fat is slightly less than 9 calories per gram.<br /><br />This cereal is described by the manufacturer as "whole grain oat clusters," and given that the recipe for making them is different than Kellogg's Raisin Bran, it is not surprising that they don't taste the same as that product. However, in their own right they taste quite good.<br /><br />This product is not sugar-free, but it uses natural sweeteners which are slightly less unhealthy than the white sugar, brown sugar or high fructose corn syrup that KRB uses. These natural sweeteners consist of milled cane sugar, barley malt syrup, and honey. The milled cane sugar and barley malt syrup are vegan, by the way, but honey is not considered to be vegan, so it is too bad the manufacturer added it to this cereal, or they could have had another selling point. In terms of health, though, the truth is, all sweeteners which are either fructose or sucrose, which each of the sweeteners mentioned above are, raise blood glucose levels. The advantage for controlling blood-glucose spikes that this cereal offers over and beyond what KRB provides is more fiber, more protein and a little bit more fat, all of which act like anchors on blood glucose levels, lessening spikes of blood glucose due to the relatively large percentage of carbs that any breakfast cereal contains, no matter who makes it.<br /><br />A true advantage of this cereal over KRB is that it contains no artificial coloring, flavoring or preservatives. (Note that the KRB ingredient list does not admit to any coloring agents or preservatives, which I find very odd and very likely a dishonest omission--it's simply not possible that it has no preservatives in it of any kind to maintain freshness. Here are all the ingredients listed on the KRB box and on the Kellogg's website: "Whole grain wheat, raisins, wheat bran, sugar, brown sugar syrup, contains 2% or less of salt, malt flavor.")<br /><br />What this cereal has used to color, flavor and preserve its cereal are an impressive list of very healthy substances. Mixed tocopherols maintain freshness. This is the form of vitamin E that is best absorbed in the body. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that fights cancer and heart disease. Annatto and turmeric are used to color the cereal. Annatto is rich in antioxidants that function similarly to vitamin E, and turmeric is particularly well known for its anti-inflammatory properties. This cereal also contains cardamom seed, fennel seed, and fenugreek seed, all of which are strong aids to digestion. Studies on the action of fenugreek have also found it is helpful in controlling cholesterol and blood-sugar levels. Nutmeg has antibacterial action, in particular combating the bacteria that cause tooth decay. In addition, nutmeg contains compounds protective of the heart and that help prevent Alzheimer's. It also tastes great and, much like cinnamon, when used in baked goods or cereals, can cause them to taste sweeter so that less sugar is needed.<br /><br />There is no mention of this product being organic, though the company makes this sales pitch: "By effectively combining the finest all natural ingredients, sustainable practices and regular giving to worthy causes, Peace Cereal truly delivers Peace of Mind in Every Bite!"<br /><br />All in all, as high-carb cereals go, this one is a good bet. It is not safe for people with wheat or soy allergies, though, and diabetics would be better off eating a cereal with no sweetener of any kind and using a natural sweetener with no calories that does not raise the blood sugar like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z9ASSK">stevia powder</a>.

review/text: I agree with the previous review; these taste the same as the regular Kettle Chips.  I don't have a bag of the regular ones to compare the fat contents, but they do taste the same.  I bought the small 1.75 ounce bags and they are perfect for a snack.  If I had the larger bags I'd eat the whole bag probably so these are great for a quick snack.

review/summary: Probably not what you're thinking
review/text: This is kind of a nice item, but not really what I was looking for. First, the body and the globe are plastic and not metal and glass. It only accepts quarters; pennies and dimes will fall thru, and nickels will jam--requiring you to take the mechanism apart. You can set it to vend large or small items. Set to full open, the gum ball wheel vends 5 or 6 small gum balls. It's very noisy compared to the little antique-style machine I have and much taller (less kid-friendly). This is not the sort of machine you can leave unattended (because it is plastic and prone to jam) and yet demands quarters, so it's not ideal for home use, unlike the penny machine I have (I can't very well leave a box of quarters next to it). Supposedly, you can set it for free-spin (there are no instructions on how to do this), but that takes the fun out of using it.

review/summary: Deliciously different little wafer cookies
review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

This cookie is amazingly delicious.  I like sweets that aren't too sweet, with just the right hint of sugar.  These are cookies just like that.  Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies.

review/text: I had these cookies in Germany, but I had a hard time finding them in the US.  I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon.  They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies, but they're a little richer and a little moister.  I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.
