I received my very own yummy batch of Haribo Gold-Bears at my doorstep days before i even expected them to arrive! what a wonderful surprise! I love fast shipping!

review/text: Once upon a time (about 20 years ago) I was able to buy gourmet gummi bears from a kiosk in a local mall that knocked the socks off these.  I was able to choose my flavors, too.  Ah, for the good old days!  I hate to be the Philistine amidst all these raves, but I just can't seem to get excited about these gummi bears.  They are so rubbery that they seem hard to bite into, so of course they are also kind of hard to taste.  I didn't notice any light dusting to keep them from sticking together, either.  I'm just glad my grandkids like them, because I would have a heck of a time eating this whole 5-pound bag by myself otherwise!

review/text: DO NOT EAT THE WHOLE BAG!<br /><br />This is not a warning included in the package, but it should be.  Haribo bears are some of the best gummi candy I've ever had. Normally, the expense will keep you from stopping at a small bag.  You'd never have five pounds to work on.  Except, here it is. You'll open it and say "just a few".  I know I did.<br /><br />Hours later, you'll wonder where the bag went.  I'm positive my dog ate them, but I don't have a dog.  They can't all be in my stomach.<br /><br />Oh well.  If they are, it was $15 well spent. I've spent double on a meal I enjoyed half as much.  Can man survive on gummi bears alone?

review/summary: A Good Deal on a Great Candy
review/text: FLAVOR AND QUALITY<br />Haribo is the original Gummi Bear manufactuer, and arguably produces the best Gummi Bears.<br /><br />STORAGE<br />Gummi Bears are actually mostly water---so they can dry out and get hard.  Openned packages (if not eaten immediately, generally the case in my home), are best refrigerated in sealed packages.<br /><br />DIETARY BENEFITS<br />The main ingredient in Gummi Bears is gelatin.  Gummi Bears are essentially very thick Jello.  Many folks actually eat/drink pure gelatin (usually dissolved in warm water) for the health benefits---claimed to improve fingernails, hair, and joints.  Since I've begun making fruit-juice gelatin deserts regularly, my fingernails are less brittle, and the "lizard skin" on the backs of my hands (I'm a gezzer) seems to be getting better.<br /><br />NON-VEGAN<br />Gelatin is an animal product, not suitable for strict vegans.  Vegan brands made with starch are available<br /><br />NON-KOSHER<br />While kosher varieties are produced using only beef gelatin are available, if the package does not say it is kosher, then the Gummi Bears are probably made with pork gelatin.<br /><br />CHOKING HAZARD<br />Gummi Bears are a choking hazard for small children.  I haven't seen guidelines, but I suspect that Gummi Bears should not be given to children under 6.  There are other brands of Gummi Bears made from starch which are softer and less of a hazard.<br /><br />DO-IT-YOURSELF<br />You can make your own gummi-candy with Jello or unflavored gelatin and fruit juice.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQTD2">Knox Original Gelatin (32-Count Envelopes), Unflavored, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>  Double the basic recipe and you get "jigglers", which should be safe even for small children, and easier to digest.  Quadruple the amount of gelatin, pour the mixture into candy molds, and you get "gummi" candy.  For sweetening sour fruit juice, you can use artificial sweeteners such as spenda instead of sugar.<br /><br />ECONOMY<br />I put these on my wishlist, waiting to get up to $25 for free shipping.  Then I went to the local grocery for other things, and noticed that they sold 3 storebrand 13oz bags for $5.  That would be 78 oz for $10 which would be 12.8 cents per oz---roughly the Amazon substription price.  I didn't buy the no-name grocery store gummi bears, but I did go home and do the math.  This is a bargain compared to buying Hairbo gummi bears in single 4 or 8oz packages.  But if you are just buying bulk candy for the crumb crunchers---you may be able to do just as well at the local grocery---or your crumb cruchers may prefer more healthy fruit juice jigglers instead.

review/summary: Great gummy bears, not too great of a price.
review/text: I bought this thinking it was going to be a lot of gummy bears, just to have at work. But turns out that 5 pounds isn't as much as I thought it would be, a co-worker and I finished these in about a week. I thought $15 was a great price for the amount but it really is not. I have gone to other stores such as Target and bought some of the generic gummy bears which taste almost exactly the same for about half the price. But then if you really do like the Haribo gummy bears it is a good purchase, but if you are not picky I would suggest you buy some generic ones.

review/text: First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies. It's true. If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy! You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a "chocolate-type candy" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh and delicious. To keep them this way, I put them in two "Freezer Bags" and of course, I kept some out. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK. I bought this HUGE five pound bag!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi bears, they are a sweet and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more bears plus a few different kinds as well. We all have our favorites!

review/summary: Best in the world
review/text: Growing up, I was a connoisseur of candy (or as some might call it, "a child"). I have tasted many gummy bears over the years and none of them are as good as Haribo. I was introduced to Haribo during middle school/high school, by my German teacher. Now I'm addicted to them (and German candy in general). Haribo gummy bears are chewy but not sticky, so they don't leave sticky residue on your fingers. They're sweet but not too sweet, and the fruit flavors actually taste like the fruit they're supposed to taste like.<br /><br />A note on locating them - I find it odd that everyone seems to have trouble finding these in the United States. I don't know about the other states, but they're everywhere, here in Massachusetts. You can get them at any convenience store or Walgreens/CVS/whatever.<br /><br />And I might as well put my years of German classes to good use - the product description says that Haribo's "catch phrase" (Haribo macht Kinder froh / und Erwachsene ebenso) translates to: "Kids and grown-ups love it so / the happy world of Haribo." Actually, it translates to, literally: "Haribo makes children happy / and adults as well."

review/summary: gold bears vs goldbaren
review/text: after tasting some of the competition recommended by some of the low reviews here, I have to say that these are the best. Better flavors, actual unique flavors with each color versus just having different colors that taste all the same, and they are supposed to be hard. That's why I like them. If you want softer bears, you may not like these though. Mine were fresh, you can tell when they are not.. the outsides start to get harder/dryer and perhaps a bit white looking. This brand gets rid of that gelatin flavor that tends to be more prevalent in the cheaper store bought stuff.<br /><br />For the ones here, made in Turkey, that you will be ordering...Not super-sweet, really the perfect amount of sweetness. Good flavor profiles. Compared to the bears made in Germany, they almost have a subtle vanilla flavor to all of them, and the flavors themselves are not as potent. Honestly I love them both, but I suggest trying them both. You won't notice the vanilla hint without something to compare by, similar to having 2 monitors next to each other to calibrate the other.<br /><br />Now the goldbaren, which can be found online as well...  Their consistency, or level of chewiness, mouthfeel, is almost identical. The german bears use glucose syrup instead of fructose syrup, and have an extra flavor.. the green is actually apple. The apple flavor has grown on me since I've used up the bags I've ordered. My prefernce now leans towards the german goldbaren versus the ones made in Turkey sold here. The flavors are stronger, more in your face, and fruity. The Turkish ones are blander, with a pleasing almost vanilla taste to them that I do enjoy.<br /><br />Bottom line, try both, they are both quite good, but distinctly different as well. Buy both, or pick your favorite.

review/text: Haribo Gold Bears are the best gummi product on the market. While so many gummi products are too soft,almost mushy at times,these have enough resistance to make them truly "gummi." The flavors are nice,not too sweet.  A handful of Haribo Gold Bears will satisfy my sweet tooth the entire day. The kids love them too and 5lbs for $14 is VERY cheap. These are my favorite guilty pleasure.

review/text: Pros: It is a 5lb bag of Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears<br />Cons: It is not a 10lb bag of Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears<br /><br />These gummi bears are exactly like the ones you buy at the store for $1.20 per 5oz bag.  They're fresh, yummy and the original gummi bears. Accept no substitutes.<br /><br />Pro tip: Subscribe to get a package and save! We get ours every four months. But they certainly don't last that long.

review/summary: more of a packing issue, but important for food item.
review/text: I have ordered this gold-bears with another bag of raspberries, both are 5lb bags. When they arrived, the gold-bears bag was taped together with a clear tape. I had originally thought it was just a random piece of tape. When I looked closely, I saw the bag was cut open and the tape was sort of holding all the bears in. The bag must've accidentally got cut opened at some point and taped together before it was even packed for shipping. I was disappointed. The shipping package was not damaged at all. So it looks like some one in the Amazon packing department decided that this is safe to ship this to the customer. I contacted the customer department and they were easy to work with. I needed the candy for kids' party, they offered to ship one-day but I didn't want to risk for another damaged bag. Maybe next time I'll think twice about buying a big bag.

review/text: I don't know if I got a bad bag or what from the good reviews I have read but these were the toughest gummi bears I have ever had.  They were hard to chew to the point where your mouth would begin to hurt.  I still have about four pounds remaining after a couple months now since they aren't enjoyable to eat.  The taste isn't the greatest either unless you let them set in you mouth for a while but the toughness just makes them very unenjoyable.  Maybe its just a bad bag but I have no reason to say these are good if they weren't and that is my experience so far.

After calling customer service and receiving a replacement bag, the result was almost the same.  They were a little bit gummier but no where near the taste and softness it should have.  I recommend buying the smaller bags (5 oz) from Walmart.  At least you can select a bag that feels soft and fresh.

review/text: And by that, I mean, it's okay if you need a paper weight.  Or a door stop.  Or some other solid, inert mass.  Because as a food, Haribo gummie bears are somewhere between Friskie's Turkey & Giblets and gravel.  Haribo brand gummie bears lack flavor, gum, or bear.  They're even shaped like tiny fragments of Mount Rushmore -- doubly impressive for a German candy that never even witnessed South Dakota.<br /><br />If you need a solid gummie, go for Target's Market Pantry brand or whatever Area 51 concoction going on at Saratoga Sweets in Clifton Park, NY.  I mean, man, the banana flavor of those bears kicks your teeth right down into your sweet spot.  Double flippin' awesome.<br /><br />In closing, real Germans prefer other bears and/or hunt meisters.

review/summary: THESE ARE NOT VEGETARIAN
review/text: I saw these gummi bears in the vegetarian section.  To my amazement, they should not be here.  They contain gelatin which is an animal product and it is not vegetarian.<br /><br />Here is the definition from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Gelatin (spelled gelatine in some Commonwealth countries) is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), nearly tasteless solid substance, derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff, with E number E441. It is found in some gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some low-fat yogurt. Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.<br /><br />Buyers beware of the ingredients of products you are buying, just because it says it's vegetarian doesn't always mean it is.  Look up the ingredients just to be on the safe side.  I hope this is helpful.  Whoever posted this item as vegetarian needs to do a little more research on what ingredients are considered vegetarian.<br /><br />thank you,

No wonder they are the biggest gummy bear manufacturer in the world (based in Germany).  It is not too sticky that it glues your teeth.  Not too sweet neither.  Just the right combination of flavors to taste.<br /><br />Just FYI: 5 oz bag has 3.5 servings, with each serving at 140 calories, 10% carbo, 21g sugar, and 3g of protein.  A serving is about 17 pieces of gummies.

review/summary: A Great Tasting Candy
review/text: Was very happy with these candy bears. Since I bought the 5 lb bag, I froze what I couldn't use and they quickly thawed when I wanted to enjoy some more. However, if you freeze them, I would suggest you put them in smaller portions in several baggies as they harden together in the freezer. Once they thaw they are fresh and good tasting.

review/summary: Buyer Beware...
review/text: While there is nothing wrong with these, please keep in mind that Haribo gummies purchased in different countries have drastically different ingredients. These are considered healthy snacks in Germany because they are made with real fruit juice. Even the Haribo brand gummies purchased in the U.S. are not made with fruit juice. So, while I'm disappointed that I can't get what my niece has the privilege of eating in Germany, this is the best gummi in the U.S.

review/summary: Haribos are the BEST, however....
review/text: Haribos are my all-time favorite gummy bears.  I was really excited that it came in such a big amount.  HOWEVER, when the gummy bears arrived, they didn't taste or feel fresh.  When I first opened them, it was hard and chewy.  I guess it's always best to buy in person and feel them before you buy them. =)

review/summary: Rubber Bears
review/text: I had purchased these supposed gummy bears in the store and they were great. I figured since buying so many I would go for the bigger bag. Bad mistake. They are very very rubbery, not fresh like the store. I also purchase the licorice wheels which I must say are excellent. We never know how long these items are in stock on a site like this. The licorice was a back order so I imagine they were made fresh.

review/summary: Overall Pretty Good
review/text: The quality of the gummy bears is great, I'd give that five stars. The only problem I had with the product is that the bag came ripped open and inside another bag. I did weigh the bag on a digital scale and did the math, and I'm only missing about ten or so gummy bears, so obviously not something to complain about. I was a bit worried that they'd be stale with the bag being ripped, but they were fine. They were actually softer and chewier than some of the smaller bags I find at grocery stores.

review/summary: Pretty Good Gummi Bears
review/text: These are pretty good gummi bears.  They are as good as any I've had by other manufacturers, like Black Forest.<br /><br />The gummi quality is nice, not too hard or chewy.  They have nice bite rebound, and the flavors are both organic-tasting and satisfying.<br /><br />There seem to be more yellow and straw-colored bears than many other mixes, and I suppose this is where the whole "Golden" moniker is from.<br /><br />These gummi bears could be the best in the world, but since I have only limited bear experience from which to draw upon, can only say they're as I expected, but did not exceed my expectations.

review/summary: My favorite gummi candy
review/text: This my friends is the king of Gummi Bears. I remember being a little kid and rejoicing when my parents bought me one of those small bags of golden gummies. Now that I'm an adult with my own money, and access to 5 pound bags at a low cost I'm in a very dangerous position.<br /><br />Basic economics will tell you that the marginal utility you receive goes down as you consume more and more of a product. If you crave a hamburger, you might eat 1 burger and be in heaven, eat another hamburger and be in ecstasy, and eat a third and be happy. But by the 20th hamburger you wouldn't want to eat beef for a year.<br /><br />Sadly this is not the case with these gummies. Everything about these gummies is great. It has a nice hard chewy texture which I love. Unlike cheap gummies where the different colors means a different color dye, Haribo gummies are all unique delicious flavors.<br /><br />This is not a review. This is a warning. For the sake of your waist line, stay away!!<br /><br />You will run a train on these chewy delights. NOM NOM NOM 5 pounds gone time to order more. What's that? Discount for subscription orders? Don't mind if I do!

review/text: Haribo has always made great gummi bears.  In fact, I believe they are the originators of the gummi bear (right after WWII).  Often copied, but never surpassed.<br /><br />For those not in the know, these gummi bears are chewier/not as soft as their competitors, and has great flavor.  It's also much cheaper to buy them in bulk like this, instead of buying them in their smaller packaging.<br /><br />If you buy these, just sit back and enjoy. :-)

review/text: Oh.my.god.  A five pound bag of Haribo gummi bears.  My wife thought I was having one of those big-box moments when I bought these, thinking we would never finish the bad in months.  I bought it for the kids, though, not me!  Right!  Right?  Right.  It has been a week, and the bag is already half empty.  The kids, well, they have had ten.  I had to sneak them to work to hide my cravings.  They are so, so little.  And cute.  And sweet, but not too sweet.  And they stand so nicely on my desk.  And have just enough resistance when you bite into them.  No where did I put that bag....

review/summary: So many... so many little gold bears!!!
review/text: Who needs five pounds of gummi bears?  I didn't think I did, but how wrong I was.  The bag is huge.<br /><br />If you peruse the one star reviews, a lot of people say these aren't as good as the retail packages, that they're hard or that they melted in transit.  I just wanted to say that the package I got is just as good as the Haribo Gold Bears in the labeled packages and that they were just as soft.  They were also delivered in 80-90 degree heat and didn't have any problems with melting.  I also wanted to mention that the bag I got was manufactured in Turkey... they may differ a bit from country, but these were fine.<br /><br />If you have any reservations due to the bad reviews, don't.  These are great... just make sure you don't eat them all at once!

review/summary: How can these be so perfect??
review/text: When we were kids, all we cared about when thinking of candy was how sweet it was. We never cared about the flavor really, or even texture. I remember eating these tubes of sugary sour blue goo from a tube.<br /><br />Haribo 'Gold Bag' gummy bears should be winning awards left and right for the taste, texture, and just overall appeal. Even at 28 years old, I routinely clean out the local 7-11 because these things are just so adictiing. I always have to tell the cashier 'oh, they're for the kids.'<br /><br />The texture of these guummy bears is perfectly firm. They have an explosive flavor, too. Lots of other gummy bears are too big and too mushy, and they have a odd plastic kinda of taste. These are in a league of their own. They're good if you leave them in the fridge for a little too. They're also good to just suck on.<br /><br />I don't know how else to describe these. I'll just say, I'm not a picky eater and I'm not picky about whether I'll only eat one brand of something over another..... Except these. I will NOT eat other gummy bears.<br /><br />Haribo or nothing! Get them, you won't regret it!

review/summary: I hated gummie bears until................................
review/text: I've never liked gummie bears.  One day recently while paying at our favorite restaurant I decided to get a small bag of gummie bears to try.  They were pretty good so I decided to see what was available on Amazon.  I ordered a bag of the Haribo Gummi bears and was hooked.  Even hubby loves them.  We went through a 5 lb bag in just a few days.  I decided to go ahead and order 2 more bags.  Then I decided that they wouldn't last very long and ordered 2 more bags.  Now I'm well stocked.  When I get down to 1 bag I'll be placing my next order.<br /><br />The flavor is superb!!!!  You won't be disappointed. Each flavor is distinct and doesn't blend with the others.  Each bite is enjoyable.  Another good thing is they don't stick to your teeth.  I've had a lot of major dental work and was afraid I'd be picking them off of my teeth and haven't had to.<br /><br />Order some and if you don't like them you can return them.  I bet you'll enjoy them to the point you'll be ordering another bag very quickly.  I know when my granddaughters come I'll have to make sure and order extra so that they can enjoy them also.

review/summary: Best type of gummy bear!
review/text: If you really want good gummy bears, you can't really get any better than the "gold" standard, Haribo Gold-Bears. I have always found these gummy bears to have a step up in flavor and possess just the right amount of chewiness- not too stiff, but not too soft either. On top of all this, Amazon offers a great price in terms of value. If you were to buy the equivalent amount of gummy bears in 5 oz. bags for around $1.50 each, you would end up spending $24 as opposed to the roughly $15 that Amazon charges. On the flip side, willpower is probably a good quality to possess before purchasing, seeing as a five pound bag doesn't offer much in the way of deterrence from binging. Also, make sure to store these bears in an airtight or almost airtight bag, or they will become stiffer as they lose moisture. Overall though, a great value purchase for the best gummy bear available!

review/text: Because the price is so reasonable at Amazon.com, I ordered two five-pound bags of these wonderful gummi bears. They arrived this week and are so fresh and tasty that I don't think anyone can stop eating just a small handful. These are very fresh, have excellent flavor and are almost like thirst quenchers.<br /><br />I take a few moments to repackage them in small, doubled, plastic food bags. I use a small, plastic scoop to put them in the bags, and store them in larger bags to keep them fresh until the supply is depleted.<br /><br />When I make frosted cupcakes, I generally stand a couple atop each cupcake then watch as family or guests grab one at a time daintily between thumb and finger and pop them into their mouth.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for making these available to your customers.

review/text: I purchased *five pounds* of gummi bears because I've had Haribo gummi bears before and really enjoyed them, plus the price can't be beat (usually just five ounces is two to three dollars, imagine getting five whole pounds for fifteen dollars!).<br /><br />I was very uncertain buying gummi bears online, because I wasn't sure if I would get cruddy old stale gummi bears that endanger your teeth and taste of old wax.<br /><br />That was not the case with me.  I purchased the gummi bears on Jan 27 2009.  I received them on Jan 30 2009.  They were fresh and squishy, and well packaged.  They shipped from Indianapolis and arrived in DC three days later.  Terrific.<br /><br />Too bad you have to buy two bags to get free shipping, now I have 10 pounds of candy lying around!

review/text: I love gummi bears and these are by far the best!  I would have never thought that there are big differences between gummi bears, but there are. Some are too sweet, too mushy, too chewy, too sticky, etc.  These bears are just right.  Germany carries some of the best candies and chocolates and these gummi bears are the best of the bunch!  If I order 5 pounds gummi bears, I will eat 5 pounds in a short amount of time, so I cannot order from Amazon.  I have to get them in a retail store and get one small bag at a time, otherwise I will gain lots of weight in gummi bears!
