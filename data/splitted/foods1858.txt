This product didn't have an image and I didn't read the product carefully - after all I went into K-cups - why would there be another product in K-cups or why wasn't there an image.  Also didn't read that this item is nonreturnable.  Now I have coffee that I can't use.  Lesson learned - don't order when there is no image available and read the fine print!

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: The metal ring around the container will make buzzing sound while the item being microwaved.  It's a little scary but I can't get rid of the metal ring.<br /><br />The heated beefaroni is tasty, not too salty (got lots of salt but not to a point to burn my lips) and having decent flavor.<br /><br />Don't expect anything gourmet.  It's just a quick 220 calorie savory snack.  I put a few in the office in case I got hungry.  I have yet to eat it without heating but I think it should taste OK without heating.  In that case, it can be a good backpacking or hiking fuel source.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/summary: Too Messy
review/text: While these taste good, they are far too messy. I am consistently challenged by them in attempting to avoid both (1) getting crumbling granola all over my desk and floor and (2) having the chocolate melt all over my fingers. I have had granola bars my whole life and I am well aware of the crumbs they can generate--but these bars will send granola flying just by opening the wrapper and the chocolate on these bars melts instantly upon any bodily contact (like fingers). I bought these as a snack of convenience, which they most definitely are not.

review/summary: Dark chocolate?  Not really!
review/text: I had to try this flavor immediately when I discovered it in my local grocery store.  I love dark chocolate.<br /><br />The product tastes fine, but make no mistake that it's not a dark chocolate coating.  It's just a regular chocolate.  It should still be fine for regular chocolate lovers, but for me it's too sweet.  You can actually see that it's not dark chocolate as the color is light brown.

review/summary: Very good taste, but contains high "maltose" corn syrup!
review/text: A friend brought these to a party, and we all LOVED them.  They taste fantastic.  I was about to buy them at Costco, and stopped to read the ingredients.  They contain high maltose corn syrup, and that surprised me.  I have been researching this additive, and it doesn't seem to be AS bad as high "fructose" corn syrup (though research is limited), but is a corn syrup nonetheless.  It also goes by maltodextrin or malt sugar, and is the primary sugar used in beer. More information is available on the web and at [...]<br />Read about it and decide for yourselves.  As for me, I choose to avoid another questionable ingredient(that is way too close to high fructose corn syrup) until proven otherwise. Too bad, because these granola thins were delicious.

review/text: I knew I would love these things. they are so cute, fit easily into a purse or lunchbox and they are quite filling (as as snack) despite the thin granola. I would agree that the chocolate is most certainly not dark---more like milk and if it gets warm (in your hometown) you should pop them in the fridge before you head out. I noticed that a few of my portable ones melted. But it was no biggie and I really enjoyed them. The item arrived on time and I will certainly order them again.

review/summary: Could they possibly waste more packaging?
review/text: I didn't realize each would be individually wrapped or I wouldn't have bought it, too much waste and too much mess spills when you open. I also don't taste dark chocolate, and it says milk right on the ingredients, so I think they're full of it. I have to eat over the garbage can because everything spills, then wash my hands because the incredibly thin layer of milk chocolate melts immediately. Refrigerated, it's not nearly as bad, but that's silly for a simple snack.<br /><br />As a single, it's entirely unsatisfying. It's so small that it's almost inert, it does nothing to stave off hunger or bring back alertness. They should have packed two to a pack, that would at least put a dent in it, while still being at comparable to all of their other bars; buy one of them instead. Just assume you'll need two at a time. Hey, there's such a thing as too few calories.<br /><br />What amazes me is that the label contains four different sugars: One sucrose, and three different ways of saying maltodextrin. Obviously NV believes consumers are stupid and will gladly try to hide the actual level of sugars (it would be the first ingredient if all four were added together).<br /><br />Note that they've just started selling boxes of 48 instead of 36 in stores, so Amazon might get them soon.

review/summary: Yummy, with a low calorie chocolate fix!
review/text: I buy both the chocolate and the peanut butter flavors regularly.  The chocolate are very hard to find in my area so I order them through Amazon 3rd party and have always had success.  I also buy the peanut butter from Amazon and opt for the extra discount using Subscribe & Save (the discount makes them taste all the better).  Yes, they will both melt a bit.  I keep mine in the refrigerator - some at home and some at work.  Before I open the package I break them into four pieces and then tear the wrapper down the middle and fold it back so it serves as a "plate".  This takes care of the mess, gives me four mini-treats and keeps the leftover crumbles in one place.  I then put the crumbles in yogurt or on strawberries or in my hand to eat.  Calories are reasonable - they are 90 on the peanut butter and I believe the same on the chocolate.  If you need a chocolate or peanut butter fix and don't want to eat a 280 calorie candy bar, I would recommend these little treats.

Don't try to eat these on the run it will be all over you. Open with scissors to prevent crumbling and eat over something like a paper towel or plate. The chocolate melts the second you touch it so you might want to keep in frig.<br />Overall they are just okay in taste & texture, some of them accually taste a little stale possily from faulty wrapping. You might find there not worth the trouble for the price.

review/text: My cat eats 1/2 3 oz can of fancy feast in the morning and the other half at night.  He also eats turkey, beef and chicken and plain yogurt from the table.  So I wanted to give him a high quality dry food -- 1/2 cup morning and 1/2 cup night -- to ensure that he was getting all the feline nutrition he needs.  The shelter had given me 4 different kinds of dry food and he would only eat one and it had byproducts in it . . . so I tried mixing a bit of this with his food.  At first he ignored it, but as the percentage of this food got higher, I noticed some of it disappearing.  Within a week he was eating this food with relish.  He complains when his dish is nearly empty and rushes right over to eat some when I fill his bowl.

review/text: These fruit snacks taste pretty good. One nice thing is that there are a lot of flavors mixed in there, so there's good variety. The flavors are pretty subtle though. Also they are very tough to chew. They give your jaw a good workout, but that really wasn't what I was looking for in a snack. The packages are quite small (only 0.8 oz each). I suppose that could be a good thing if you're trying to lose weight, or if you're giving a snack to a five-year-old, but one package of these is not enough to really affect my appetite in any way.<br /><br />I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015236MG">Kellogg's Fruity Snacks</a> over this brand. They have a stronger flavor, are easier to chew, and come in a package that is big enough for an adult-sized snack.

review/text: I bought this at Bev Mo last month, really due to finding Qtonic months ago there and enjoying it so much.  QGinger doesn't disappoint at all, has a great ginger taste, and a kick from probably the real ginger and from the coriander and other spices.  Once again, like in the tonic one of the best things is the calories are only 60/serv which really is nice to have less calories per serving if you are drinking like a pop.<br /><br />The kids loved the taste as well, I don't think they even knew what a real ginger ale should taste like.  The agave works as a good sweetner as well for kids, the sweetness reminds me a little of tasting the Coke of old when using real sugar instead of the corn syrup.<br /><br />In the end, great taste, low calories, and makes a great Dark and Stormy or is great alone over ice.<br /><br />I'm glad to see Amazon carrying.

review/text: This is the most refreshing ginger ale on the market. Hands down. It's light, yet spicy and thirst quenching all at the same time, and without loads of calories like many of the ginger beers out there. It can stand up to whiskey, though I prefer it on its own. After each bottle, it leaves me wanting more. I'm definitely hooked and will be drinking a lot of Q Ginger this summer!

review/summary: Wow, so THIS is how a ginger beverage is supposed to taste!
review/text: To compare this to ginger ale misses the point entirely, but its the only way I can.  I've always loved ginger ale, but after tasting this (thank goodness I got the 24 pack!) I will never be able to drink another produce that has the name "ginger" in it.  It tastes clean, crisp and, well, like actual ginger.  The fact that it is made in the US and owned by a small business (I heard an interview of the owner and after hearing how they made the product, I went out and bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VTG7RC">Q Tonic Soda Water (Pack of 24)</a> - also a great product) made this an easy purchase.

Only recently did I learn of craft, "Q"uality beverages in this category.  I took a flyer on this and was very, very surprised.  All the ingredients, flavors, etc. meld perfectly and create a uni"Q"e taste you are bound to enjoy.<br /><br />Take my word for it and give it a try... goes great on it's own or as a mixture in cocktails (which definitely ups your bar cred)!

review/text: I have drank the Q Tonic water and it is worth the price.  So when I saw that they make a Ginger Ale I knew I would give it a try.  If you like Canadian Dry Ginger Ale than Q Ginger is not for you.  But if you like fresh complex tastes and a real authentic ginger ale than you will love the Q.  The giner is the key ingredient but does not over power it is very refreshing.  I drink mine with Makers Mark and I have made this drink for several people who loved the drink but had no idea that it was mixed with the Q as it tastes so different than cheap store bought ginger ale.  I really like and will continue to use this as the only giner ale that I will drink with my Makers Mark.

review/text: This is the most amazing ginger ale ever.  I've recently been suffering from serious nausea in my first trimester of pregnancy.  Many books recommend ginger to ease the stomach during this time as you really can't take any meds.  I've searched for something fizzy and suitable to drink but all the ingredients include high fructose corn syrup and preservatives or loads of sugar!  This is just the right size and only 60 calories, sweetened with organic agave.  What more could you ask for?  Plus there's a bit more ginger, which helps!

review/summary: Too many mediocre Ginger Ale/Beers have jumped on bandwagon
review/text: This is another example of a mediocre at best ginger ale dressed up with fancy packaging at a ridiculous price while not even coming close the complexity or intensity of many of the better Ginger Beers. Unfortunately, Amazon places you in a paradox in buying some of the better ones. The top two aren't carried by Amazon at all but Amazon does carry some decent ones. Aside from the two that are 5 star and will go unnamed as they are already too difficult to get AND sticking w/ those that have free shipping since w/o free shipping, you are likely to pay well more for the s/h than the actual product.<br /><br />Loathe that I am to admit it, Bruce Cost's is pretty good-not nearly as good as it should be given the alternatives and he screws some them up with flavoring, which; to my mind is like taking Peet's French Roast and trying to get a hazelnut/vanilla flavor to it. But he fancies himself the guru of all things Asian (as far as I know, he is the only one who shares that opinion)and the rhizome ginger is Asian so he makes a 12 pack and charges $50 for it. All of the British ginger ale is no better than Canada Dry (who used absolutely no ginger in its ginger ale until the past couple of years)so skip the Fever Tree. Bermuda Ginger Beer is frequently very good and Amazon has had a few. I believe Regatta is from Bermuda but as a form of torture with which Tantalus would be familiar, Amazon generally offers the Diet with free shipping and the stuff that tastes good with exorbitant shipping. Blenheim is a marketing campaign, they know that many of the better ginger beers are spicy so they make a spectrum of spicy GBs, but they are one dimensional, heat only. Two of the better known brands, Reed's and Boylan's don't appeal to me. When they were the only premium GBs on the market, I drank them but i don't think either makes the top ten anymore. Two good ones in bottles that Amazon carries w/o s/h are Saranac & Eli's, neither are cheap but it's delivered to your door and includes what we in CA have to pay as CRV and s/h are generally free. Now for the best deals Amazon offers. Bottles are expensive to ship so that cost will, to some extent at least, be built in somewhere. In some cases it's worth it. The two best bottled GBs that Amazon carries that are usually free s/h are 1) A J Stephen's (sp?) and 2) Cock & Bull which, urban legend has it as being brewed specifically for the Brown Derby restaurant,an LA icon and is called for by name in a cocktail named the Moscow Mule. Can's are significantly cheaper to ship and I have 3 recommendations for them. I keep a variety of strengths of ginger juice, grated fresh ginger, & ginger syrup so I can sometimes salvage a GB that is a little too bland. That is the case with Santa Cruz organic GB, it's almost good (by which I mean far better than Schwepps or Canada Dry but not top tier. If you have some ginger extracts around you can get it pretty good. Occasionally, Amazon will have the Ginger People's product with free shipping. That's definitely worth a look as it has pieces of ginger still floating in it. The single best deal on Amazon, in my estimation, is Barr's. It's canned so you can get a reasonably priced 24 pack, usually with free S/H. The problem is that Amazon is more often sold out than not. I probably wouldn't have mentioned it if I didn't already have 3 cases en route to my house. I haven't seen it often enough to get around to studying it's heritage but it's the best tasting canned ginger beer I've ever had-and at a great price. I think the single best deal for consuming on a daily basis is Vernors. I occasionally can find it on sale at $2.99 a six pack. I don't think I've ever seen a great deal on Amazon but if they offered free shipping on Vernors, I'd probably get a couple cases a month. It's a little sweet and not really gingery/pungent as the best but can be a great deal.<br /><br />I confess to knowing not very much about Jamaican GB. I've tried Idris and it's pretty good. Most of the Jamaican stuff on Amazon seems to be in 64 oz. 1/2 gallons, plastic and I'm not too fond of that. Well that my not very humble opinion.I'm going to have a 12 oz. bottle of my favorite. I'm not going to share the name online but if I get an email (besides hate mail) I'll tell you. Of course I may be the only one in this country this fanatical about a soft drink so I won't expect an overflowing in box. Do yourself a favor, though, skip Canada Dry - unless you need a mixer or have a sick kid.

review/text: I'm not a huge soda drinker, but I do enjoy Ginger Ale.  The Q-Ginger ginger soda is all and all pretty refreshing and comes in the just right serving size of 8oz.  Keep in mind that not all the bottles are filled to the same level so the serving size does tend to vary a little bit from bottle to bottle.<br /><br />My only real complaint with Q-Ginger is the spicy kick of the pepper they add.  Ginger can be spicy enough on its own and I feel like the spiciness of the pepper was unnecessary and gives it just a tad too much unnatural feeling bite.  Still a good drink by any means.

review/summary: It's got a Ginger twist
review/text: I love having Ginger Ale to drink especially when my stomach isn't feeling well so I tried to purchase this and see how I would like it. It was nothing like I imagined it to taste like. It has a real taste to the actual ginger root and I was highly disappointed because it was nothing like what I expected especially with all the positive reviews. So Buyer Beware that this product has that ginger root taste to it. And now I am stuck with the bulk that I purchased, so I'll look into giving it away to friends who may enjoy it.<br /><br />I got this sadly comment back from some bored person:<br />Nowhereman says:<br /><br />Six of your eight reviews are one star. Perhaps it is merely poor judgment in purchasing decision making. Maybe you need to see someone for Postpartum depression. Any attempt at defensive rebuttal might help provide insight into the psychological origins of this hostility and help a professional to diagnose if you need education or treatment. Run, don't walk to caregivers. They can help you sort it out as I am uniquely unqualified to pinpoint the exact nature of the problem. It would not hurt to take English as a second language in either case.<br /><br />My take on your reply to my review: TOO BAD, if you don't like what you read you are free to move on. I don't post reviews for entertainment purposes as you seem to be evaluating and insulting comments posted. Before you judge someone from a petty post of review please keep in mind it does not give you the person's lifestyle nor psychological origins. I work in the medical field so if anyone needs help that is for you to seek, I also have two special needs children so please education does run deep in this household. Keep your comments to yourself. Sadly after what you have posted it's obvious you are in need of some Jesus and the love you lack in life. God Bless!

review/summary: An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee
review/text: One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like "I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the "Original Donut Blend" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those "special" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).

My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good.

review/text: I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?

review/summary: If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee
review/text: I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to "double brew" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.

review/text: I have been ordering Xango mangosteen juice for  nearly 4 years, and was pleasantly surprised to see it on Amazon.com.  I saved approximately $15 in shipping, which was very nice!  I will continue to order the Xango mangosteen juice in the hopes of preventing colds, cancer, and chronic disease because of all of the antioxidant benefits in it!  Thank you Amazon.com for being so diverse in what you sell!

review/summary: Sour tamarind paste for Asian/Indian cooking
review/text: I use a tablespoons or two of tamarind paste in Indian and Thai dishes - it adds a distinctive sour flavor to Asian dishes. Tamicon brand tamarind paste is concentrated and keeps for up to 6 months in the fridge after openingm making it a good bargain here on Amazon.<br /><br />It's very sour, so don't eat it out of the container.  It's meant to be added to other foods.

review/summary: OH MAH GAH! This tea is sooooo good!
review/text: Wow. Finally an organic white tea I totally LOVE!<br /><br />Firstly, this is so super-fresh and you don't get a weak cup of tea from one tea-bag (definitely no skimping in that department). I think the packaging of the tea-bags in individual plastic wraps rather than paper definitely help with the freshness factor.<br /><br />Secondly, this is super mild on your tummy even on an empty stomach. I can drink a cup of tea with a little honey while fasting and not feel ill.<br /><br />Thirdly, I can even drink this in the evening without getting caffeine jitters even though it does have a small amount of caffeine (admittedly, the characters in my dreams are a bit more energetic though, but, not too much as to startle me awake).<br /><br />Fourthly, this tea is very unassuming flavor-wise and can be easily blended with other teas to your personal liking.<br /><br />In udda woids, this is some really awesome tea!<br /><br />And, with that being said...<br /><br />Tasty tea to all and to all some tasty tea!

review/summary: clean taste at a great price
review/text: I switched to white tea from black tea. Unlike green tea, this white tea does not have a grassy taste which I don't care for. It also does not have the bitterness of regular black tea. This is real white tea, not a blend with green or black tea. Overall it has a nice clean and light taste. I drink a lot of cups of tea every day. My teeth stained very easily with the black tea but the white tea has only a minimal, if any staining effect. You also don't end up with the black rings in your tea cups that you can barely remove. It is a lot of tea bags for the price and as an added bonus it is also organic. The bags are individually sealed in plastic pouches. The only negative I can think of is the quality of the bags themselves. The string sometimes comes off and I have had a few plastic pouches with tea leaves in them but no bag. However, the quality of the tea itself makes up for it.

review/text: Peeled Snacks Cherry is *very* tasty.  They are like soft, juicy, extra plump raisins, but with the distinct flavor of cherry.  The Packs are a convenient size for travel, and are a built in limit to the tendency to over-indulge.<br /><br />That said, the cost isn't bad for a travel pack, but for a household staple it's pricey.  It would be nice to have the option to buy it in bulk at a more economical price.  I almost downgraded it a star for that reason; but I must admit it might be difficult to maintain the perfect flavor and texture achieved in the travel pack.<br /><br />Taste it to believe it!

review/text: Finally a snack food that is healthy, tasty, convenient and perfect for seniors. Whoever thought out this product had me in mind! I want something that I can have in my tennis bag, pocket or car that is really fresh and tasty. What a pleasure to have dried fruit that is really moist and flavorful. I hate those dried rinds that most trail mixes contain. This product is more like a "luxury mix" than those trail mixes. At this point in my life I really would like to spend more time in the "mansion" than out on the trail! What is really nice about this product is that the freshness and taste is consistant. You really do not get tired of this snack. For those of use a little bit around the age bend, this is the first really appropriate snack I have tried. (If the grandkids don't get there first!) Good job, Peeled Snacks!

review/summary: Part of a Elmo Birthday Party Favor bag!
review/text: All kids and adults love the Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers - I know I do and I'm 43 y/o! I'm writing this review even before I get them in.  I bought these individual packages to put in my son's Elmo themed birthday party favors bags to give to the kids that attend it. Since Elmo and his best friend, Dorothy (who is a goldfish), I thought that would be a cute idea.
