review/summary: Very strong aged Gouda
review/text: This cheese has a very strong flavor since it is aged very long. Almost too strong for my taste, but otherwise a very excellent cheese, as you would expect an imported cheese from Holland to be. So if you like aged Gouda then give this a try.

review/text: This syrup is one of the best I have ever tried of any brand and flavor hands down! Not too sweet as the others said but still perfectly sweet with just the right amount of coconut flavor. Hats off to you Amoretti for getting this syrup so perfectly perfect! It works great as a half pump in a shot of espresso or cup of strong coffee and as a 1 1/2 pump iced latte flavoring making it not only delicious but a value!

review/summary: Nice!
review/text: Great flavor.  it faintly taste of coconut, but not so faint that you cannot taste the coconut.  It is pretty amazing to find a coffee syrup that is so flavorful yet with half of the calories.  Most of the syrups that I find have 60+ calories which discourages me from purchasing them.  Not to mention how sugary sweet watered down they are.  Amoretti syrups, are surprising not thin.  They actually seem like true syrups: thick yet thin.  I can not wait to mix this flavor with others to create brand new concoctions.  Maybe next I will combine coconut with caramel and white chocolate!

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: Not much to say other than that this is a really good tasting coconut syrup for iced mochas and I imagine lots of other things as well.  A little goes a long way and I recommend reading their little instruction pamphlet that lets you know how many pumps to use for different kinds of drinks.  I also noticed it has considerably less calories per pump than similar syrups but the same amount of flavor without tasting wierd or chemically so that is a big bonus for those of us watching our weight who still want to enjoy our summer iced coffee drinks. ;-)  I will definitely be ordering other flavors from this company in the future especially when it comes time for Fall and those pumpkin spice latte's! :-)  Very happy with quick delivery, large bottle size and great service, really nice informative brochure in the box as well.  2 thumbs up!

review/summary: OLD??? HARD AS A ROCK!!!
review/text: I have been buying Sweet Potato and Yam treats for my 3 dogs for the past year or two. My dogs love them so we make sure we always have a good supply on hand. I purchased these particular treats from this particular supplier because the price was a bit less than usual. However, they are so HARD that even my big dog has a hard time chewing them!! And my older small dog will not even try to chew them, though they are his favorite treat. This is the second time I ordered this product from this supplier and both orders were the same, the treats are too hard for the dogs to chew!! I ordered a second time hoping I just got a bad batch from them or something. However, both orders were the same, too hard for the dogs to chew!! I don't know if they have been allowed to sit around and get old and hard, or what. All I do know for sure is that I will not be ordering any more items from this supplier!! It's not cheap if you have to throw it away in the end!!

review/summary: MAY BE DANGEROUS! Product developed white mold!
review/text: I bought these imported sweet potato chips because they are less than half the price of SAM'S YAMS which are my dog's favorite treats. The first bag seemed fine, but the stored bags all developed what appears to be a silvery white mold, although the expiration date is December, 2013. I have no idea if this could be dangerous to dogs, but I tossed mine out, because we have had terrible problems with food poisoning of our pets from imported ingredients.<br /><br />If anyone else has had this experience I would like to know if the white stuff is natural or is, in fact, dangerous.

review/text: We've tried several types of sweet potato treats but this is the best we've found so far, mainly because it's the only one our yorkie will eat:) Others are so hard/rubbery you can't even cut them with a knife. This brand is chewable for bigger dogs and tearable for our yorkie plus she loves the flavor. My only concern is that the product is made in China but the ingredients seem pure.

review/summary: Healthy Veggie Dog Treat
review/text: When you are looking for a Organic Veggie Treat for your Dog. This is a very good one. It is Rubbery Veggie slice that the dog loves to chew.<br />Do not give too many in a days time or you will have a loose orange stool to take care of. So 1 or 2 a day is best. I also found that although the puppies love to chew them if you give them more than 1 a day their baby teeth/gums become painful.<br />I switched to the Sweet potato fries for my puppies to keep away from the gum/tooth pain. My adult dogs Love the chips.<br />Great change from all the other Meat-additive treats out there.

review/summary: Product may be dangerous
review/text: Healthy Pets reports that sick dogs who have eaten sweet potato snacks show symptoms similar to Fanconi syndrome, "a condition in which the tubules of the kidneys don't function properly."  According to Healthy Pets, products implicated in anecdotal accounts include:<br /><br />Beefeaters Sweet Potato Snacks for Dogs<br />Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good Dog Treats<br />Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality<br /><br />According to Becky Lundgren, DVM, of the Veterinary Information Network, "Anecdotal reports from veterinarians indicate similar concerns about sweet potato pet treats made in China. Although no evidence is available that these sweet potato treats cause kidney issues similar to those related to chicken jerky treats, pet owners should be aware of the possibility."<br /><br />You certainly should. A prudent course of action that every shopper should take is simply looking for a "Made in China" label on any package of treats, and, if finding one, returning it to the shelf.

review/summary: Made in China!
review/text: This product deserves no stars.<br /><br />I read ingredients SO carefully. In my local pet store I decided to get my boys something different and bought them this treat. Checked the ingredients and they seemed fine. Brand is "Beefeaters USA". After a few weeks my dog was vomiting, had bloody stool, and drinking a lot of water. Five hundred dollars later after xrays and blood panels he came back cancer-free and with nothing blocking his system.<br /><br />Puzzled, I googled some of the brands of treats I was feeding them, and information on the organic dog food I feed them. Beefeaters is made in China AND is on the list of tainted dog treats. Thinking it was only chicken jerky I did not think to check.<br /><br />I learned the hard way. I will now either make their treats or make sure it is safe before buying.

review/summary: yummy treat
review/text: My little dog loves sweet potatoes, so this seemed like the perfect treat.  The 'chips' weren't what I expected, but she loves them.  The 'chips' are big slices of sweet potato, and are soft, not crunchy.  I was disappointed at first, but Misha begs for them, so that's what counts!  The slices are too big for my little girl, but cutting them into smaller sizes isn't a problem.  Will definitely order again!  It's a shame they are made in China, but I guess they are too expensive to make in America.  They are irradiated (according to the FDA - Food irradiation is the process of exposing food to ionizing radiation to destroy microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, or insects that might be present in the food.) so they are safe for our four-legged babies.

review/text: Our family dog, a 5 year old (human years) Shih Tzu didn't take to this at first. It took a good week before he would try it. After he tried it, he was all over it. He's allergic to everything so it was nice to find a treat that he could eat. We found this at Pet Smart and got the clear plastic bucket (about one pound of treats). It's lasted him about 8 months now--serving it to him about 2-3 times a week ahout 2-5 of these treats each time. We'll be getting him so more of these. He's pretty happy when he gets these.

review/text: This is my favorite thing to feed my 11 year old aussie for a chew.  Her canines have become pretty worn, partially because she developed a habit of chewing her way out of chain link kennels about 5 years ago (which I no longer keep her in) but also because I used to give her very hard chews when she was younger.  I still give her a chew in the evening but it is always something pretty soft.  I like the Sam's Yamz but they are pretty pricey and then I found these!  I purchased my supply from Amazon which is perhaps I didn't have the same experience as the previous reviewer with them being pretty hard. The pieces in the bag I got were very soft and chewy.  With free shipping these are a great deal and don't wear done my dog's teeth!

If your dog goes on the neighbor's yard that's good but we all know the pain of picking up soft poop.  I guess it all comes down to how much you love you mut.<br /><br />I only give each about 1 or 2 a day and thier fine.  If your dog likes these, then try giving them raw sweet potatoes or sweet potatoes that have been semi cooked in microwave.  My dogs eat them as it was the beef or turkey jerky.

I'm on a low-carb diet and these snack come in quite handy when I'm craving something salty and crunchy.  I usually keep a few bags of these in my car for to snack on during my drives.  I must warn that these snack are very salty though so I do limit the amount of these I'll eat.  Some people may have a difficult time with the texture.  It's almost like eating that little bit of overcooked cheese that oozed out into the pan the last time you made a grilled cheese sandwich.  It's crunchy but not oily.  It took a little getting used to, but now I can't get enough of them.  :)

review/text: I like cheese. I like bacon. How could I go wrong with these snacks? Well, by not checking the nutritional information, for one thing. Each two-serving bag offers a quarter of the RDA of sodium! But even that could be excused and the snacks doled out sparingly if they were at all yummy. But they taste exactly like you'd expect something that supplied one-quarter of your RDA supply of salt to taste: practically inedible. I got through one tiny bag in the course of a week and am trying to decide how to dispose of the rest. I'd feel guilty even giving them to a food bank, and I certainly don't want a yard of hypertensive squirrels on my conscience. Foul! Save your money.

The rainbow chips don't discolor the white frosting when applied to warm cakes/cookies;  they hold their shape and color.

review/summary: Berry Detox -- Bitter and Buzzy
review/text: This tea has an unpleasant taste. I'm not sure why people say it is mild and smooth.<br /><br />Smelling the tea bag, you can get a whiff of the bitterness of some of the herbs. That bitterness is what you end up tasting after steeping the tea. It's a sharp, pungent taste mixed with more subtle berry flavors, and it is none too pleasant on the taste buds going down. I take my herbal teas without sweeteners because they don't typically need them, I just like to enjoy the flavor, but in this case, the flavor is not appealing at all.<br /><br />As equally surprising is the immediate effect upon drinking the tea: I feel a little "buzzy" and discombobulated, and it makes me feel pressure in my forehead and temples, almost as though the tea is dilating the blood vessels in my head (almost feels like a pre-migraine symptom set, but without the migraine). This begins after a few sips and lasts for about 1-2 hours after finishing the tea.<br />Whatever herbs are in this tea seem to have a big effect on me physiologically, and keep in mind that no herbal tea has affected me in this way before (and I've tried several!).<br /><br />At any rate, I will not be buying any more Berry Detox.<br /><br />I would love to hear if anyone else experiences the same thing, or other strange side effects. There are quite a few herbs in this tea, so perhaps my body is reacting negatively to one of them.

review/summary: Just like Mexico----Only Smaller... Great for Cafe' de Olla
review/text: Just a great product, just like the large cones you find in Mexico at any grocer, but smaller and perfect for making a small batch of Cafe' de Olla at home.  3 cones, 3 scoops dark roast coffee (whole bean), 3 Cin. Sticks, 1 tsp. Clove whole.  Makes just enough for my coffee press, boil the water, cones of Piloncillo and steap for 5 mins, grind the coffee and cloves and drop right in the pan, boil for a minute or two and allow to steap for 5 total, put in your press, and boom, real Cafe de Olla without the Barro de Olla.  Of course MexGrocer has a Really Nice Barro de Olla too, so I plan to get one to use when I have more guests over.  I did notice that many Mexican homes use just a large pot for Cafe no matter what so...  It's cool.... the product is a great buy, and is just the right size for me.  Saves a lot of time and mess from trying to cut down the larger cones to a size that works. :)

review/text: This coffee is simply too sour for my taste, even when cut with a lot of heavy cream and sweetener. I've never gotten a good cup of coffee out of this bag. Perhaps it's too coarsely ground for my coffee maker, or perhaps I just prefer a darker roast; but either way I won't ordering it again.

review/text: I tried various K cups in order to find the one for my taste. Finally, a friend of mine gave me a pack of this and I used it with EZ cup and EZ filter on Keurig B60 system. 1.5 tablespoon of this finely ground coffee brews a great 8/10 oz cup of rich, bold coffee. This is BOLD but DOES NOT leave bitter taste in your mouth. The seller is quick to ship and has great communication in addition to offering free shipping.

review/summary: Flavorful Change
review/text: If you're looking for a flavorful change from boring bitter coffee this is perfect. Full of smooth body rich flavor from the first sip, this finishes with a great coffee taste without a bitter or "too strong" ending. I enjoy drinking my coffee black without the additives to cover up taste that just isn't that good. I find this is so good tasting that there is no need to add anything. I do not enjoy Starbucks because to get the flavor you also have to take the bitter and too strong with it. I want a full rich flavor without thinking I am drinking bitter espresso. I would recommend trying this Brazilian favorite and see what you are missing. A mere 6 level tablespoons makes a full 12 cup pot in my Cuisinart maker, so this ends up being quite reasonable in cost as well. 5 Star in my book.

review/summary: Love this soy sauce
review/text: I love this soy sauce. Years ago I dated a wonderfull gal from Thailand and the only soy sauce she used was dark soy and I fell in love with it. Now I have found this sweet soy sauce and even better. It's a wonderfull combination of sweet and salt. This soy sauce is also very thick. I use this with some water, garlic powder and olive oil to marinate salmon in before I put it on the grill and cook with apple chips. If you mix this with some honey, chipolte pepper and what ever you might think of this will make an excellent dipping sauce for egg rolls, chicken, crab ragoon and so on. The price here is good, give it a try - if you like soy sauce you will love this. Don't get confused by what I have said here - this is not a replacement for everyday soy sauce - it is in addition to for new and different ideas and taste sensations.

review/summary: Only pancakes that my kids will eat....
review/text: We've tried several pancake mixes and this is the one we keep coming back to.  You just add water, wisk to desired consistency, and cook.  On a busy school morning this is a plus.  Caveat, I recommend that the batter be mixed at room temperature and if refrigerated the previous night should be be brought out and warmed up first.  This makes a difference in flavor and my kids are very quick to notice.  I use canola oil in a hot frying pan and the result is restaurant quality pancakes, unlike some other batters I have used.  As a former grillworker I can appreciate this!  Concur with the other reviewer's recommendation to add this product to Amazon's subscribe list.

Next, I want to try freezing it in ice cube trays (after adding aforementioned spices- and whatever else strikes my fancy at the time - maybe a dash of coarsely ground black pepper, or vanilla extract?), then putting it in the Vitamix along with agave & lemon, to make a pumpkin sorbet.<br /><br />Would definitely buy this again when it's on sale.

It was packed well, and no cans were dented at all. The contents in the cans are the color and taste I would expect for pureed, commercially canned pumpkin (not gray or tart as some reviewers mentioned).  The pumpkin worked well in a vegan pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, in pumpkin spice muffins for breakfast and in a cream cheese pumpkin dip to accompany ginger snaps on New Year's Eve.  I ordered a second case on a Manager's Special and that one arrived in excellent condition as well.  I was also pleased with the long shelf life.  I would give this product five stars if it was packed in BPA-free cans.

So will just reduce amount of sugar, which is a good thing anyhow, and enjoy the rest of the cans of pumpkin. I am glad to have enough for the upcoming holidays even tho Libby's is now back on grocers shelves. Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: A good substitute
review/text: I bought this because of the pumpkin shortage (which is now over) to be sure I had canned pumpkin for the holidays.  Like other reviewers, I received a few dented cans, although only one was so badly dented that I hesitate to use it.  I have used the pumpkin in pie and pumpkin bread. It is a bit less dense than the kind we are all accustomed to buying in the grocery store, but it is by no means watery.  I did add an extra egg yolk to the pie to make sure it set up.  The pie was somewhat wetter than my typical result, but it held its shape and tasted great.  This made excellent pumpkin bread.  My family has devoured almost a whole loaf since last night.  If you are having difficulty finding pumpkin, don't hesitate to order this product.

review/summary: a change in consistency
review/text: The first order had the consistency of pureed pumpkin, like that in the individual cans that I buy (same label) from my local health food store....very good.  The second order, however, had the texture & consistency of a product to which FRUIT SUGAR or PECTIN may have been added, suggesting less quality for more profits....disappointing.  The condition of the cans on both orders has been excellent.

review/text: Purchased this item to bake with and was hesitant to order due to the negative reviews of dented cans with packaging.  I went ahead and ordered, received free shipping and the whole case was delivered DENT FREE.  The entire case of pumpkin was bubble wrapped and then enclosed in a box.  The taste of the product is great, a little less dense than the usual Libby's I have baked with in the past.  Will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: My cat loves it!
review/text: I bought this pumpkin because there is none available in our markets due to the great pumpkin crisis of 2009 or something equally drastic.  Its primary use is to prevent hairballs in my cat and it works.  I usually mix it with some canned cat food, but when I ran out one night, I gave it to him straight and he scarfed it down as if it were candy.  It lasts a long time (he only gets about 2 tablespoons a night), smells wonderful and I plan to use it in some muffins as soon as I get the time to make them.  I like being able to give him something organic, as he's an older gentleman, and I like having organic for my own cooking.

review/summary: LOVE this stuff!
review/text: I had been hunting for canned pumpkin for several weeks (with no luck in my local grocery stores) before remembering last year's pumpkin crop disaster, so out of desperation, I turned to the 'Net and ordered a case of the Farmer's Market product.<br /><br />I'm glad I did--this stuff is great! I originally wanted it for holiday pies, but have already used it for pumpkin pancakes and waffles with superb results, and have lots of other recipes still to try (but expect to have equally good results).<br /><br />It's not been watery in the can, and not a single can arrived with a dent, so I think this was an excellent purchase!  If I run out, I plan to purchase this product again.

review/summary: Don't buy this product
review/text: I cannot recommend buying this product.  I think the manufacturer is fobbing off its dented cans on Amazon customers!  Out of a package of 12 cans, only 3 were not dented in the package I received -- and I see from other reviews that I am not the first to experience this.  I wish I'd read the reviews before placing my order.  I don't think this was an Amazon fault, since the flat was pre-packaged and I think Amazon simply shipped the flat as they received it from the manufacturer.  Amazon took immediate and very good care of me in this situation, exceeding my expectations, so I have no quibble with them.

review/text: I was impressed with the service (price) and speed of delivery - but disappointed when half of the cans in the case arrived severely dented. I didn't bother with asking for replacement - we had an immediate use for the product (made lots of pumpkin pie), so this is a word of caution to other buyers. We will do this again - but next time, we will not be so forgiving.

review/summary: Fine for its purpose
review/text: I'd really like to see the product description amended to address the dented can issues. That said--my second shipment had two VERY badly dented cans--but the rest were only slightly dented.  (This compared to my first shipment where every can was moderately dented).  Since I am using this for dog food--I have no problem using.  I just don't like to see this product sold as if it has no problems.  I am glad it is available though since there is such a pumpkin shortage.<br /><br />I'd like to update--my third shipment had only a couple of cans slightly dented.  I don't know if I just got lucky this time, or whatever issues there were have been worked out.<br /><br />That said, I am upping my review to 5 stars--however as other reviews have noted, the pumpkin is more watery than other canned pumpkin I have used in the past.  For my purposes that is fine.<br /><br />Taking my review back down to 2 stars.  I just received a shipment with extremely dented cans.  Too much trouble to return--and I will use them to feed my dogs.  I really hate that I don't feel like I have another choice right now.

review/text: I have another pumpkin eating dog (it really has helped her IBD) and couldn't find canned locally. I ordered three cases of this (error on my part but not worth undoing due to scarcity) and awaited arrival with some trepidation thanks to negative feedback on damage to cans. To my very great delight, only 1 of the 36 cans had a even a small dent so looks like the problem has been solved, at least as far as my shipment goes. Can't comment on product itself beyond saying that it really is helping the dog.

review/text: I've bought this pumpkin before but cannot find canned pumpkin in the grocery store during non-holiday periods, for some reason.  Although the consistency is not as nice as Libby's pumpkin - this is a little watery, the fact that it's organic scores big points.  I mix it with my dog and cats foods, so the wateryness is not an issue.  My complaint is that it was not well packed for shipping.  Almost half the cans were damaged to a point that I would not have purchased them in the grocery store.  The contents seem to be fine, but I will try to find some other source next time, as the shipping seems to be a consistent issue in other reviews I have read for this product.

review/text: I've been eating pumpkin from the can for years. All it takes is a can opener and a fork (and unless you're from Maryland -- one should never use a spoon) and a bit of pepper.<br /><br />Yum! Pumpkin is my favorite edible gourd. Though I do miss the delicious pumpkin seeds you can get from fresh pumpkin. Sometimes I'll bake the seeds and throw a little sea salt on top. That's a nice treat on a cool Fall day. I'll make a steaming hot cup of tea and eat pumpkin seeds and just think about things out on my porch.<br /><br />I imagine that Susan Lucci and I are married and that she's very experimental in the bedroom and not afraid to invite company to join us. One time I imagined this so hard I blacked out. I woke on my porch with pumpkin all over my chest and a slight burn on my calf from the tea.
