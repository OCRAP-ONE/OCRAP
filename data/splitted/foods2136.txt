review/summary: Hip Action for Cats - Excellent treatment!
review/text: My vet put my cat, Ranger, on Hip Action after Ranger started limping and we discovered his patella was slipping off his knee joint.  It was painful to watch him limp around the house and up stairs.  Shortly after starting the treatment with Hip Action, my cat stopped limping and regained his agility.  Now, several months later, he is as active and athletic as he was years ago!  I no longer cringe as I watch him go up stairs, jump on his food counter, etc.  I think these treats are excellent and effective! (Hip Action was the only treatment we used with my cat - nothing else.)  He even seems happier and more comfortable and asks me to play tag with him all the time again!  On top of it all, they've very affordable (especially compared to the alternatives).

review/summary: Cat loves them and they seem to have actually helped!
review/text: My cat is 12 and is hyperthyroid (but can't take traditional meds) and has the beginnings of kidney failure.  She's on lots of meds and vitamin supplement treats and isn't very happy about it so I was afraid she might not take to the  new "treat".  She's always been a snuggler and has never been a cat who has played with toys (got her at 10).  It never occurred to me that she might not be interested in toys because of arthritis.  On a recent trip to the vet an x-ray was taken and the vet pointed out the arthritis all along her spine.  That made me wonder how much of her not playing was in fact the arthritis and not just the older age.  It's been a week or so since I started giving her these treats and she has started playing (with my hair ties).  She bats them around and is jumping around trying to get it.  She has played with my hair ties a bit in the past but never this actively.  I definitely think it is the Zukes supplement that is helping.  I also think this is her "favorite" treat since I put a plate out of all of the supplements and the Zuke's one has been the first gone the past few days.  (Fyi my cat is picky about canned food but has never been picky about treats or dry food.)

review/summary: FANTASTIC!
review/text: So I bought these treats for my cat, Gucci. He's 3 years old, and has carried a bit of excess weight most of his life. Even through continuing efforts to bring him to and maintain a healthier weight, he has never been much of an agile cat. He struggled just to jump onto the couch sometimes. I never thought he may have been having joint issues until my vet mentioned it. Which led me to try these.<br />First, both of my cats LOVE the flavors. They gobble these things up no problem, which is saying a lot for Gucci who is a bit picky. As for whether or not they actually work, I am a firm believer that they do. About a week after starting these, I watched Gucci leap from the doorway of my bedroom all the way onto my bed in a single bound. He now runs up and down his cat tower as if he were a kitten again. I'm so glad I decided to purchase these. I would recommend them every time!

review/text: My cat is almost 12 years old and he was moving very slow and watching him walk up the steps to our door made me feels bad for him. Since starting him on Hip Action he has become very youthful again, he tears out after our others cats like he is a kitten again. His coat looks so healthly.<br /><br />So glad I spent the money for him.

review/summary: New cat - my grumpy old man is my kitten again!
review/text: My cat, Pluto broke his hip when he was a year old. He had surgery to have the hip ball removed. The doc said he would have ten years but after that he would be in pain but by then something should come out that should help.<br /><br />Pluto is 12 now and has been in pain for the past several years, six months ago it was getting to the point my husband and I had "the talk"<br /><br />My vet recommended Nutramax Cosequin for Cats and Zuke's Hip Action Natural Cat Treats. Pluto gets one each night and it's like I have my kitten again. He is playing and is able to jump without pain. We give him the Cosequin first which is a pill he Hates then he gets the Zuke's treat which he Loves.<br /><br />I highly recommend both!

review/summary: Vet recommended
review/text: At her last checkup my 19 year old cats vet recommended I try these for her.  He said that he had heard about them giving older cats some relief from arthritis and was going to start stocking this item in his office.  I ordered the salmon flavor and was at first a little put off by the price for what appeared to be cat treat size packages.  That is true but for my cat's weight I only give her one a day and we are still on the first package and she has been taking them for about six weeks.  I find that to be very cost friendly.  She is not a very big cat treat kind of cat but took to these and now daily expects to get one in the morning.  They are semi-moist which means they do not fall apart and get crumbly in the package.  I break them in half and she eats both pieces with ease.  They are about 1/2 the size of a dime.  Now that she has been on these for six weeks I can say I think they have helped some.  Enough that I will continue to give them to her.  She is more mobile and comes down the stairs more frequently.

review/summary: Great Product. Really Improved My 19 Year Old Cat's Quality of Life
review/text: My very elderly cat has severe arthritis in one of her hips. There is a constant clicking when she walks and every few months she will limp around for a day or two. I tried Zuke's in hopes it could help her some. It has worked wonders! It's not a cure, but it has greatly reduced the number of times she limps around and the duration of those periods. She also has less pain on a day to day basis. You have to be realistic when your cat is 19 about what to expect. She loves the flavor and will eat these even on the days she doesn't have much of an appetite. I can only imagine how much benefit it would have for a young cat that was only 13 or 14 :) So, if you love your kitty and he/she is not as catty as it once was try Zuke's!

Hopefully these do what they are supposed to do for their joints. I would buy again.

review/summary: Five strikes against these treats
review/text: OK.  I admit it.  Cats can be finicky.  They can be very picky about wet food, so I wouldn't write reviews about canned, wet food.  But treats are another matter.  I've tried a lot of treats.  Usually, one of my three cats will eat the treats.  I have one who is picky, one who isn't particularly fussy and one who is a chow hound.  I keep seeing healthy treats and trying them.  I am such a fool!  As my cats started getting older, I worry about their mobility.  I tried some Omega-3 salmon oil and that was a fail.  I tried some of these treats.  Not one cat would eat them.  When I leave food out for them, sometimes it will eventually get eaten.  Not these.  So I gave them to an office mate at work who has two kittens.  Neither of his cats would touch these treats.<br /><br />I can't attest to the effectiveness of these treats.  But if you are looking for a healthy treat, try another brand.  It seems that these treats are disliked by lots of cats.  I'll give two stars instead of neutral three because so many cats won't touch these treats.<br /><br />What's a good Cat Parent to do?!<br /><br />PS.  My cats all like Whisker Lickins tartar control treats, so I've signed up for an Amazon subscription for them since they price is the best.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a cat that does not like the WL treats.<br /><br />PPS. Every one of my cats loves Trader Joe's Tuna for Cats and it was the only food my deathly ill cat would eat for several weeks.  It probably saved her life.

review/text: Won't eat 'em! Hence the three stars as I wanted to keep it neutral. As always your mileage may vary. Some cats probably really like these things.<br /><br />She's not totally wild about Cosequin either, even though I think that's probably the best formula for kitty arthritis. If you your cat is fussy but they like stuff like Laxatone, give them Feline Joint Gel. She practically does a happy dance when I get the tube out. And I can really see a difference in her ability to jump up on furniture when I give her the glucosamine supplements. Just not this one.

review/summary: Another flavor failure for a healthy kitty treat
review/text: Well, we keep trying different kinds of treats, hoping to find one our cats will eat.<br /><br />We have a 5-yr old cat who has some hip problems due to a steep fall as a kitten.<br />We thought some glucosamine/chondroitin might help him as much as it helps us.<br />We always bought glucosamine food for our older dog, who very much enjoyed it.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the product.  First off, it smells very funky, even to my nose!<br />Chicken?  What type of chicken?<br /><br />Our older cat will eat virtually anything chicken flavored, but he won't touch this one<br />at all. They look like they were cut from an extruder tube, like little dark tynenol tablets.<br />(I'll take some photos and post them later. I know lots of cats are picky about the shape of<br />their food.) I've tried breaking the pieces into smaller pieces for him - nope.<br />I even tried waiting until he was starving (like right before dinner) and he still turned his nose<br />up at them.<br /><br />I then tried leaving some out for a few days, since he likes the dry crunchy treats better<br />than moist ones. Nope. All he did then was try to bury them. Even our little cat, who loves<br />the moist treats, would not touch this one.<br />When I pick up the bag, I get a stink-eye look from the cats, and they walk away from me.<br /><br />So, back to the drawing board. Some people's cats might like them, but neither of ours would touch them.<br />Another expensive mistake. I think Hubby and I just need to create a tasty, healthy treat for cats ourselves,<br />because the mfgs are not doing such a hot job in this area.  Although, I think dogs would probably<br />love this item.

We have been feeding her the treats daily, four for the first month as directed and the maintenance dose of two daily afterward, and the difference is amazing.<br /><br />She wouldn't go near anything treated with Cosequin, actually doing the turn and scrape derision action any time I put it on her food.  She loves these and begs for them.  If your cat has the same reaction to Cosequin, definitely give these a try.  They're easier to use, cost a lot less and cats seem to like them.

review/text: I love the stay fresh packaging because it keeps the corn starch from getting moist and clumpy before you use it. This has always been my favorite brand, the container just makes it even better.<br />If you only know it as a gravy thickener, you're missing a lot of the uses of corn starch.<br />I use it to make pudding, thicken gravy and to make my teriyaki sauce thick and glossy to use for grilling.<br />It makes a great bed for casting sugar shapes.<br />There are also a ton of crafting uses for corn starch which mean the bigger containers always get used up. It works as a mold release when you make silicone or rubber molds, mixed with the right ingredients, you can make a lot of very fine "clay" like substances. Corn starch clay completely replaced Play Doh and flour/salt clays in my family because it has a finer grain that will take more detail.

review/text: I grew up in an Italian neighborhood, so maybe it's not fair to compare these shells to what I'm used to from the local bakeries.  But I'm finding them to be a little too thick.  Cannoli shells can't be too delicate or they will fall apart in your hands while filling or eating them.  But to me, these Ferraro shells cross over the line into being too thick, and that detracts from the experience.<br /><br />And I also don't find them to be as tasty as other shells.  They don't taste bad, but the flavor of the shells is very neutral.  I'm used to shells that bring a little bit of zesty flavor to the cannoli party.<br /><br />Since Amazon only sells them in these multi-unit packs, maybe they'll grow on me as I work my way through them.

I do have to admit that the tastes was missing something as compared to homemade recipes. I think that they had more of a vanilla taste, no sort of spice like cinnamon. Overall the cannoli was still good.

I do not mean that the water is flat after storing an opened bottle, I am talking about how the plastic is obviously somewhat porous because the water was flat before I had a chance to even open it.  Perrier in glass bottles never have this problem.  So sad to have to get a refund on the whole 12 bottles, totally undrinkable.

review/summary: One of my favorite Panko bread crumb products
review/text: I have come to appreciate Panko bread crumbs. I use two different brands--both of which are very satisfying.<br /><br />Bread crumbs are really good complements and ingredients for many dishes. I prefer Panko to the regular bread crumbs that one can purchase at the nearby grocery store. They add a better texture and provide a crunch that is delightful.<br /><br />And this product is one of the better Panko bread crumb resources that I have run across.

review/summary: Best flake panko
review/text: Most commercial panko bread crumbs are just like traditional breadcrumbs with a larger granule size. Sushi Chef brand is actually like bread shaved into flakes up to the length of a grain of rice. Using this style gives you a considerably different crust than any crumb-based breadcrumb which has a more elegant look and delicate crunch. The concept of panko is to produce a light, airy coating with bread flakes, which is something you don't get if you're using the crumb found in most brands.<br /><br />Inside the box is just a plastic bag containing the panko, so you can't reseal it. I just pour the remainder into a ziptop bag that I continuously reuse. A decent ziptop is going to be a lot easier to open and seal than most seals you find built-in to products, which are made as cheaply as possible.

review/text: Of couse, you have to like creaminess.  If you do, give this creamed rice a try.  Yeah, I know it's not cheap; so use it for a special occasion.  However, don't think you're going to eat maybe half a can and save the rest for tomorrow.  You won't stop until that doggone can is empty.<br /><br />It's sweet; but a pleasant, soothing sweet.  Very old-fashioned and came in real handy one day when I was feeling just a bit yucky.  You know, you feel like you need to coat your stomach with something rich, but not upsetting. Like maybe a baby food with grownup flavor?  Yeah, open a can.  Make sure it's in the refrigerator waiting or you.

review/text: Love Love Love this product, a favourite of mine since childhood.  Great light dessert hot or cold. I've never tasted rice pudding in America that comes close to Ambrosia, it's fantastic, it's not heavy, even though it's cream, milk and rice, not overtly sweet.  You can add many things to it; fruit, nuts, or stir in's.  If you have a sick one, this is light enough to give them and know they have had some good nourishment.  Treat yourself, if you've never tried it.  You might very well enjoy it.  It's a heavy product so the cost for shipping makes it cost prohibitive to order from most places.  With the auto shipment option it costs even less and you can edit when you wish to receive it.

review/text: This was a product that I grew up with in the U.K. and hadn't had for years before finding it on Amazon. Compared with typical American rice pudding, it is creamier (runnier) and meant to be served warm. It was traditional in our house to top a bowl with a dollop of raspberry jam, but I'm not a big sweets lover and prefer it on its own. It's actually quite low in fat and calroies, so it's a relatively healthy indulgence.

My husband has been here for 15 years now and really misses his Branston Pickle, HP Sauce, Ambrosia custard, so it's absolutely marvelous to be able to buy these things at a reasonable cost from Amazon -- and certainly saves money versus searching the small imported foods stores around.  Item was very well-packed, arrived quickly, and was the original.  We've got 4 cans two or three days ago, and he's already eaten two of them. Looks like I'll be reordering by the weekend.

review/text: The market for a package like this is infinitesimally small. Kids and nostalgic adults who like sticky, artificially fruity Dots. But for those that enjoy it, there is no better gift. I generally buy the larger 7.5 oz boxes in single portions. The problem is that once opened, it is too easy to eat a whole box in one shot. This package is meant to be single-serving. Less guilt. Less trouble. But the love keeps on coming day after day with a pack of 24 smaller boxes. This was on my Amazon wishlist for a while--though not the most practical gift, it is one that made me smile when opened. Sometimes love does come in small boxes of cherry, lime, lemon, orange, and strawberry flavors.

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy.  That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda.  By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns.  Enter Honest Kids!  Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like.  Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out).  I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners.  Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down.  In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade.  When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor.  Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in.  At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/summary: The Third Ingredient Is Sugar!
review/text: I purchased this expecting it to be a healthier option than traditional organic juice boxes. Based on the description I expected this to literally be watered down organic juice in a handy to-go container that is easy to take on the go or pack in lunch.<br /><br />But, upon receipt, I looked at the ingredient list and saw this had only "10% juice" (and about 20 different kinds, at that) and the third ingredient on the list (after water and white grape juice) was "organic cane sugar." Isn't the whole point of diluting juice with water to reduce the naturally-occuring sugar? Why would you add more?<br /><br />Yes, it's only around 40 calories (good) and doesn't include high fructose corn syrup (also good ... even if the corn lobby's claims are right and your body can't tell the difference, I still don't like lab-made ingredients). But, in general, I try and avoid processed food and this is pretty highly processed. There is a long list of added flavors and ingredients, many of which are not found in nature, so all told, even while certified organic, this still strikes me as HIGHLY processed food. Unlike, say, orange or apple juice, which I could make at home myself from whole fruit if I wanted. And you can buy just about anywhere with an ingredient list of one ("apples" or "oranges").<br /><br />My son doesn't partake of juice boxes all that often (1-2 a week, at most), so I'll stick with those that feature 100% organic juice. It may be higher in calories, but it's a lot more natural, ingredient-wise and, whether it's technically, "better" for you or not, I feel a lot better about naturally-occurring sugars than those added later. If I want to dilute it myself to save on sugar intake and calories, I'll just add water ... And nothing else.

It comes with absolutely NO cooking instructions.<br /><br />Mixed half and half with wild rice, and properly cooked, it is palatable, but if you were expecting aromatic, buttery Indian Basmati, you're likely to be disappointed.  Otherwise, it's relatively inexpensive, and is a good substitute for "regular" white rice.

review/text: great fresh picked fruit taste and I like that it is artifically sweetened and packed in water instead of syrup as the fruit stay a little crisper then. It tastes best cold because when it is room temperature it doesn't taste as fresh or crisp for some reason. When I get these from Amazon the expiration date has always been like a year later so they keep a very long time and you don't have to keep them refrigerated so I keep them in the closet on a shelf and just keep 2 of the 4 packs in the frig so they are cold and ready to eat. Such a great late night snack too to curb your appetite. I have a habit of always feeling hungry just before bedtime so I just eat one or two of these and it's off to bed and to sleep. The price is better ounce per ounce than I have found in any store including Sam's Club and Wal-Mart. Even when Hy Vee has it on sale it costs more than Amazon sells it for and I don't have to carry it out to the car and into the house. Gets delivered right into my front porch and I just pick it up and put it away...

review/summary: Decent taste - 5 servings per box
review/text: I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says: "10 bars" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars).<br />The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case.<br /><br />On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these).

review/summary: Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me
review/text: I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.

review/summary: Low. Low. I repeat: Low.
review/text: I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2" wide, 4" long, and 1/4" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away.

review/summary: Great taste, but not very filling
review/text: I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon.

review/summary: Overpriced! Not what you are expecting.
review/text: My main beef with this product is with the labeling.<br /><br />The box is labeled very deceptively. This goes double when inspecting the packaging from the Web (as you are doing now). "10 bars" is prominently displayed on the box. Lo and behold, once you open the box, only five bars are present. Upon further inspection, you see that printed in mice-type on the box is "5 two count packages". The net weight of the entire box is 7.4 ounces. That's less than one cup of granola. That's when you realize you've been had.<br /><br />You can buy a mega-size box of Nature Valley granola bars from a warehouse club for less money than the "Pack of 2" you'll find here. I mention Nature Valley because in a blind taste test you won't be able to distinguish that brand from these Clif bars.<br /><br />Seriously, if they are selling them for this much on Amazon, I'd be shocked and chagrined to see what they go for at the camping stores which is their retailer of origin.<br /><br />I consider myself embarrassed to have been duped so badly on this one. Clif has seriously damaged their brand credibility. Live and learn.

review/text: These bars come two in a package (and two to a serving size!) and are absolutely delicious.  They are crunchy and rich. The peanut butter bars taste like they are made with actual peanut butter holding the grains together.  The white chocolate macadamia nut bars have little pieces of soy white chocolate in the bars and you can taste them when you bite in.  These bars can keep me full for a while and are a great snack.  Appropriate for a plant based diet.

I loved these though, and the white chocolate macadamia nut was so yummy! I would definitely buy these again! Great value. But very messy, so definitely not recommended for a breakfast while in the car! ha :)

review/summary: Best crunchy granola bar!
review/text: I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks. I find that I need something with me in case I get hungry. Fruit doesn't travel well. Granola bars do well in my bag. But chewy bars get too sticky. And most crunchy granola bars are so hard I am always worried I would lose a tooth or two. I saw these at Nutrition S'mart yesterday and picked them up. I tried one before I got home. They have a great crunch, not too hard, and a wonderful flavor. Now I want to try the other flavors but my local Nutrition S'mart only had 2.

Probably the finest compliment I can offer is that if I was going to make a crunchy peanut butter granola bar at home, I'm not sure I could make them better than these. Anyway, these are highly recommended if you want a delicious crunchy peanut butter granola bar that just happens to have all the nutrition we've come to expect from CLIF. Yum-O!

review/text: These taste great but they are small bars.  My biggest complaint is that I have to eat these while standing over a sink or trash to avoid making a mess.  I've gone through 6 or 7 boxes and not one package has had two completely intact bars.  Most of the time there are just lots of crumbles from the edges of the bars but occasionally you'll find a bar that was jostled around enough to be broken into three or more pieces.  Certainly, this is a combination of the composition of the granola bar and lack of completely protective packaging.  But be warned that you will have lots of crumbled Clif Crunch bars if you order this through Amazon.

review/text: "Cocoa" is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly-sweet than many others.  They taste like they contain dark, as opposed to the easy-to-find milk, chocolate. I recommend them to dark chocolate lovers and ordered three more boxes, straight-away.<br /><br />On the other hand, the blueberry bars are a loser, in my opinion. There is only a faint blueberry flavor.  This blueberry-lover would just love one choc-full of dried blueberries, adding the appropriate blueberry flavor to these crunchy snack bars.

I like that each packet comes with two thin bars rather than one big granola bar - great for sharing or portioning.

review/summary: Delicious!  But Too Crumbly!
review/text: I like Clif products in general and this one is also pretty good.  It tastes good and it has better list of ingredients than the more processed ones from Nature's Valley, etc.  But the thing crumbles too much.  It doesn't hold together very well and from the moment you open the package, there's crumbs all over you.  Just be aware of it.  It's tasty and crunchy as they say on the package.

review/summary: Too crunchy!
review/text: The bars taste good, but they are REALLY crunchy! It's almost impossible to eat them and not make a huge mess of crumbs--definitely not good for taking on the go to eat in the car!

review/summary: Organic and not too sweet
review/text: There is a definite, crisp and crunchy texture to these bars. Some other bars have a slight chemical aftertaste. These are probably healthier then cereal.

review/summary: Clif Crunch Bars
review/text: My grandson, who is in special forces training in the Air Force requested these.  Needs a lot of protein for his training.  Asked me not to send cookies or junk food.  Wanted these instead.  Lots easier than cooking, packaging, and trips to the post office.<br />He said his favorite is the Blueberry bars.

review/summary: Clif Crunch Bar
review/text: I love these things! Usually they go on sale on Amazon and I only buy them when they are about $6 - 7 for the pack of two. My favorite kind is the white chocolate macadamia nut. However, when I bought them I wasn't expecting them to be quite so messy. They are definitely crunchy, and you will get crumbs everywhere - so keep that in mind. Otherwise I love the things! I'm a college student so this is a good breakfast or snack on my walk to class.
