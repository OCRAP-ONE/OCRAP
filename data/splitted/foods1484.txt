review/summary: Shipping not as promised
review/text: The Caribou Coffee is of course equal and the same as any I could buy in a store or at any other on-line vendor.  The time it took to get to me was unacceptable though.  I will not be ordering my coffee from this vendor again.  I opted to pay for speedier shipping although I was eligible for the free Super Saver on this item, because I knew I would soon be running out of coffee at home.  I then received a notice of a shipping date that was almost 2 weeks from order date!  I had to then take my time and get stressed arguing with them about the fact that I'd paid extra for expidited shipping. I did get my shipping fees refunded, but not my coffee sooner.  So I had to then go out to a store to purchase coffee to use until the order from Amazon finally arrived, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place by placing the order on line.  Not a happy camper on this one!

review/text: We have a Dane who prefers the small Iams. However, being 180 lbs., she can really put them away, and they don't sell these biscuits in our town; you have to drive for hours.  My only concern was whether or not the biscuits would grow stale.  In a month's time, they still seem fresh.  (I recommend carefully storing these in plastic containers and picking out the broken ones and feeding those first.  Don't freeze; they'll get soggy.)

review/summary: 3-way CFL bulbs work great!
review/text: These are wonderful CFLs! They are 12/22/33 watt CFLs with light output equivalent to 50/100/150 in incandescents. All 6 were delivered in-tact, none broke in shipment like many other cfl packs I've bought (each bulb is individually packaged in its own box, inside of a larger box).<br /><br />I use all 6 of them in pedestal lamps around my home and office. 3 of them are constantly on, and have been for about 6 months now, putting them around 4,500 hours of usage. The other ones are used less often. None of them have failed, dimmed, or shown any indication of premature failure.<br /><br />I like having low lighting in my office for the most part (12w mode), then the ability to switch up to 33w whenever I need to. Such an improvement over having single wattage cfl's that I've used exclusively in the past. It also saves more energy, because you dont always need the extra wattage/brightness so you can turn it down during normal activity. Of course you pay for it in premium for purchasing the bulbs, so cost savings I don't know if it's there. I paid a little under 30 bucks for these bulbs, which makes the 5 a piece - fairly expensive for a CFL. However, if they do last the 10k hours, then I would say they last longer then most CFL's as well (maybe by twice). So far the failure rate is lower then a few other packages of bulbs I've tried on here from Amazon.<br /><br />All in all a great bulb, and very functional 3-way adjustment that is well worth the up-front premium.

review/text: The cattery I got my Savannah cat from had been using and recommended Royal Canin Kitten 36; I transitioned my little guy to a raw diet fairly early at 13 weeks but I continue to use this food occasionally as a treat for him.<br /><br />He always comes running when he hears the storage container open. I feed him just a scant couple of tablespoons in any given day, and always separate from his other food. Even though he is raw fed, this does not cause any negative digestive issues for him.<br /><br />He can be somewhat picky at times so I am impressed that he enjoys this food so much.

review/summary: Sweet Taste - Has Pulp
review/text: This is the third brand of coconut water I have tried. This one tastes much different than other brands, it has a definate SWEET taste and tastes like the coconut taste Americans are familiar with from various coconut desserts or drinks.<br /><br />According to the label "Our coconuts are harvested from the prized Nakorn Pathom province, where they grow larger and taste sweeter than from any other region in the world." These are made from "natural coconut water" only, there are no added ingredients. This is a product of Thailand. It is distrubuted by a Taste Nirvana of Walnut California.<br /><br />Some people are curious about sodium content. The label says 42 mg of sodium per 9.46 fluid ounces. It has 50 calories and 600 mg of Potassium.<br /><br />There is a little pulp in this. It doesn't bother me but may be visually unappealing to some if they are used to a more clear looking coconut water.<br /><br />(I tried Vita Coco first which had a taste that I got used to after a while. I then tried Zico and decided I liked that "flavor" better than Vita Coco. Now I that I tried this, I like this Taste Nirvana water best of all.)<br /><br />What drew me to try Coconut water was the high potassium level (one serving is said to equal to two bananas), the electrolytes, and the fact that it is all natural. Coconut water is an excellent natural hydration beverage that does not have various negative things that the popular brand artificial drinks have in them.<br /><br />All coconut waters taste best when served very cold. The fact that this comes in a glass bottle makes it seem more chilled and it holds the chill longer than an aseptic pack or plastic bottle. They also package their product in aluminum cans although I have not tried that packaging.

review/summary: A favorite snack of all time!
review/text: This item is wonderful on so many levels, while almond crunch is the best seller, I love the cashew crunch the best! Almonds are a harder nut, cashews are softer and buttery, so it goes down very smoothly. Then all varieties are natural, a non guilt snack, and to top it off TASTES GOOD!!! For pecan lovers their pecan crunch is awesome, but sadly is not offered here or on their site, and could not find it Traders Joes today, so maybe it was discontinued (sob). Now I am hoping for them to do pistachio and macadamia crunches. They also do fruit/nut combos, was not sure I would like them with fruit added, but Costco's in the SW has a new one called 'Premium Fruit & Nut Crunch' with cashews, almonds and walnuts with real cranberries, real blueberries and POM extract (all 3 sources of antioxidants), the nuts complement each other and have the crunch, then the fruit makes it a bit chewy and complement as well, cranberries not tart like I was worried about, loved it and now it's one of my favorites. Also have tried cran-blueberry crunch, which does have pistachios with cashews and almonds, and it is very good as well, it was newly found in a 12 pack (4 2oz bags each of: cashew Crunch, almond Crunch and cran-blueberry crunch). I must say I have not tried all the flavors due to a limited market, but am looking forward to trying other yummy ones listed on the bag, and dreaming of a variety box of all the flavors included!

China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?<br /><br />Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore.<br /><br />I would rather purchase the Sahale snacks that are made in the US, even if they are a bit more expensive.

review/summary: Products like this fuel the "green is a fad" sentiment.
review/text: There are legitimate "earth friendly" products out there... and then there's a lot of "hippy fluff". Unfortunately these bulbs fall into the "fluff" category.<br /><br />Sadly, this review could have been totally different, as ONE bulb... OUT OF 12 ordered (2 packs)... met my expectations! ONE bulb looks pretty good... ironically, it was the first bulb I screwed in... and I thought "yeah, that guy who said these are dim is right, but this is acceptable"... and then I proceeded to add a second bulb to the fixture (ceiling fan)... and that bulb was almost pink in comparison to the first, much brighter, more yellow bulb. Well... to my disappointment... EVERY ONE of the remaining 11 bulbs was that same color (any early adopters to CFL know the color I'm referring to... it's a slightly depressing CFL color that makes you want to RUN, not walk, to the store as fast as you can to buy 40w incandescent Reveal bulbs.)<br /><br />To say that you couldn't read by the light from these bulbs (as another reviewer said) is no understatement... they are about twice as bright as a night-light! There is a less-vocal, yet common "green is a fad" attitude... and products like this fuel that view. These are functional for MOOD LIGHTING ONLY... They won't light up a small room (unless you have 6+ of them in a fixture and then it will still be HALF as bright as a 2 x 13w CFL fixture... to clarify 2 x 13 = 26 and 6 x 5 = 30... yet 6 of these will be HALF as bright as 26w of Lowe's Bright Effects CFL) These can barely light up a person sitting at the bottom of a hanging pendant light! (which is what I'll do with the 6 I don't return). Quality dimming CFL is something I've been chasing for years... but it's almost comical to think you'd want to dim these down from their maximum brightness.<br /><br />Just so I can leave you with a positive consideration about this product, if you have hanging pendant lights with artistic glass that you want to light up, but NOT really light up the bar/table under them... (to repeat and emphasize... MOOD LIGHTING ONLY then these will actually work out well... and for THAT use, at about $25 for 6) I could ALMOST recommend these, but if you're buying these because you want significantly usable LIGHT... hmm... I'd have to say "look elsewhere".<br /><br />A helpful note to Earthmate... notice where I said "met my expectations" about the one bulb... overall... the real problem here is that the product doesn't meet my expectations! Expectations based on claims right on the package. I highly suggest that products like this have wording on the packaging which directs consumers to the most likely REAL use of the product. For starters, these bulbs do NOT replace a 25w incandescent lumen for lumen... probably more like a 13w incandescent... and again, this bulb should work out well for a pendant light, like in a bar... where low lighting is desirable (and further dimming is useful)... and there are several pendants using power (when people have pendant lights they usually have many/several)... and the desire is to maintain MOOD over outright lumens. Claiming an "18w-20w" replacement on the box would go a long way to ensuring the bulb in the package meets the expectations created by the package. (I still say these are closer to a 13w incandescent, but having a number in the teens satisfies... meaning "lowers"... expectations... while having a number in the twenties satisfies the need to "sell" the product.)

review/text: I'm putting these in all my ceiling fans that have dimmers and even in some places that don't have dimmers. Nice soft lite and seem to last well, no humming noise.  Only 25 watt but with 4 bulbs in a fan 100 watts is fine for me.  They have adapters so will fit candelabra or regular base.

review/summary: Bulbs OK for mini socket, not for standard socket
review/text: The bulbs dim properly and work as advertised.  Shaped to look like a candle. Warm white instead of glare white light, which is good. The bulb has a mini-socket base and works fine in those types of lamp.  However, the adapter base that is supposed to enable their use in a standard socket doesn't fit up tight against the bulb, making it stick up 3/8" and it looks very odd in a chandelier.  Since that was our intended use, we can't use the bulb where we would like to.  Guess the cheap price should have indicated that there was something wrong with the product.<br /><br />One other thing to consider is that the bulb is thicker than the standard candelabra bulb, so it will not work with some types of glass chimneys that are intended to slide over the light.

review/summary: Brighter, cheaper, hopefully lasting longer
review/text: Considering that they come close to the lowest price for a 40W CFL six-pack and they can be had from Amazon with 'free shipping', these Earthmates are probably near the top of the 'value' pyramid. When it comes to quality, I've only had them for a couple of months when I am writing this and the fact that all 6 are still doing fine doesn't mean much but... see the last paragraph.<br /><br />Talking about the bulbs themselves:<br /><br />- unlike many CFLs, they come on almost instantly, maybe 1/10 second after flipping the switch<br />- once they're on, it takes a couple of minutes for them to warm up and reach full brightness<br />- contrary to what Earthmate claims, these bulbs are not exactly 'small' - see below for exact sizes<br />- they do NOT work well with a dimmer - they are either on or off<br />- the light is bright, so bright, I would not stare at it directly - I did once and I saw 'ghosts' for a few minutes after that<br />- the color of light is pretty close to what 'incandescents' deliver - 'soft white' is a fair description<br />- unlike neon lights, there's no flicker<br />- of course, they consumes less power when compared to an incandescent<br /><br />The above were my subjective comments. What follows are specs, as the manufacturer lists them plus some of my measurements:<br /><br />- Light output: 2900 lumens (bright)<br />- Energy used: 40W<br />- Color temperature: 2700K (emulate incandescent bulbs)<br />- Electric charge: 600mA<br />- Life: 6000 hrs. or 5 years<br />- Overall length - 5.75 in.<br />- Length from base to top (the glass spiral) - 3 in.<br />- Diameter - 2 in.<br />- Made in China<br /><br />Maybe I was lucky (read that many found broken bulbs), but my six-pack arrived nicely packed: a box holding the 6 individual bulbs each held inside its own recycled cardboard box, unbroken and undisturbed.<br /><br />It may be worth mentioning that the 5 year limited warranty statement(covers defects in materials and workmanship, whatever that means) promises to replace them if proof of purchase is provided. Since there is no mention of it, the buyer will likely cover the shipping so the warranty is by and large meaningless as it would cost more to ship the bulb out for replacement than buying a new one.<br /><br />The other claim is that each of these bulbs will save they buyer about $73 in energy costs over their lifetime. The assumption is that the kilowatt hour costs 11 cents and the bulb lasts for a little over 6000 hours.<br /><br />So far, I see no reason not to award these CFLs 5 stars but, if they begin dying on me before 5 years, it is likely that I will come back and update my review.

review/text: Bulbs arrived 3 days ago. One was broken on arrival due to poor packing. I needed them so I opted not to send them all back. I installed all 5 remaining bulbs and 3 days later one has failed in a puff of foul smelling smoke and two others are flickering. Two are working well. Not a very good average. I bought them because they seemed like a good value - they were less than $5 each. If the two that are working continue to work they'll have cost more than $12 each... not so good! I'd recommend avoiding these.<br />UPDATE: 10 days later one of the flickering bulbs has failed. 3 dead - 1 flickering - 2 good.

review/summary: Bright and Reliable
review/text: After over 14 months of use (an estimated 3900 hours in my application), the three bulbs I installed in the ceiling fixture in my home office last July are still going strong.<br /><br />This were a perfect way to get more light, reduce the unwanted heat emitted into the room, and save energy in this fixture that's on for a good part of almost every day.  The label on my fixture restricted it to 100 watt bulbs, and even the expensive screw-in halogens I was using before didn't provide all the light I wanted.<br /><br />These are a bit dim when starting up, but they quickly warm up to a bright light in a color that I find is almost indistinguishable from incandescent.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have complained of breakage during shipping and out-of-box failures, but these bulbs all arrived here in one piece, and I checked each of them upon arrival in a live socket to ensure that none of them were DOA.<br /><br />I'm not sure why some reviewers have complained about the cost of these bulbs.  With the electric rates here (about $0.13 per KWH), I expect to save a total of $234 over the expected 10,000 hour life of these three bulbs, while at the same time getting a cooler-burning bulb that provides a lot more light. That's a $468 savings for the 6 bulbs in the box, and is a huge return on investment in my opinion!  Plus folks on the east and west coasts where electricity rates are typically much higher will save a lot more than me.<br /><br />If you are satisfied with dim light, there are plenty of cheaper CFL choices, but I think these are the best bright CFL bulbs around!

After two years of use I am down to two out of the origional six.  These lights are on between 30 minutes and 4 hours a day which would mean that they should last me a lifetime but that hasn't been the case.  On the Earthmate web site in the product decription it give a warranty of 5 years but no where on the web site can I figure out how to claim a warranty issue.  With all the other options out there I will not be purchasing Earthmate bulbs in the future.  Also I purchased some of the Earthmate 11 Watt Dimmable BR30 and have had poor luck with the dimming feature.  I would guess that they dim about 15-20% total.  To me that is not dimmable.

review/text: I read the reviews for this bulb (half really good, half really bad) and decided to roll the dice.  Worst move of that day, easily.  I received the 6 bulbs, and they were actually packaged decently because they were put in a larger box with other items I purchased.  HOWEVER, the quality problem appears to lie in the bulbs and not the packaging.<br /><br />I used these bulbs to replace other energy-saving bulbs (made by GE) in 150w floor lamp (exactly what these bulbs are advertised to be used for) because these are a bit brighter.  I had the GE ones for a couple of weeks, and they worked fine but were just a bit dim.  I put these bulbs in and literally within 6 hours, I went through all 6.  Every single one started smoking/flickering.  I've since put the GE bulbs back, which work fine.<br /><br />I'm not even going to send them back to redeem the 5-year warranty because it's not worth the shipping to me.  If you get extremely lucky, these bulbs may be great, bright, long-last bulbs.  But if you're like the majority of us, it's a big waste of money.

Let's talk watts in "old" terms, i.e. the amount of light emitted by incandescent bulbs.  This spiral one is equivalent to 150 watts, an excellent amount, and better than the 100-watter which is widely available but a little dim, unless you purchase a multi-fixture.  150-watters are almost impossible to find in the big stores, and Amazon is doing a great job selling this one, although it is expensive.

review/summary: Do not use with dimmer!
review/text: Disclosure: I don't own any of these specific CFLs.  These Earthmate bulbs may be somewhat smaller than the usual CFL of this wattage which would of course be great in small fixtures.  But...<br /><br />Because this bulb is being promoted by Amazon as part of a 10 product "green" package and the *very* next thing on their list is a dimmer switch, I think it should be pointed out that conventional CFLs such as these DO NOT work and play well with dimmers.  The Earthmate site currently lists three (only) of their bulbs that are dimmer compatible, and this is not one of them.<br /><br />There are specific types of compact fluorescents (usually even more expensive than these ;-) called CCFLs (Cold Cathode...) that *do* work with dimmers, last even longer than regular CFLs and have less mercury to boot.  You can identify them visually by noting the significantly smaller diameter of the light tube and generally more turns.<br /><br />While I'm at it, 2700K is to my eye significantly more yellow than the typical incandescent (tungsten) light bulb.  I recently replaced the 2700K CFLs in my kitchen with 5500K (so-called daylight) CFLs and made my wife happy.<br /><br />The Earthmate bulb is undoubtedly a fine product but it may not be optimal for your application.

I was afraid that the coloring would leave my hands purple or blue, but the only place I noticed a stain was where I touched the full-strength coloring directly--once I mixed it in with the melted marshmallow before mixing the powdered sugar in to make the fondant, there were not problems with stains. I can't say if it would stain stone counters, though--I was not brave enough to test it on my granite, and so I kneaded the fondant on wax paper. Like other reviewers, I was a Wilton fan for years, but love this new alternative and will definitely be using AmeriColor from now on.

review/summary: Best black coloring
review/text: I purchased this item after reading the reviews on Amazon. I've tried Wilton and several other black food coloring for coloring frosting, and NOTHING came close to the Americolor Black coloring. After using very little of the coloring, I was able to achieve a true black frosting. So many complements! I would strongly advise buying this item.

review/summary: Does the job as far as frosting goes...
review/text: I ordered this in anticipation of making my son an x-box cake for his 8th birthday.  The cake did indeed look black after mixing this coloring with the chocolate frosting, so I'd say it works.  It will also color your tongue bluish but that's just par for the course.  My son was happy so even if I wouldn't eat the final product, I'd say it was a success.

I have not used it yet - I bought it for special cupcakes<br />for an event in a few days. I'll add to the review when we have actually used the product.<br /><br />I did want to mention, though, for those who think this might be a really great deal - the bottle<br />you see in the photo is NOT the bottle you are purchasing. You are getting one of the very small (under 3" tall)<br />drop bottles, not one of the large ones shown in the photograph. I wanted to point that out, because for people who<br />are only looking at the photos, it is misleading. Not sure why some sellers feel the need to be sneaky, but<br />I guess they try for more sales that way.<br /><br />I'll be back to review the actual gel once we are done with the project.<br />Just don't expect the big bottle when you purchase from this listing.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Well, I am now a HUGE fan of the gel coloring!<br />It worked like a dream, gave us a beautiful frosting that looked like black leather (but soft).<br />No purples or blues, no weird shades - just great color.<br />Now I will probably have to get more colors, because with these, I might start decorating cupcakes again!<br />I am adding a photo of our cookout cupcakes that we used the frosting for... it all looked great!

Because boiling sugar, corn syrup and hot water makes a yellowish color, adding too little, too much or stirring too much can change to a green color. Took me three tries (first Americolor Sky Blue, second McKormick Neon Blue and third Americolor Sky Blue again), but I got it eventually.

This Magnum blend was like finding a diamond in the rough. Of course you may not find it as good; we all have different likes and dislikes according to our taste buds.

review/summary: It's just ok...
review/text: Let me just say that I've never had Blue Mountain Coffee before, so I can't compare it to a full 100% blend. I'm also not a coffee connoisseur (don't roast/grind my own beans...yet), but I do like a nice light-medium roast with smooth flavor and low acidity/bitterness. From what I've heard and read, Blue Mountain coffee beans are the gold standard when it comes to that which is why I was very disappointed in this coffee. Maybe I'd built it up too much after reading all of the positive reviews, but I found it to be quite average with a moderate amount of lingering bitterness and acidity afterwards. To be honest, I would prefer Starbucks Veranda or Breakfast Blend as opposed to this. Both have a similar bitterness  and slightly more acidity (yes, I know everyone complains about Starbucks being over-roasted), but at least they have more flavor to show for it.<br /><br />FWIW, one of my friends (who recommended that I try Blue Mountain coffee) had the 100% stuff when he was over in Jamaica and he said that it was the best coffee he's ever had. When I told him I'd purchased this, he was very curious and excited to see how it compared (knowing that it was a blend). Having no idea of my opinion, he stated that the taste had very little similarity to the real thing and was significantly less smooth.<br /><br />So bottom line, at $10/pound, it's not overly expensive, but it's also nothing special. You can get as good or better for a similar price in a non-"Blue Mountain" blend.

When they use the title "blend" for coffee it usually means its 10% or less of the type of coffee. Thhis is 10% jamaican and 90% something else, Hence the price is much lower. Like i said a good coffee but doesn't compare to the real JBM. Would i buy it again yes. Cheaper than the 100% by a long shot.

review/summary: Smooth flavor, slightly coarse grind.
review/text: Not many of us can afford to drink 100% Jamaican Blue Mountain on a daily basis.  As such, I've tried several Blue Mountain "Blends".  Based on the price none of these blends could contain more than 25% Blue Mountain beans, and most likely contain only 10% or so.  Of those I've tried, the Magnum is the truest to real Jamaican Blue Mountain.  It maintains much of the flavor of JBM and much of the smoothness with only a small amount more acidity than you would normally find in pure JBM.  The most notable difference is the strength.  JBM is so great because it pack a bold flavor without being overly dark, burnt, or acidic.  Magnum has chosen to maintain the overall flavor profile but with less boldness, I assume to keep acidity in check.  For daily use this is a good compromise to make.  Other blends go the other way and come across as burnt and acidic.  This will likely be my daily coffee for quite a while to come.

Maybe people who feel otherwise don't drink much good coffee but if you're looking for something in the "specialty" or "gourmet" genre I strongly suggest avoiding this stuff. It's about as "Jamaican" as my Labrador retriever. Muddy color, bitter, no subtleties, flat, dull and surprisingly aroma-free, I've had better from the stale coffee urns in hospitals.

Most places serve a blue mountain blend because the 100% blue mountain coffee is too expensive even for over there unless it is being served to the wealthy Jamaicans or in a fine dining restaurant. I myself prefer the casual places and I love the Jamaican people. They are some of the most friendly people in the world and the homestyle Jamaican food is delicious. It is hard to describe this coffee; it is smooth and yet strong and has a wonderful taste and aftertaste. It packs a little punch in the caffeine department too. Try it, you are getting a good deal because it is a 1 lb bag. Cheaper than Starbucks.

review/text: This coffee actually tastes even better if you let it sit a while after brewing it. I can let it sit and re-heat it and it tastes even better. Not too expensive either and I really like how I can order individual packages vs. multi packages of some other coffees. I alternate between this and a Kenyan type I like, for variety.

review/summary: Great coffee!
review/text: I had enjoyed Kona blend until I tried this Blue Mountain blend. In my opinion, this is a very different coffee from the Kona blend. I still say if given a choice, I would have a tough time selecting a Kona blend or a Blue Mountain blend, but I definitely recommend a friend of mine to try this coffee!

review/summary: Worth the price -- don't expect true Jamaican taste
review/text: This blend did not disappoint at this price point.  I did not expect the quality of Blue Mountain at this price, but was pleasantly surprised and found it to be quite good and better than what I had been buying (Dunkin Donuts) in the grocery store.

review/summary: "famous" but not matching expectations
review/text: good "quality" product, but then the subjective part comes into play: we felt it does not have a "bite", an "aroma".  it lacks the "je ne sais pas quoi" i believe they say, the "i do nto know what" you'd need to have a Name.<br />entirely possible you'll like it more than we did.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: Coffee is very good, have been buying for quite awhile and I love it, there are better coffees out their, but for the price, it  is excellent, coffee is  smooth and taste is very good, can also be purchased from costco, price probably better here though. Magnum company located in Michigan, they have others that are also very good, and there Jamaican Mountain Blue is terrific, a bit expensive, but it is very smooth and very good, try it, you'll love it, you only live once.

review/summary: Good coffee for the money
review/text: Very nice coffee. If you like the bold and mellowness of coffee, this is a good try. I tend to like my coffee bold and strong. Not at all bitter. A good buy. I'll repeat.

review/summary: Jamaican me want something else!
review/text: Well, taste is very subjective, but I think I'd buy a can of Hills Bros. before I purchased this again. It's a blend but I've had to do more blending to make it something I want to drink.
