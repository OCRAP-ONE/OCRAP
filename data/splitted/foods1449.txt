review/summary: Freeze dried favorites.
review/text: These treats are my very picky Boston Terriers favorite.<br /> She is also finicky about dog food. So I crumble these<br />treats over her food and she is very happy.<br />The freeze dried chicken liver crumble easily, the beef<br />are not so easy.  Anyway, these treats are perfect and<br />healthy. I usually order two containers at a time and they<br />arrive in about 5 days.

review/summary: These vanilla candies are very tasty.
review/text: One of the other reviewers, (D Deveny) says the description doesn't mention the "vanilla" flavor. Perhaps it wasn't mentioned then, but it is now (September 2012.) I'm sorry he/she rated it that low due to that one error, since these have a great taste. I sometimes give a small piece to my dogs, who go crazy for them too. The other reviewer says shipping to the UK is too much. I don't know about that, it's about $7-$8 for shipping in the US, but it's disclosed, not a secret. Again, I wish reviewers wouldn't ding the PRODUCT, which they both admit is good, for an error in description or for shipping costs. You're supposed to be reviewing the product, which is delicious.

review/summary: Good, but doesn't taste like typical "orange"
review/text: Product as described...2 lbs of orange gummi bears.<br /><br />I got them as a semi-gag gift for my boyfriend, since orange is his favourite flavour. To me, they tasted more like peach, or some sort of tropical flavour. This could just be the brand, I mean we've never had these ones previously.<br /><br />I know this manufacturer makes peach and other special flavoured gummis so maybe it happened in storage? I don't know. I wasn't really a big fan of the odd taste, then again who am I to judge, I'm not a fan of gummi bears in general. He didn't say he tasted bad at all, and eventually ate them all.<br /><br />Only gave it four stars because of the non-orangey taste.

review/summary: Great for my cat's digestive issues
review/text: After struggling with my cat's digestive issues, this food saved him and our rugs! He used to barf several times a day. Our vet suggested fancy prescription food, which my other cat hated. She lost weight on it, and his vomiting issues were still a problem, so I decided to try this. The vomiting stopped. It was amazing. He is so much healthier. Also, both of them really like it and my female cat has even gained weight on it (after losing weight on the prescription food she hated).

review/summary: Amazing Cat Food!
review/text: I went to the vet because my kitten had frequent diarrhea, without eating any wet food. The vet first prescribed some drugs, which helped a little, but the problem continued. He then suggested switching the dry food diet to either Science Diet or this. Being the cheaper of the two, I tried this first. Within days, the problems stopped, and have not happened since. It has now been 3 months without any issues. I would recommend this to anyone experiencing frequent digestion problems, such as mine. Purina also makes several other formulas, such as hairball control, and all around nutrition. If they are anything like this, they will definitely help save some vet bills.

review/summary: Contrary to popular belief: Cats are allergic to seafood.
review/text: I thought cat food was good enough for my cat. I was wrong. The kind of cat food you get for your cat matters. It matters alot.<br /><br />My cat has had recurring allergic reactions, where she starts either throwing up or scratching her face off :( I didn't correlate what was happening until the I mentioned these bouts to the vet. Verdict: stop feeding my cat canned salmon/tuna and NEVER FEED MY CAT regular cat food. The regular stuff has fish byproducts in the first or second line of the ingredients. I now check the label and this is by far the one my finicky cat eats and enjoys. I buy at my local Target for better value.

review/summary: GREAT for cat with food allergies!
review/text: Purina sensitive systems turned out to be a life saver for our one cat!  Our cat is allergic to most cat foods.  She will have severe chin acne, loose stool, and flatulence problems.  On the advice of our vet, we tried a ton of different brands, including Iams, Wellness, and Science Diet.  None of them worked.  We feared we were going to have to buy some extremely expensive prescribed food, but we decided to give Purina Sensitive Systems a shot.  It worked!  All of the problems mentioned before magically went away.  I don't know what is in the formula that makes it different from other cat foods, but Purina Sensitive Systems cat food truly is for cats with "sensitive systems."<br /><br />**Note: Purina Sensitive Systems is not for all cats.  We have another cat who has never had any problems with food, but we switched her over to Purina Sensitive Systems when our other cat started to make life easier.  For some reason, Purina Sensitive Systems started giving our other cat acne, so we switched her back to Iams.  Though it was a life saver for our one cat, it didn't work for both.  I am still grateful though!

I am back to regular manufacturer K-Cups or the My K-Cup (the one you can get in the store) (That's the only one that doesn't leak).<br /><br />I even went online and checked out the reviews that said to move the rubber seal down on the needle, it didn't work.<br /><br />Keurig is designed to brew with high pressure.  To do that, you need an airtight seal.  This doesn't provide that.  That is why Keurig is not selling these in the store next to their machines.

review/summary: One of the better ginger teas available
review/text: I tried this tea because it was on sale at my local grocery store, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I like it much better than some of the other brands of ginger-based teas that I've tried; although I love ginger, some of them really pucker the tongue. Normally I'm not a fan of Bigelow teas as I find they're over-flavored (their Earl Grey has so much bergamot that it makes me and another tea-loving friend nauseated!). But they nailed this one. Glad to find it available on Amazon since my local store had a holiday display and once the boxes were gone, they were out of it.

I have always liked Bigelow teas, I haven't had a bad one yet, unlike Celestial, which ofter tastes pefumey.Also try Constant Comment by Bigelow, tastes like Grand Marnier, and even better with a splash of Grand Marnier,

review/text: This is a great caffeine free herbal tea but the ginger flavor is a little light.  What I taste in it mostly is the lemon verbena and the lemon.  Since I like both of these flavors I'm happy with the tea although it wasn't quite what I expected.<br /><br />They did a great job of packaging this tea with a bright colored box and the individually wrapped teabags also have this colorful packaging so it's a nice one to put out on the table or in a basket of teas.  The flavor, because of the lemon verbena reminds me more of a summer tea than a winter one, but I'm happy with it nonetheless.

It was only sold during the holidays.  When I found it at Amazon, I was ecstatic!  Now we can have it all year long!!  It's especially good with--you guessed it--ginger snaps!!  One of the best things for me about this tea is that it is caffeine-free.  Since I have issues with caffeine, my choices are sometimes limited as to a hot beverage.  Even green tea and white tea are out of the question.  That's why this one is so good.

review/summary: This Chocolate Is Good For You
review/text: Too many Americans know of chocolate only from the bars appearing in most food stores. Those bars are of inferior quality, so I determined to spend a little extra to see if I could tell the difference.  With the Dagoba Organic Chocolate Bars, I found a chocolate bar that was not only tasty but healthy. What distinguishes the Dagoba from the commercial bars is not just the organic materials inserted but the unhealthy sweeters omitted, like high fructose corn syrup. The taste of a Dagoba is rich, deep, and ultimately satisfying.  For those with a sweet tooth and want their polyphenols in cacoa, then Dagoba is the way to go.

review/text: Not very sweet, but extremely chocolate.  Got these bars with a gift certificate and not sure I would pay my own money for them, but they are indeed superior quality. The taste is almost identical to the chocolate acai network marketing squares that cost a fortune and a half. Except those aren't all organic and the Dagoba is. Go for the Dagoba!!

review/summary: Superior chocolate
review/text: Dagoba chocolates are all high quality, but this bar is one of my favorites (along with lavender and xocolatl). The rose flavor is distinctive, but not overwhelmingly floral; the raspberry component comes through more strongly. The cocoa content also makes this a good chocolate if you want to eat a little at a time. I'm less tempted to eat the whole bar at a sitting when each bite is so flavorful and satisfying.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are better than you'll find most places, too -- the stores where I've been able to find this brand charge $3 or so per bar, and so does Dagoba's own website (and then there's shipping...).

This is not a sweet chocolate, it is more of a semi sweet chocolate but not too sweet, and you get jsut ahint of rasberries ever so often. Really did not catch a taste of rose. Only noticed a slight hint of rose scent a few times.<br /><br />Lovely dark chocolate bar. Try it you will love it.

review/text: I really wanted to give this coffee 1.5 stars, but Amazon does not allow half stars.  This is a fairly light brew with a sickly chemical vanilla flavor.  When we are paying nearly $.60 per cup, you would think that these companies would actually put out a decent product.  I can be pretty picky when it comes to food, but I am far from a coffee snob.  If you want a decent cup of french vanilla coffee, don't order this product.

review/text: I thought I would give this one a try as I usually order Timothy's French Vanilla. I thought I would get a much richer vanilla flavor due to the "supreme" on the label. I was disappointed. I has quite a nice aroma but the taste was lacking. There was a bitter after taste. I tried three separate cups...each having that strange after taste. I gave up. Timothy's plain old French Vanilla is much better than this "French Vanilla Supreme".

review/summary: YUCK!
review/text: We just recevied our 35 count Crazy Cup Sampler(the best sampler we have found so far) and are in the process of taste testing vanilla flavored coffees in the hope or finding one we will enjoy drinking daily. Having read previous reviews that went from love to hate I figured I would land somewhere in the middle as I rarely go to extremes.<br /><br />Although it is against my nature to throw money down the drain, The taste was so repugnant I did just that (66 cents in this case).<br /><br />From the moment it began brewing there was a permeable odd chemical aroma.  Determined to ignore this I brought the brew upstairs to my husband not mentioning the questionable brewing aroma.  He was the perfect "blind taster" as he had not read any reviews.  His response is the title of this review "YUCK"!<br /><br />Although the unpleasant aroma was not as evident as while it was brewing he mentioned it at once.  We both tatsed it twice.  The chemical flavoring was so repugnant we dumped it down the drain.<br /><br />I still have high hopes for the other brands included in the sampler but they will have to wait until tomorrow as we will need overnight to cleanse our palattes and minds of this foul brew.

review/summary: Good Coffee, Good Price
review/text: After looking for French Vanilla k-cups I stumbled on this pack, which originally I chose because they were some of the least expensive I could find per k-cup.  When I got them, my husband loved them & has since switched to these over his normal k-cups.  They do have a vanilla flavor, not too sweet or overpowering, so if you like a very strong vanilla flavor you could add flavored creamer or select a different brand.  I myself will not drink normal coffee, and even with flavored coffee tend to add quite a bit of creamer & sugar.  This coffee I was able to cut my sugar back & I don't need to add creamer/milk & I like it.  I would definitely buy it again.

Since then we have tried the Wolfgang Puck (very delicious!) and Folgers Gourmet French Vanilla.  This is the first vanilla K-cup brand that we do not care for.

I always put it in my mug to take to class b/c I know I will get bored enough and drink it if it is in front of me. The caffeine does the trick but the taste is just off, it is sweetness and flavor gone wrong. I think a lot of it has to do with the smell, it smells terrible! It just tastes like bad coffee too begin with with awful vanilla syrup added to it. Wish I could return or get rid of my 50! :(

review/summary: Amazing Product
review/text: I have looked everywhere for Cornnuts and haven't found a single package; I was a little reluctant to purchase two crates of 12 since I didn't know if I was going to eat every pack. After a month, I've gone through both crates with the help of my family (who love the product as much as I do) and I'm back to buy 2 more boxes. It was an amazing buy at the best price around!

review/text: We actually got a handful of these for free while we were vacationing in california from some people promoting them.  I really liked them.  They taste kinda like the cliff kids smores bars.<br /><br />Each bar is 190 calors with 5g of fiber.  If you are looking for a snack bar with these stats, try it out.  I don't know if I would be willing to pay $2 a bar but if I can find them for &lt;$1 a bar, I would definitely buy some more.

review/summary: Appetizers: only a supplement!  Not a daily cat food.
review/text: Just be aware (and Purina says so on the label) that this is not another<br />daily cat food.  Check it out and see that there is only 12% protein in it, and cats need a food with at least 40%.  The problem is that, if they eat a whole tray a day, then they'll reject the "real" food.  I imagine that 1/2 tray per day is the absolute max for your kitty.

review/summary: Five of Five Cats Will Not Eat
review/text: Dear readers: Our Mom hates to write up a negative review, so we are taking all the responsibility for this negative bit of writing. "We MADE her do it!"<br />This is the third Fancy Feast Appetizer our Mom has had shipped to her for us from Amazon. We really like the other two vaieties, but we DO NOT like this one. It has a Yucky taste and we are horrid and will not eat even the broth. We stick our little noses up in the air and walk off because we are certain that something better will show up if we do so. (Usually we are just scolded for our attitude and we get no extra food, but we persist in REFUSING to eat even the tinniest bit of this!!!!!) We do like the Talapia:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EJGVVY">Fancy Feast Steamed Tilapia Appetizer in a Delicate Broth</a> and we do like the White Meat of Chicken.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQKN2">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, White Meat Chicken, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a>. But we say "No Thank you to this." We think it is the flaked Tuna that we do not care for.<br />Again, DO let us point out, that this is our decision and not the decision of our Mom. Even the guy that lives out back that she feeds, the one she calls "Feral Kitty" will not eat this. So We are only giving two stars. We are sorry to be so Negative, but we are finniky and WILL NOT eat things that do not taste good. So that is our vote: Gabriella (4years), Trinity (3 years), Wisdom (1 year), Mercy (1 year) and "Feral Kitty" AKA Yellow Kitty (10 years.) Thank you. We are finniky, but also quite polite!

In the '60's they were my favourite animal cracker as a kid because because they were NOT TOO sweet! And I carried that little red box like a purse all summer long.<br /> Then came the 70's and they dissapeared forever.  The other brands of the day were too sugary even for this 6 year old. Barnums,, ugh, even Barbara's are too sweet. Now that not-too-sweet appeal is are back.  Thank you, Austin for the great taste - pure nostaglia in every bite.<br /><br />KMG

review/summary: New Recipe is Awful
review/text: These used to be my favorite animal crackers but Austin has recently changed their recipe to a "new and improved" version and as a result, what was once a tasty snack now tastes like cardboard.  The old version had a hint of lemon and the new version is completely tasteless and leaves a horrible after-taste in your mouth.  Nice going Austin.  Won't purchase again.  Austin needs to take a lesson from previous companies that tried to change what was already good and go back to the original.

review/summary: Best tasting animal crackers
review/text: I bought a case of these for an animal-themed birthday party a few years ago, but have kept buying them since. At first I thought it made sense to keep buying animal cracker "cookies" since they are reasonably healthy for both mom (just 2 Weight Watchers points per serving!) and kids. But the brands at Safeway all tasted stale and artificial compared to the Austin. Since Safeway doesn't carry this brand, I just keep buying the cases at Amazon. Easy to toss a bag in with the sippy cup for snack time, or to keep a few bags stashed in the car.

review/summary: First skeptical, then SOLD!
review/text: Ok, here is the truth - this freeze dried coffee is GOOD.  Long time ago (maybe 20 yrs) I tried the freeze dried stuff and thought it was a bit on the bitter side in taste, so never tried it again.  So here I am, years later writing Taster's Choice parent company asking for samples.  They sent me a few, and boy was I blown away at how tasty the Vanilla and Hazlenut flavors were.  I ended up gong to the local Walmart and cleaned their shelf of these flavors.  Yes, that is how well I liked this coffee.  HOWEVER, as tasty as this stuff is, there is a down side...<br /><br />The reviews on amazon are correct, in that the size of the individual packets are RIDICULOUSLY small.  This is why I am giving a four star rating instead of a five star.  Be forewarned - if you want a typical 8-oz cup of this coffee in the morning, you WILL have to use two full packets to achieve the taste of a regular strength of coffee.  Having said that, know that you are told on the box of this product that you are buying a TWENTY COUNT box.  In reality, it is a TEN COUNT box.  Who do you know only drinks 6-oz of coffee in their cup each morning?  That is what the packets are - 6 oz!  I do not, repeat, do not like strong coffee, so even I would have to complain that this company needs to stop pre-packing for a 6-oz cup.  Nescafe needs to sell this product in a single jar container so that customers can choose how much coffee to stir in their cup each day.<br /><br />Its all about profit, I know.  But if Nescafe wants to truly listen to customers, then they will stop pre-packing such small quantities and let the consumer have this product in a larger container.  I will pay for it anyway, but atleast stop pre-measuring for me.

review/summary: Bring the canisters back!
review/text: Since I haven't tasted the product in the packets the rating may be misleading. This is a comment about the choice of packets over canisters. The coffee itself is a wonderful (and, when purchased in the canisters, AFFORDABLE) treat. It isn't bitter or have an after taste like many instant coffees do.<br /><br />I was given a sample of the plain decaf packets when I made another purchase. They are a mess to open at your desk and get sticky trapping coffee as you are pouring them into a cup of hot water. No - Nestles - I don't think I should have to run the around the building with a cup full of instant coffee particles so don't even go there. I use a tablespoon of coffee. Bottom line is using packets will be a pain and very expensive.<br /><br />Perhaps if enough of us complain Nescafe will bring the canisters back. If you agree send Nescafe a message. I don't know if Amazon allows pasting other's web links but it is found by typing "Nescafe coffee" on a search engine.
