review/summary: LOVE this chocolate!!
review/text: I absolutely love this chocolate but can't understand why it is so hard to find. It is a seasonal item and I can usually only buy it localy around Christmas time. And even here on Amazon it is hit or miss. Usually miss. I wish they would have it in stock year round! C'mon Amazon, give us chocoholics a break! This chocolate is just melt-in-your-mouth goodness!

review/summary: The BEST Christmas candy stocking stuffer...EVER
review/text: Ever since we discovered these several years ago, they have been a staple item on our Christmas stocking stuffer list.  All of the kids (and I) absolutely LOVE these.  Normally I'm more of a chocolate flavor purist, perhaps allowing peanuts (M&Ms) or almonds (Hershey bars) to be part of the mix, but until I tasted these chocolate eggs, the thought of mixing chocolate and fruit flavors grossed me out (e.g., cherry chocolates, etc.).<br /><br />Anyway, the combination of chocolate and orange flavors is heavenly.  I like the size, the shape, and the way they are put together.  AND, of course, the flavor.<br /><br />Just in case you are not familair with these already, the chocolate orange comes wrapped in a foil covering.  One end is covered with a sticker.  What you need to do before you open the wrapping is hold the egg in your hand and whack it down onto a solid surface on the end where the sticker is.  This action allows the sections of the chocolate orange to be easily pulled apart after you remove the wrapper.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic treat, and I try to be a good boy all year long in the hopes that there will be another one of these in my stocking come Christmas morning!<br /><br />Merry Christmas, and a 5-star treat!

review/summary: Love Terry's Milk Chocolate Orange Ball
review/text: I love the creamy meltiness of this chocolate. Some chocolates are so waxy they just sit in your mouth, but this chocolate melts. I absolutely love the orange and milk chocolate together, these are totally addicting and no way does one last around me, for more than a couple days. Bad for waistline, very very good for taste buds. I wish they had these in stores longer than just the holiday season. I found them last week at 2.50 each which is a great deal!!! I guess it will be "load up" for me! Life is short, live a little, you will love this chocolate!

review/text: This is undoubtedly my favorite flavor of chocolate. Every year I eagerly await the new batch. I bought 12 of these little gems this year, from Amazon, again. My big surprise was that this year my wife came back from Walmart (yes, we do shop there as well) and told me that they had the exact same Terry made Orange balls for $2.50 each plus our local tax. Now we have another dozen in our freezer, waiting for me. I can't wait.

review/summary: Yummy Chocolate in Sweet Orange Slices!
review/text: Having an English family (that moved to the US), these were a staple in our Christmas stocking. My Grandma used to send to us each year (or we bought them in England while visiting). I occasionally found them locally during the holiday season but I've seen them less and less. So unfortunately, my children haven't had them for a year or so. A real bummer at Christmas.<br /><br />I am so glad that someone mentioned they were on Amazon. Now I have a place to order them at any time.<br /><br />They are terrific balls of sweet, creamy milk chocolate with a touch of orange essence - a delicious combination in my book.<br /><br />If you've never tried them, they are worth a taste. But keep in mind that once you try it, you'll never stop thinking about the creamy orange chocolate flavor.

And they have an unusual orangey flavor to them,  distinctive and delicious.  I have to say that they are very expensive here.  I thought they were expensive at the store where I found them,  but they were $5.99 there and here they work out at $10 a box.  So I would look for a better rate,  but it is a first rate product.

review/text: I love these chocolate oranges, they have been a tradional stocking stuffer treat in my family for as long as I remember. I ordered 6 of them through Amazon to give as gifts this holiday season. I couldn't help myself, and decided to eat one. I am glad I did, it would have been very embarassing to give the ruined, melted and rehardened mold covered chocolates as a gift. All 6 of them were ruined. I threw a few in the trash in complete disgust before realizing I should try to return them. These were delivered directly from Amazon, not from any of their other suppliers. You could not tell from looking at the packaging that contents were disgusting.

But after tasting one I was quite disappointed.<br /><br />For me the chocolate is quite a bit too sweet; not "chocolaty" enough and not the rich luscious taste I expect from good milk chocolate. The orange taste is also quite artificial.<br /><br />I think the chocolate orange is fun and would make good holiday gift. But in terms of taste I feel it's just okay.<br /><br />The package of the chocolate I received looked quite different from the picture on Amazon's product page though. I'm not sure if the company changed the ingredients or recipe as well.

review/summary: Authentic Taste of India from a Bottled Sauce!
review/text: Being an American in a small town on the West Coast, I had never heard of Sharwood's and was not expecting much when I picked up a bottle of this at a local discount store. I cooked up a batch of Chicken Makhani to serve with aromatic basmati rice, and I was surprised at the very authentic Indian flavor. I added a little fresh squeezed lime juice and plain yogurt in the last few minutes of simmering, but even that was not really necessary.<br /><br />The following day I used the leftover Makhani and rice to make Chicken Biriyani, adding dried sour plums with a few green and brown cardamoms, covered the dish tightly and baked it to perfection. Much easier than starting from scratch, but it tasted just as authentically delicious!<br /><br />After learning how wonderful this cooking sauce really is, I rushed back to the store and bought all that was left on the shelf. This is something you can store in your cupboard to have on hand, ready to throw together a very tasty gourmet meal in a matter of minutes.

review/text: When I was growing up my German-French mother would tell me stories about how, when she was a little girl and suffered all winter from bronchitis, her French grandmother would take cherry stems, boil them all day long, and make a syrup out of them.  She would give this to my mother and it helped her bronchitis.<br /><br />Over the years I have heard how awesome cherry juice is for many things.  Since I am allergic to almost all medications, I have to find holistic ways to stay healthy.<br /><br />The tart cherry juice helps not only with arthritis but other things too.  My body feels so much better when I use it every day.

review/text: I saw Dr. Oz and he said Tart Cherry was good for you. A lot of his good 4 u things taste nasty. But this is really good. I used two TBSP. is a tall glass w/ four ice cubes and filled it with water. Sometimes I will add a packet of Purevia for a little sweetness. But it is good w/o anything added. I only ordered 1-16oz bottle, now I'm going to get more b4 I run out. This is really good!!! There is no aftertaste, but it is tart like cranbery juice. Amazon said it would be 2 weeks for shipping, I had it in 8 days.

review/text: I was told to eat tart cherries for gout and Trader Joe's used to have an organic tart cherry juice but it was discontinued long ago and I hadn't been able to find it anywhere. I couldn't find any kind of tart cherries without sugar nor any kind of tart cherry juice without sugar. True, this isn't organic but it's fabulous, delicious, and sugar free. I add it to water with fresh lemon juice and to my tea. If I had soda stream I'd use it with that. In fact now I'm thinking of buying Soda Stream just for this juice. I just received it yesterday. Last Sat I developed an acute attack of gout arthritis and this juice is already helping. I'm going get a bottle every month on auto delivery. I love it!

review/text: What a great thing to have a natural ingredient to help with aches and pains. I just take it straight, and it is tart, but a sweet taste that is gone in a couple of minutes. This stuff gets rid of the pain in my shoulder when I don't get relief from over the counter meds don't work. And that stuff is bad for your kidneys, (actually dangerous).

One month later, the cost went up to $18.99 - and now it is $25.99.  The product is not worth a $9.00 increase per month.  Lower the cost and I might subscribe again.

review/text: I had heard about the health benefits of tart cherry concentrate through AARP and Dr. Oz.  Both resources claimed that taking 2 tablespoons in liquid each day would help with joint issues.  I found this claim to be true, as did some of my relatives.  This is a tasty way of "taking your medicine."  The only negative is the 80 calories in those 2 tablespoons.  This is not a huge amount, but calories do matter even a small amount.  However, I would suggest that the benefits outweigh the negatives.

review/summary: Tart is Smart Tart Cherry
review/text: I decided to try Tart Cherry juice concentrate based not just on the overwhelming anecdotal evidence, but the research behind it. Go to pubmed and search the abstracts for "Tart Cherry" and you will find multiple recent studies examining its effects on joint health,inflammation,and sleep patterns.<br />Well, my personal experience corroborates these claims. I've used the product for 2 weeks and notice improvement in knee pain and even deeper sleep w/ more vivid dreams. The taste of the juice itelf is actually quite good. Most of the research has participants taking between 10-14 ounces of cherry juice drink. I take one concentrated serving, 1 ounce a concentrate per serving, twice daily. Cheers!

review/summary: Life Changing and Truly Remarkable!
review/text: My husband and I began drinking tart cherry juice when someone told us it was good for the aches and pains felt due to arthritis and we haven't been the same since!  We tried several different ones and Tart Is Smart Tart Cherry Concentrate has been the one that has given us the most positive results. We mix it 2 Tablespoons to a cup of water and drink it once a day.  (It tastes good too which is a plus!)  On the rare occasion that we miss a day, we are well aware of it because our joints hurt more on those days.  Through Amazon.com, we get it shipped automatically [on a personalized] schedule which makes the price even more affordable but even without that added bonus, the price is very reasonable.  Thumbs up from both of us on this as we have become advocates for it and tell anyone who will listen about the advantages of drinking it daily.

review/summary: A Two-Fold Product That Works For Me
review/text: Sometimes with an active lifestyle comes bad joints. I have arthritis in my knees and hips and get very little relief, if any, from all the diets and supplements I'm on. I'm far from crippled but the stiff painful joints is enough to make me feel and move like an old man at times. A guy at work recommended Black Cherry juice and I ignored him for quite a while since nothing else seemed to work - so why should this? Out of despair I picked some up at the grocery store and within 24 hours I felt much better. Not just much better but a lot better! I can't say this will work for everyone but over the last month I'm a new man. It's still hard to believe it's actually working.<br /><br /> As for "Tart is Smart" it saves me a lot of money by buying it through Amazon. It's concentrated and goes a long way. I use two bottles a month which gives me two 8 once glasses of cherry juice a day. I'd be spending three times as much in the grocery store. The taste isn't bad but as far as juices go it isn't my favorite. It's worth the health benefits though since I'm getting arthritic relief and boosting up my fruit consumption for the day.

review/summary: OK but bottled juice is better
review/text: When I mix up the concentrate, at the lower recommended amount it is weak and not sweet enough.  It is better if you add more of the concentrate, but it still has a bit of an off-taste compared to tart cherry juice that I get in glass bottles at Whole Foods.  It is not bad after experimenting with the concentration and mixing in a little bit of some other juice, but it is still somewhat disappointing.  I have not tried it in recipes, but I suspect it would be fine there.

review/summary: Rather have a beer!
review/text: I have seen two types of cherry juice concentrate for sale: tart cherry concentrate and black cherry concentrate. Both have their "benefits", but tart cherry concentrate seems to be the better product.<br /><br />Neither the tart cherry nor the black cherry taste much like fresh cherries. They both have a hint of over-rip fruit. The tart cherry is tart (dah). Reminds me kinda of cranberry juice (sort of).<br /><br />The directions call for a mix of 6 parts water to 1 part concentrate. This mixture is too strong for me. I like mixing 20 or so to 1 in a quart bottle and allow it to chill over night. I drink the quart over the course of the day.<br /><br />It seem to work and I feel better.

In this concentrate form the cost comes out to about $2.67 per quart when you buy through Amazon on a regular delivery basis. I've been using Tart is Smart for about four months now and I feel I have more energy as a result. I will continue my automatic delivery for cost savings and because it is so good for you.

review/summary: What An Improvement
review/text: About a year ago, my mom introduced me to tart cherry concentrate while I was home visiting.  When I returned from vacation, no one sold it where I live.  I do a lot of shopping on Amazon.com and found Tart Is Smart Tart Cherry Concentrate.  It is cheaper than what my mom pays in the store back home and tastes just as great as the brand they have there.  I use it regularly and the difference is amazing.  I have fibromyalgia (diagnosed in 2002) and was in a bad car accident (1995).  The pain from both of those have been intense and debilating.  When a person is in constant pain, they can become depressed and even "grumpy" (as my husband puts it).  The cherry concentrate makes life so much more bearable.  I am not in constant pain all the time and no longer have to take muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories on a daily basis.  Not being in constant pain has definitely helped my smile and laughter return, and I am much more active than I have been in the past. I also sleep much better at night.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for putting this product on an automatic renewal capability.<br /><br />The extra bonus is that it tastes just like cherries. I will definitely keep ordering this product.

review/text: I ordered the first bottle a month ago and measured an ounce a day in a 7 oz glass of water, just the right mixture for taste and of course doing it this way the bottle lasted 32 days. I just received the second bottle today and am ready for another 32 days. Funny thing happened during shipping, the bottle was distorted with the cap being bent down into the top side,(good thing bottle is plastic & bent ok),and can't be straightened but no spillage happened, so I will carefully open and pour the syrup into the first bottle. The design of the bottle makes pouring into a shot glass easy for measurement.

review/summary: Good stuff, especially with Seltzer water
review/text: I recently switched to a diet free of all processed foods (hence, I've cut out anything with added sugar, salt, fat, which means everything from cookies to brownies to pizza to ice cream -- soooo painful!) to beat down rising blood sugar (doc started using words like "pre-diabetic".<br /><br />So I went for a bottle of this stuff. I pour about 2 tablespoons of it into a 16 oz glass, then mix in seltzer water.  It really hits the spot on hot afternoons in Savannah, GA, where we have four seasons: summer, summer, Christmas and more summer.<br /><br />Yeah, I don't know about the health claims, but it turns out that I have both joint and insomnia issues, and so so sure, that'd be nice if this drink mitigated even part of my problems (only been consuming it off and on for about a month, so we'll see).<br /><br />Anyway, if you don't like sweet, this is right for you, because it's just sweet enough in straight-up soda (seltzer) water, though at first you must "train" your taste buds to sense it (keep in mind that a natural, no-sugar diet heightens your taste buds so that fruits and any other naturally sweet stuff now tastes 20% sweeter than before; hence, it won't be that hard to get yourself to the level of enjoyment that I'm now at).

I got this for my joints, but I've found that it gives a lot of flavor to diet soda for a lot fewer calories (and more vitamins) than normal soda.  I also use it mixed with a little oil and vinegar for a great salad dressing.  It can also be mixed with a little balsamic vinegar for a delicious sauce for chicken or pork.  I can't tell you how many people have asked for my chicken recipe when I use it as an ingredient in a glaze while grilling.  And being a concentrate, it takes up a lot less space in comparison to buying several quarts worth of unconcentrated cherry juice.  This stuff is amazing!

review/summary: what a tart!
review/text: This is a concentrate that i found much sweeter than  I thought it would be. Its not excessively  tart or sour which makes it very easy to dilute and drink. I got it for someone who has arthritis....its supposed to relieve inflammation...but the verdict is still out on that :)  All in all its yummy!

review/text: This definitely helps with gout and arthritic complications, but the taste when mixed with water is not good. It has a bitter aftertaste that lingers. If this was all I had to choose from, it would be worth drinking for it's health benefits.  However, I will be looking for a different brand and hope I can find one that gives me both; good health benefits and good taste.

review/summary: May add trips to the bathroom
review/text: I had been drinking Knudson's Just Black Jerry juice for several years to prevent gout, and it worked.  But when the stores in my area were no longer stocking it, I had to find an alternative. This was the 2nd different one which I tried. While it appears all the ones I tried still help me stay away from gout pain, this one had an added affect. Yes, diarrhea. It took me a few days to figure it out. I had been drinking it for about a week and was feeling well other then the extra trips to the bathroom. Figured it had to be something I was eating or drinking. This was the only "new" thing I had introduced. So I stopped drinking it and within 24 hours my bowels were back to normal and have stayed back to normal.  Also fortunately the Knudson Just Black Cheery juice was back in stock at my store, so I am back on it and have no unwanted side affects. The store manager told me it was a back order issue with Knutson.  So all is well today.  And I have always had a pretty strong stomach. I pity those who do not.

review/summary: Price is too high
review/text: When I originally purchased this product I only paid about $18.00 dollars for it and I thought that was what I would pay each time I received the product; but when the next shipment came it had almost doubled in price and I could not afford it, so I cancelled it altogether.  I think the product itself is most likely great if you can afford to take it all the time, which I cannot.  I am living on a shoestring and wishes, neither of which are getting any better.  Thank you for letting me give my opinion of the product itself.  I really think it would have helped my arthritis immensely, but unfortunately, through the fault of no one except the economy and my age and financial status at this time, I will not find out.  God Bless you all and keep you safe.<br /><br />Barbara M. Voage

review/summary: Delicious and more than just drink -
review/text: I love this stuff, I really do!<br /><br />Mixed in water or soda with a little ice it's wonderfully refreshing. It's also good drizzled on ice cream, mixed in a smoothie and adds a bright, fresh flavor to a milkshake. It's also lovely IN ice cream if you make your own. I like to soak a cup or so (never have measured the amount) of dried cherries in the concentrate mixed with a touch of water - chop the cherries while still in the juice and put in the freezer for about 1/2 hour. I like to add a squirt of Agave syrup for a bit of added sweetness. Also add a touch of the syrup to your ice cream mix - when the ice cream is finished stir the cherry mix in. Freeze. YUM!<br />Make the ice cream with low fat milk and save yourself a herd of calories and fat.<br /><br />It also makes an out-of-this-world sorbet and mixes well with other flavors like orange and lemon.<br /><br />If you're making a white cake - substitute the oil with applesauce with 2 tablespoons of tart cherry juice mixed in.<br />You'll get a pretty pink, very, very moist cake with just hint of cherry flavor.<br />Make the frosting for the cake and use add a little tart cherry juice to it. Very pretty, very tasty and less sweet than when you make it with water only.<br /><br />Dice up a bunch of fresh fruit, add a handful of coconut, a handful of nuts if you like and then make a bowl of whipped cream and add a few drops of tart cherry juice to it - the whipped cream with be a bit softer than usual- pour it over the fruit mix and you've got a dessert in less than 10 minutes of time.<br /><br />I consume at least 2 tablespoons of this wonderful concentrate every day and never get tired of it.

review/summary: On my 6th bottle
review/text: For years I had a slight limp that I attributed to my shoes.  Then I had what I thought were calluses on the big toe joints on my left foot that I also assumed were due to my shoes.  Turned out it was gout.  On the internet tart cherry juice was said to help.  I started drinking a small cup (maybe 6 oz) of this once a day and quickly the joint swelling went down as did my limp.  A little over a year later, I still have what seem to really be calluses on the big toe joints, but instead of being large, and hard, they have shrunk to almost flat and there's no hardness underneath.  It's just taking time for them to go away.<br /><br />Just to be clear, I probably has issues with other joints which gave me the limp, but the only visible symptom was on that big left toe.  I think this has made a big difference in all my joints.<br /><br />Diet is another factor and I've tried to change that as well, but really this juice is what has made the difference.  I don't drink it daily now as that's hard to keep up, but I try to since it made such an obvious difference.

review/text: I am not doubting the health benefits of this product (they are legion), but I cannot get by the aftertaste. Compared to the taste of fresh tart cherry juice there is a distinct aftertaste. I think it may be due to leaching from the plastic container. A glass container may make a difference. And lo and behold Traverse Farms makes a cherry juice conc in bottles and it is the absolute best.

review/summary: Tastes nasty
review/text: I use cherry juice daily for my arthritis, and I bought this product because it represents a good deal...so I splurged and got a couple of quarts.  It's going to be tough to drink them both, because they have a very brackish and nasty taste.  As far as I can tell, it's still effective for my arthritis, but drinking it is like drinking very bad cough medicine.  Compare the taste of this to the product by Dynamic Health and believe me, you'll understand.<br /><br />I've been drinking cherry juice for a long time now, so this isn't just because I'm not used to it, or don't understand how to dilute it.  It's just a gross tasting product.<br /><br />Also--maybe this was just chance, but Amazon shipped this product on the same date it expired.  Maybe that's why it tastes so terrible, but whatever he reason I won't be ordering it again...64 ounces of concentrate is a lot to go through when you have to try hard not to puke when you drink it, LOL.

review/summary: GREAT taste! GREAT convenience! GREAT health benefits!
review/text: Carrington Farms organic milled flax seeds are delicious with a slight nutty flavor kind of like wheat germ. But flax seeds are so much better for you and the texture is great! To get the full benefits of flax seeds, they must be ground or cut in some way or will pass straight through the body with all the nutrients still inside the seeds. They are a pain to grind yourself and measure exact amounts without a scale. These packets are fantastic because they are pre-measured, the flax seeds are already ground, they do not become dangerously rancid, and one a day on cereal or in a bowl of soup is a powerhouse of nutrients and positive health benefits. Centuries ago, Charlemagne made it law that people in his kingdom consume flaxseed because he believed in its health benefits so much! One of these packets has 2 grams of protein, 3 grams of soluble/insoluble fiber, zinc, B vitamins, 90mg of potassium (and only 4.8 mg of sodium!), sulfur, magnesium and on and on and on....<br /><br />The importance of balancing Omega 3 to Omega 6 appears to help so much with almost any type of inflammation from arthritis to intestinal inflammation. The proper balance also can help with depression. As well, some studies have indicated that consuming an adequate amount of milled flax seeds everyday can lower cholesterol as effectively as statin drugs without the side effects. Milled flax seeds seem to help diabetics because of the fiber and micro-nutrients, and also help people with a number of skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and those who just want over-all better skin condition. It may even help those wih dry eye syndrome. It's good for weight loss too with all the micro-nutrients and beneficial oils which help burn fat.<br /><br />I believe Carrington Farms is packaging a little miracle in each packet! Stay with it once you begin with the milled flaxseed. Depending on how out of balance your Omega 3 to Omega 6 may be, balancing may take some time. I noticed almost IMMEDIATE improvement in my well being, arthritis pain, and blood sugar control. Not enough good could ever be written for such a wonderful product! This is a TEN STAR product as FIVE STARS are not enough!
