review/text: Ok so I am a Hellman's mayo man. However clearly something has changed in their recipe; while they're hardly terrible, that classic taste is MIA.<br /><br />I, a Blue Plate virgin, decided to give it a try based solely off the few reviews here. After some delay thanks to shipping issues with lazy Fed-Ex, the mayo arrived yesterday. I decided to test it out on something I've not had in quite a long while: a great NYC cold roast beef sandwich. I told the deli to hold the mayo, because I've got that taken care of!<br /><br />Let me tell you it was, bar none, the best roast beef sandwich I've ever had. Now credit must go to great slices of rare beef, fresh lettuce, and my own personal addition, avocado, but the mayo was the scene stealer here. It seduces you to the point where you literally have to force yourself from drowning the sandwich in it's alluring goodness.<br /><br />When mayonnaise dreams of being reincarnated as a higher being, this is the stuff it longs to be. As I type I am chowing down on a bowl of tuna, egg, and broccoli salad and the mayo has just turned the whole thing on it's ear.<br /><br />Get this mayo now. It just does not get better than this.

review/summary: Blue Plate Mayonnaise
review/text: I first had Blue Plate mayonnaise years ago when I was traveling for my job. I was in the South, at a restaurant. I had a sandwich, and the mayo on it was SO GOOD. I asked the waitress what kind of mayo it was, and she told Blue Plate. Not living in the South at the time, I couldn't buy it at the store, but never forgot it. When I moved to the Florida Panhandle (L.A. - Lower Alabama) they had it there, and I was in heaven. Now in West-Central Florida, it's not in the stores here, but I was excited to find it on Amazon. I'll never use anything else again!

In my old age I have decided it's time to try making changes. so after reading positive reviews from customers about this mayonnaiseI thought I would give it a try. WOW. it was even better than I thought it would be. I received it Prime Eligible and subscription so I got a great price in a great mayonnaise. It has a very rich full taste. I really research customer reviews and I outweigh the good against the bad. please take my word for it you will love this mayonnaise, just give it a try. Also prompt delivery and very well packaged. 5 stars all the way Thank you. Also it is in plastic jars not glass. I like the change. If you or the kids drop it? No worries!

review/summary: Like Home-Made
review/text: Let me begin my review by stating that I have been a Helmann's mayonnaise devotee for the better part of my lifetime. I have tried many other brands, mainly out of curiosity, and found all of them inferior. Recently, a friend recommended Blue Plate brand. To be honest, I had never even heard of Blue Plate Mayonnaise. To my surprise however, on a recent trip to my local Publix, there it was, in an unassuming blue, yellow, and red container, tucked away on the bottom shelf. Given my frequent disappointments, I was skeptical to say the least.My fears were soon put to rest, however.<br />  Upon first taste, I immediately thought of Helmann's. Blue Plate had a nice, slightly acidic tang that I was familiar with. There was no sweetness whatsoever. The Blue Plate had a nice clean aftertaste, and no heavy off-oil flavor, common to many lesser brands. (Even the much vaunted Duke's brand, which I tried with high expectations, let me down in this department. It tasted heavily of cheap oil.) While the taste is very similar, where Blue Plate is leaps and bounds ahead of Helmann's is in the texture department. For those of you who have ever made home-made mayo, you are familiar with the wonderful, velvety texture that is created. There is a nice sheen, and a good white (not yellow) color. Blue Plate reminded me of this exactly. Unlike Helmann's, there is no "whipped" thing going on here - very little air in the mixture, which added to the outstanding, home-made experience. I can see why Blue Plate has been a staple in Cajun Kitchens for the better part of a century.<br />  For those of you who take your Mayo seriously, I strongly recommend Blue-Plate. I really believe you will not be disappointing.

You must taste it for yourself. Highly recommended.

review/text: My wife and I are picky about mayonnaise and have been Hellmann's loyalists for over a decade now.  However, after seeing that this product was top rated we decided to give it a shot via Amazon (since this is not sold in the Northeast).  The price was very good - including shipping, so it was not a big risk on our part had we not liked the product.<br /><br />Well my wife was sold after one taste, while I waited a bit before making my vote.  But there is no denying it, this is a better product.<br /><br />NOTE:  We have ordered this twice through Amazon now, and each time the expiration date of the product was over a year out - so they are not shipping items on the verge of expiration.  4 containers still too much for you?  Find a friend and split a 4 pack.

review/summary: Unfortunately Awful Taste/Texture
review/text: I bought this after reading the nutrition information. If it tasted good, it would be a wonderful breakfast, especially on the week-ends or you could even use it as a dinner entree because it has only 2 grams of fat/serving, 5 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein. Unfortunately this mix tastes ghastly and the texture of the pancakes is kind of "pebbley" and just not what I've come to expect from a pancake. Also, the pancakes are very fragile and hard to turn. If you make the mix as directed the pancakes are thick and take a very long time to get done and end up too brown. This happened even after I thinned the batter with a bit more milk.<br />And speaking of milk....with this mix you have to add milk, oil and eggs. With my regular mix, I only have to add water or milk and they taste alot better than these do.<br /><br />I thought maybe I could salvage it by mixing it with my usual brand of pancake mix but even at a 40/60 ratio (40 of this mix, 60 of my usual brand) it just tasted awful and again with the yucky texture. Since it doesn't taste sweet to me, I tried mixing it up with some spices, bread crumbs and a bit of flour and dredged a few chicken tenders through an egg and then in the mixture and then I fried them in canola oil. It was not too bad however, it wasn't good enough for me to want to keep this mix or to ever buy it again especially since I almost never fry chicken anymore. One last thing: I read that once you heat flax seed to a certain temp, it looses it's "goodness" so I think you probably lose that healthy aspect of this mix.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is too expensive, tastes awful and has a horrible texture. I won't ever buy again and I ended up throwing away the last half of the package.

review/summary: Best Da*n Coffee, Period
review/text: Before joining the military back about about a bazillion years ago, I wasn't a coffee drinker.  Never cared for the stuff.  As fate would have it, my first duty station was in Germany, and required many long shifts at odd hours.  I begrudgingly began to drink the stuff (and surly everyone has heard about military coffee, all of it is true). By accident I happened across Jacobs coffee, and began to drink the stuff for pure enjoyment.  Drank it by the pot, I did, loved the stuff...<br />And then I rotated back to the states.  This was before the days of the luxury of the internet, and my beloved coffee was not to be found...  After 911, I went overseas again, and managed to bring back some Arabic coffee, but it was a poor substitute.  And then I found amazon.com.  Love this site, and the things I can find on it.  I'm reviewing this purchase not for the coffee (which, by now, I think I've gotten the point across that I love to death), but rather the grate deal I got on it.

review/summary: Lakerol Special Licorice
review/text: Update on 09-03-2010:  I recently learned (by reading) that the natural sweetener Xylitol is poisonous for dogs to ingest.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Too bad I can't rate this product with ten stars! Manufactured in Sweden, these are appreciated around the world. Why do I appreciate them so much? What are they like? Well, here goes:<br /><br />Sugar free with only 3 calories per serving, they are sweetened with xylitol, which occurs naturally in the fiber of many fruits and vegetables. Xylitol has virtually no aftertaste, and doesn't impact blood sugar, so diabetics can enjoy them. With these, I haven't noticed any tummy discomfort as I do with Sorbitol or Aspartame. I don't really consider these as candy in the normal sense, but more as a refreshment. These pastilles are a wonderful treat that can help prevent cavities by keeping the saliva flowing. This is especially helpful for those of us who are stressed, have a medical condition or take medications that can cause dry mouth. These pastilles are firm but chewy, and also melt in one's mouth. There are no sharp edges which can occur with some hard candies.<br /><br />The taste is distinctive, rich and pleasurable, with notes of licorice and menthol.  A serving is two pieces, with a total of 12 servings per box (which is small enough to discreetly carry in a pocket or purse.)<br /><br />Lakerol Special Licorice pastilles come in handy, too.  Ever need to change the subject in a hurry? Offer one of these. Got the munchies at 2:00 a.m. but want to wake up free of guilt? Forget the cake and have a couple of these instead! Mouth going dry on your way to the principal's office? (Or enrolled in a speech class?) No problem. These will help!  Bored stiff trying to do your taxes? Lakerol and a stroll away from your desk will help refresh you... and with luck you will think of a couple more deductions.<br /><br />If you suffer from arthritis or any other source of chronic pain as I do (ankylosing spondylitis), these may help distract you from the pain and help you proactively focus on doing something kind and positive for yourself, such as gentle stretching or a hot bath.<br /><br />These do have menthol, but are not overwhelmingly strong, which is a nice plus. If you have a sensitive mouth, as I do, this can be very comforting. Also, I'm a chocoholic, but more often than not these stop those cravings and reframe my feelings to something more positive.<br /><br />My husband and I both love these and wouldn't want to be without them. Whoever invented them must be a genius! I've ordered them multiple times through Amazon.com and am extremely satisfied.  My order often arrives within four days or so. What more could I ask for?  I hope you try these if you haven't before.... they really are special.

review/summary: Licorice Menthol Pastilles
review/text: I can't believe the one star review. These candies are delicious. I'm diabetic and dislike no-sugar items; however, these leave NO aftertaste! The licorice is soothing rather than overbearing, and the menthol is very subtle. I wasn't especially fond of the lemon flavor, but that's why there is chocolate & vanilla! I've let friends try the licorice, and several have asked where they can buy them. 5*****

review/text: I think I first had the licorice menthol ones as a child.  I have loved them from the beginning.  Was so happy to find them a few years ago at the WORLD MARKET however they have now discontinued carrying them. I am now having to order them on line. Thank goodness. I know some people hate them - don't know why that is.  I can't get enough.

review/summary: Lakerol
review/text: I am an a'cappella singer and I use ONLY Lakerol Special Menthol liqorice lozenges to soothe my throat - and they are sugar free!  I have tried other lozenges for dry, scratchy or sore throat, but others have sugar in them, which also irritates my throat.  Lakerols are also small in size and work very quickly to soothe and moisten.  With other lozenges, I have to deal with a large piece of candy which takes much longer to melt and to work.  I cannot use any other kind of lozenge for singing except Lakerols.

review/summary: Clear Tones!
review/text: I have been singing "lead" in barbershop quartets for more than 40 years.  Phlegm is a constant problem for singers, especially the lead, who must sing with clear, strong tones for the other three to match.  For the past ten years, I have sung with the comedy quartet, Lilac Crazy.  (We chose that name, not because we're crazy about the color lilac, but because we LIE LIKE CRAZY!)  The bass singer always offers me one of her Lakerol lozenges before we sing, and I always accept it, plus two or three others.  The lozenge soothes my throat and helps my voice sound more clear.  Finally, I ordered a case from Amazon.com, and I no longer have to "bum" Lakerols from her.  I probably owe her a case of them by now.  Ordering them from Amazon.com is so easy, that won't be a problem!

review/text: My friend had a pack at her house that she purchased from a fundraiser.  I noticed the little box sitting on the table and inquired, as I like licorice.  Well I pop one of these minis into my mouth and thought hard perhaps stale?  Strong menthol, kind of gross tasting, and lastly that I love them anyways and need a lifetime supply, so thank G-D for the internet.  Everyone I know ends up liking them, though they are not sure why?  :-)

review/summary: Smoke a pack of Menthols and chew on a dirty tire at the same time.
review/text: I had to put in a review of this product after I read the previously entered 5 star reviews. I purchased some tonight at World Market and I must say that this is absolutely the worst tasting candy that I have ever come across. Believe me, I have done some serious traveling, everywhere from Canada, across the US, Mexico, South America, Jamaica, Britain, Belgium, the Philippines, Dominican Republic, Guam, and the Cayman islands. I have tried food and candies from each one of those locations, and I have never tasted anything like this candy. Please do not waste your money and buy this. The candy is so bad that most people I have given it to could not keep it in their mouth, but rather spit it out on the floor. I could not believe the taste when I tried it. Imagine if you will cramming an entire pack of filter-less menthol camel cigarettes in your mouth and smoking them, while at the same time chewing on a dirty tire and drinking water from a dirty ashtray... That may come close to the flavor of these little bad boys. These candies are made in Sweden therefore I have come to the conclusion that Swedish people have no taste buds. (I'm Joking, I love Swedes).

They are around $3 a box at the grocery store.  So I ordered 2 thinking I would get 6 boxes - a good deal.  Not so, one box for $7.73 - crazy.  My error for not reading the small print but the picture is deceiving and when ordering on a phone one doesn't pay as much attention.  Lesson learned but am going to try to return anyway!!!

review/summary: Space food for bad astronauts
review/text: You like eating a sponge? Good. This is like chewing on a sponge that stinks of Fruity Pebbles.<br /><br />We've all eaten Rice Krispies treats; those are good, those are slightly crunchy. This is just a dense gummy mess that tastes like it has zero natural ingredients in it, entirely a science project affair. I could deal with the astronaut food consistency of the product if it tasted good. It probably would have been smarter marketing to associate this with the Jetsons rather than the Flintstones.<br /><br />On the bright side, each unit has only 90 calories. The ingredients boast of no high fructose corn syrup, gluten free, and 10% of the FDA vitamin D requirement. But I get the impression that these benefits are as illusory as the products that shout, "Sugar Free!" while loading you up with sucralose, aspartame, or whatever test tube agglomeration it is that conjoins scientists and marketers like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R4T1C">siamese twins</a>.<br /><br />I confess, I didn't look at the label until after I put it in my mouth. Well, actually, I didn't look at the label until just now as I was writing this. Apart from a few recognizable elements including vitamins or minerals, the ingredients include a laboratory soup of red 40, niacinamide, reduced iron, zinc oxide, turmeric oleoresin, yellow 6, yellow 5, blue 1, palmitate, blue 2, marshmallow (corn syrup, sugar, gelatin, natural and artificial flavor), hydrogenated vegetable oil (coconut and palm kernel oils), partially hydrogenated palm kernel and palm oils, dextrose, glycerin, soy lecithin. Any vestige of nutrition that these bars might contain presumably comes from the manufacturer artificially adding in vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />It's hard to consider this a food product. One could imagine the day will arrive when any organic substance found in the average kennel could be processed to contain a soft creamy multivitamin center so the packaging could boast that it contained 100% of FDA daily requirements. Until that day arrives, this product should suffice.

review/summary: Tasty, But So Smelly
review/text: I thought I dreamed these up until on a whim I did a search online and found out they were real, so I ordered them through Amazon. Two days later they arrived. They are a bit small. They are like Rice Krispie treats, in that they are a block of cereal held together by sticky "marshmallow". They are tasty, but there is this smell that is terrible about them. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the "marshmallow". Whatever it is, I had to put the wrapper on the bar while I ate it because I didn't want my hand to smell from holding it. I thought maybe I got a bad batch, but I found a friend who found them in a store and tried them and said the same thing about the smell. You don't really taste the smell unless you inhale with your mouth while you have a bite of the bar in it. It's too bad because they would have been a treat I would have purchased more of.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: In general, I'm not a fan of gift baskets. They often contain sub-par items that are not of good quality, nor do they taste good. This basket from Wine.com is a big exception, and it was really a very pleasant surprise. Every item in this basket was tasty, and thoroughly enjoyable. The pink color on most of the items makes me think it might be a more appropriate gift for a woman than a man, but the treats would appeal to anyone. The basket was lovely, and could be used long after the food is gone. I'm always watching my calorie intake, and all the food in this basket, individually, fit into my daily plan as a snack without too much adjustment.<br /><br />In many cases, I wind up giving away or throwing out the food that comes in pre-made gift baskets that we might receive during the holidays. Many times I take one bite of food and throw it out because the poor quality is just not worth it. However, had I received this basket as a gift I would have been pleasantly surprised and I would have kept all the food. (And eaten it!)

review/summary: Nice Enough Gift
review/text: It's a little hard to judge this item because I don't know what price this will be offered at, and with an item like this that does make a difference. It certainly is a nicely packaged item that makes a nice presentation, and I could easily see giving this to a wide variety of people I might not know well because who doesn't like a bit of sweets, especially for a special occasion? But there's not really a whole lot here, it's more of a "sampler" package, so I would give it as a gift for a maximum of 2 people, not for a family to share. As far as the sweets themselves, they were all right, but not great. I thought the fudge was a bit grainy, and the cookies were ok but there are certainly better quality sweets out there that I would give to people I know and care about more.<br /><br />For presentation it's a 5, but for products about a 3 to 3.5.  At this point, I think I would give this as a hostess gift or to a manager for a holiday or special occasion, but for true friends and family I would spend the extra bucks for higher quality products.

review/summary: definitely "delightful and enjoyable", beautifully presented
review/text: I love to put together gift baskets and goodie bags for special people. I also love to receive them! The "Delight and Enjoy" gift basket more than lives up to its name--I was smiling all over myself before I even removed the user-friendly plastic wrap. This presentation is truly the "total package". The color scheme is deep pink with black and gold accents--pretty, but not too frilly. I adore the oval basket with the wooden handles, and my first thought was "great bread basket". It's long enough and deep enough to make a generous serving basket. The big golden bow tied around the package added a touch of elegance, and it could be reused in many different ways. The deep pink shredded paper filler is very colorful and added enough cushiness to keep everything safely in place. This type of filler is also reusable and is much preferable to many other types of filler. On to the good stuff! "Delight and Enjoy" offers a variety of sweet treats, from creamy chocolate fudge to crispy little spice cookies. Claeys Kettle Fresh Chocolate Fudge is not overly-rich, and it is really melt-in-your mouth creamy. The Primo Dulce Truffle cookies are rich, but still light, and the chocolate coating lands on the tongue just right. Brown & Haley's Cashew Roca was crunchy butter toffe with a light coating of chocolate and chopped cashews. Beth's Heavenly Little Chocolate Chip Cookies are crispy cookie bites with a touch of chocolate and a really good flavor. The Dolcetto European Style Wafer Rolls are ultra-light, but still richly flavored. Angelina's Sweet Butter Cookies are simply buttery sweet and good. The Torani Chocolate Milano Biscotti is darkly rich and was perfect dipped in a cup of vanilla cappucino. Everything was scrumptious, but my favorite item was the Biscoff Caramelized Belgian Coookies--Yum! It's been a while since I had this type of cookie--lightly spiced, thin and flavorful. These cookies are individually wrapped and would be perfect portables. This is a wonderful gift basket for tea and coffee drinkers who love a good cookie plate along with their cuppa!

review/summary: Really really delicious, gorgeous packaging, awesome gift idea
review/text: The packaging was so beautiful, all color coordinating, high color graphics, very artistically created and arranged. They were all designed with the feel of old world European elegance.  (Perhaps the color palette and design motifs from the era of what we associate with Marie Antoinette.)  All the cookies in the assortment were fantastically delicious.  We gobbled through them all in two days.  (most were petite size in packages with 2 servings each approx.) These were more what I would call European biscuit type cookies that you might find enjoyable with afternoon tea (ie. more like shortbread cookies, nibbly, not chewy, and not overly sweet - how refreshing!).  These cookies were all very fresh, made with very high quality ingredients, and a true pleasure to enjoy.  I would highly recommend this gift basket to anyone.  The entire thing was delivered well wrapped and not one cookie was broken on the inside.  The basket was made of very high quality and can be reused as a fruit basket or a bread basket etc.  I can't say enough good things about this gift basket of cookies.

review/summary: Good, but small
review/text: This basket is very attractively packaged; the sweets are well displayed and the basket is fairly nice, as this sort of thing goes.  The bow is attractive enough to save, and the basket holds a good variety, from biscotti to candy.  The frustration-free packaging was easy to open and protected the contents very well.<br /><br />The contents made nice snacks paired with coffee, with flavors running from very good to just so-so.  The Cashew Roca is delicious, as Roca-brand treats always are, to my taste.  The chocolate chip cookies barely earn the name, as they are very sandy shortbread (a texture unlike any I expect when I think "chocolate chip cookies") with tiny, scarce chips too small even to taste chocolaty.  The fudge is tasty, although there are only two small pieces.<br /><br />Therein lies my chief complaint:  All of the items are very over-packaged for the amount of food they actually contain, making the basket appear much more generous than it actually is.  For example, the fudge box measures 3 x 4 inches (that's it on the right in the picture of the filled basket), containing two pieces of fudge that measure just over an inch square:  12 square inches of box for about 2 inches of fudge.  The Roca box (on the left in the picture) is 6 x 3-1/2 inches, with three small pieces of Roca in it.  The cookie box was about 24 square inches, containing 2 ounces of itsy-bitsy cookies (each is about the size of a quarter).<br /><br />There is no dishonesty in advertising here, as the basket clearly lists contents of just 11.9 ounces.  However, the appearance is one of a large, bountiful basket full of treats, but it actually doesn't contain very much once all the packaging is disposed of.<br /><br />At the right price, I would suggest this as a nice, small gift with an interesting variety of treats -- emphasis being on small.

review/summary: Do you love sweets?
review/text: There are eight items in this basket all of them sweets.  There's a nice blend of tastes both for chocolate lovers and non-chocolate devotes.  Most of the individual packages contain two to eight pieces.  The basket the items come in is cute with two small side handles, not of the type that's reusable except for very light items and for a decorative purpose, not for hard use.  The color of the boxes range from white, to beige to pink.  There was a gold bow tied around the cellophane covered basket with pink paper shreds on the bottom.<br /><br />Here is a breakdown of the individual items you'll receive:<br /><br />Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies<br /><br />Almost bite sized cookies that have a shortbread texture.  There are VERY few chips in them but that was fine with me because the cookies were delicious.  I love that style of texture and taste.  The box contained about eight to ten cookies.  I'm not sure if it was the packaging or the style of cookie itself but they were a bit pulverized.<br /><br />4/5 stars<br /><br />Brown and Haley's Cashew Roca<br /><br />One of my favorites!  There were three individually wrapped, larger than expected cookies.  They were extremely fresh which meant they had a slight crunch but they were easily chewable without sticking to your teeth.  The chocolate was soft and melty.<br /><br />5/5 stars<br /><br />Claeys' Chocolate Fudge<br /><br />I'm not fond of fudge because it's so sweet.  The package contained two individually wrapped pieces.  For me this was just ok.<br /><br />3/5 stars<br /><br />Dolcetto's Chocolate Cookies<br /><br />These are the rolled, Italian like, flakey tube cookies and the outside was chocolate as well as the inside.  Very fresh and though they were all in one package the flaking damage was minimal.  The fudge inside was soft and gooey.  Nice blend of soft and crunchy.<br /><br />4.5/5 stars<br /><br />Torani Chocolate Milano Biscotti<br /><br />You receive one large biscotti.  The chocolate is in the brisket itself as opposed to being a coating, it's almost a bitter taste though not unpleasant, and it has a few nuts mixed in.  The consistency is a bit too crunchy to my taste.<br /><br />2/5 stars<br /><br />Primo Dolce Truffle Cookies<br /><br />There are two large cookies individually wrapped and oh my Goodness they're good!  Each wrapper contains two thick wafers sealed together with chocolate; chocolate also surrounds both of them. Along with the Cashew Roca this was my favorite in the basket.<br /><br />5/5 stars<br /><br />Angelina's Sweet Butter Cookies<br /><br />You receive ten average sized cookies, 4 round, two oblong, two pretzel shaped and two donut shaped. They're good; a nice relief from chocolate (is there such a thing?).<br /><br />3.5/5 stars<br /><br />Biscoff Caramelized Belgian Cookies<br /><br />You receive six individual wrapped small rectangle shaped cookies.  Very nice taste with no cloying sweetness.  I would think these would go well served with Earl Grey Tea or black coffee.<br /><br />4/5 stars

review/summary: More packaging than food!
review/text: Depending on who you're buying this for, it may not be such a big deal that there's more packaging than food in this basket. Where packaging is concerned, it is done well with a bow and all. The basket is very nice and can be re-used. Like the picture shows, most of the boxes are very pink!<br />But on to the contents. Here's what you get (8 boxes total):<br />- Dolcetto Chocolate Cookies. 3 of them, each looks like a cigar with chocolate inside. Nice and tasty.<br />- Claeys Kettle Fresh Chocolate Fudge. 2 individually wrapped pieces. Also very tasty.<br />- Brown & Haley Chashew Roca - 3 individually wrapped (small) pieces. Not too bad, sticks to the teeth though.<br />- Primo Dolce Chocolate Dipped Truffle Cookies. 2 individually wrapped (medium size) cookies. Nice and tasty.<br />- Angelina's Butter Cookies. A tray of different types of butter cookies (like the kind you get in a tin). Pretty good.<br />- Torani Chocolate Milano Biscotti. Just one of these. Has nuts in it and made with bitter sweet cholocate. Very filling and okay (not so tasty).<br />- Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies. A packet filled with about a dozen small cookies. Nice. They crumble easily though.<br />- Biscoff Carmelized Belgian Cookies. About 5 individually wrapped cookies. It sounds better than it tastes, but still not too bad.<br /><br />Overall this basket has very good presentation value (looks really nice). Most of the food items are good, but there's not as much as food as it looks like when you open it all up. It leaves you feeling a little bit gypped.

review/text: I love mocha coffee.  *love it*.  I've tried *a lot* of different kinds.  This is one of the best I've ever had.<br />Keep in mind this is different than the fake, artificially flavored stuff you are probably used to drinking.<br />It took me a while to adjust.<br />In fact, I really didn't enjoy the first cup all that much.<br />By day 3, I never wanted to drink my other brands ever again.<br />So, it gets my two thumbs up.  Its definitely worth a try.

review/summary: microwave your own tapioca puddingl  please try that instead
review/text: This is puzzling, since the pudding by Thankyou is currently not available, because I did receive it via Amazon about two weeks ago.<br />  Well, it would have been terrific to give this product lots of stars and kind words.  For several reasons, i can't praise this product except to say the label is very pretty, the can has a ring that holds well when you open the can, and the manufacturers use real sugar, not some corn-chemical sweetener.<br />I did open a can of this; the product is pale, liquid, and uses tiny bits of tapioca.  No eggs,although eggs are traditional with tapioca pudding.  If it's used again at our house, (bought a six-pack of this) some kind of protein powder to perk this up will be needed, and how do you keep it from making your stomach burn again?<br /><br />The product is "a product of its time",  meaning it is an artificial pudding, very liquid, with artificial colors like tartrazine or yellow number 5, and sunset yellow, or yellow number 6.<br /> So now you know that if you invite friends and family for dinner and some in the group are on the Feingold Diet and are sensitive to and trying to avoid artificial colors and flavors, you cannot serve them this.  Sorry.<br />  In trying to make things easier, looks like  we have made them difficult in other ways.<br />  It might be  really neat if you made your own tapioca pudding rather than using this product, and I'm sorry if that sounds  like a lot work, but  you might enjoy it;  it might take about ten minutes in the microwave, eggs, milk, sugar, tapioca, salt, vanilla.<br /> Recipes with how many and how much are on the internet.<br /> Or it can be made in about twenty minutes uninterrupted using a saucepan on the stove,  Stir  in a figure-8 pattern to avoid scorching, and remove from heat when mixture just comes to a boil.  It thickens as it cools.<br /> As for separating egg yolk from white, for the fancy meringue version of tapioca pudding, it's a skill that gets easier with time.<br /> One may just crack the eggshell and, while not puncturing the yolk at all,hold the yolk in half the shell while the eggwhite slips away by its own weight.  Maybe this skill isn't the same as sinking a three-point shot from way out; nevertheless you might enjoy cooking your own pudding.<br />  Very sorry could not recommend this canned Thankyou product.

This was a very good choice price-wise.  But it is also perfectly acceptable for the normal use in cooking, I'm sure.  It came quickly, nicely packaged, and the main thing...lots of it!!!!

review/text: I've tried quite a few different brands and styles of seaweed snacks, and these definitely have the best flavor of the ones I've tasted so far. Perfectly crispy, wonderfully salty, lightly seasoned with that distinctive sesame flavor -- they're amazing. Only problem is, each little box in the 3-pack has only about 10-12 2.5"X3.5" (6.4cm X 8.9cm) sheets of seaweed, so they disappear way too fast, and you need to buy at least ten packages at a time!

review/summary: Delicious for Pasta and Pizza
review/text: This is a delicious seasoning. I had been buying it in a health food store for ALOT more money and they stopped selling it :(<br />I was so happy to find it on Amazon. Now I order it by subscription so I never run out of it and I get it for a fantastic price!<br /><br />It is my family's all-time favorite spice blend. I use it on every kind of pizza, both fresh from the pizza parlor as well as on all frozen pizza's. When I'm out of jared pasta sauce, I use it to make my own combining canned tomatoes, Frontier Pizza Seasoning, a little olive oil, a spoon of sugar, some salt and pepper, and finally some parmesan cheese. In a pinch, this mades a very tasty sauce. I especially love the fennel they add to this scrumptious blend.<br /><br />I've even given it out for gifts by combining it with a pizza cutter. Can you tell I like this spice :)

I  used the same recipe I'd been using for years, I just wanted a quicker rise. Hodgson's performance does not seem to be equivalent to other products. I'm just glad it wasn't Thanksgiving, or I'd really be up a creek with my family.  I'm going back to Fleishman's, a brand that I can trust.

review/summary: Decent, but not great
review/text: When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

review/summary: Very very disappointed.
review/text: I was excited to purchase this product because gluten free oat bran has not been available in the US until now...gluten free oats, yes...but not oat bran.  For the past two years, I have been purchasing my gluten free oat bran from Canada and have been very pleased with the quality of the product and their customer service.  However, I thought I would try this company to minimize my shipping costs.<br />I received the product quickly; however, when I opened the plastic bag which contained the oat bran, there was a faint, but distinct, odor that I can only describe as sour milk.<br /><br />I notified the company via e-mail through their website and questioned what I might be smelling and whether I received oats that may have gone rancid.  When I did not receive an answer after a few days, I notified them again and added my complaint of poor customer service.  I received an e-mail and a telephone message assuring me that their oats were fresh and had a shelf life of another eight months.  She further explained that they were raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oats and very nutritious.<br /><br />Okay, I thought, so maybe oats that are raw, unsteamed, unprocessed and nutritious have an offensive odor. I am always open to eating foods in their most natural state.  For a few days, I ate the oat bran each morning even though it had a sour, as well as a sweet taste that I am not accustomed to.  I e-mailed the company again to let them know that the odor and taste did not seem right to me.  I asked if they would describe to me the odor of raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oats; but after a week, they have not responded.<br /><br />So either raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oat bran smells like sour milk and has a sour/sweetish taste or the oat bran that I received was rancid.  I guess I'll never know since they won't describe to me what it should smell and taste like.  Whatever the case, I won't buy it again.  I didn't enjoy the taste, as well as the odor.

The grain of the oat bran is finer than others, and makes it easier to mix into juices when I am in a hurry.  I have also made pancakes from it, and mixed it in smoothie drinks.  I have friends and family who have chosen to be on the Dukan diet.  They tried my oat bran from Legacy Valley, and said it tasted better, and was easier to use than other oat brans.<br /><br />The only downside is, I have not been able to purchase it through Amazon recently.<br />I am hoping it returns soon.

review/summary: Bitter, Rancid and horrible customer service
review/text: I was excited to see gluten free oat bran for sale on Amazon...so excited, I chose to ignore the bad reviews on it.  That was a huge mistake.  Like another reviewer stated, the smell before cooking is like sour milk and after is bitter and rancid tasting.  It literally burned my throat...horrible anyway I tried to prepare it.  I contacted the company to see if there had been any complaints with my batch, and I was met with a condescending, canned marketing message.  Our dialogue continued back and forth where they basically told me I was not used to the taste of whole grains and unprocessed foods.  That is ironic considering my diet is comprised of ONLY whole foods and grains.  I find it ridiculous that the company refuses to admit that sometimes, despite their best efforts, a product is just not good.  I would love those people to taste the foul product I was sent.<br />At any rate, the wonderful people at Amazon understand the concept of good customer service and refunded my order.  I will never deal with company Montana Monster Munchies again...it was a horrible experience.  However, my experience with Amazon, as usual, was great.

review/text: I read a previous review about the oat bran smelling rancid and clicked "buy", hoping it was just a bad batch that she received and that mine would be fine.  But unfortunately, that was not the case.  I wish I had saved the packaging so I could attempt to ship it back, but I was so excited to have GF oat bran that I poured it all into once big tupperware container.<br /><br />Not only does it smell rancid, it tastes bitter and awful. I tried soaking it in water overnight before cooking it to remove some of the bitterness, but it still tasted "off".  I have eaten a lot of oat bran, both GF and regular, and never has oat bran tasted like this.<br /><br />I don't like to leave bad reviews, but I really hope no one else makes the same mistake I did.<br /><br />Legacy Valley, I hope you just ran a couple bad batches.  If that is the case, do yourself a favor and THROW AWAY the remainder of those batches.

review/summary: One of the most disgusting snacks on the market
review/text: Bought these at a Target store, and ate two of them thinking the first one might have been defective.  Yes, it tasted that bad.  First, let me discuss the appearance.  This pressed fruit bar is yellow and brown, and looks like a bar of pressed ear wax drizzled with white yogurt.  It has no scent and the texture is similar to fruit rollups, only with a "chunkier" feel because it is thicker and also has more real fruit in it.  The taste is not good.  In fairness, you CAN taste the mango and peach flavor, but both are very subdued and are secondary to an overwhelming flavor of cardboard.  I didn't expect it to taste like a piece of candy or anything, but I did expect for the bar to present some sweetness or sourness.  It is very bland, dry, and tastes a lot like generic fruit pulp.  Finally, I want to talk about nutrition.  For 90 calories and half a gram of fat, this bar just isn't worth it.  Fiber One makes a delicious 90 calorie granola bar that is roughly the same size and tastes worlds better.  Also, this bar has barely any vitamin C.  A little citric acid would have improved flavor, added vitamin C, and not added calories.  One other thing:  These were expensive!  They cost too much for what they are.<br /><br />Overall, I disliked this snack so much I felt the need to go online and write a review.  That alone should tell you to avoid this poor product!

review/summary: My son loved this one!
review/text: I have tried a couple other plum organic flavors with my 11 month old. He has never refused any of them and eats the whole thing! But I must say he could not get enough of this flavor he learned how to suck ever last drop out of this bottle! Lol!! I love these for traveling. I typically make my own food for him and thought these would be less of a mess to travel with. They are once your child has mastered how to suck on them to eat and not to suck to hard, it took about 7 to 8 diffent feeds for him to learn this. All in all I love the quality and the taste of this product. High recommended! Wish it was an amazon subcribe and save item, just saying! :)

review/summary: Sadly disappointed
review/text: We've  been buying Happy Tot Organic Superfood pouches (Spinach, Mango and Pear) for almost a year now.  The kids love them as a quick on-the-go snack.  When they were temporarily out-of-stock, I decided to buy this, with the assumption that it would be of the same caliber as HappyTots.  Not all pouches are alike.  Happy Tots tells the consumer right on the front of the pouch which ingredients are inside - spinach, mango, pear and salba (chia seeds).  When you look at the ingredient list on the back of the pouch, you see the organic ingredients of pear, mango, spinach and salba (chia seeds).  No added water, no added apple puree.  Plums Organics not only added apple puree and water to their pouches, but those are the first two ingredients.  Normally, I check the ingredients list prior to purchasing a product, but since this was online and I had such a good experience with Happy Tots, I didn't do that.  I'll be more prudent next time.

review/summary: Iowa sounds local but this comes from Israel
review/text: The quality of this dill weed, (as well as Frontier's bulk Dill Weed, and its off-shoot company-- Simply Organic<br />Dill Weed), is OK for a dried spice. But you pay for it's transportation all the way from Israel. I find that environmentally and morally problematic, with Israel's ongoing snubbing of international law and UN resolutions.<br />You'd never know this origin from the label, which only prints Frontier's home base in Iowa. Maybe even Frontier<br />isn't proud of buying from Israel.<br />For my Kosher dill pickles, I'd suggest either fresh dill weed, or the California-made dill weed from Spice Hunter.<br /><br />VM Feldman

review/summary: My Cat Loved it
review/text: I read the label and it seemed to be a healthy and nutritious food , especially in that it is an organic food. Figuring organic food is pretty scarce when it comes to pets.<br /><br />I had originally bought this after the wheat gluten poison scare on the news.<br /><br />Anyway, my cat (one who will not eat dry foods) got very excited just by the smell of it. She loved it and since then I still buy it. Since it costs more and I have more than one cat and its pricier than other canned cat foods, I do alternate with other brands.

This is not a 5-* item for everybody, but if you like grape nuts (the hemp nuts have similar flavor and texture), almonds, chocolate, coffee, and a little sweetness from dried fruit, this is a healthy and filling snack that is definitely worth trying!

review/summary: Albondigas Meatball.  Good to the last ball.
review/text: This is a flavorful soup that's sits well with a good sourdough bread.  The tomato broth is a little thin.  My taster would benefit from a more full bodied broth.  Thicker, I guess I should say.  And a little more rice.  You certainly can't find fault with the amount of meatballs in it.  Almost one in each spoonful.  You could also add arrowroot to thicken it a bit, if you'd like.  I'll be trying all of Progresso's different types, I'm that confident of their quality.  Did you hear that, Campbell?

review/summary: Too many culls, substandard processing, inconsistant moisture content.
review/text: Despite how many regions of the USA can grow pumpkins, the market for roasted in-shell pumpkin seeds is dominated by David (Conagra) due to their distribution abilities.  Although David's seeds are too salty, they are a consistent product with good flavor, dense nut meats and well regulated moisture content.  And yes,did I mention that they are too salty.  So when I came upon the high praise given to these seeds, I bought a 12 pack.  As noted, the price on these is significantly lower than Davids.<br /><br />However, I am disappointed with the product.  The first issue I noticed was the lack of grading.  Fallow seeds (flat seeds with no nut meat) and other irregular seeds are included in quantities which vary from pack to pack, but there are too many.  Additionally the nutmeats are quite inconsistent in density and moisture content.  Some nut meats have little density and just crumble during the shelling process. The shells are quite a bit thinner than the David brand, which causes them to collapse, rather than cleanly splitting, when pressured on the edges.  This transfers a lot of the salty shell into your mouth.  So although these have less salt on them, more salt is ingested in the process of eating them.<br /><br />You might be happy with these if you are looking for a cheaper product than the David brand, but I was looking for a superior product and these are not it.

review/summary: Wow - these are really tasty
review/text: I have eaten many David's pumpkin seeds, but I find them too salty.  I bought a case a month of Klein's for a couple of years, and I thought they were much better.  Amazon stopped carrying the Klein's I was buying, so I tried these.  Wow  - they are even better.  They taste almost exactly like what my own roasted seeds taste like around halloween.  Smaller than the Kleins, but tastier IMHO.  Probably in between Davids and Kleins on salt, but I don't have the packaging to confirm that.<br /><br />Will definitely order again.

review/summary: Good sweet tea that's basically sugar, water, and tea leaves
review/text: This was the only tea I was able to find at three grocery stores that consisted of only sugar, water and tea leaves.  As an added benefit I believe that everything in it is organic as well.  I was surprised to find that all of the other tea at the grocery store contained 15 plus ingredients, most of which I'd never heard of, with tea leaves not being in the top 5 ingredients.  I do find the tea to be a little sweet for me, but I normally take my tea without sugar.<br /><br />Overall I'd give this 4.5 out of 5 stars.  If you're looking for iced tea that consists of tea, sugar, and water and tastes good you can't go wrong.

review/summary: Tea-Flavored Tea
review/text: This is the best tea I've ever had in my life.  It is perfect, not too strong, not too weak, not too sweet, but sweet enough.  And the flavor is superb; I don't know if they slow-brew it, or what, but whatever they do is perfect.  It gets and A+ from me!<br /><br />This particular tea is the original type.  There are other varieties in which there are added flavors, such as peach, lemon, etc, and I do love those, too, but my favorite type is the original.  And the reason is, I love to taste the tea without any other flavors in the way.  Now don't get me wrong, like I said earlier, I do love the flavored teas, also, and I do drink them.  But this original variety is my favorite of them all, so, therefore, I do drink this type the most (but I also drink the others).  I love to be able to just taste the tea and no other flavors, because, to me, tea itself is an awesome flavor.<br /><br />I guess anybody can brew tea, but I do think this brand is the best I've ever had that is store-bought.  I absolutely love this tea!<br /><br />This tea is organic.<br /><br />If you love tea, then I think you would love this tea.
