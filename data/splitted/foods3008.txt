review/summary: Gluten-Free Sadness Pie
review/text: Oh, my, how awful this was. Beth Hilson should be spinning in Bette Hagman's grave.<br />I am a highly experienced baker. I'm not new to GF baking, but I am new to GF pie crust (I've avoided it and pie for years).<br />The package is too small, especially for the money. The product as packaged should be increased at least 25% by weight. As it is, it barely makes the prescribed-size 8" pies. And good luck finding an 8" pie pan in a retail store (Amazon has them). There is no reason Gluten Free Pantry cannot market products that are sized to fit standard-sized U.S. pans (9" or 10"). This is just cheapness on their part.<br />The instructions should be written so as to be as foolproof as possible. Making a GF crust is not the same thing as regular pie crust. It will not look or feel the same. For instance, when cutting in the 2nd 10 oz of shortening, the flour turned to a solid, waxy mass, nothing like regular pie crust. This was before any liquid was added. All ingredients were chilled. This made it difficult to mix in the liquid ingredients. No guided descriptions or instructions are offered.<br />Moreover, the instructions say "3 tsp vinegar," "2 Tbsp water" and 2 eggs. 3 tsp is a tablespoon. Eggs vary in size, and instructions should be given regarding the total amount of eggs and water so as to be exact. My eggs were extra large, so I reduced the amount of water. Nevertheless, the dough was still far too wet, so I held off on adding all the eggs + water + vinegar. You could add some AP GF flour or starch if things get too wet.<br />Even after 90 minutes of chilling, the dough was very soft. It did roll out between sheets of plastic wrap, and transferred to the pan with some tearing that was easy to patch. However, I found this a tedious and moderately difficult task, and I am a very experienced cook and baker. There was almost no extra crust - maybe 2 oz, or a ball the size of a walnut - left over. I had to struggle to roll the crust in the exact size and shape to fit my pan.<br />My unattractive result looks nothing like the crust on the box, neither in thickness, nor in texture. It is too thin on the pie, and it collapsed unattractively and did not set in the oven. Also, the crust browned on the edges of my tin pie pans too quickly (because the edges are too thin because there isn't enough crust), with only 30 mins of baking at 350 deg. Usually vinegar retards browning in crust. Even covered with foil, the edges burned and won't be eaten.<br />A subsequent insult is that somehow the top crust on my berry pie partially dissolved into the filling before it set in the oven. Then I poked the top crust with my finger and it has turned into this loose, sandy mass - ghastly.<br />I will update after I taste it.

review/summary: Best Pie Crust Ever.  Flaky & Tasty
review/text: I will never go back to a regular pie crust!  This is better than most "normal" crusts.<br /><br />I've been making pie crusts since I was a kid.  Lard is the best, but can't use that anymore.<br /><br />When we went GF, all hopes of good pie crust were dashed.  Found some premade ones that tasted (and looked) like they were made out of sawdust and wood glue.  They shattered just be looking at them, before baking.  After baking, they tasted like dirty feet.  Ewwww.  I threw them away.  At $5.00 each, that was tough.<br /><br />Then I saw this box at the store.  Bought it with little hope.  OMG IT IS SO GOOD!!!<br /><br />Very flaky, very tasty.  I am still working on the best way to roll it out.  I've only used it for deep dish meals, such as chicken pot pie, Greek pie, and fruit cobblers.  I mash it in the bown or baking dish I'm cooking the food in and it works wonderfully.<br /><br />I also used it to make a modified Baklava.  Rolled it thin, put it in the freezer for a couple of minutes, laid it in a Pyrex dish, brushed the top with butter, added some finely chopped roasted almonds, more thin pie crust, butter almonds, cinnamon.<br />Cut in triangles before baking.  After baking I poured honey over them.  It was awesome.  Folks I made it for thought it was better than Filo dough.

review/summary: Gluten Free Pie Crusts!
review/text: Great product for those of us who like pies and thought they would never be able to eat them again!  This product makes a great flaky crust.  Measure the ingredients carefully to make sure you are not adding too much butter, etc.  Add the water a little at a time.  The crusts can be difficult to roll out if they are too wet.  I usually make all four crusts at one time and freeze the extras.  I've found that the crusts are better when baked before adding the pie filling.  I honestly don't think that anyone would be able to tell that this is not a traditional pie crust.

review/summary: great pie crust with a tip for rolling it out perfectly
review/text: This crust is great and very flaky like a regular pie crust HOWEVER you MUST chill the dough like they recommend!!!!! Also, I rolled it out between two pieces of waxed paper then peeled one piece off, flipped the crust over into into the pie plate and peeled off the other piece of waxed paper. Viola! A perfect pie crust!  Without gluten, pie crusts don't hold together well and the double waxed paper method really alleviates the frustration of pie crust tearing and falling apart while trying to transfer it to the dish.  I made a Gluten Free/Dairy Free pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and our guests didn't even know it wasn't "real".  This is my pie crust from now on!

Nice and flaky n it didn't take as long even having to mess around with it a bit to make 4 pies.  We tried with pumpkin apple and cherry.  And just the other night we used a double crust to make a beef potpie YUM!

review/summary: Makes a great pumpkin pie crust!
review/text: While very crumbly and hard to work with, it did make an excellent pumpkin pie crust!  I also made the bottom of an apple pie with it and topped it with a crumb topping.  It would have been very difficult to get a top crust to look pretty.  I found it extremely difficult to get it into the pie pan without it breaking into pieces, but in the end after patching it a bit, it turned out delicious!  When they say chill, I think they should say freeze for about 10-20 minutes and that will make it slightly easier to handle.

review/summary: thank heavens for small favors
review/text: Being in charge of Thanksgiving this year, and having Celiac disease can be quite the challenge.  A friend gave me a box of this mix to try for the lemon pie I have been craving for the holiday.  The dough mixes extremely easily (contains eggs, which was a first for me with pie crust) and requires refrigeration before rolling.  One box makes 4 crusts.  The dough rolls easily between plastic wrap, but does crack as it bakes (for a prebake crust anyway).  The pie came out beautifully even though the crust was crumbly as it was cut.  Unlike tradition crust in a lemon pie, it NEVER got soggy even a week later when I got to have the last piece!  You can't say that about a flour/lard crust!  Extra crust is portioned out and in my freezer for the next pie baking marathon (Christmas)!

review/summary: Great gf pie crust
review/text: We're long-time pie-lovers around here, and I thought we'd have to give up pies forever since we can no longer have gluten. WRONG-O! This mix makes wonderful flaky pie crust. We use Spectrum Organic Shortening in place of the butter, so it's casein-free. The dough has a different consistency than wheat flour crust and so requires slightly different handling when rolling it out and getting it into the pie plate, but not a big deal. It smells wonderful when baking, it browns nicely, and it's flaky and delicious. Even gluten-eaters (both children and adults) gobble it up and ask for more. A winner!

review/text: I have been experimenting over and over with pie crusts since we found out my daughter couldn't have gluten, and I was so sad when nothing even came close to being good. After a lot of research I ordered this pie crust. I baked my first 2 pies from this mix and took them to a family get together. The pies were gone within minutes and everyone went on and on how wonderful they were. It made me thrilled.<br /><br />I will say I only got 2 nine inch crusts out of it though. It was very well worth it. I will buy it over and over again!!!

review/summary: The simple pleasure of chocolate combined with peanut butter
review/text: It was in the 1920s that the H.B. Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey's milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese's Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese's started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese's bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the "you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this pair of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them. Fortunately this is a 2 cup packages, because my way of eating Reese's Peanut Butter Cups is to eat them all. Open up a wrapper with four cups, I eat four. Open up a wrapper with two cups, I eat two. You do not want to enjoy too much of a good thing when it comes to candy.

review/summary: The "instant ramen" of the kimchi/kim chee world
review/text: Note: I did not buy product from this site<br /><br />The good:<br />-product has the basic ingredients needed for kimchi seasoning.<br />-One bag will take care of one large kimchi cabbage(I can't remember the actual name but its the huge leafy green traditionally used for this).<br />-Just add water & a little chopping action<br />-after day 3, it starts to smell and taste like the real deal (I followed the direction except for the salt water bath.. I just salted each leaf & let it sit for 30 minutes, then rinsed. I also added more mix from another bag cause I wanted to be sure the flavor would not be watered down.)<br />-It wont win any taste awards but it gets the job done if your tight on money & time (college students rejoice!)<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />- Your not working with fresh herbs so the finished kimchi "red stuff" is watery rather than thick & rich red (I guess because you are working with a fine powder & only "just enough" to do one batch).<br />- if you're looking for the kimchi "look" & taste you are used to from pre-made.. get ready to be disappointed. See above reason.<br />- I have seen flour used to make kimchi, there is none here.<br /><br />Side note: Nothing beats fresh made so my next adventure will be hunting down raw ingredients. That said, I don't feel like I "wasted" my money.

review/text: I grew up drinking Diet sodas.  No joke.  I'd never tasted a regular Coke until I was 13.  I thought I'd gag.<br /><br />In recent years I've scooted from one Diet brand to the next, avoiding all those empty calories and eventually avoiding caffeine.<br /><br />All these new 'Zero' products may not have sugar or caffeine but they are loaded with artificial sweeteners that I've generally heard nothing but bad things about.<br /><br />So, get fat with sugar or get cancer with artificial sweeteners.  Doesn't seem like much of a choice.  And, of course, I am prone to exaggeration on this matter.<br /><br />Having used Stevia before (an all natural herbal sweetener from South America) I was thrilled to find Zevia...sweetened by aforementioned sweetener.<br /><br />If you're used to the taste of Diet or Zero anything, then this won't be a far leap for your taste buds.  I love this stuff!<br /><br />The only down side for now is the price.  AT nearly $6 a 6-pack (or more) it's a pricey artificial sweetener alternative.<br /><br />But if you aren't a soda-holic (less than a can a day on average) then this really isn't so bad.

review/text: I really would rather give this stuff three and a half stars, but I rounded up because my third grade math teacher said to round up for half or more. And I don't want her to think I didn't learn anything. She'll find me, just like she did all the others. The horror...<br /><br />Anyway, this stuff is pretty alright. What it lacks in the crispness of a 7-Up, it makes up for in flavor and not giving you diabetes if you chug the whole 24 pack in a week. Which, given the taste, is not impossible. The diet-y bluntness is still there from other flavors, and if you're used to 7-Up like I was, its pretty noticeable. But once you get used to it, its pretty good for lemon-lime, which I've never been a huge fan of in general. Drink it on the verge of freezing and finish before it gets warm, because when it does, it feels kind of like thin syrup.<br /><br />Should you buy some? If you want stevia-sweetened pop, sure. I do wish Amazon offered six or twelve packs instead of only twenty-four. I'd love to try out black cherry, but frankly, $25 is steep for me right now.

I say this because just as aspartame was produced and marketed to the masses, and people were not aware of the dangers of chemicals, I wonder about the synthesized version of stevia.<br />But, for now I'm trying to do the best with the information we do have - drink water most of the time, but when I just have to have a soda like with a pizza or something spicy, I reach for my Zevia.<br />I've tried all the flavors but my favorite is Black Cherry. The lemon is weird tasting and not very refreshing.<br />Black Cherry hits the spot.

review/summary: lemon lime twist zevia
review/text: lemon lime twist and all zevia sodas are great and a  healthier option to regular and diet sodas.  They don't have all the sugar of  regular soda and the harmful chemicals of the diet sodas.  A Dr I work with stated she normally eats healthy but she stated she has a soda addiction and she is worried it's going to  harm her bones.  I had a zevia mountain dew with me that night and asked if she likes mountain dew, she stated that's her favorite so I gave it to her, she looked at the ingredients and was thrilled with what was and wasn't in it.  She stated she thinks she could definitely get used to this, and not hurt her bones.  Amazon shipped it quickly, great product.

review/summary: DISGUSTING!
review/text: OK, let me start out by saying I'm extremely biased when it comes to sodas. I grew up with all the delicious teeth-rotting HFCS sodas such as Coke, Dr. Pepper, 7Up, Mountain Dew, and Fanta. And I'm allergic to Aspartame, so artificial sweeteners and I don't usually get along. But I have tried some Stevia-based products before and they weren't too bad, so I thought maybe this would be OK.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong. This stuff is now on my list of "Worst Sodas I've Ever Tasted", right up there with Russian malt soda and that disgusting No-Cal junk. I had expected a little better than this, but should've known better. If anyone ever comes out with a better Stevia-based soda, let me know. I'm willing to give anything a try at least once.

review/summary: From a recovering Diet Mountain Dew addict
review/text: Last year, I was drinking probably two 24 packs of Diet Mountain Dew a week. I thought this was rather unhealthy (and expensive), so I decided to gradually taper off. I had decided to steer clear of all types of pop, but while at Sunflower Market, I noticed Zevia. I liked that it was sweetened with stevia, rather than something a little more artificial. I allow myself a maximum of one Mountain Zevia a day, if that. It has helped me rid myself of a pretty bad DMD addiction.

review/summary: Delicious and refreshing, however expensive
review/text: I love this soda. Absolutely delicious. I used to be addicted to diet sodas, but after reading that sucralose (i.e. splenda) acts as a pesticide in your body (killing crucial intestinal flora) and that aspartame is made up of a main ingredient in paint thinner (methanol), I knew a change was necessary. Zevia was the exact crutch I needed to make it through. Incredibly, when I try other sodas now, it makes me sick and burns my throat. I would have given this product 5 stars, but the price recently went up, and it is not cost effective for most people to switch from cheaper sodas.

review/summary: Pretty Good, But Better Mixed With Juice
review/text: I bought this soda because I was looking for an alternative for soda with high fructose corn syrup and also because my husband recently found out that he's diabetic and can't have the real stuff anymore.  I wasn't that impressed with it at first taste, but I would say that the taste is comparable to a store brand of regular lemon lime soda.  This soda is really good when you mix it with juice.  I add a little bit of cranberry juice and the result is kind of like a wine cooler without the alcohol.  I will definitely buy this soda again.

This was a first, but I couldn't get through the first can and my husband didn't get beyond a sip.<br /><br />It has a very strong aftertaste. Bitter almost.. I tried masking it by adding other things to it but it just didn't work. I would loved to have found a pre-made Stevia sweetened beverage, I love stevia... but not this. Sorry.<br /><br />I will stick with making my own using Stevia, crystallized citrus juice and water. Tastes good to my taste buds and no bitter aftertaste.

I am absolutely thrilled that I can enjoy a zero calorie soda that's actually good for me.  I've been drinking beverages sweetened with stevia for several years now so I found the taste of the Zevia to be very enjoyable.  There was absolutely no after taste with the Zevia flavors I've tried and they are just as refreshing to drink as traditional sodas without any of the bad stuff! I cannot wait to try more of the flavors but the ones I've tried are very similar to their traditional soda flavors.

review/summary: Chemical-free Diet Soda + Free Shipping Make for a Winner
review/text: I recently found out about Zevia through a friend but have had trouble finding it outside of health food stores, which aren't that easy to come by in my neck of the woods. I wouldn't have guessed to look for soda on Amazon, but the Zevia website pointed out it was for sale here, and when I found out about the free shipping, I ordered it on the spot.<br /><br />At just over a dollar a can, it's a tad pricey compared to other diet sodas, but that's to be expected for a specialty drink. The price here at Amazon is comparable to the prices I saw at the health stores, especially if you sign up for the subscription delivery which discounts things 15% at the time of this review. Also since you're not paying for shipping, I think it ends up being a good deal, especially considering the limited availability of the drink across the country.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I've tried several of the flavors and like the lemon lime the best. If you're a Mt. Dew or 7-up fan, this is a similar style of drink. I do recommend that you try a can somewhere before ordering a 24-pack. If you at one time switched from regular soda to diet soda, you may remember that period of "getting used to it." I don't think it's as much of a stretch to switch from aspartame-sweetened diet soda to this, but I didn't love it at first taste.<br /><br />In regards to other flavors, I thought the orange and Dr. Zevia were okay. I wasn't a fan of the ginger ale at all, but that may just be because it uses real ginger (and tastes like it), unlike the watered down fake stuff I'm used to. I haven't tried the other flavors yet.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend Zevia to anyone who's trying to avoid high calorie beverages as well as artificial sweeteners.

review/text: OK,..I'm speaking on behalf of the Orange Soda here. When I first popped the tab and drank a sip of the Zevia Orange,..it did NOT hit me with the anticipated sweetness that I had come to expect from say a Diet Sunkist Soda or any of your typical SugarFree Orange sodas. I wasn't disappointed per say, but just surprised a bit by the unexpected lack of sweetness. Now, with that being said,...and a few cans later,..this has quickly become my "go to" drink when I want a refreshing orange soda. It is very good and very quenching (due to the noticeable lack of sodium) on a hot summer day. The aroma is wonderful and the flavor is very close to as real as you can get before drinking straight orange oil. It's a really good soda and I'm now tempted to try the Root Beer and the Cola.

review/summary: Make sure your grinder can handle the larger peppercorns
review/text: I'd read a lot of the other reviews and quite frankly was a little concerned due to all of those who'd said that the peppercorns were too large for some of the grinders. I decided I really wanted a variety of peppers in my grinder and simply got one (grinder) which adjusts to several sizes--but that's for a review of my grinder. All I can say is that these peppers are great. I was quite pleased that none of the peppercorns were too large, and the four-pepper blend is a spicy delicious treat on all the foods over which I usually sprinkle pepper.  I recommend it highly with only one qualification: It is true that some of the corns are a bit larger than the familiar (and smaller) black peppercorns--so be certain your grinder is a quality product as well, and has multiple adjustments for grain size. These three bags should well last you a year or more unless you use a lot of pepper--and as pointed out earlier, they are top-notch quality--healthy for you (just read up on health benefits of ground peppers--all kinds) and delicious for us spicy-food lovers.

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: Up until recently I have had 4 dogs. Sadly, one passed away from old age this past July. Anyway, all four of my dogs love these Iams biscuits. My finickiest dog never turns them down although she has turned down other brands of biscuits. The only thing that puzzles me is that the biscuits are now thinner than they used to be. They must still taste the same since my dogs still gobble them up. I had brought up this inconsistency to an Iams rep at a dog show about a year ago. His only answer was that they had 2 manufacturing companies and one must be making them thinner than the other company. I would think that their standards on this would be fairly strict so that the 2 companies would be manufacturing identical products, but apparently not. Oh well, it's not really a problem as long as my dogs remain elated with them, and since they are sold by weight there's nothing sneaky going on as far as I can tell. I love that I can order a pack of 6 on Amazon.com. Many times the stores do not have that many, so the 6-pack is really convenient since my dogs go through these pretty quickly.

review/text: I have been giving my dog these treats since she has been a puppy.  She loves them and were great rewards for her training.  Best of all, they have kept her teeth and gums clean and free of plaque.  I recommend them to all dog owners.  Buying them from Amazon on a recurring basis has been a lifesaver.  These treats do not last long on store shelves so finding them locally has been difficult.  Thanks Amazon for solving my source problem!

review/summary: Great Way to Buy a Great Product: Subscribe Today!
review/text: I live in an isolated town, and you cannot purchase Iams dog biscuits within a four hour radius.  Unfortunately, Iams small biscuits are all my parents' spoiled dogs will eat for a snack.  Like another reviewer's dog, these dogs will not eat large biscuits, even though one is a Great Dane and the other is a lab mix.<br /><br />When I found the monthly subscription on Amazon and found they were slightly cheaper than in the stores (where I can no longer buy them; thank you, over-sized "super" stores that carry fewer and fewer products since you feel the consumer is at your mercy), I immediately ordered them.  They arrived a week later with free shipping.<br /><br />The packaging was neat and tight; very few biscuits were broken in the opened box.  They were also very fresh.  The expiration date was June 15, 2012.  Traditionally, the ones I've purchased in stores were only good for six months or less.  I subscribed for two six packs a month, and it's very satisfying to know I don't have to worry about my mother haranguing me to drive to Mississippi to pick up dog biscuits.  They come to the PO box once a month: No fuss, no muss, no bother.  And the dogs are infinitely happier. :)

review/summary: Trussing Needle
review/text: This works fine for small birds but could be a couple inches longer to go after a turkey. I'm not sure why the end is curved which makes it a bit more difficult to gauge where you will come out the other side when going through the cavity of the bird. I'll probably forge the curve out of it. The use of stainless steel is a bonus, strong and obviously won't rust.

review/summary: An outstanding aged Gouda
review/text: It isn't mentioned above, but Old Amsterdam is aged at least 18 months before shipping. Something magical happens to Gouda when it's aged. It transforms from a tasty if boring semi-soft cheese into a hard and complex cheese that approaches young Parmigiano-Reggiano in warmth and texture. Nice caramel and nutty notes. The cheese also has a pleasant crunch, the crystallization of acids that are a sign of good aging.<br /><br />Old Amsterdam can be grated and used like a dry Italian cheese, but it also cuts neatly. It's soft enough to serve as slices or cubes. Delicious, magical stuff.

review/summary: Good product
review/text: Overall this is a pretty good product. The honey taste is fine and the pricing I see reasonable. My only complaint is that the tubes are not always easy to open. Sometimes you can bite down and the pinched end opens, other times it takes an act of godly teeth gnawing on the end (or scissors). Overall it's good. It's nice to have a stirring straw with the sweetener in it. I poor the honey in and suck the drink through the straw. The first few sips are amazingly sweet and tasty with the residual honey coming out of the straw. It would be nice if there were bigger tube options too.

review/summary: An edible San Marzano
review/text: I have purchased a variety of DOP tomatoes in the past. Typically I been disappointed. I usually find that California products taste markedly better. The DOP tomatoes I have tried previously turned out to be mealy, and tinny tasting.<br /><br />These tomatoes on the other hand, had a bright taste and a balance of sweetness and acidity that made a very good marinara. I have not used up this shipment so I don't know if every can is as good as this lot, but if so, these Strianese tomatoes, some garlic, a couple table spoons of olive oil, a pinch of crushed red pepper, salt and pepper are all that is necessary for happiness.

review/text: Although the tomatoes were delicious, I might hesitate to order again, since it appeared that the cans were either dented en route, or were taken off the shelf that way. They were also sort of dirty and old looking, so I have a feeling these are items which maybe don't move often enough, and I may have gotten the last of what was on the shelf, dented or not. Otherwise shipping was prompt. Could have been packed better.

I ordered these Strianse's after trying a few other "top line" DOP San Marzano Tomatoes.  These are the ones to get.  These are bright and fresh looking out of the can.  I simply pour the can in a bowl and crush them with my hands.  Nothing else really needed to do to prepare these tomatoes for use.  Other cans require trimming hard ends off of each tomatoes.  Add a little herbs, salt and pepper.  Everyone loves my pizza sauce.

review/summary: excellent quality light but full of flavor -good company
review/text: First I have to say I ordered and tried 5 flavors of the syrups from this company. I was so sick of maple ALL the time. So, as a general statement each flavor was very good, they were light but full of flavor. And though every person has different tastes and will like them in different degrees I found the following to be my tastes:<br /><br />Peach: even though i would not have thought peach would be my fav of the lot it was. it had amazing flavor and was not too super sweet. plus it went awesome w a bit of butter.<br /><br />strawberry: was really really good flavor nothing artificial about it just lightly sweet with great strawberry flavor.<br /><br />marionberry: had great bolder flavor, sweeter than the rest and thicker, closer to traditional pancake syrups but good flavor.<br /><br />red raspberry: i was expecting this to be my favorite and it was really tasty, even if peach did steal the show. however this was good and also light, though it had just a hint of an after taste.<br /><br />cherry; of all i tried this one had the lightest flavor, it was also more liquid like and less syrupy. it was light and delicious I liked it alot but for pancakes it seemed to soak right in and disapear a bit. i imagine for crepes or something this would be outstanding.<br /><br />the company shipped super amazingly fast in a strong sturdy box. each syrup was packed in strong material individually. I recommend them and plan on trying more of their products.<br /><br />PS- i also tried using these flavors with each other or with maple in double whammy of flavor on pancakes- peach and strawberry was really good, also marionberry and maple...

review/text: UPDATE_ July 2012<br /><br />I found a great way to beat the summer heat- i empty a can of this fruit cocktail into a freezer safe bowl- leave it in the freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours- and then i get to eat lightly frozen fruit cocktail- it's very refreshing and cooling_and the entire can is only like 150 calories.  i suppose i could also throw the gently frozen fruit into a blender and make a sorbet of sorts--i'm just finishing a bowl of gently frozen libby's peaches- peach sorbet would be yummy<br />-----------<br /><br />The best part is the no added sugar. Not packed in syrup. Only natural juices & splenda.<br />This variety seems to have more fruit and less juice than say the just peaches or just pears.<br />This might also be more firm than the just peaches or just pears.<br />Long shelf life_ more than a year till sell by date.<br />The only thing i don't like is the candied cherries-yuck__the few cans i've eaten so far haven't had many of those thank goodness- plus they don't seem to be mixed throughout the can_ there's been  a few cherries at the bottom of every can. yours may be differnt?<br /><br />Regardless, it was decent. If you can get this for $1.25 ish per can with free s/h it's a very good deal. You can order 24 or 36 cans at a time_ imagine carrying that home from the grocery store.

review/summary: The Very Best in Turkish Coffee!
review/text: I was in Istanbul a few weeks ago and asked a Turk what is the best Turkish coffee available.  He say Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi and handed me a 8oz can.  I took it home and tried it and I must say it is the best I have tried from Kuwait, Turkey, or the USA, even as a novice preparing it at home.  I'm happy to see that it can be purchased from the USA.  You will not be disappointed, just follow the directions on the can and prepare for a treat.

review/summary: Sweet experience
review/text: You can walk through the spice bazaar, through the streets and past the storefronts amidst the crowd and crush of Istanbul's market bazaar, until, near the Bosporus you come to the Mehmet Efendi window and smell the sweet scent of Turkey's greatest coffee.<br />What Illy is to Italy, Mehmet Efendi is to Turkey, and let's remember-the Turks started it! Oh, what sweet scents, what delicious varieties. I always bring home as much as my suitcase will carry. This year I may throw away all my clothes to make room for more Mehmet Efendi. Oh, and if you are not hitting Istanbul, isn't it nice that you can get it on Amazon?

review/summary: Horrible!
review/text: I bought two 17.6 oz cans.  Both are marked with 12/2010 packing date and 12/2012 expiration date.  This coffee is absolutely bland, nothing like Effendi I have had before this order, from a different vendor.  Either it was stale before it was canned or there might be another possible explanation.  The text on either can is in Turkish and German.  The same brand bought before, from a different vendor, was in Turkish and English.  Perhaps, for German market, it is supposed to be bland but I doubt it.  The largest Turkish community outside of Turkey would not drink this stuff.<br /><br />I got full refund from Amazon.<br /><br />I strongly recommend to buy your Mehmet Effendi from another vendor and to make sure the text on the can is in Turkish and English.

review/text: Great coffee, if you make it in a traditional Turkish "kettle" you will really see the beauty of a slow-brewed cup of coffee. Also, watch out for the grit at the bottom!

review/summary: The real thing.
review/text: (This review is very similar to one I did for another brand.)<br /><br />Let me start by saying that, while not a snob or connoisseur, I have tried just about every method of making coffee known to humanity. Drip, perk, pump and steam espresso, Aeropress, Neopolitan, Canadian-made coffee bags, Toddy concentrate and everything but pan boiled with eggshells. I've ground my own beans and even roasted them in small quantities. (I must have been an alchemist in a previous time!) Most of my gear (La Pavoni espresso machine, Capresso pump machine, Capresso conical grinder, countless Bialetti pots, Revereware stainless drippers, etc.,) have come from fortunate thrift store finds.<br /><br />My interest in Turkish style coffee came about with the purchase (online auction-used) of an ASTOUNDING Turkish-made fully electronic, sensor controlled masterpiece of an automatic maker from Beko which is even easy to clean! It has won awards from CeBIT, the world's largest and most international computer expo. Atat&uuml;rk would be proud!<br /><br />I found that my grinder could produce very close to the powder-like nature of ground Turkish coffee. But I wanted to try "the real thing," so I ordered this brand and another. This brand is from Turkey and comes in an attractive almost collectable metal can.<br /><br />My biggest surprise was that the coffee is not as dark roasted as what I had used before. But very pleasant with (traditionally) sugar or without.<br /><br />If you have a local coffee supplier with the gear to REALLY grind down to Turkish style, you are in luck. If not, give this a try. Standard stove-top boiler pots are cheap, but the Bekos are not. As all coffee tends to come from the same sources, I suspect I will be able to find similar quality locally, grind it or have it ground, and store it in this can.  Makes it easy to spot the Turkish grind!

review/summary: Wonderful, Rich Body...Love the caffeine.
review/text: This is, without a doubt, the best Turkish Coffee I have ever tried.  Very sophisticated taste.  Unfortunately, I am not a coffee connoisseur.  But I prefer this to anything made at Starbucks, Peetes or Diedrichs.  If you love the taste of coffee and haven't tried any Turkish Coffee before, this is the genuine article.  I just brew mine in a simmering pot over the stove.  No fancy gizmos.  Not that I wouldn't love to try to make it in one of those tiny pots, but my house is filled with every Ronco infomercial kitchen appliance since 1989 and I don't have any more room.  Plus, its like 3 of those pots to one of my coffee cups.  Finally, this stuff lasts forever and a day. It should take me a month or two to finish it.

review/text: Wonderful product, can tell it is fresh (!!!!!!), tastes great!<br />Purchased for myself, then ordered additionally to give as a gift. The best Turkish/Armenian/Mediterranean coffee ever!!! Not mixed with any additives, "fillers", or by-products as most coffees are, though they don't even indicate it on their labels.<br /><br /> Rich in flavors, not bitter, very finely grounded (as it should to be!) Speedy delivery! Nicely packed! Would highly recommend to everyone! All my guests love it!<br /><br />Thank you!

review/summary: Excellente ~
review/text: It is one of the best Turkish coffee available!  I love Turkey and went there twice.  Every time I was there, I always ordered their cai (tea) or Mehmet Efendi Coffee.  I'm so glad that it is available from Amazon.com<br /><br />There is a little tips in brewing Turkish or Greek coffee.<br /><br />1) Use filtered water if possible.  It does make a difference.<br /><br />2) Use medium high heat.<br /><br />3) When you place the pot on the stove, ensure you don't over boil it.  After it is boiled for 1-2 minutes, the coffee should have very tiny-bubbled foam.  If you have BIG bubbles - you are over boiling it. Turn down the temperature.<br /><br />4) Once the tiny-bubbled foam starts to rise up, remove it from the stove and spoon the foam into you cup.  Within seconds, place it back to the stove and continue to boil it w/medium to medium high heat.  After 10-15 seconds, your coffee is ready to be served. To me, the tiny-bubbled foam makes the coffee smoother.<br /><br />It takes a few good trys to make a perfect cup - Enjoy!
