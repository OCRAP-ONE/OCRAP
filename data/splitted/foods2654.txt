review/summary: Weak, sometimes WON'T sweeten
review/text: I am used to KAL stevia, and having read some of the other reviews, perhaps the one I received was from a bad batch. But - I have had to use AT LEAST 4-5 times as much compared to KAL to sweeten most items, and for some items (i.e. my high protein breakfast drink) it just disappears. Never has quite the same "sweet" effect of the KAL either.

review/text: This is the best value of any Stevia product I've found.  This is pure, no fillers added.  1/8 tsp is equal in sweetness to a full teaspoon of sugar.  I was paying $10 for 1 ounce at Trader's Joe's, so this is a fantastic value.

review/summary: Do Not Like the Taste Compared to Truvia
review/text: I tried this product and I have to say that I just cannot tolerate the taste.  At least for me, it tastes awful. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I have been using Truvia and Truvia tastes much more like sugar than this product.  I don't know what this tastes like.  It is unlike anything I've ever tasted - and it sure doesn't taste like sugar to me. I had to pour out a fresh pitcher of green tea because it tasted so bad.  I made another pitcher of tea with Truvia and it was much better tasting. I usually mix some real sugar with Stevia.  But this last pitcher of tea was sweetened only by Truvia (Stevia) and it was pretty good tasting. It certainly isn't an identical taste to sugar, but close enough after you adjust to the taste.  When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br /><br />I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.  Everybody has a different sense of taste. All food has a rather intense taste to me. About 25% of the population is a super taster. We have many more taste buds on our tongue. That describes me. So you may have a different experience than I did.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I've used stevia powder for years. NOW is an excellent source at a great price. If you are baking, stevia is not very good for that as it will not give the same texture as white sugar. However, it is outstanding for sweetening tea, coffee and smoothies.<br /><br />Many have claimed that stevia is 200 times as sweet as white sugar. I don't agree. To my taste it is no more than 16 times as sweet.<br /><br />Be careful about using too much because it slips from sweet to bitter to the taste when that happens.

review/summary: Amazing price as opposed to buying retail...
review/text: I've been on the Atkins/Low-Carb diet for several years so I avoid sugar like the plague. Also to be avoided are carbonated diet-drinks. Which leaves me little choice other than water. So, I make a half-gallon of Kool-Aid with a teaspoon of Stevia EXTRACT and a teaspoon of liquid saccharin. Some complain this is too sweet for their tastes. But, do the math, a pound of sugar is LOT more expensive and takes at least a full cup per half gallon.<br /><br />In the past, I've had to purchase Stevia at the health food stores for $12-$15 an OUNCE. Here I bought a POUND (16 ounces) for less that the cost of four ounces from the health food stores. Fantastic price!<br /><br />Be careful what you wish for, a POUND of Stevia is a LOT of Stevia (At least a year's worth...;-}  )<br /><br />In a year, I'll buy another jug of it.

review/text: Excellent product and received in record time...thanks and good job!  Taste is perfect and consistency the same.  The only thing I question is so much plastic is wasted because the container is less than half full each time I've ever received this product.  A container half the size or a slightly larger should be considered, to stop the waste of excess plastic that may end up in landfills if not recycled.  I wrote to the company three years ago and asked if they would consider package modification, but never was acknowledged.

review/summary: Teeny tiny spoon!
review/text: I've been trying a number of different kinds of stevia, both liquid and powder. This one is my favorite. It has a very neutral taste and one tiny spoon of it is perfect in a big glass of oolong hibiscus iced tea. A heaping tiny spoon of it is perfect in a chocolate/banana/soy milk smoothie. I originally got it to put in something called "mega muffins" but managed to use up an entire 1 oz container of it without even making the muffins and have had to order more. I really like that it's organic. I've been trying different sweeteners in my hibiscus oolong iced tea, and this is not only better than any other stevia product I've found, but works better than any other sweetener as well. Even regular granulated sugar. It dissolves pretty much instantly. I'm thinking about ordering the 1 lb size (although that would probably last me about two years) I just wonder if that size comes with the teeny tiny spoon!

review/text: As a healthier alternative to other sweeteners I have tried, stevia extract fulfilled the billing it had received.  I had been led to this brand (NOW) because it reportedly had less bitter aftertaste than other brands and I found that to be true although there is still a slight undesirable aftertaste.  Stevia provides sweetness but a different tasting sweetness that takes some time to get used to.

After searching, this is the only stevia we will buy. We recommend it to our family and anyone who wants to stay away from sugar.  Other products are full of chemicals that are worse than the sugar.  Now Foods Stevia extract powder is natural.  We only use about 1/8 of a teaspoon for a full 8oz cup of coffee. Even that may be too much. We buy it by the pound and it lasts a long time.  How can anyone not use this product to substitute sugar?! It is an excellent product.

review/summary: Better Than Sugar!
review/text: I have used Stevia for several years, but often have had trouble finding it. It was a real pleasure to find it on Amazon! Stevia is a natural sweetener made from the Stevia rebaundiana leaf. It is not an artificial sweetner made with chemicals. It has no unpleasant taste, though people who use artificial sweeteners may take a few days to get used to the lack of "chemical" sweeteners. Most people who use Stevia find that they can use less of it than other sweeteners as it's sweetness level is higher per packet. I recommend Stevia to anyone who wishes not to use sugar for any reason, but still likes things a bit sweet. By the way, Stevia has no calories.

I have started baking banana bread w/ stevia and have been very pleased.  I've never minded what little aftertaste of Stevia since my mom used Sweet N Low when I was growing up.<br /><br />FYI-The 1 pound package didn't come w/ the tiny single scoop, unless buried at bottom.

review/summary: Tasty, natural, and cheap; but apple-y, salty, and weak.
review/text: I just got this mustard delivered and tried it out. I was happy to see that it's organic/natural (though it doesn't often matter with mustard) and sugar-free (unnecessary), not to mention fairly cheap (at [..] each bottle when sub-save ordering, compared to [...]  in local stores for similar items). The items received are good until JAN 2012, and nothing broken or damaged. The label on the bottles delivered is different, and a bit more attractive, than the label shown here on Amazon.<br /><br />Overall, it is definitely tasty. It has a good mustardy flavor and is a welcome addition to any sandwich. However, it also has a good appley flavor, most likely from the use of apple-cider vinegar instead of plain white. I don't think this is ideal for what's supposed to be a spicy mustard. And on the topic of spice, there isn't nearly as much as I was expecting. Especially for a HORSERADISH mustard, the heat level of this mustard disappoints. This mustard is just barely spicier than plain yellow mustard -- and less spicy than run-of-the-mill "spicy brown" mustard. Again, if horseradish wasn't in the ingredients, I wouldn't have noticed it. In addition to this, it is also pretty salty. It has salt listed in each "prepared" section of the mustard and horseradish components, so I'm guessing that means there's twice as much salt in this as either condiment alone, on average. And it shows. It's not unpalatable by any means, but make sure you use it with lots of nice greens on a sandwich.<br /><br />So again, this is tasty, there's no doubt about it. But it's tasty for the wrong reasons. It doesn't live up to its name, and the recipe definitely needs to be reworked to start appealing to the proper buyer demographic. I now have 6 bottles of this to go through, and while that may be slightly disappointing, it thankfully still won't be "hard to swallow".

review/summary: Finally, a great oat cereal
review/text: I always liked Cheerios, but have not eaten it for years and years since they put too much junk in them with lots of iron which is not such a good idea for males. Every other oat cereal I tried tasted like hay or worse. Well the search is over. This cereal has great flavor and none of the unnecessary additives. It is crunchy or, if you prefer less crunch, use warm milk and they become chewey, not soggy. You can eat all you want without worrying about loading up on junk. My wife and I eat it all the time. I order it by the case from Amazon and you cannot beat the price. If you like oat cereals, this is it.

review/summary: Good X-Bold Dark Roast for the Price
review/text: Really my title sums up my opinion of this cup altogether. It does make a nice, heart large cup of dark roast coffee, and $25 for 48 cups as the preorder price was outstanding. At that price, I don't think I've ever really seen better, but at the same time the brew doesn't seem quite as bold or earthy tasting as a cup of Green Mountain Dark Magic or Emeril's Big Easy Bold. I prefer a robust large cup on almost every brew, and I've realized that even the Ice Brew K-Cups are basically the same thing; a cup of coffee with extra grounds for brewing a small amount stronger...so I brew iced coffee with my Extra Bold k-cups. I did the math on weight, and these weigh in at just under a cup of Dark Magic or Sumatran Reserve, but I'd still say my favorites (by taste,) are the brands I've listed above or Tully's Italian or French Roast, Caribou Obsidian, Starbucks Dark Sumatra, or even Barista Prima French and Italian Roasts. The only other thing I can note about these is that the construction of the pods is about perfect; I didn't find any grinds in the box leaving me to believe there were no leaking pods. Almost all the pods had a little air puffing the foil out; which I've noticed a lot of the Keurig brands have flat foils, anyways, so I'm not even sure if it matters that much, although I've had grinds brew through on some of the flat pods. The only other difference I can mention is the  material of the foil top is different than Keurig brand pods; these are slightly harder and smoother (almost like a plastic or polymer,) but it doesn't seem to effect the brew process at all, and I didn't seem to get any grinds in my cup, so all in all it just doesn't matter to me. Still better than brewing through a regular coffee pot (even from fresh ground beans,) and I don't think I'll ever get tired of my Keurig coffee maker.

review/summary: Best K-Cups I have tried so far
review/text: With K-Cups being so expensive, I haven't ordered much for a while.  Most prices are over .60 per cup.  That's a lot of money a month for two daily cups of coffee.  Nothing is cheap, and neither are these at about .50 per cup.  I remember the good ol' days when the K-cups were not more than about .35 each, and it wasn't that long ago.<br /><br />I have been buying K-Cups at Costco most recently, and the Tully's they carry are okay.  Newman's Own are just okay too.  Those run .475 per cup, so that's been a little better.  This Martinson coffee comes close to the same price as the ones at Costco, but the flavor is superior.  This is the first cup of coffee I have in the morning. It's got a richer flavor, fresher somehow, than the others I have tried.

review/summary: Kinda tastes like instant
review/text: I really like a bold cup of coffee.<br /><br />Generally if I want flavored coffee I will flavor it myself as flavoreds don't come in dark roast bold, however I expect to not have to flavor it to drink it. I want my base coffee to be an experience in itself and something that I look forward too.<br /><br />Martinson Dark Roast K-cup does not give me that coffee experience. Although the coffee is smooth, I will give it that, it is bland and kinda tastes like instant.<br /><br />Honestly I didn't spend the money I did on a Keurig machine to get a cup of instant coffee. I can do that with a pot of boiling water and a cheap jar of whatever.<br /><br />While I do not expect the same experience as I get when I grind my beans fresh and brew it in my french press, I do expect a reasonably fresh ground taste.<br /><br />On a positive note the presentation of the K-cups and the box are top notch. The black/gray combination makes the coffee look like it is presented in a tuxedo. 5 stars for the marketing department on this one as the look on the shelf is bound to grab lots of attention so that people will buy it at least once.

review/summary: Better than Most of the Other So-Called "Bold" K-Cups!!
review/text: As one of the previous reviewers said, this is the first "K-cup" that doesn't taste at least somewhat watery.  I've tried LOTS of the Green Mountain sanctioned "extra bold" varieties (Jet Fuel, Dark Magic, Black Tiger, Double Black Diamond, etc.), but the new "RealCup" Martinson Dark Roast is in a class by itself.  Not necessarily a better "flavor" than the others mind you, but definitely more full-bodied and robust....not to mention significantly less expensive!<br /><br />BTW, absolutely no "sludge" or "dust" to be found at the bottom (or anywhere else) in my mug.  Only a good, satisfying cup of Joe! Highly recommended!<br /><br />Next, I plan to try a few of the Brown Gold RealCup varieties.  Look for even more choices to hit the market as some of the Green Mountain K-cup patents expire.

review/summary: RealCup Is Great!!!
review/text: If you have a Keurig brewer you need to try this coffee.  I just received the Martinson "Dark Roast" and I ordered a box of the "Brown Gold" (single origin coffee) as well.  I don't know if it's just the RealCup (new K-Cup filter) technology, or the Martinson coffee, but I love this stuff.  This is the first "K-Cup" I've used that doesn't taste watery.  Don't get me wrong, I love my Keurig, but the coffee always seemed to be missing something.  According to Martinson, the RealCup uses a new filter that allows essential oils to come through (like a french press) and it provides better mouthfeel and taste.  I can't wait for my next shipment.  As a bonus, some of them are available on subscribe and save.

review/summary: Inconsistent
review/text: I purchased the House Blend --and-- the Donut Shop Blend.<br /><br />BUT I can only leave one combined review so I will try to make this as clear as I can.  I averaged the star rating for both (hence the two stars) - Hopefully this isn't too confusing.<br /><br />*I give the House Blend one star because:<br />This coffee tastes cheap, old and stale.  It reminds me of the time I accidently drank a gulp of coffee someone had put a cigarette out in. I am tiny bit of a coffee snob and can't stand 'cheap' coffee but even my husband, whom will drink (almost) anything, can't stand it.<br /><br />***I give the Donut Shop Blend three stars because:<br />To my taste it is slightly stale but drinkable it has a mild and smooth taste BUT it's weak.  I prefer medium roast --I got this for my teenagers and they like it well enough that it won't go to waste but they don't want me to buy it again.<br /><br />Also, with this brand the  cups are made of a plastic that have a little more resistance than the other 'k-cups' that I've used so they require a little more pressure to pierce when I load them into the Keurig... I worry a mite that this could damage the machine.

review/summary: Martinson Coffee Capsules, French Roast, 48-Count
review/text: This French roast coffee is very good. Since purchasing our Keurig brewer we have tried almost every coffee we could find (except flavored coffee), and found most of the French roast varieties to have a bitter aftertaste. This coffee is a bold, dark roast, strong (like we prefer), yet without the bitterness of other brands. The 48-count package was a good value, considerably less than the "Super-store" where we usually purchase our K-cups. The most amazing aspect of this purchase however, was the AMAZINGLY quick shipping. This  order was placed with "Amazon Prime" on Thursday and was delivered to our door in just over 24 hours after the order was placed. Amazon continues to give us more and more reasons to not have to deal with the wally-world-weirdos! Thanks!!

review/summary: My new favorite K-Cup!  Replaced Veranda
review/text: Wow, what can I say!  When I first got notification about this new product from Amazon, I was a bit skeptical.  The price was the lowest around of any k-cups I've ever found and I figured that the quality probably wouldn't be far behind the price.  Boy was I wrong.  I'm not into the insanely strong, bold coffee, but I'm also not into water either.  Previously, my favorite flavor was Starbucks Breakfast blend, also known as "Veranda", or "blonde".  It had the right flavor, not bitter, and was delicious.  The problem was the price.  It was way too expensive and I ended up using an ecobrew single serve cup and a bag of it to cut the cost down.  It made it a lot cheaper, was just as good if not better, but was a pain to have to dump the grounds, clean it out, and refill every time I wanted to use it.  My Martinson Breakfast blend cups arrived today and I didn't waste any time.  Straight out of the box and right into the brewer.  It smelled good as it was brewing but the surprise came when I took a taste.  This was better than Veranda!!  Full flavor with just a hint of nuttiness, exactly how I like it.  After one cup, I'm officially hooked.  This is my new favorite coffee and I'm just about to order a much bigger box!  Thank you Amazon for offering it here at such a great price.  It's about time these things got cheaper!

review/text: I purchased the variety pack of Martinsons and the Brown Gold they are both from the same vendor.  I did not like the taste of the Martinson product at all.  I threw it away, not the product I expected at all.  The Brown Gold was more palatable, however certain flavors with this brand also feel short in particular the Costa Rican named product was extremely too bitter.  I would agree with most that this does give you a lower cost per serving, but when the coffee is inferior and the taste match is also, I think the best descriptor is cheap.

I am guessing that the coffee was ground to fine for a K-Cup.  I only have 8 more left and will be glad.  I will not buy this brand again.

review/summary: Great (and inexpensive) way to try several coffees
review/text: I wanted an inexpensive way for our office to try several roasts.<br /><br />I grew up in New Orleans, drinking french roast or coffee with chicory and, not surprisingly, I liked the dark roast and french roast the best. Both are very good, and the price can't be beat, so I ordered a case of each.<br /><br />I'm not wild about the other roasts, but the other people in the office seem to like them, and once again, the price is outstanding!

review/summary: Nice Surprise!
review/text: Martinson's Dark Roast k-cup was a very nice surprise. My only complaint was that it came in a 48-count box. I had never tried this brand and bought it based on other reviewer's comments. Now that I know how good this coffee is, the larger box is not a problem. I prefer a full bodied cup of coffee in the morning and this brew met my needs and is one of my favorites. It is not over-powering, just very good.  I shared this coffee with two friends that have Keurigs and they liked it but said they couldn't find it at the store.  I would definitely buy this again.

review/text: I was thrilled to see that Amazon carried Martinson coffee, a fixture in my household growing up. Now that I live in Florida, I was taking an empty suitcase with me when I went to New Jersey to visit my daughter and filling it with Martinson coffee to import to Florida.  I'm sure TSA is worried.  I know my daughter is. Thank you Amazon and Martinson for helping me with my coffee hoarding.  Now would you mind offering the cans?  Thank you so much.

review/text: I think all of us Keurig owner's are looking for a better, make that cheaper:), alternative to the original k-cup. So far I have tried San Francisco Bay (ech), Broklyn's (not crazy about it) and now this one - Martinson Variety Pack (the best one yet). Tried all the different blends except the Hazelnut (not looking for a flavored coffee), and I would buy any of them on their own. Much better to me than the others:)<br />Really looking forward to trying the Brown Gold variety pack by this same company - if Amazon ever does get any in stock that is!

review/text: Tried the new coffee by Martinsons because I needed something new. Every cup I tried seems to have a lot of coffee dust and sludge on the bottom the cup. I know that some of these k-cups do that but it seemed much more than usual. I think the filter is not filtering the coffee properly and allowing the finer grounds to get through.

review/summary: Nice Texture
review/text: This is one of the first items I bought as I am changing my family's diet to gluten free (or as close as I can get it).  I made pancakes yesterday and my family loved them.  My husband usually eats 5-6 regular pancakes before throwing in the towel and yesterday after only three of the same sized pancakes he was "stuffed".  I also found I couldn't eat more than two, and I'm a good breakfast eater.  Our five and six year olds were happy after one each.<br /><br />As for the taste and texture, they didn't fall apart or go "crumbly".  We both agreed that they tasted much more like a corn cake rather than a traditional pancake, as we are used to the Aunt Jemima brand pancake mix.<br /><br />This morning I warmed one pancake up (since there were leftovers) in the microwave and had one for breakfast and it was just as good as yesterday.  I am freezing the rest and will nuke one each day this week for breakfast as an easy start to each day.  Couldn't be simpler.  If you are one who always says they don't have time for breakfast, this is the easiest way to go.  Enjoy.

review/text: Not much to say about this fudge, other than it is awesome!! If you like fudge in general (vanilla and other non-chocolate flavors), and you like caramel, then you should definately try the dulce de leche fudge. It's only downside is that it is so so sooo sweet...but it's fudge. It's supposed to be sweet. Buying from Mo's Fudge factor was great too. they shipped out quickly, and when I received the package, I saw that they had written "perishable" on the box, which I was very happy to see. Although it seems like it should be a standard practice for perishable items, it is not as common a thing as you might think. A lot of companies would and do overlook the need for that. In my case it was extremely helpful, because my mail comes at different times of day throughout each month, so I never know when to look for it to show up. My mailman usually just leaves my packages by my mailbox, and I eventaully find them outside, sometimes hours later, but this time he rang my bell for the first time in ages. Im assuming that was due to the perishable label...So, to sum up - great fudge, great company.

I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :(

(One is a pretty picky eater too, but absolutely loves these soft buddy treats.)  They have made training much easier because they will do anything to get them.  (If I train with other treats 1 of my dogs will spit it out and wait to see if I have a buddy treat...)  :)  They love all of the flavors (as long as its the soft and chewy buddy biscuits rather than the other types).
