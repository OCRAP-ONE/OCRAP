review/summary: Donut House K-Cups
review/text: In the past, the Donut House K-Cups have been of the highest quality & would have been rated 5 stars. However, even tho the quality of the product is still there, the last time I received the 80 pack, several of the K-Cups were broken & the coffee missing. Some of them were broken within the box & the coffee was everywhere. That is the reason for the 4 star rating - will order them once more to see if the last order was an anomaly.

review/summary: Light Roast: Bitter for this gal...
review/text: I hate calling out an entire brand, but sadly, I must. I accidentally ordered this thinking it was a different, very similarly named brand, and didn't realize it I brewed a K-cup. It was so bitter, typical of this brand (this is my third attempt with this brand). And of course, I just had to accidentally buy the jumbo 24-count pack. Even with a 1/4 c of cream or a whole packet of hot cocoa, it still has a big bite to it. Anyway, it's just not for me. Good price, though, and arrived on time.

review/summary: Not bad for a light roast!
review/text: My father-in law purchased this coffee as an 80 count box at Sam's Club, and since he really likes it (and so does my mother-in-law, I thought I'd also give it a try. My preference is actually a darker (medium) roast, and I also prefer an extra bold amount, but for this coffee, if the water setting is on medium, then it's a good flavored, moderate wake-up coffee with only a very small amount of bitter aftertaste. In short, it's not bad for a light roast!

I love them both and alternate between the Green Mountain Robust Magic and Donut House. Having tried most of the brands on the market these 2 stand out to me as having the best coffee flavor.<br />If you don't like to drink "brown water" (stay away from the organic Newman's Own Decaf - horrid!) the Donut House is for you!

review/text: When I bought this coffee I was expecting a light-roast coffee with smooth body and great flavor as could be found in some donut shops in days gone by.  For me, this doesn't fulfill either.  This coffee should be described as bold, there is nothing light about it.  Forget about smooth body, instead it has an acidity and bitterness that I found unpleasant.  I'm still debating just tossing it out or letting it collect dust in the event I need to use it if I'm out of all other k-cups.<br /><br />This coffee made it to my "Do not buy again" list.

review/text: I mistakenly grabbed this Donut HOUSE blend at Costco thinking it was the Donut SHOP blend of k-cup (by Coffee People).  I realized it wasn't Donut SHOP the first time I made a cup.  It was REALLY light - basically colored water, very little flavor if made on the recommended 8 oz brew size.  Not much better on a lower setting either.  If you like a very, very mild coffee, then this is for you.  I'm not a fan of strong coffee, but this was WAY to mild and I'll be making sure I'm getting the Coffee People Donut SHOP coffee rather than Donut HOUSE in the future!

review/summary: Almost Perfect
review/text: I'm on a quest for the perfect Christmas fruitcake since I had one when I was in high school, many, many, many years ago.  I can't remember the name of the immortal fruitcake and my mother has passed on, so I'm pretty much starting from scratch.<br /><br />This Christmas I tried the Trappist Abbey fruitcake and the Glenfiddich fruitcake.  Be aware that both are very small, no larger than a small container of sour cream but in a square shape; in other words, roughly 3x3x3, enough for two people or three skinny servings.<br /><br />Of the two fruitcakes, I prefer this one.  It's moister and contains more cherries.  I like cherries.  In fact, there seems to be more fruit overall, including pineapple.  And it's soaked in brandy as opposed to scotch which, while I have nothing whatsoever against scotch, just doesn't translate as well as brandy to fruitcake.<br /><br />Next year I've decided to make my own fruitcake and make it self-igniting which may bring it closer to the legendary fruitcake so firmly entrenched in my memory.

review/summary: Perhaps a bit overpriced
review/text: I ordered the 1 lb. fruitcake (along with the 1 lb. date-nut cake), and when both of them came in one small brown box I got concerned. Like others who have ordered, I was a bit taken aback by how small it was. So I took my first bite with full intent of savoring it. It is very dense. It carries its weight in fruits and cake bread: pineapple, cherries, raisins, walnuts, pecans; the cake is lightly sweetened with honey and soaked in 120 proof brandy.<br /><br />The 1 lb. portion (16 oz.) contains 8 servings. Each serving is 2 oz., worth 220 Calories, 80 Fat Calories. Hopefully that gives you an idea of how dense this fruitcake is. It is packed with goodies. For its amount, personally I find it a bit overpriced, but if you can savor every bite, then it's worth it.<br /><br />By the way, I uploaded a photo of the 1 lb. fruitcake in my hand, just to give you a sense of size so you're not surprised when you order and receive it.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Not immediately. I'd shop around and try other ones just to compare. I may or may not re-purchase, hard to say, but this was definitely worth a try.

review/summary: This fruit cake is a find
review/text: Of all the fruit cakes I have purchased, this is the closest to a home-made fruit cake, so I'm happy! It's packed with fruit and especially glace cherries, so the smallest piece is satisfying. It's not sickly sweet. The cake I bought was only 1lb, which also makes it the smallest cake I've purchased, and on the expensive side, but worth it. Because it is so rich, it packs a punch and will last me quite well. It was delivered in excellent condition.

review/text: There are so many artificial ingredients in this it made me ill to read it.  If you can smell the bourbon (which is just above the salt) then you have a better nose than my hound.  If you want sodium benzoate, yellow #5, yellow #6, red #40, blue #1, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, diglycerides, artifical flavor and sodium propionate, this is your fruitcake.  I wish I could send you mine.  The flavor was very disappointing but what can you expect with all those chemical.  They need to let the nuns make the cake.  I think the monestary part is just a ploy.

review/summary: The best fruitcake money can buy IMO
review/text: I have tasted fruitcakes from several manufacturers in the United States. The Trappist Abbey Monastery Fruitcake is the best. It is small in size but it is a dense quality content. The sweetness is just right. It is extremely rich composed of quality nuts and fruits. Unlike other fruitcakes it does not leave behind a sticky sugary ooze. The bite is soft yet it has a mild crunch to it. Size for size compared to other fruitcakes this one is pricey. You get what you pay for. When I feel the urge again I will order the Trappist Abbey Monastery Fruitcake.

review/summary: Wonderful, old-fashioned dark fruitcake from Trappist Abbey
review/text: I have been buying this wonderful, traditional fruitcake from the Trappist Abbey for many years now. My family used to make a fantastic fruitcake until my grandmother, mother and aunts got too old to continue. The Trappist Abbey fruitcake comes the closest to the taste of my family's old recipe cake.<br /><br />I have served this fruitcake to guests who loved it. Even my son thinks it is wonderful and always looks forward to receiving one as a gift. I also have given it as a gift to friends who remember the old-fashioned fruitcakes.<br /><br />The Trappist Abbey is a dark, moist fruitcake stuffed with fruit and nuts. You can wrap it in cheesecloth and give it a drink of brandy, bourbon, or rum if you want, but that certainly is not a necessity.<br /><br />I recommend this brand wholeheartedly and I plan on sending in this year's order shortly.

review/summary: Less than I bargained for!
review/text: When I opened the medium sized packing box I found a fruitcake about the size of a 3x3x3"cube.  I first burst out laughing at the size and then I looked at the product box as this wasn't what I expected a pound fruitcake to look like!  It's very dense, with lots of nuts and moist fruit, but it is a bit difficult to cut in spots.  I've loved fruitcake for over 50 years, but I think fruitcake is very subjective, just like pizza.  I wouldn't order it again as I like mine with less densely packed nuts.  There's nothing wrong with the taste, and it does have more delicious cherries in it than most cakes.

Made with care and quality, side benefits included fairly low calories (compared to others), high fiber and a satisfying taste experience. Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: Delicious but TINY!!!!
review/text: This a great fruitcake. Let me start off by saying im not a huge fan of fruitcakes. The first thing I noticed was this fruitcake was TINY!!! I was shocked, I will never buy one again for this price. It was about 4"x4" on the large side.  It fits neatly into the palm of my hand. It has a nice red cherry in the middle with some pecans arranged to point to it from each corner, clearly an attempt at a design.<br /><br />The fruitcake itself is delicious, it is a dark, dense, and moist cake. It is dominated by nuts, but not overpoweringly so. It has a great flavor of brandy, spice, and cinnamon. It was like eating a pumpkin cake mixed with cinnamon rum raisin bread pudding in flavor. It had just enough fruit to provide it with a nice little burst of refreshing juiciness in the midst of the spiced flavor, walnuts, and pecans.<br /><br />If price is not an issue and youre just looking to get a good fruitcake, go no further, or if you dont mind spending the money just once to try it, go ahead. Im glad I bought this as it really was a delicious treat, but I will not be able to get it again until I have a little more cash on hand. They would make great gifts though due to their "fun" size.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Delicious<br />Cons:<br />TINY, should be like 7-8 bucks.<br /><br />Taste: 9.5/10<br />Appearance: 7/10<br />Value: 4/10<br />Gift Power: 8/10 (If they like fruitcakes)

The cake arrived in very secure packaging right away - within 3 days during the week between Christmas and New Year's! I asked her if I could have a bite sometime, but she ate it all herself. I take that as two thumbs up for the flavor. She did say the cake was moist and delicious and thanked me many times. I should have ordered two. This will likely become a birthday tradition in years to come.

Besides the long list of preservatives, there really isn't any flavor to the cake itself. All one tastes are the fruits. The price I paid for this little tiny square of it was outrageous! Do yourselves a favor and get the fruitcake from the Assumption Abbey Monks. The cake has a delicious flavor having been soaked in liquer and it doesn't skimp on the fruits either!

review/text: I ordered this and I got confirmation they sent my fruitcake to my PO Box via UPS.  Which of course, can't be done!!  My fruitcake arrived 19 days later.  It was vacuum sealed.  It was not moist.  It was as heavy as a brick and very tiny like half a brick.  Careful around small feet and pets.  As I was trying it...I was also reading the ingredients on the back.  Horrifying....They say "fresh" but the ingredients list says mono & diglycerides 2 times, artificial flavor 3 times (one is artificial butter), partially hydrogentated oil, many preservatives including Sulfur Dioxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Benzoate of Soda and also something called Gum Tragacanth.  I always knew the candied fruit in fruit cake may not be naturally dried fruit, but I prefer that the rest of the cake is truly fresh.  I tried this `cause it came in a small size and was less expensive, but normally I get the Assumption Abbey Trappist Monk (Missouri Ozarks) cake, which only comes in one size, but does also have 4 stars on Amazon reviews.  It's ingredients list was much less of a shocker.  It is very very moist, you can taste more remnants of the  rum (but not boozy - my kids like too).

review/text: I LOVE fruitcake and actually asked for a good one as a Christmas present.  Boy, was I disappointed!  It was dry(stale) and flavorless, with only a bland piece of pineapple or cherry here or there with mostly nuts.  I believe fruitcake should be mostly fruit, otherwise it should be called nutcake.  Plus, there were no citron or any kind of citrus pieces to liven it up (though they probably would have no flavor even if they were there).  I'm glad I received this, though, because I've always dreamed about it, so now I know.  I guess next year I'll have to content myself with Entemann's -- it's doughy and way too sweet, but at least it's fresh and has that "fruitcake" flavor.

review/summary: No Wonder people wont eat fruitcake!
review/text: I have been experimenting and buying fruitcakes on line from some reputable sellers.  This arrived the other day.  I paid $15 for a 3x3 square and it is THE WORST FRUITCAKE I'VE EVER EATED!  Where is the fruit?????  IT is more like a nutty drier health food bread.  And there was no taste of bourbon or anything alcohol as said in description.<br />No doubt about it..............This is TERRIBLE!  Fruitcakers BEWARE!

review/text: I love sardines--especially skinless and boneless.  I have tried other brands, but Cole's is the best.  Not too salty or oily tasting.  I also like knowing where the fish I eat comes from.  Worth the higher price.  I plan to purchase again.

review/text: If you think all sardines are the same, you are going to be in for some surprise.  Cole's products and these sardines in particular are simply delicious.  They are packaged in a wonderful olive oil, boneless and fantastic.  I am a big fan.  Strangely the price on line is more than I pay in the store, but if your local grocer doesn't carry these, try them.<br /><br />I also love the smoked rainbow trout.  High in Omega 3 and zero carbs. Yummy.

review/summary: Sunflower Seeds
review/text: Wonderful product.  Salty and sweet.  So good on salads and in oatmeal.  Awesome for trail mix.  They are packaged well and don't have as much as oil as regular roasted sunflower seeds.  Besides being tasty and not as fattening, I think the lower fat prevents them from getting that rancid taste like so many sunflower seeds do even when stored in an air-tight container.  Speaking of air-tight - the bottles really seal well and are great for direct or regular recycling.  I will buy this product again.

review/summary: Favorite New England Style clam chowder.
review/text: When my local supermarket quit carrying Gordon's New England Style clam chowder I almost went into withdrawal.  This clam chowder has lots of potatoes and clams, as well as a thick, rich, soup base.  It is as close to authentic chowder as I have found in a can.  I generally "spike" mine by adding a can of Snow's chopped clams to make it even "clamier."  Nevertheless, this is a great base to start with.  Now I can buy both items even quicker and easier from Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Despite the dangers to my health, I prefer to make this with Half & Half.  I don't eat it too frequently, so I justify the added calories and fat by saying that I am consuming fewer calories by having soup.<br /><br />I've tried quite a few brands, and this is clearly my favorite!<br /><br />Bon app&eacute;tit!

review/text: Not sure what the ingrediants are but it seems like I recall a strong honey taste. I didn't care for this one. Not understanding why they don't have the Peach Tea available in the gallon jug, because that is the best one. The amazon price is outrageous! They must be figuring on a built-in shipping cost. You can buy this at Schneuks grocery store for $2.99/gal. and on sale it is 3 jugs for $8. If you want your store to carry it, give them the barcode.

review/summary: Good, but salty
review/text: This is easy and quick to make and a life saver if you are short on time. I would add more vegtables to make it a main meal, not a side. The downside is the high sodium content. It's pretty high plus you can really taste it when you eat it - you really need to add something to it to make it less salty or use only half of the spice bag it comes with. Of course then you don't get as many dried tomatoes either. But, for your health and taste buds sake, you need to do something to bring down the salt.

review/summary: Sugar Free cookies are a joke
review/text: So many people, usually diabetics, buy sugar free cookies/snacks "because they can't have sugar".  These may not have sugar, but they have sugar alcohols which DO affect blood sugar, and they're mostly white flour which gets turned into glucose quickly.  These cookies have more calories and more carbs per biscuit than the regular ones!  The regular ones are actually not bad in the carb/sugar department (3g total carb per biscuit, 1.6g is sugar) and you don't have to worry about unpleasant gastric side effects from sugar alcohols.<br /><br />If you're thinking of buying these because you're diabetic, do yourself a favor and get the regular kind and account for the carbs which will be LESS than the sugar free ones.  Unless you're going to be a total pig and eat the entire package it won't make a difference.  I have Type 1 diabetes and count carbs, and I take the appropriate amount of insulin for however many biscuits I'm going to eat.  The regular Kedem biscuits are fantastic with a hot cup of tea, and you couldn't pay me to eat the sugar free kind which would affect my blood sugar even more than the regular ones.<br /><br />Oh, and the sugar free biscuits are more than twice the price of the regular ones.

review/text: This is a good tasting orange marmalade but does not really have the taste of blood oranges.  So if you are expecting an unique flavor like eating a blood orange, forget it.  For a standard orange marmalade, it is good however.  The company should sell it in larger jars rather than 3.5 ounce bottles, like those small ones a restaurant puts on your table.

review/text: I'm pleasantly surprised to see that Amazon carries Stonewall Kitchen products and especially the Blood Orange Marmalade.  My only complaint (a small one) is that I'd like to be able to buy the 12 oz. jar.  For those who think the marmalade doesn't taste enough like blood oranges, if you read the ingredients on the jar you'll see that "blood orange concentrate" is the third ingredient. There are no ingredients which you cannot pronounce, that is, chemicals of any kind, everything that goes into it could be found in your kitchen at home.  I don't know how they could make this product to be any more flavorful.  Good stuff and far less expensive than buying it at the Stonewall Kitchen website.

review/text: This is just powdered tomato. No additives. The nutrition facts listed above are accurate. There is no added sugar.<br /><br />I did not for the product any sweeter than a can of low-sodium tomato paste. You may find it "sweet" if you are accustomed to the loaded-with-sodium "national brand" tomato paste that you find in the grocery store. There is barely any sodium at all in this powdered tomato. Take care of your blood pressure: Eat less sodium!<br /><br />Now for the best part: According to its Web site, Frontier is an outstandingly socially and environmentally responsible company. The package in which my product was shipped consists of 100% recycled materials, sourced locally (in Iowa), and printed with soy ink. The packing peanuts are the kind that dissolve in hot water.<br /><br />This matters to me folks. I will certainly buy more products from this company.

review/summary: Pretty healthy, but not a low sugar product
review/text: Now, one of the reviewers of this product complained about the sugar content of this cereal by only looking at the ingredients list, which is not how to determine the nutritional value of any product (especially when the reviewer cannot distinguish between nutritive and non-nutritive ingredients). This cereal has just as many simple sugars as Frosted Flakes, but the cereal does not claim to be low in sugar. What's important about this cereal is that it offers quite a bit of fiber and vitamins/minerals (not as much as some cereals, but since I have no deficiencies in this area, I didn't mind). Also, it only has 3 times the salt of a half cup of milk which is not LOADED. A can of healthy choice soup, now that is loaded with salt.<br /><br />Now, I chose this cereal as a replacement for Frosted Flakes/Honey Nut Cheerios, which against my better judgment I continued to have every morning. I should point out that I don't drink coffee in the mornings and I don't drink soda (less than 1 a week on average). I also eat no sweets.  Simple sugars (listed as just "Sugars" on the nutrition label) seem to be treated like carcinogens, while most people don't realize that aspartame (artificial sweetener in most diet sodas) really is one. If your diet is already low in sugar and you feel confident you can burn through those sugars pretty quick (since I don't drink caffeinated drinks, I need that jolt in the morning), then this is a good choice. If your diet already has quite a bit of sugar or your doctor tells you to cut down on simple sugars (or you also have a couple of cups of caffeinated coffee with sugar every morning), then go with another bran cereal without the oat clusters and syrups (which I really do not like that much). Also, if you are concerned about the total carbs, please note that a normal 2000 calories diet would include about 300g of carbohydrates (so yes, high protein diets contradict  this).<br /><br />Since taste is completely subjective, I won't put much emphasis on it. In my opinion, it tastes pretty good (but I don't consume many sweets during the day).

review/text: This is not a bad cereal and the taste is pretty good. However I prefer more natural food even if they have a bit of sugar. I don't like the fact that the cereal is made to look healthy although it is sweetened with the unnecessary ingredient, High Fructose Corn Syrup. Natural sweetening with fruits is proffered but if you want to sweeten something just use plain old sugar, not some crappy chemically modified for of corn glucose.<br /><br />Kashi heart to heart and many other Kashi brands are much better and they do not use High fructose Corn Syrup.
