review/text: I tend to drink decaf far more than regular coffee, but will occasionally partake in a cup of the good stuff. This was a real treat - rich tasting, but not bitter. The vanilla is there more as an afterthought, which is a good thing. I like flavored decaf coffee since the flavor tends to "up" the taste quota since decaf tends to be lacking in body. But, with regular coffee, I prefer any flavoring to be secondary to the coffee taste. This hits that sweet spot - the vanilla is there, but it doesn't mask or interfere with the coffee taste.<br /><br />I tried this in a drip machine, a Senseo and a french press. The french press results were the best - the flavor really came out, but it was a bit more oily than other brews (I'm assuming this is because I'm so used to decaf). Served it after dinner to some guests and got thumbs up from everyone, even those who stated they don't care for flavored coffee.

review/summary: Smells Great - Tastes Bitter - Disappointing
review/text: This coffee - Starbucks brand Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee - smells incredible when you open the bag, even better when the coffee is brewing, and after the coffee was done brewing, my entire house smelled like the inside of a Starbucks Coffee Store.  Excellent.<br /><br />As for the taste? The taste is something of a disappointment. This coffee has a definite bitter edge and the vanilla aspect is extremely light, definitely overpowered by the bitterness.  If I was going to have a house party, I'd probably brew this coffee just for the way it smells. This creates a great party-like atmosphere, but for day-to-day coffee drinking enjoyment, the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, probably won't live up to the expectations of most gourmet coffee drinkers.

review/summary: Typically Starbuck's
review/text: I am by no stretch a coffee expert, but I drink around 4-5 cups a day and thoroughly enjoyed this brew.  It's ground very fine and has a full flavor.  One of my concerns was that I didn't want the vanilla to be overpowering.  I was happy when I tasted an excellent blend of the richness that has made Starbuck's famous and the twist of vanilla swirled in seamlessly.<br /><br />As for the price, I don't know that I will be ordering this more often than the occasional special event.  But, none the less, this bag was worth it.

review/summary: Not disappointed, not impressed.
review/text: As a self-confessed coffee addict for the past 20 years, I'd like to think that I'm a good judge of coffee.  Yes, if you poke through my previous reviews, you'll see that I rated a bag of Yuban (Breakfast Blend) rather highly.  So you may be surprised at my middling review of a bag of Starbucks and might therefore brand me a "hater". I am not. I love their Sumatran, Komodo Dragon, Anniversary Blend and their Christmas Blend.  AND, I was really looking forward a "subtle flavor" of vanilla in a cup of coffee. Now that we're all clear:<br /><br />Opening the bag of Starbucks Natural Infusions Vanilla, you'll immediately be hit by the scent of vanilla.  I was a bit scared that the coffee would wind up overpoweringly vanilla once brewed, but it wasn't so.  The vanilla is pronounced, but not overpowering once brewed.  HOWEVER, once brewed, the coffee beans' origin is immediately obvious.  The bag says "Latin American beans" but what they mean is Colombian. There's no mistaking that distinctive scent or taste.  Also, this is not a dark roast, not a bold coffee; it's a tame pseudo-breakfast roast.  It is a bit oily, but not overly so. (As another reviewer noted, this may be due to the added glycerin.)<br /><br />Point of interest: I drip brewed 6 cups for my initial tasting and did not add anything nor doctor the brew.  And onto the taste: very Colombian coffee, definitely vanilla, mildly sweet.  Starbucks not only added vanilla to the ground coffee, but they also added sarsparilla root and "natural flavor" including corn maltodextrin.  This is likely why it comes off as sweet when served black.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is there, make no mistake.  And the sweetness is there too.  No, this isn't as pronounced as adding a shot of flavored syrup to your coffee, but it isn't as subtle as the packaging would have us believe. If you like flavored coffee, this is right up your alley.  But, a note to coffee drinkers who like their coffee strong and bitter: this is not the coffee for you!<br /><br />I don't hate this coffee, but I don't love it.  If someone served it to me, I'd drink it (black) and not complain... until I got home.  ;-)

review/text: This coffee starts tempting as soon as the package is opened.  The aroma of the coffee beans and vanilla are sweet smelling and made me want that pot to brew fast!  While brewing I got a scent of what was to come - a smooth cup of coffee with just the right hint of vanilla and that bite that Starbucks coffee is known (and loved) for.<br /><br />I don't use sugar in my coffee - just a little more than the usual amount of milk, cream or half-and-half - whatever is available.  With that I had a nice smooth cup of Joe, and a nice pick-me-up to get through the afternoon!<br /><br />If you like Starbucks, like vanilla, and most of all, love coffee, this is good stuff!<br /><br />I don't usually buy Starbucks for home so will comment on the packaging.  It's a typical foil pouch with resealable top (both tape and wires that fold in).  This should keep the coffee fresh from first to last cup!

review/summary: Another Starbucks Winner
review/text: Being a dedicated Starbucks Coffee drinker, I was anxious to try the "Natural Fusion" flavored ground coffee. (Natural Fusion: a blend of coffee with natural vanilla "guessing") Following the recipe on the package, namely, using cold filtered water, adding 2 tablespoons (measured) for every 6 flu oz. of water in the 4 cup brewer (clean machine) - I was surprised at the smooth taste - Starbucks Shop Coffee with flavor is a great experience.  Couple recommended do/do not: (1) keep the back sealed tight in a cabinet (2) do not refrigerate (3) brew within a week of opening the package (4) Best use before date stamped on package.  An outstanding cup of Starbucks Coffee - vanilla flavored!

review/summary: Most people will like this; aficionados not so much
review/text: This Starbucks coffee is a (very consistent) medium grind which works perfectly either in a coffee press or for drip (filter) brewing.<br /><br />The aroma from the bag and the cup is distinctly, and strongly, vanilla.  If you actually like the flavor of coffee (as I do), you will not find it here.  Starbucks states that they used a lightly roasted Latin American bean that sets off the flavor.  In my opinion, it sets it off too well, as the only flavor I could detect was the vanilla (and "other natural flavors").<br /><br />Sipping the coffee, it had a round, smooth taste and feel and low acidity.  The coffee press let the oils through that were trapped by the filter in the drip test cup and felt a bit oily to me, perhaps from the vegetable glycerin added to bind the unidentified "natural flavors".<br /><br />I grind moderately to dark roasted beans for each cup prior to brewing and actually like the flavor of coffee with (rarely) at most some subtle additional flavor.  The vanilla flavor here is neither subtle, nor completely natural if you happen to be someone who has cooked with actual vanilla beans.<br /><br />Folks who like flavored coffee will probably like this as long as they appreciate the difference between flavored coffee and coffee into which a sweet flavored syrup has been poured.  Folks I know who typically buy ground coffee for an automatic coffee maker would enjoy this.

review/text: I usually am NOT a big fan of Starbucks coffee as I think it tends towards being bitter/burnt tasting.  But I chose this with an open mind and am glad I did.  Since I typically drink just plain coffee (not flavored), I was pleasantly surprised by the nice hints of vanilla as I drank my first cup, and the coffee was mellow and smooth.  A friend who loves regular Starbucks had some with me, and she really enjoyed this flavored brew as well.  So whether you love Starbucks signature roast or simply want a nicely flavored coffee for a change of pace, I think you will enjoy this coffee.

review/summary: Light roast with very subtle vanilla tone
review/text: A smooth full bodied cup of coffee with a very faint hint of vanilla. Opening the bag is a wonderful experience as the bold aroma fills the air around you. Yum. The vanilla component is very strong with the fresh grounds.<br /><br />I made the first cup and drank it black to get the unadulterated flavor. The recommended amount of coffee, 2 tablespoons per 6 oz, is a very, very strong cup of joe. I like strong coffee but 2 T per 6 oz of water is too strong even for me so I brewed it at about 2T for 10oz of water which is still a really strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />My second cup I brewed the same as the first but added Coffee Mate Peppermint Mocha powdered creamer - super tasty. I like that creamer flavor and I wanted to see how the vanilla would stand out. Really it got lost in the stronger flavor of the creamer. There wasn't much vanilla to cover in the first place. I've used the creamer with non-flavored coffee and I cannot tell the difference in taste as far as the vanilla is concerned.<br /><br />So, good coffee with a very mild vanilla taste.

review/text: I tried this Starbucks coffee thinking that it would be a more mild roast coffee in order for the "real vanilla" flavor to show through.  It smelled good and I had high hopes for a true vanilla flavor mixed with a high quality coffee.  What I tasted was a very robust, deep roast, coffee with a bit of vanilla flavor.  It's just not what I prefer.<br />I can't say that i hated it but nor can I say that I loved and would put it on my groccery list.  I was unimpressed and will still hope for something better.

review/summary: Excellent roasting and (mostly) excellent taste.
review/text: I wish Starbucks would roast more of their coffee beans this way. I am not a fan of their tendency to char-broil their coffee beans. For my taste, this is the right amount of roasting and the taste is excellent. I said "mostly" excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees, the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking. For this reason I try to cycle through flavors, and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle. If you are a vanilla flavor fan you will probably rate this as a 5/5, but I am giving it a 4/5 because I would like to reserve a perfect rating for truly exceptional blends.

review/summary: Tastes like real vanilla, very subtle and smooth
review/text: I am sipping on this right now and loving it.  The vanilla flavor is not fake at all, and it does not overpower the flavor of the beans which is surprisingly good.  I don't like many flavored coffees because they taste like they were sprayed with chemicals, not this one.<br /><br />I am also not the biggest fan of Starbucks coffee that you can get in their cafes, it all tastes burnt to me.  I never had their DIY beans and grounds before and I like this much better than what they serve in their chains.  I think it is because I can use a bit less grounds and steep how I like; it creates a cup that is just as strong, but not so bitter or burnt tasting.<br /><br />I used 2/3 of what the bag recommended and it is still very robust.  I made it in a french press for 4 minutes, added 2 creams and 1 sugar, and it kept its deep java edge despite my add-ins.  I sipped it black too and was pleasantly surprised at how less acidic it was than the cafe offering.<br /><br />I took a star off for not being a 16 ounce bag despite the list price, its feels like they are charging for a pound, but skimming off the top.  The price here on Amazon is much better.<br /><br />I am really enjoying my 3:30 Mommy-pick-me-up.  We have 26 guests coming for Thanksgiving in a few days, so I anticipate many pots of this coffee will help make that happen :)

Although I'm glad to be contributing to buying Starbucks products, this coffee flavor is a let-down.  If there is a hint of vanilla flavoring to it, it's extremely subtle and I was unable to notice it.  If you buy this and you're looking for it to have a sweet vanilla flavor, I would recommend buying a syrup to add to the coffee.

The vanilla perfectly compliments the beans and blends together into a delicious blend.  The grounds were nice and fresh as well.<br />CONS:  The bag runs out fast.

The vanilla and the coffee are ground together; you can actually see it.

review/text: My mother in law loves this coffee. I find the aroma a little strong for my taste, but different people enjoy different things. I did like the flavor, sometimes flavored coffees seem like they taste plastic-y or something, this did not. I sometimes mix this with regular coffee in a half and half ratio...that seems to be my perfect amount. Just enough vanilla for me that way. I do that with many flavored coffees though, so it is hard for me to judge what is "too much" or "just enough" for someone else's taste. If you like vanilla coffee, then I think this is a good choice since the flavor is so good. Try it. If you find the aroma slightly strong, you can temper it with regular like I did.

So I'll use it when I run out of other brews or when I have guest who just wants an average cup of non flavored coffee. I've never heard, "oh this is Vanilla?"<br /><br />I made excuses for this brew because it is "Natural Fusion".

review/summary: The right balance of vanilla and coffee
review/text: Starbucks Natural Fusions ground coffee contains the right balance of (added) vanilla flavor and bold coffee. Normally, flavored (let alone pre-ground) coffees aren't very high quality; however, this Starbucks blend is very good. It's not stale or poorly roasted, nor does it have any kind of artificial smell or taste. There's no strange after-taste, either. It brews well, and I'll likely purchase it again. The vanilla "flavor infusion" doesn't overpower; the aroma is absolutely amazing - not flat, with the right amount of depth and complexity.<br /><br />I prepared this coffee drip-style (not in a machine), and found it required a bit more than usual to make the strength I prefer. Additionally, though I prefer black coffee, this coffee responds well to a bit of sugar (it heightens the vanilla flavor) and cream.

review/text: I'm not a HUGE coffee drinker but I do like to keep some in the house so that once in a blue moon we can enjoy a cup or have some when friends or family visits.  Being that I'm not accustomed to drinking coffee, I'm VERY, VERY sensitive taste wise to coffees that are really bitter, have a strong, overpowering flavor and ESPECIALLY those who leave a nasty aftertaste in the mouth.  In other words, for an inexperienced coffee drinker, I'm VERY picky about my coffee.<br /><br />Right when I opened the bag to this Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, I smelled this wonderful, coffee and authentic vanilla aroma that I felt compelled to make a batch immediately just to try it.  Both my husband and I thought it was delicious.  It's very smooth - it doesn't have a harsh 'bite' to it at all, the vanilla flavor in it tastes very 'real' and not some horrid chemical rendition of vanilla and again, didn't leave a bad aftertaste.  I served it to family who visited who are AVID coffee drinkers and they enjoyed it as well - actually asked me what brand it was.<br /><br />For those of you who enjoy your flavored coffees, Vanilla is a GREAT flavor to have on hand since you can do so many things to it in my opinion.  I added some cocoa powder to the grounds one time to make a vanilla - chocolate coffee (YUM!), another time I added cinnamon (DOUBLE YUM!) and another time, Pumpkin Pie spices (hubby didn't like this but I did).  Two thumbs up for me!

review/text: There were a number of things I did not like about this coffee.  First, while most coffee is packaged in 12 oz to 1lb bags, this one is only 11 oz.  That may not seem like much but to pay thier price and get an ounce less than their standard product, seems like a price increase to me.  Next was the actual coffee flavor.  I tried making this coffee a number of different ways to make it taste good.  And every time it just didn't work.  Now, trying to be fair, I like a lighter roast which Starbucks is not known for.  So for those of you who like a darker roast, you may like this just fine.  The last problem I had was the vanilla flavor.  It was extremely overpowering. Just for the record, my wife, who only drinks flavored coffee, did not like this one either.

review/summary: A Satisfying Woodsey Taste
review/text: This coffee really surprised me in a good way.  Preferring my coffee black, Starbucks coffee has always seemed too bitter for my taste.  This coffee was not bitter at all and had a pleasing woodsey flavor that was very pleasing.  I plan to buy some more of this.

review/summary: As good as any Starbucks coffee
review/text: This is a ground vanilla flavored coffee. I do not know the what type of beans it is made of, but it has a strong Sumatra-like flavor to it.<br /><br />I took this on a ski trip with friends and many have said they liked this coffee. Personally, I thought it was good but not great. But that could have been because we used a generic Mr. Coffeee maker which isn't exactly known to brew the best cup.<br /><br />I felt the vanilla flavor felt almost "fake" and artificial and didn't taste very natural.<br /><br />If you are looking for a ground coffee that has a strong sumatra-like taste with slight infusion of vanilla, then this would fit that bill.<br /><br />If you like other Starbucks ground coffee, then this coffee would be as good as any.

review/summary: Not to my taste
review/text: Overall the coffee is OK - tastes fine and is very typical of bagged Starbucks coffee.  The Vanilla is almost not present, which may be a good thing although I wanted it to have just a bit more kick.  There's a slight acidity that makes this a better afternoon or after dinner coffee, rather than breakfast.  I didn't love it and I didn't hate it, but doubtful I'd get any more.

review/summary: Still bitter.
review/text: In two senses, this coffee leaves me bitter.  On the one hand, I've had several years of trying Starbucks home coffee of various kinds and in various ways, and in no way have I been able to get it "perfect."  On the other hand, I gave it another shot with this product, and, while it definitely tastes better than other Starbucks home coffees I've had (hence the three stars), it still has a sense of bitterness.<br /><br />My co-worker, who is much better at brewing coffee than I am, made a pot at the office and told me to try some.  I did, hoping to get that amazing taste other reviewers have mentioned.  After making the cup of coffee that I always do, I sat down at my desk, had a sip, and waited for the full experience: the taste on the tongue, the swirl to the rest of my mouth, the final swig down my esophagus, and, finally, the awaited aftertaste.  It was fine until the last step: the aftertaste.  Here is where I recollected the pangs that bitter coffees leave, and it'll be a while till I try home-brew Starbucks again.  My co-worker even admitted it was bitter.<br />Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not completely anti-Starbucks.  While this specific home-brew leaves a wonderful vanilla initial taste, the in-store coffees taste better (but are still bitter to me), and their specialty drinks are amazing.<br /><br />Because I've had horrible experiences with Starbucks home-brew coffee, I wait for my trip to my grandparents' to drink home-made coffee, and will settle with my Nescafe.

review/summary: Smooth, but not very vanilla
review/text: I don't drink coffee often, but when I do it must be mild to medium roast and very smooooth.  I don't like bold roasts or most flavored coffees. I try to keep a little something different on hand for guests, and figured I couldn't go wrong with Starbucks Vanilla.  I wasn't sure if I would like it, but it's actually pretty good!  In my opinion it tastes less vanilla and more hazelnut, which isn't a bad thing.  I like hazelnut.  That said, the flavor was nicely subtle - just a hint - and did not overpower the coffee flavor.  I was still able to enjoy a medium roast flavor and thankfully it was also very smooth :)

review/text: I am a huge Starbucks coffee fan. I love their coffee and drink it as often as I can. When I saw this Vanilla flavored coffee, though I am a coffee purist, I thought I would try it. Honestly, I've had pleasant vanilla coffee and this was far from it. The vanilla flavor was just strong enough to make it taste odd, but not strong enough to really identify the vanilla flavors. I would not recommend this coffee.

review/summary: Nice addition for Starbucks Lovers
review/text: No need to lie. Starbucks is my favorite brand of coffee. When I saw this offered on the Vine Program, I was totally overjoyed. I love using vanilla creamer and thought the experience would be the same or close. It wasn't, at least to my taste buds. It was much better.<br /><br />When I opened the pouch, specks of vanilla were visible. The smell was strong as well as the taste, much stronger than using vanilla creamer. Then again, the lightly roasted Latin American beans had a robust flavor and the combination was heavenly. I enjoyed it so much, that I ordered more. The cost at Amazon is competitive, especially when I used the $25 free shipping offer. That said, I can't always find the various blends of Starbucks at places like Wal-Mart or Target. Having it shipped is much easier.

review/summary: Usual Starbucks quality delivers the goods
review/text: Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee combines the usual Starbucks richness and "ooomph" with a subtle vanilla flavor, resulting in a more relaxing, down-to-earth coffee than non-flavored Starbucks varieties.  Or to put it another way, it's an enjoyable coffee for those times when you favor a comforting coffee experience over an eye-opening one.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Program, I also recently tried Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee, and liked that a lot, too.  That one was more like a regular cup of coffee, though, less strong and complex than the Starbucks variety described here, though the vanilla flavoring had about the same flavor and strength in both coffees.<br /><br />It's all a matter of personal taste.  Some people like a no-nonsense coffee like the Melitta and some like the gourmet richness of a Starbucks.  Myself, I go back and forth.  And when I'm in the latter mood, and also in the mood for a flavored coffee, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this quality Starbucks offering.

review/summary: Subtle hint of Vanilla and very rich flavor
review/text: I've been a fan of Starbucks coffee for years, but I've only enjoyed flavored varieties of their "holiday lattes". I also drink flavored coffees at Dunkin Donuts, but usually find their flavors a bit overpowering, possibly because "syrup" is used.<br /><br />This coffee, on the other hand, has a "hint" of Vanilla, that does not penetrate the entire cup of coffee and distract from the actual coffee flavor. There is a pleasant fragrance for each sip, but I am still able to taste the bold Starbucks flavor underneath.I'm a daily coffee drinker, and am drinking this coffee right now at work. While the vanilla flavor is subtle, it is effective in spicing up the regular cup.<br /><br />As a side note-Starbucks please consider a partnership with Keurig-it would be my # 1 K-cup choice!<br /><br />Great product and wonderful flavor!

review/summary: Simply put, I loved this coffee
review/text: Since I am a fan of flavored coffee, particularly coffee flavored with natural ingredients, I knew I had to try this coffee. As soon as I opened the package to brew a pot, my kitchen smelled of hints of vanilla (my four year old son even asked me if I was baking something).  If anything, the aroma is most satisfying when drinking this coffee, but the taste isn't too strong. In sum, this coffee is good because of its aroma and delicious taste.  I am certainly impressed with Starbucks' new vanilla addition, and I will most definitely continue purchasing this coffee. For a two pack purchase on Amazon, the price is quite reasonable. Bottom line: if you enjoy drinking a nice scented coffee, this one is a must-try!

review/summary: Great flavor - not overwhelming.
review/text: I am a non-committed fan of Starbucks coffee. I like their in-house coffee, but rarely buy the bagged stuff. I usually find it to be little better than Walmart brand off-the-shelf and have been spoiled in recent years by freshly roasted coffee from a local roaster. Far superior to "bagged" coffee which can be weeks to months old.<br />That said, I am pleasantly pleased with this particular coffee. I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees because most taste weak or painfully artificial, but this one is really enjoyable.  In fact, I just got some from Gevalia coffees recently, and I liked this one better than theirs.<br />My only reason for withholding a star is that the coffee disappears quickly and has a bit of a bitter aftertaste. It's not noticeable if you add cream and sugar, but those who like it black may be a bit turned off by that.<br />If you read the package, it calls for using about twice the amount of coffee per 6oz. water that most bagged coffees indicate. Brewed as directed, this will provide a cup of coffee equal to the strength one generally finds when purchasing it at the franchise stores. Not bad. Actually, pretty good. But you'll find your bag of coffee doesn't last long.<br />One big bonus...on the side of the bag is a keycode. You can take the empty bag to a local Starbucks and they will give you a free medium cup of their brewed coffee.  That's a nice compensation for the "end of the bag" delerium one might encounter.

review/summary: Finally, the Right Combination
review/text: I am really enjoying this coffee.  It took me a little while to get the right combination for my tastes, but I think I finally have it.<br /><br />First of all, it does not work well in a French press.  No matter what combination of water to bean I tried, it just came out off flavored and bitter.<br /><br />When I tried it in my automatic Mr. Coffee, I finally got the flavor I was looking for.  Two rounded 1/8th measures per 6 cups of water.  And don't cut this in half; one scoop for 3 cups is too watery.  I know, it does not make sense.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is good.  Subtle in the way that hints of vanilla without the over whelming vanilla syrup taste that some other brands have.<br /><br />Oh, and do not use artificial sweetener, that does something funky to the vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Also, as an added bonus, when you are finished with the bag, take it to your participating Starbucks for a free 12 cup of coffee.  That is a nice bonus.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good cup of coffee without having to get in the car and travel across town for a midday pick me up.  I suggest that you try it next time you are in the market.

review/summary: Great Taste that Does not Get Old
review/text: I have been a fan of Starbucks Coffee for a long time.  Although that is not a very unique thing in our time, I tend to avoid some flavored coffees because they tend to get old pretty quick.  During the Christmas season, you see cinnamon, gingerbread and other flavors that are to remind us that winter is here.  These wear on me pretty quick and I usually loathe getting through the canister or package of coffee after the first couple of cups.<br /><br />This Vanilla Flavored Coffee is really a nice treat.  My wife enjoys the aroma as it brews.  She does not like the smell of some coffees, but this one is pleasant and it really tastes like it smells.  One thing I like too is that you can get a more bold flavor if you wish by adding just a little more than the recommended serving, giving it a Vanilla Pikes type taste.<br /><br />I look forward to trying more flavors from the Starbucks Natural Fusions collection.  Enjoy this as the months grow colder.

review/summary: If Vanilla is the flavor, why is it the THIRD ingredient after "coffee"?
review/text: I tend to be a regular coffee drinker - 3 to 4 cups per day. And periodically drink flavored coffee. Most are too flavored for me. I like a dark roast (though not as dark as French Roast). I DO like Starbucks' varietals and SOME blends.<br /><br />So, I was hoping for the best of both worlds when Amazon sent me the 1lb package to try. But it didn't live up to expectations.<br /><br />The coffee was a lighter roast than normal - more like Dunkin Donuts. And the Vanilla flavor didn't taste like just vanilla. So I read the package. Though it says "Vanilla and other Natural Flavors" on the front of the package the ingredients list reads as follows" Ground coffee, Natural Flavor (with corn maltodextrine, vegetable Glycerin), Gound Vanilla Beans, Indian Sarsaparilla Root".  Hmm. corn sugar and a natural vegetable product BEFORE the Vanilla? And Sarsaparilla? It's not in the name. That explained the different taste and the aftertaste I got. How about just giving us coffee and vanilla beans? This is to be premium coffee.<br /><br />I think I'll pass on this line of flavors in the future. Coffee preference is a subjective thing. There are lines at Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks as well as McDonalds. And Maxwell House still sells well.<br /><br />So you may or not agree with me but I just want folks who read this review to know the ingredients when they buy this "Natural Fusion" product from Starbucks.<br /><br />Steve Ramm (who generally reviews CDs, books and DVDs but DOES drink coffee too!)<br />"Anything Phonographic"

review/summary: So-so coffee sold by union-busting Starbucks
review/text: I'm not actually a food reviewer. I'll do my best here, but don't expect anything special.<br /><br />This coffee is entirely decent, but tastes to me a little too much like I'm trying to drink candy. The flavor is less about a 'hint' of vanilla and more about sort of rolling your nose around in a vanilla extract smell.  The coffee taste itself, underneath all that vanilla, somehow manages to come off musty, if that makes any sense. It's almost a little too much in the morning, though I suppose it'd make a good dessert coffee.<br /><br />Then there's the Starbucks factor, of course. If you're socially conscious enough to care that this is labeled as a fair trade item, you probably also care about the fact that Starbucks is a union-busting company. All in all, you ought to take your fair trade business elsewhere, as it doesn't make much sense to try to support fair trade on the one hand, while contributing to the abuse of American workers on the other.

review/text: Starbucks Natural Fusions vanilla flavoured coffee is the same consistently strong taste you would expect from the Starbucks brand. The dark roasted taste is consistently strong to the point where it almost overwhelms the vanilla flavouring that was added.  You can taste the vanilla only slightly.  I do use a French press rather than a drip coffee maker for my coffee,letting it steep several minutes in order to maximize the flavour.  This particular batch of coffee came pre-ground and I am one of those hard core cofee drinkers who prefers whole bean coffee,  grinding the beans only when they are ready to be used. While the taste is pleasant enough, and it was a nice change from the usual French or Turkish roast that I drink, I am not sure that I would go out of my way to buy this particular coffee again.

review/text: I am a huge vanilla flavor fan. I love anything vanilla flavored. So naturally, I figured that I would love this coffee. The aroma is great when I open the package and dumped the ground coffee into my coffeemaker. I had high expectations for this.<br /><br />The coffee itself, once it is made is actually only decent tasting. I could only taste a very small hint of vanilla in it and it might have been because of my creamer and not the actual coffee itself. It was a bit bitter compared to other coffees that I have had and very rich. I usually take my coffee with cream and a small amount of sweetner and never really had problems with it being still too bitter.<br /><br />Next time, I guess I'll just use more cream and sweetner. Don't get me wrong, this is not completely horrible and I still enjoy Starbucks. It just surprised me as how bitter it was.

review/summary: Coffee and Real Vanilla A True Fit
review/text: I have been a Vanilla Latte devotee for several years, just ask my local coffee cafe. Only Vanilla Latte, I might add. I will at Christmas try a Gingerbread but always revert back to vanilla. I am also a fan of vanilla ice cream. I am a coffee lover, and went through the flavored coffee phase a few years ago, but quickly reverted to my regular coffee. I was very interested to see the Starbucks Vanilla Fusion on the market. Couldn't wait to try it.<br /><br />The package is very attractive, a subtle green with a picture of a vanilla bean on the front. I have discovered that coffee rarely comes in pound packages nowadays. The pound was decreased to 12 ounces for the price of a pound, and the Vanilla Fusion is 11 ounces.  Opening the package and a very subtle smell of vanilla and coffee is inhaled. I made my coffee in my trusty Cuisinart Coffee maker, and used the usual directions. I poured a cup of the coffee and an aroma of coffee and vanilla lingered. I usually taste new coffee, black, to get the full flavor and this did not disappoint. The taste is a strong medium dark roast. A mellow vanilla flavor blends. The after taste had a darker roast flavor. I then tried it with a little half and half, and this was delicious. My vanilla latte has come home to roost!  There are no chemicals in this coffee, but real vanilla beans are roasted with arabica beans and produce a marvelous taste. Not too strong and with a subtle taste of vanilla.<br /><br />The Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored could be one of the best flavored coffees I have had. This will become a staple in my home. I am anxious to try their caramel flavored coffee.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 11-27-10<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QKBDX4">Starbucks VIA� Iced Coffee by Starbucks Coffee</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ54DW">Starbucks Africa Kitamu Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>

review/text: I normally buy Starbucks so I was excited to try this flavor.  The coffee is mild.  Normally with Starbucks, what is advertised is usually the next level. So mild usually tastes medium, medium tastes bold and bold pretty much removes all tissue from your mouth.  This truly is a mild brew.<br /><br />Also with Starbucks I normally HATE the way the unbrewed coffee smells.  This was an exception and it didn't smell too bad.<br /><br />When I brewed as I normally would it was a smooth cup of coffee with a subtle hint of vanilla.  The next day my husband brewed it with an extra scoop to make it stronger and it was a hot mess.<br /><br />In short, go light on the coffee when you brew and you will get an excellent tasting cup of smooth & subtle vanilla flavor.

review/summary: Yes, I do like flavored coffees BUT.....
review/text: I just want to preface this review by noting that I do stop into Starbucks and get flavored coffees (current favorite, Peppermint Mocha, whipped cream on top). So I had positive expectations of a vanilla flavored coffee. Unfortunately, this was among the worst Starbucks blends I've ever tasted. Just to give it a fair shot, I tried brewing and drinking it four different ways:<br /><br />1.Mild with no sugar or cream<br />2. Strong with no sugar or cream<br />3. Mild with sugar and cream<br />4. Strong with sugar and cream<br /><br />I also had friends taste test this. We all hated it. We couldn't choke it down as it was truly bitter and unpleasant. Maybe we got a bad batch or bag. At this point, we have nearly a whole bag left and I'm feeling guilty about wasting it. But there is no way I'm going to brew another pot of coffee and try to create a tasty brew. I tend to like my coffee extremely strong but even making it overly strong did not make it better. Yes, the vanilla flavor came through but it wasn't a good addition to a possibly decent coffee (without the vanilla).

review/text: Vanilla flavored coffee happens to be my favorite.  I like to drink it hot or cold all year round and prefer the 'soft' aftertaste to other roasts.  I can't say that I notice any difference in the 'natural fusion' as to the taste of other flavored coffees but it was definitely superior to coffee that was flavored after it was brewed.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz

review/summary: Suprised by how good it is
review/text: I'm an avid coffee drinker, but I stick to the basics: lattes, french roast drip,  espresso. Only rarely do I drink coffee with flavor added. But when I do, it's typically vanilla, so I thought this might be a decent product to have on hand during the holidays as an addition to my usual dark-roast, whole beans.<br /><br />I am drinking a cup as I type this and it's really good. The coffee itself has the full-bodied, robust taste I like. The vanilla flavoring is subtle and pleasant. It doesn't taste artificial and leaves no after taste. It's definitely a nice change from my usual coffee and feels festive.<br /><br />The Amazon price for two bags seems reasonable to me for Starbuck's coffee. Yes, it may be more expensive than other brands, but I think it's worth the delicate balance of flavors you get from the product.

review/summary: Best-smelling coffee ever!
review/text: Buy it for the amazing smell.  I opened the bag and was in love.  I looked in there and it reminded me of a fine tea blend with flecks of different roots and beans etc.  The coffee smelled great while it was brewing.  At first when I took a sip it was all I had hoped for.  But then it hit the back of my tongue and I tasted a slight acidic flavor.  I hate that in a coffee.  It was not strongly acidic, very slight, and probably plenty of sugar would nullify the acid, but I don't want tons of sugar.  All in all I would say I like it, but it's not my favorite coffee.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: I must admit, I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this thru the Vine program. I was wary of anything that is "pre-flavored". However, I was pleasantly surprised. When you open up the bag the smell is wonderful. And the taste is complex. Some people have complained that the vanilla flavor is not pronounced enough, but I find it to be just right. It is definitely there, but not overwhelming. There is another nice flavor in there which I couldn't quite place, but after reading the ingredient list on the bag I assume it is the Sarsaparilla Root. The coffee is slightly bitter, which adds to the complex flavor. (There is a yin-yang thing going on with the sweeter flavors.) I like a very strong, dark roast and I find that this falls into that category although Starbucks advertises it as a medium roast. Overall, I think this is a winner.

review/text: I'm not huge on plain coffee but I do enjoy making myself Cafe Mochas and this is wonderful for that.  I've drank this plain as well and thought that was really good too.  I was a little worried that the smell would put me off because I'm one of the few people that don't like the smell of vanilla but this wasn't overwhelming at all.  I actually liked the smell of this.<br /><br />Smells great and tastes really good.  What more do you need?  I highly recommend this coffee.

review/summary: Not as good as their unflavored coffees.
review/text: I am a flat-out fiend for good coffee.  I ordered Starbucks by mail well before they had a string of coffee shops, and I'd venture to guess that were you to order a vanilla latte there, this is not what you would get.<br /><br />I basically never buy flavored coffees, having learned from a friend who worked for a local gourmet coffee company that if you want flavored coffee, you add the flavoring after it is brewed.  Because many delicate natural ingredients are destroyed by the heat required to brew coffee properly most flavored coffees are chemical.  I would not purchase a chemically flavored coffe, or drink it except as aq last resort (i.e., stranded at an airport).  I applaud Starbucks for the effort to make a naturally flavored coffee, and on thinking about it, vanilla beans seem like one of the better candidates to stand up to the heat; after all, they are used in baking at even higher heat.<br />However, this effort falls somewhat flat, or maybe I should say sharp.  While it smells just wonderful when you open the bag, the brewed coffee is bitter with only a faint odor remaining to remind you that it is flavored with vanilla.  I am not familar enough with the chemistry of vanilla (would have to consult <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> to see if vanilla is fat or water solable.  Maybe it's the butter in cakes and cookies which absorbs the flavor.... but whatever it is that does it in baked goods is missing here.<br /><br />I suspect that Starbucks released this to combat the rise of Dunkin Donuts coffees.  But to my mind that is like a steak house worrying over all the people who flock to McDonalds.  I am hoping that Starbucks maintains the standards which allow us to look to them for a reliably good cup of coffee.  This is a disappointment from a company which knows good coffee, and which should know better.  It would be a lot better had they packaged the coffee with single serve packets of vanilla sugar.<br /><br />The coffee is ground for drip brewers as is most of their ground coffee.  While it is described as a medium roast, it tastes like a French roast (but not a good one).  Because of the larger grind, I am guessing it can be used with a French press.  I will give that a try to see if the vanilla beans hold up any better, and return to this review forthwith.  It was not terrific brewed in a good drip brewer, which is, how I suspect most people would make pre-ground coffee.

review/summary: raises the bar for scented coffee
review/text: I was very excited to try this. I brewed it 3 ways: vacuum, press, drip.<br /><br />This a relatively fine grind. I'd call it the finest limit of drip coffee. Beyond that, we're getting into espresso territory.<br /><br />Against my better judgement, I tried it in my French Press. The fine particles plug up the steel mesh making the plunger difficult to press. The finer particles got into the brew. There was a very thick sludge at the bottom of the cup. Flavor-wise, it was intense but not bad. There was a slight bitter taste and a silky texture which I suspect was from the dust in suspension. So I ran it through a cone filter. The resulting brew was still intense but lost all of the vanilla aroma. The texture was too thin. It basically became a better than average cup of "diner coffee". Easy to drink, dark & tasty, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I expected great results from the vacuum brewer. While brewing, it filled the kitchen with vanilla, but when I tasted the coffee, there was only a hint of it. I don't think it brewed long enough to pick up the vanilla, or maybe it was so hot the vanilla vaporized rather than dissolve. In any case, the final product was only slightly better than the pressed-then-filtered coffee above. Not recommended.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the best results came from my drip machine. I used the freebie Gevalia gave me with membership (yeah, I'm a sucker for free stuff). I'm drinking the stuff now as I write this review and it's exceptional. I only used 2 Tbsp to 6 servings of water and the taste is just about right. It has a rich mouth-feel, a fair amount of vanilla aroma, a robust coffee taste.<br /><br />I've bought and tasted flavored coffees before and have come to the conclusion that most of the manufacturers are just masking cheap, dry, tasteless coffee with deceptively sweet aromas. Those coffees rarely taste like coffee and never taste like the additional flavor, which is why I call them "scented coffee" rather than "flavored coffee". So color me jaded. But the stuff from my drip machine actually TASTES LIKE VANILLA! And maybe my mind is playing tricks on me, but I'm getting a hint of ice-cream too! I'm drinking it black, no sugar so it's pretty fascinating.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: When brewed 2:6 in an average #4 drip coffee-maker, you get a delicious coffee treat with the usual Starbucks buzz to brighten up your work-day.

review/summary: lovely coffee
review/text: Update 12/7/10:  Now my law-enforcement, black coffee, no-frills husband wants me to always get this coffee. It's that good, and the vanilla just sortof creates a smoothness, or fullness that is very satisfying.<br /><br />I normally do not drink flavored coffee, and I don't add any sweetener to my coffee, either. I hate that chemical taste found with those artificially flavored coffees. I tried this because it said it has all natural flavors. They grind up actual vanilla beans and add that to the grounds. You can see them!<br /><br />Smelled amazing!  Wonderful flavor. Not overpowering. The vanilla (& sassparillo) give the coffee a delightful smoothness. Absolutely no artificial, chemical taste. You don't take a sip and say "wow, this is definitely flavored coffee." This will make a perfect after-dinner coffee, excellent in the morning, and any time of day. I'll be getting this again.

Just remember Starbucks is formulated to be mixed with milk. It's really not at it's best when it''s black--with or without vanilla.

review/text: My wife and I love Starbucks coffee, so when had the opportunity to try their vanilla flavor, we took it. Just made a pot of it, and it is fabulous. I used to use sugar in my coffee, but this is perfectly sweet enough as it is. (Less sugar is healthier for you.) The only thing I would suggest is NOT following the directions of 2 tablespoons per 6 oz. of water... we use only 1 and it is plenty strong enough. But I guess that's a personal taste thing. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Milder roast, not bitter, and without any strong smell! Winner!
review/text: I like flavored coffee's but not as much as a good nice light to medium roast blend of just regular ol' Java. I find flavored coffee's to just be a bit too much. In general I actually don't like Starbucks beans that much because I find the coffee bitter with an aftertaste that stays with me for too long - and I get heartburn. Not fun. The key word on this package that got me to try it was Natural.<br /><br />I might be the only one but the biggest problem I have with flavored type coffee is not only the cloying taste but the extremely strong smell. If I want that strong a smell in my house I'll buy candles or spray. Usually, after about a fourth of the cup, I just don't want to drink much more - or smell it. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this coffee carries the trace of smell but it is neither strong nor overpowering. The taste follow suit - this is not a heavy roast and it does not have any bitter aftertaste. I found it exceedingly pleasant and finished the whole cup. In fact I found it so good that I would likely drink it on a regular basis. It is just perfect for me. Amazon's price is good as well. I'm kind of surprising myself by saying there's nothing not to like about this one. Give it a try!

review/text: The smell of coffee is the first step to a great morning.  Right out of the bag you can smell the deep richness of this Starbucks coffee.  The hint of Vanilla just makes it that much more enticing.  I'm sure that there are purists out there that would not hear of drinking a flavored coffee.  But if you are inclined to a subtle bump in flavor that wistfully plays with your taste buds, then you might want to try this coffee.  It is excellent.

review/summary: A very smooth coffee with a subtle flavor
review/text: Full disclosure: I don't generally enjoy Starbucks coffee, mainly because it often tastes bitter at the stores, and I haven't had a flavored coffee in quite a while. For both those reasons, I was pleasantly surprised with this pack of Starbucks Vanilla, which balances the flavor with a mellow, smooth brew. Made in a French press, it's the perfect afternoon shot-in-the-arm, and the vanilla really isn't as over-powering as I expected. From a pricing standpoint, it's well priced for two bags, and I can definitely see myself stocking up for holidays, which seem to be the perfect time of year for flavored coffee.

review/summary: An unfortunate truth about vanilla coffee...
review/text: ...is that it tastes like vanilla coffee. Any richness or flavor inherent in the coffee itself is obliterated by the chemical bite of the fake vanilla. I just don't think there's any way around it. Whether the coffee is decent Starbucks brand (and I'm a Starbucks drinker, admittedly), cheap grocery store brand or some kind of high-end bean, the result is the same: it's always going to taste like something you'd drink for free at a continental breakfast bar at a cut-rate hotel.

review/summary: Unique Real Vanilla Essence, Not Overly Flavored Yet Definite
review/text: I basically gave up "flavored" coffee years ago after a brief love affair with coffee beans laced with chocolate, vanilla, raspberry, gran marnier, etc. But this Vanilla Starbucks is different than the flavored coffees I used to drink. This does taste like a nice, full bodied coffee (and not bitter) with just a subtle hint of real vanilla taste and aroma. It reminds me more of a cup of coffee after adding a shake or two of the real vanilla powder. Its very satisfying. While I still prefer the dark italian roasts this is a real treat and fits perfectly into the holiday season. Excellent!

review/summary: Good if you like flavored coffees - Americano review
review/text: I ordered this to try as a different sort of coffee.<br /><br />My brewing method:<br /><br />I normally make Americano, which is an espresso with extra water. I have always just let my manual espresso machine continue to brew after it's normal double espresso, and the results are very good. I generally use a darker, bolder roast, and since I have tried Starbucks bold roast before, It felt this might make a nice change. This method of brewing really brings out the quality (or lack thereof) in a coffee.<br /><br />The results<br />This coffee makes a lot less "crema", which is what espresso machines put out as a sort of light brown colored foam at the top of the coffee. As to taste, it is (as expected) a lot less bold. My initial thought was that I found the vanilla to be a bit sharp or bitter, but then I'm using an espresso machine, not a french press or brew machine. At the same time, I didn't taste the coffee as much as I might prefer.<br /><br />However, after sipping a bit over half the cup, I find that it is actually a pleasant drink; by the time I emptied my cup, I decided that I will make more of this coffee - as a change of pace, not as my primary flavor or brand. I can taste the vanilla, and a bit of the coffee. Perhaps this means that the blend is very good - if they were aiming for exact balance. I would characterize it as a "vanilla and coffee drink" rather than a "vanilla flavored coffee" because that more accurately describes the overall flavor.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Flavored coffees are a world to themselves - one either likes the concept of putting additional flavor in coffee, or one doesn't - there isn't much in between. For anyone who likes flavored coffees, I think this one would be suitable for daily use. Recommended if you like this sort of combination, but not if one prefers more coffee taste and less vanilla addition.

review/summary: Subtle But High Quality Coffee
review/text: I can't count the times I've bought a flavored coffee, opened the bag and inhaled the incredible aroma only to be disappointed that, once brewed the special "flavor" either isn't detectable or conversely completely overpowers the coffee itself .  Few coffee companies achieve that "happy medium" of providing specialty flavor without compromising the integrity of the coffee itself.<br /><br />Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla is the exception.  This mostly medium roast has an unmistakable but not obnoxious vanilla perfume upon opening.  I was pleased to find that upon tasting, there is indeed a distinct vanilla note to the coffee, but one that is content to stay in the background and compliment rather than dominate.  It is not overly sweet and wears on the palate well over the course of a few cups.<br /><br />I you are the type who doctors your coffee up with flavored sugars and/or creamers the subtleties of this coffee may not matter to you.  But for those who are interested in actually tasting the coffee, this is a good buy.

review/summary: Here's what many aren't understanding about this coffee
review/text: They aren't understanding that the vanilla flavor is *supposed* to be subtle.  If you don't believe me, just read the bag because it states this quite clearly.  I've seen many reviews where the reviewer is dinging the rating because the flavor is subtle and that's not fair in my opinion because that's what Starbucks is trying to accomplish.  And for those who say that there is no vanilla flavor, I strongly disagree.  It's there but it's subtle, which is the entire idea here folks.<br /><br />Along those same likes, I thought I'd compare the subtle flavors of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee to the more pronounced flavors of the Melitta Pariaian Vanilla coffee.  So I brewed two cups and then sampled each side-by-side.  Following are my impressions of each coffee.<br /><br />Cost: While prices change all of the time, as of this writing, Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.59 per ounce.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.58 per ounce.  So in essence, the price is roughly the same between the two.<br /><br />Color/Roast: The color looks about the same between the two.  It's a medium roast or roughly a city roast for those who know what that means.  In the past I've felt as if Starbucks overroasts some of their coffee.  Fortunately, that does not appear to be the case with their Natural Vanilla Coffee.<br /><br />Grind: The grind is also about the same.  Melitta calls it an extra fine grind but both are probably somewhere between a fine grind and an extra fine grind.  I brewed both cups in my Jura S7 espresso machine in the Cafe Americano style, which is basically hot water added to a shot or two of espresso.<br /><br />Aroma in the bag: Starbucks mostly smells like very good quality coffee.  The scent of vanilla is present but subtle.  What vanilla scent is there is reminds one of  fresh and natural ingredients.  The Melitta has more of a pronounced vanilla scent.  The Melitta's scent is pleasant but slightly artificial to my nose.<br /><br />Aroma in the cup: The vanilla scent is very subtle with respect to Starbucks Natural Vanilla.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla has a stronger, but not overpowering scent.  There's more vanilla scent in the Melitta cup to be sure.<br /><br />Flavor: Both coffees are very pleasant, although I'd characterize Starbucks Natural Vanilla as being a very good quality coffee with a subtle hint of vanilla versus Melitta's Parisian Vanilla coffee being a vanilla-flavored coffee, if that makes sense.  While I still like and recommend the Melitta, I think I like it a little bit less now that I've tried the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee.  That's because the Starbucks brew has a fresher and more natural aroma and flavor.  But again, the Starbucks coffee is far more subtle than the Melitta coffee.  For some, that will be a good thing and others will undoubtedly wish for a more forward vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients: The Starbucks Natural Vanilla lists their ingredients as "Ground Coffee, Natural Flavors, Ground Vanilla Beans & Indian Sarsaparilla Root" (with Corn Maltodextrin & Vegetable Glycerin added).  Melitta doesn't tell you what's in their blend.  I visited Melitta's website in an effort to determine what sort of ingredients are used to flavor their Parisian Vanilla.  They use words like "rich" and "smooth and creamy", but nothing more specific that I could find.  So I am going to assume that Starbucks uses ingredients that I would consider to be of a superior quality to the ingredients used to flavor the Melitta Parisian Vanilla.<br /><br />Recommendations: One thing that I like to do is to buy non-flavored beans and simply add a teaspoon or tablespoon of fresh vanilla to a cup of non-flavored beans.  So this is also an option.  If you go this route, use only real vanilla and not the artificial stuff.  Now with respect to these flavored coffees, they're both very good.  Tasting the two coffees side-by-side gave me a good opportunity to compare the two.  While I still like the Melitta Parisian Vanilla, I prefer the subtle character and fresh ingredients of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee.  If you prefer a coffee with a more pronounced but not overpowering vanilla flavor, go with Melitta.  If you prefer a well-balanced coffee with a subtle but fresh and natural vanilla flavor, you might prefer the Starbucks version.  If you're not sure, consider trying each and decide for yourself, as they're not terribly expensive.  But in the end, I do think that they are both very good.

review/summary: Great Coffee with One Caveat ...
review/text: If you enjoy Starbucks coffee, than you already know that this is well worth the money. So buy it! If you are (somehow!) new to the franchise or this specific product, read on ...<br /><br />Now, I'm almost inclined to rate this product as though it didn't read "vanilla." To be perfectly frank, the vanilla taste is nearly undetectable (and I have a fairly sensitive nose and palette). I see that multiple reviewers here have registered similar "complaints." Surely, I think Starbucks would have been wise to label the product as having "a hint of vanilla." So, please know that this is not a true vanilla flavor (just in case you are searching for a brew to compliment a particular dessert or breakfast.)<br /><br />Nonetheless, as far as the standards of coffee, this one has near perfect acidity, a lovely aroma, and bright flavor.<br /><br />If you need a little more sweetness, add raw sugar (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZGU">Sugar In The Raw/Unrefined</a> is a great choice and can be found just about anywhere).<br /><br />Bottom-line: do not buy this coffee expecting a rich vanilla flavor and you'll be fine. Very tasty!<br /><br />Post-script: I saw that a chef noted that Starbucks was not created to drink black. While I never use milk in my coffee, I decided to take this professional's advice. I added some (soy) milk and found that the very slight "bitterness" was entirely gone. (Now I have reinstated the product's missing star!)

Shouldn't it be JUST coffee and whatever flavoring is added?<br /><br />Way to go Starbucks! 1 star!<br />--- EDIT ---<br /><br />I've tried many different Starbucks coffees, from morning blends to more flavored coffees and not one have I enjoyed or liked.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor in Starbucks Natural Fusions is a joke. When you first open the bag you are hit with this amazing aroma of nice fragrant coffee with a delightful hint of vanilla. When brewing, you completely loose the vanilla smell. And once tasted, the vanilla is GONE. And I don't think I should be expected to have to add something (be it milk, cream, or some other product) to bring out the flavor of the coffee. A good coffee can stand alone straight from the pot.<br /><br />No matter how weak or strong I made it, it had a not so pleasant taste to it. I'm thinking that it had a lot of quakers in it before the coffee was ground, thus this odd taste was present.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality is the look and design of the bag, initial smell, and the fact that it gives me my caffeine for the day, even if I have to chug it.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board Starbucks and come back with a better tasting blend.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Smells great!<br />Didn't get a bitter taste from it (oddly enough).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Didn't taste like vanilla by any stretch.<br />Isn't all that palatable to my or three other peoples taste.<br />Pricey for mediocre coffee.

I love coffee and usually always change what i'm drinking because of the vast variety out there; but I honestly have to say that this is probably the 3rd time in a row i've purchased this particular brand and flavor!

review/summary: If Flavor is Your Choice, Nothing Wrong Here
review/text: Firstly, I do drink a fair amount of coffee during the winter months.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I tend not to drink flavored coffee.  This is ground, flavored coffee.  Starbucks has not previously offered flavored coffees themselves because they know it will contaminate unflavored coffee in a grinder.  They are getting around this by only selling the coffee pre-ground, therefore, no customer will ever request it to be ground.<br /><br />When first opened, the quality is decent despite being pre-ground.  However, I do find, the quality of the product slips away fairly quickly being a ground coffee.<br /><br />Furthermore, again, I am not a particular fan of flavored coffees.  If I need a sweetener or flavor, I'd prefer to add it myself.  Nevertheless, this  vanilla flavored product is not terribly unpleasant.  I was able to enjoy it on a quiet morning or two when I wasn't demanding the very best.<br /><br />If flavored coffees is your thing, you will likely have no problems at all!

review/summary: Good coffee with pretty natural vanilla flavor
review/text: Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of flavored coffees. I generally find them frivolous when I'm feeling generous and a sign of moral weakness when I'm not. In fact, I chose this coffee from Amazon vine by accident, and only finally tried it months later, when I ran out of regular coffee and was desperate. I stored it in the freezer in the meantime, so it would be as fresh as possible and I'd be giving it a fair shake, since ground coffee can lose flavor so quickly.<br /><br />I tried to temper my review to judge this product as someone who doesn't have a moral objection to flavored coffee (no one with my preference would buy it in real life, so it's unfair to judge it by the standards of someone who dislikes flavored coffee), and just rated the overall quality of the coffee and the strength and quality of the vanilla flavor.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black, whether iced or hot.<br /><br />The verdict: I'm still no fan of flavored coffee. But this coffee is good enough, and the vanilla flavor is strong but not cloying. I would definitely tolerate it for the sake of pleasing a guest who liked flavored coffees--which is more than I've ever been able to say for a flavored coffee before (typically, flavoring seems to be a compensation for crappy coffee, not an addition to good coffee). Hot, I found it tolerable (=very good, if I actually wanted vanilla in my coffee). And iced, it was actually verging on pleasant. It has a very faint acrid afternote, almost like chickory coffee, which I think would be dispelled or improved with milk, which most flavored coffee drinkers I know favor anyway.<br /><br />While I still wouldn't drink it on purpose if there was any regular coffee in the house, I didn't find it to be the abomination I expected, and I feel confident that it would be well received by flavored coffee lovers, so I give it 4 stars for quality and strength, and its expected success with people who like this stuff.

review/text: I am no effete coffee genius who can go into the infinite spectrum of points about what makes a coffee good or not so good, but I do appreciate an astounding, wake-me-up twist on an old theme. This isn't it.<br /><br />While achieving everything an adequate coffee should provide, Starbuck's Vanilla Natural Fusions Ground Coffee is just that - adequate coffee. I was not blown away by subtle essences of vanilla; it did smell pretty good while brewing, which I suppose is the aim of coffee in general (one of the Top Ten Smells in the world, IMO, is a good coffee brewing up), but the flavor wasn't any more spectacular than any other coffee on the market. I would categorize it as robust, full-bodied, and - good. Not wow, do-cartwheels, jump-up-and-down...just that - good. Maybe the vanilla essence needs to be a little more noticeable, but for flavored coffee, I prefer Gloria Jean's.

review/text: I don't normally drink coffee on a day to day basis as I like the vanilla flavorings and since I'm cutting down on all things sugar that is usually a no-no. That said, I was thrilled to get a chance to try this via Vine and we brewed a pot at the office this morning. Except for the boss and controller who loathe fru-fru coffee of any kind, everyone else loved it. The smell from the opened package was very pleasant (always my favorite part of the coffee experience). I felt it was a bit bitter black, but after adding some flavored creamer (yes, I did have some), I ended up with a very yummy cuppa joe.<br /><br />This might not be the roast for everyone (and I see from another review there are some rather, ummm, interesting ingredients there) but this was a definite thumbs up from this office gang.

review/text: We all know about Starbucks commitment to the environment and how the beans are responsibly grown and ethically.  How about this particular coffee?  I like plain Starbucks coffee, so what is `vanilla' going to "do" to my coffee taste?<br />I don't like the phrase "flavored ground coffee", but that is what this is.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients:<br /><br />Ground Coffee<br />Corn Maltodextrin<br />Vegetable Glycerin<br />Ground vanilla beans<br />Indian sarsaparilla root<br /><br />Okay, very cool.  How did I like it? The coffee was strong enough to make it worthy. The vanilla taste is somewhere between smell and taste, but not enough of either to really put a mark on it.  If you put sugar in your coffee, you won't need it with this (if you like vanilla).  For a `flavored coffee', it tastes very good.  It's simply a matter of taste and choice.<br /><br />Also, if you bring in your empty bag to Starbucks, they will give you a free coffee.  Isn't that nice?

review/summary: HInt of vanilla, strong roasted flavor
review/text: Starbucks Vanilla Natural Fusions Ground Coffee has just a touch of natural vanilla infused into the coffee.  This results in a subtle vanilla aroma and a *very* subtle tinge of vanilla flavor in the coffee.  Perhaps it's just me, as I've never been able to discern much of the "flavor" in the vast majority of flavored coffees offered in coffee shops or for home brewing.<br /><br />That having been said, this Starbucks variety has a very distinct roasted aroma and makes a powerful cup of coffee.  I personally prefer a stronger roast flavor in my coffee and found this product enjoyable; if you also prefer this style of coffee then Starbucks Vanilla Natural Fusions is certainly worth a try.

review/summary: Pleasant Tasting
review/text: Having lived my entire life in the great state of Louisiana, I've always been partial to local coffee brands such as Community Coffee and Mello Joy.  I try to make a point of buying these local brands for the simple fact that the money stays in Louisiana and both of them taste very good.  To me, Starbucks has always been an overpriced and overhyped brand with a brilliant marketing strategy that put them on the map.  Still, I sometimes visit the local Starbucks for a frappucino or even an Earl Grey latte when I have a bit of extra spending money on hand.<br /><br />I picked up Starbucks' Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, via the Vine program.  I have to admit that it's a very good coffee as far as flavored coffees go.  The scent of the vanilla intertwined with the coffee hits you before you even open the bag, but do not use that as a device of judgement until after you've brewed a few cups of this coffee.<br /><br />As I've already said, the smell of vanilla is strong, but the actual vanilla flavor is very slight.  In fact, the vanilla is very hard to taste at all.<br /><br />I decided to brew this coffee in two separate ways:  1) Per the instructions on the bag (two tablespoons per six ounces of water) and 2) By my normal method (three tablespoons per six ounces of water).<br /><br />After brewing the coffee, I drank each brewed cup in three different ways:  1) black (which is my normal method of drinking coffee), 2) with one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, and 3) with two teaspoons of cream and two teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />What I immediately noticed was that the bag's brewing instructions suited my personal taste best.  My normal brewing method made the coffee stronger (as I like it), but didn't alter the taste at all.<br /><br />When I drank the coffee black in both brewing cases, I noticed almost no difference in the taste, although the coffee's body was a bit heavier in the second brewing method.  The vanilla flavor was miniscule.<br /><br />With one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, I found that the vanilla flavor stood out a bit more, but was still fairly weak.  The overall taste of the coffee was good, though.<br /><br />With two teaspoons of cream and sugar, the vanilla came into its own a bit more, but could not overtake the coffee's taste itself.<br /><br />Overall, this is a coffee drinker's flavored coffee.  If you want a fuller, sweeter vanilla taste and less coffee taste, look elsewhere.  If you only drink flavored coffees as a treat but prefer the taste of medium to dark roast coffee alone, this brew will be right up your alley.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed this coffee, and plan to buy more of it soon.

review/text: For as long as Starbucks has been around and for as long as they have been selling packages of their coffee, it is somewhat suprising that they have not had a vanilla flavored product of this quality before now.  The Natural Fusions vanilla flavored coffee offers coffee drinkers the real thing.  The taste is not artificial and does not seem like an afterthought or an add-in to the coffee itself.  The scent of vanilla is not overpowering and the coffee has an extremely smooth taste to it.  Plus, it is much nicer to brew high quality Starbucks coffee at home and not have to pay the ridiculously high in-store prices for it.  This new Natural Fusions line is a fitting addition to the Starbucks family.

review/summary: Good, but not Too Vanilla-ey
review/text: I enjoy Starbucks coffee very much and I generally like vanilla flavored coffee. This coffee is promising but I found it a little bitter. I drink my coffee strong and perhaps I have brewed it a little stronger than it should be but I found the drink good, but rather bitter. I tried it for several days and still found the bitterness every time. I tried it with less sugar and more sugar and cream and no cream but it was still a little bitter for me no matter what.<br /><br />Starbucks has many good flavored coffees for the holidays, and in general, and I drink them often. This coffee to me, didn't live up to the wonderful flavors I have drank that carry the Starbuck's name. I think the coffee needs a little more of the vanilla flavor unless Fusion means that it's just a hint, and it's a very small hint at that.<br /><br />The coffee itself smells very good and it also smells wonderful when it's brewing, but it lacks a little something that would make it really good. It needs a little more vanilla and less of a bitter taste to live up to the vanilla in the name.

review/text: As an addicted coffee drinker, I love trying out new flavors.  I have, of course, drank Starbucks coffee before, as well as Vanilla flavored coffees.  However, I have not had the two combined together into one coffee.  I can honestly say that I was not disappointed with Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored.  The package is incredibly well sealed and upon opening, the scent is mouth-watering and fresh.<br /><br />The amount used is the same as with any other coffee - 2 TBS per 6 oz of water.  This, of course, can be adjusted for each individual's preference.  The scent is heavenly, as the coffee is brewing and the taste is very robust and holds a light flavor of vanilla.  The vanilla flavoring is a very gentle and light taste, almost a whisper soft hint.  In addition, the taste is not bitter, but smooth and delicious.  I am one who drinks with a bit of sugar and cream, rather than straight black, as well as being rather picky on my coffee, as it bothers my stomach if it is overly acidic.  I had not problems, at all, with this particular coffee.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a full-bodied coffee with a slight hint of a vanilla taste.  This makes for a delicious drink any time of the day.

review/text: I was a bit hesitant to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> because I typically do not like flavored coffees and prefer whole bean coffee which I can grind myself. But for a flavored ground coffee, I suppose this one is OK.<br /><br />The flavor is not bad but the aroma is intoxicating. (I think I prefer the way the coffee smells rather than how it tastes.)  The lightly roasted Latin American arabica coffee beans are flavored with ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root, and the ambiguous "natural flavor" (which also includes corn maltodextrin and vegetable glycerin). The vanilla is highlighted but not overdone.<br /><br />I usually drink my coffee black and without sweetening and for my taste <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>  can stand alone without additional enhancement.<br /><br />The brewing recommendations suggest 2 Tbsp coffee for every 6 fl oz water.  I find that a bit too much and get a smoother, less biting flavor with 1 1/2 Tbsp coffee per 6 fl oz water, but that of course is to my taste.<br /><br />I do wish the coffee could be fair trade and organically grown but Starbucks states on the package that the coffee is "100% Responsibly grown.  Ethically traded."  At least that is something in the right direction.<br /><br />Finally, I noticed a special offer on my package ~ take the empty bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> to a participating Starbucks and receive a free "tall" brewed coffee.

review/summary: A strong coffee that can be made to taste good
review/text: I was very disappointed when I followed instructions making this coffee.  I cut down on the amount called for and the taste was great.  I never like strong coffee so it is up to ones taste.

review/summary: starbucks vanilla coffee
review/text: Starbucks Vanilla flavored coffee has just the right amount of vanilla so as not to overpower the coffee taste. Even my parents, who usually drink Starbucks Breakfast Blend, enjoyed this coffee.

review/text: Great Starbucks coffee taste.  Not the first hint of vanilla.  Very disappointing if you ordered it for the "vanilla fusion".

review/summary: Finally Starbucks Makes Flavors
review/text: I am so excited to see that Starbucks is coming out with flavored coffees!  My family enjoyed this Vanilla Flavored one.  It has a slight vanilla taste.  Add some vanilla creamer and you are set with one yummy drink!  My husband enjoys his coffee black and said he could taste the vanilla and it was nice that it was not so strong and over powering.  We give this coffee our thumbs up!

review/summary: Everyone Loved This
review/text: I am not a coffee drinker so my wife did the testing on this one. She took it to work and made up some and it was gone in a flash with everyone going hey is there any more of that special coffee that was in there????<br /><br />Large group of folks downing it like wild animals. I appears that this is a keeper. Wife loved it too.

review/summary: delicious not overbearing
review/text: Occasionally flavored coffees can either be over the top or not flavored enough.  This is a nice mellow vanilla coffee.  Very pleasant in flavor and aroma, the vanilla does not taste terribly artificial.  The beans are not oily either.  This is a very nice soft vanilla flavor.

review/summary: Smells great, tastes...not so much.
review/text: Right when you open this bag of coffee the amazing vanilla bean smell hits you and you think, "Man, this is gonna be a great cup of coffe!"<br />It smells like very fine whole vanilla beans that you've just split open. Unfortunately, that wonderful smell doesn't transfer to the actual cup of brewed coffee. (For full disclosure, I use a Cuisineart Auto drip) Once in your cup, the vanilla bean taste is way muted and kind of acidic.<br />On the plus side, this coffee comes ground fine, which I like. I wouldn't buy this again.

review/summary: The vanilla's a little TOO vanilla for me.
review/text: Yes, I know. It says "vanilla" and you expect it to taste like vanilla. What am I complaining about? Well, I was sort of expecting it to taste a bit more like coffee with a hint of vanilla, but instead this tastes like a blend of vanilla and coffee, in that order. Some people say they barely taste the vanilla. For me, it was front-and-center. It also had a sort of acid feel in the mouth, like fake vanilla, even though it says it uses real vanilla beans.<br /><br />It's good coffee, though. Quite strong, quite potent, and well-ground, it works in any coffee maker and it doesn't take much to make a nice, strong cup of coffee. It's just not for me. I'd recommend cutting this with another plain coffee, to minimize that strange vanilla flavor.<br /><br />If you like vanilla, you'll probably like it. Me? I think I'd rather just order a mocha.

review/summary: Not much vanilla, dark roasted taste.
review/text: I'll start by saying that I'm not a lover of dark roasted coffees, which is all Starbucks makes.  I find the flavor a bit harsh and bitter.  I prefer a light or medium roast, like Green Mountain coffee.  If you like dark roast however, you will probably like this coffee.  It has the typical dark, rich taste that is the signature of Starbucks.  The vanilla is very subdued.  I think most would have trouble distinguishing this from regular Starbucks coffee once it is brewed.  It does have a slight vanilla aroma however before brewing.

review/summary: Would be better purchased as whole bean
review/text: I love starbucks and who doesn't? I'm glad I was able to try this out but I prefer whole beans and I think it just adds that extra body of flavor. The Vanilla is is there unlike a lot of coffee that says it's vanilla, while it is not overpowering it's perfect, add a little cream and delich! The aroma is also great. This is one of the better Starbucks coffee I have had, BUT I really like vanilla flavors :)

review/summary: If It's Starbucks, Doesn't It Have To Be Good?
review/text: Starbucks has created Infused coffee with natural flavors added into the coffee. The first thing that I noticed is that the coffee smelled like normal coffee with a hint of vanilla in it. Usually what I open a bag of flavored coffee, there is the over powering scent of whatever flavor coffee it is. When I brewed it, it was the same thing, just a hint of vanilla.<br /><br />Just like the smell, the coffee tasted the same way. It was a good, smooth coffee with just enough vanilla to make it interesting without over powering. I recommend this to anyone that likes coffee. Was a great change from regular coffee!!<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.

review/summary: Not A "Starbucks" Junkie But I LOVED This Premium Coffee!
review/text: First of all, I brew a lot of teas and coffees at home.  I grind my own coffee beans, have my own herb garden and use loose leaf teas 95% of the time.  I live in a rural area that doesn't have a Starbucks on every corner.  I have to travel 35 miles to the nearest Starbucks and even then I am loathe to spend $5.00 for a cup of coffee, Starbucks brand or not.<br /><br />However, I thought this coffee was some of the best ground and flavored coffee that I had ever brewed at home.  I LOVE vanilla and when you open the package you can even SEE the ground vanilla bean in the coffee.<br /><br />The coffee was very smooth and sweet and I just really loved the REAL ORGANIC vanilla taste.  When reading some of the other reviews, people said they couldn't taste or smell the vanilla in this coffee.  That's because most people are used to artificial vanilla flavorings or vanilla extracts (i.e. alcohol based) instead of whole bean vanilla.<br /><br />This coffee also has Indian Sarsaparilla Root as an ingredient. Sarsaparilla root comes from the sarsaparilla plant, a woody-climbing vine that grows in South America, the West Indies, Mexico and other tropical parts of the world. Sarsaparilla root has a pleasant fragrance and a spicy sweet taste that pairs well with the coffee bean used and the vanilla bean.<br /><br />All in all this coffee makes a lovely "cuppa" and I would DEFINITELY buy this coffee and serve it again!<br /><br />Happy Brewing!
