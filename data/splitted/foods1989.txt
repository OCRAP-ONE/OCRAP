review/summary: Tasty, but not that useful for me
review/text: These are really tasty, and make a decent snack, but I've found that they aren't that helpful for running. When I'm doing a long run (10+ miles), they are too sweet, and leave my mouth feeling weird. I had also thought I was ordering the version w/ caffeine, but... appears not (mea culpa). Anyway, lastly, don't seem to give my system much of a boost, so... these go into the snack pile, but I'll not be using them for endurance sports.

review/summary: Awesome Recovery Tools
review/text: I had my reservations about this product when I first saw this product.  But being a big fan of Jelly Belly I had to try them.  I've used this product off and on for two years now.  I has helped me recover from training sessions.  Long runs, cross fit sessions, and field exercises that would have left me dehydrated for the day just become "fond" memories after taking one of these packs.  I do not recommend eating these Jelly Bellies unless your body needs the electrolytes, they taste too sweet and salty.

review/text: These are not just ordinary jelly beans (I know, I tried comparing). They are just the right amount to provide an energy boost, whether it be first thing in the morning, mid-afternoon to fight off food-coma (or meeting malaise), or even as a snack before dinner. I first started using them to supplement on the train to or from nighttime grad classes. They're also handy to have on hand between sets, quarters, or whatever your sporting needs might be. Quite tasty, too.

review/summary: So delicious, don't let the color scare you
review/text: This pasta is just plain delicious, and I love knowing it is GMO free. Note that a 2 oz. serving has a whopping 9 grams of protein. The simple genetic make-up of einkorn wheat makes it easily digested, even though it is not gluten free. No belly bloat from this pasta!  Einkorn grain has a reddish hue, making the pasta appear somewhat purple, but it cooks up smooth and tastes very similar to regular white pasta.  Not grainy like many whole-wheat pastas.  Holds up well in recipes without turning to mush.

review/text: This pasta is made from Einkorn wheat, an ancient grain which has more protein and less carbs.  That in addition to the fact that it is whole wheat makes it a healthy past product that also happens to taste great.  Although more expensive than most pasta, the price is also good relative to what you will have to pay for it if you buy it at Whole Foods for at least $1 more per package.  If you use the auto ship feature, you save even more money.

review/summary: No bitter taste!
review/text: I had tried whole wheat pastas in the past and was always put off by the bitter taste that overwhelmed any sauce, and the grainy texture.  So it was with some trepidation that I bought the jovial einkorn fusilli.  It required a minute or so less cooking time than indicated, but the flavor was smooth, without a hint of bitterness!  Texture was just a tad less smooth than white pasta.  My usual pairing of the pasta swimming in tomato bisque soup was a tasty success!  It has more protein and double the fiber of semolina durum pasta, and a nice vitamin/mineral profile.  It's a winner!

review/summary: GREAT  FOOD FOR MY WONDERFUL TNR PROGRAM
review/text: Awhile back I decided to set an example and fix 80 cats in my neighborhood. At first the feeding cleaning and care of all those cats was overwhelming and very expensive. A few years into the program I thought I might have to stop due to health and old age, but I was shopping on Amazon and saw cat food. WOW, There it was pages of Friskies canned catfood on sale and shipped using SUPER SAVER. I now have 60 cats and adore the great karma they put out. Thanks to Amazon I get wonderful prices and don't have to lug hundreds of pounds of food home each week.If you are taking care of ferals or have only one indoor kitty you MUST check out the huge range of flavors and friskie products in the grocery section of Amazon you will be delightfully surprised :-)

review/summary: Good and affordable cat food
review/text: One of my cat got very sick few months ago and had surgery. $1800 later he came back home very weak and skinny and of course no appetite. My vet recommended us to spoil him and give him whatever he likes and would eat. I tried all the cat food brand available at Amazon.com, even the most expensive, and finally "Friskies" was the favorite to my dear Wicket. Since this ordeal Wicket became very spoiled. He will eat only Friskies but also only fresly opened can. Good that we have another cat and two dogs, so we can recycle.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: Revised: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) Water sufficient for processing, fish, poultry, meat by-products, wheat gluten. How disgusting is that?! "Fish" and "poultry"?? Not really sure how that can be counted as an ingredient...not "tuna" or "salmon" but "fish." Not "chicken" or "turkey" but "poultry." If it was a decent quality meat- they wouldn't feel the need to hide behind ambiguous terms. Then there's the by-product which is the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, pure, meat, and there just isn't real identifiable meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or ambiguous "meats".

review/text: I enjoyed this product more than any other hemp breakfast due to the additional ingredients which bring forth the exceptional taste., i.e., the apple and cinnamon among other nuts and spices.  This is and will be the only Chia product I will purchase, unless something more exciting and nutritious comes along.

review/summary: Amazon Kuhne Salata Order
review/text: I was so happy that someone chose to sell this favorite Kuhne Salata - Seasoned Vinegar Dressing at Amazon online!!! My husband and I were once stationed in Germany with the U.S. Army.  We tried this wonderful dressing while there. Upon returning to the U.S.A., I couldn't find it anywhere except at our military commissary and quickly bought two bottles. That was many many years ago and we are not near a military base where we live right now. A dear neighbor in another state who is the German wife of a deceased retired military soldier went to her commissary to find it for me and then sent me two bottles of a different brand of German vinegar dressing after not being able to find my Kuhne Salata. It was not my favored Kuhne Salata although I did not tell her that it wasn't not wanting to hurt her feelings. So, it was after that delivery that I went on the internet to find my Kuhne Salata and this Amazon seller actually had it for sale at a very reasonable price!  Even the delivery was ahead of the predicted time arriving faster than expected! Since it was a glass bottle, he or she did an excellent job packing it and a tag was attached saying "Fragile".  Would definitely recommend this Amazon seller!!!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />A very satisfied customer!!! FIVE STARS!!!

review/summary: Perfect vinegar for veggies
review/text: My German hubby introduced me to this vinegar. It's now a staple in our house. We used to have to drive to a German community north of us to find a grocer who carries it. When we make sauerkraut, I rinse it 3 times to remove the highly acidic vinegar they pack the stuff in stateside, then start with my seasoned base, add the kraut, and 2 Tbsp Salata, plus a bit of champagne or sweet white wine if I have it on hand. Perfect kraut every time. Another way to use it is to dice some fresh tomatoes, julienne some sweet onions, add some salt and whatever fresh herbs you have on hand (dill, thyme, basil, parsley, etc.), pour about 1/4 cup Salata over it and let it sit in the fridge for about 3 hours. Delicious side dish.  Salata also works well to add the kick to coleslaw, a cold bean salad, etc.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Wish I could get it on Amazon Subscribe & Save!

review/summary: Salata....Delightfully delicious!
review/text: This is the best seasoned vinegar ever! Light, tasty, wonderful for salads. To make my salad dressing, I use 2 Tbsp Salata vinegar, I add a little water(maybe not quite 1 Tbsp), a little(approx 1/4 tsp)freshly ground pepper (I use McCormick Steakhouse Seasoning grinder - coarse grind), a little salt (approx 1/4 tsp), a little (1/4-1/2 tsp) fresh (minced) dill if in season, and a little oil (maybe 1/4 -1/3 cup). Wonderful with a spring side salad of just greens (I usually use romaine) and some green onion and occasionally add fresh sugar snap peas when in season.  Toss the dressing with the salad just before serving. Easy and delicious! I wish I could find it in stores - 3 stores in Columbus, Ohio used to carry it - now, none of them do. So sad.

Saw that Crystal Light had a green tea with a peach/mango combo so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I looked around at my local retail stores, but could ONLY find it available in the packets used in the 16 oz. bottles, gave them a shot to see if I liked it....BOY OH BOY, did I LIKE IT! But, unfortunately I could<br />not find the 10 quart size ANYWHERE. So checked around here on Amazon and low and behold, here is Peach/Mango GREEN TEA!!! This has everything you're gonna want in your antioxidant/metabolism boosting regimen and the TASTE: Superb, very potent peach with the aftertaste of the mango, IGNORE ANY reviews that say there is a bad aftertaste.....this stuff is TOP NOTCH!! I drink about 2 to 3 quarts a day, can't get enough! With super saver shipping from Amazon, you're paying about THE SAME that you would pay retail. What more could you want???

review/text: I cannot taste the green tea.  When I tried my first sip I thought I tasted something that seemed like green tea but it was quickly and abruptly interrupted by peach/mango... I have never seen or heard (or tasted) that hint of green tea again.<br /><br />I usually make 4 quarts at a time (two of the packs) but found the tea was just too sweet.  I tried one pack and 3 quarts and that seems to be the happy medium.  tastes like tea, a little sweet but not overpowering.<br /><br />With the recommended mixing I felt that I needed to drink something else right after drinking a glass of this tea just to wash down the sweetness of it.  Forget drinking this to quench a thirst, I just felt more thirsty.<br /><br />My suggestion if you find the tea to be too sweet, add more water, it helps.

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: There are several listing on Amazon for "Hormel Bacon Bits" or "Hormel Crumbled Bacon", sometimes accompanied with the adjectives or descriptive phrases "Real", "Premium", "with Picnic Ham, "30% less fat", or "50% less fat"; at prices between $11 and over $42 per 20oz bag.  In fact, these are all the same product,  "HORMEL REAL CRUMBLED BACON";"50% LESS FAT".  The phrase "30% less fat" and the white or the dominantly light gold packaging are just photos of old packaging---not a current product.  Over the past year, I've ordered this product from at least 3 different Amazon merchants, and regardless of their description, I've ALWAYS recieved "HORMEL REAL CRUMBLED BACON; "50% LESS FAT" in the darker gold packaging.  So, don't worry about the "varieties", there are no "varieties"---there is just a single product.  You'd think that for $42 you are getting a better product (or a larger package) than for $11, but in fact, it is exactly the same product and size.<br /><br />This is NOT "crumbled bacon", or bacon-flavored "bits" for salads---although it is terrific in salads.<br /><br />Think "chipped dry smoked ham".  This stuff is obviously the "sawdust", and small left-over peices, from slicing quality smoked ham for pre-packaged lunchmeat, etc. Some of the "chips" are pretty big, up to 1/2 inch. Being ham rather than bacon, it is genuinely "less fat" than bacon.<br /><br />I mostly use the chipped ham in omlettes, for which it is wonderful.<br /><br />Caution:  The ham chips are pretty salty, so always add them BEFORE adding any additional salt.<br /><br />Enough of the ham chips are large enough that you can use it to convert potato soup to "potato and ham soup", or as a very tasty addition to any vegetable soup. Mix a quarter cup of ham chips, half an onion (finely diced), (optionally) half a carrot (diced) and a can of sweet peas, cook on low for a half-hour and you've got great "ham and split pea soup".<br /><br />You can cook the ham chips with rice for great "ham and rice". You can spread mayo on a slice of bread and add a layer of ham chips for a terrific ham sandwich. Or make a fabulous "grilled-cheese and ham" sandwich. Mix with cream cheese for a great spread, or dilute with a little milk for a great dip.<br /><br />My Southern grandmother added "seasoning" to all vegetable dishes, from collards to squash to lima beans. What she meant by "seasoning" was a slice of "fat back" (thick mostly-fat bacon). And I must admit, her vegies were wonderful. You can accomplish the same thing (in a much more healthy way) with a teaspoon of ham chips and a couple tablespoons of good olive oil. I often add a tablespoon or so to "stir-fry" dishes---even those which feature chicken or beef---the ham flavor goes unnoticed, but pops up the flavor of everything else.<br /><br />The potential uses are almost limitless. Considering that the price of real smoked ham (which isn't half pumped-in water) often exceeds $35 per pound, $16 (the price at the time of this writing) is a good deal for 20oz.<br /><br />Since this is dry ham---it keeps very well in the frig, no need to freeze it in normal situations.  In my house a 20 oz package never lasts more than 2-3 weeks.  Because it keeps so well (and is so tasty that open packages don't last long), there is no need to buy it in the smaller 4 oz packages---except perhaps for camping or emergency food.

review/summary: Way over-priced...
review/text: I haven't used this particular shipment yet, but have used this product in the past, I used to purchase it regularly from a 'club' type store. When I saw this, it was several dollars more than I paid for it before, but I assumed the price had simply increased. However, while shopping yesterday at the local (non-member) big-box store, I happened across this product and found that not only does the local grocery carry it now, but ounce for ounce, it was cheaper-- whether in the large 20oz. pkg, or the smaller size packaging. I wish I'd known this, as I'd have gotten several smaller packages for less expense, and would not have to open all the product at once.<br /><br />I do like the product, it's great for seasoning vegetables, adding to salads, or as a quick addition to omelettes; I just don't like being overcharged. I'll buy it at the local grocery next time.

review/text: I love the taste of this product, but am disappointed that it is so finely ground.  When I think of crumbled bacon, I think of small pieces.  The bag I received is so finely ground it looks like bacon "saw dust".  It adds a lot of bacon flavor, but requires no chewing at all.  If the crumbles were bigger, this would be a five star product in my book.

review/text: My little one, a super small Pom, loves these!  We first discovered these at the Pet Feed Store.  They last her a long time and keep her occupied when I absolutely need her to be still and quiet!  However, this batch I ordered from Amazon just didn't have the same quality.  They were so dried out and hollow in places, like they were old stock or something.  I can't tell you exactly what the difference is, but there is one!  So much for getting a bargain!  I'd rather pay more and get ones that aren't so old and already deteriorating.

review/summary: Great Flavor and Heat - Highly Recommended!
review/text: Huy Fong "Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce" is offered in just about every Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in my area, and with good reason! Unlike at lot of hot sauces, this has a great chili pepper and garlic flavor that compliments most of the dishes I like (particularly good on Pork Lo-Mein) and also provides a good amount of spicy heat. This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the borderline for several of my friend.<br /><br />This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out doesn't have enough "zing". It is also great to spread on chicken when grilling but watch the smoke when opening the grill lid, it is like OC spray if it gets into your eyes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br /><br />CFH

Sure, the imported treats are very cheap, but ones that are stamped A Product of China or Made In China, Taiwan, etc., should be avoided at any and all cost. The spoiled meats cause liver and kidney failure and are deadly because they are poison. Period.

Each one lasts my Rhodesian Ridgeback about 20 minutes.  I guess they're kinda smelly, but it doesn't really bother me, as long as she's happy and busy!

review/summary: These changed drastically! My dogs have lost a favorite treat.
review/text: I'm certainly no expert on the anatomy of cows. Nor are my dogs. But everyone noticed when suddenly our long-time favorites, Cadet's Beef Tendons, definitely changed. For the worse. We don't buy them anymore - whatever they are now.<br /><br />For over a year, I would order a new 1 pound bag about every six weeks. We have a Papillion-mix and two purebred Dachshunds, who are insanely hardworking chewers. Obsessive, possessive, and picky, too. Well, with those three and the frequent visits of the extended family's dogs, those tendons were hugely popular and went fast.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm no expert, but I can describe what we used to get: long, thick, chewy but tough, slightly moist, meaty, rope-like things, with occasional shapes that definitely resembled my limited understanding of tendons. I even have some experience with beef shin tendons, having also frequently purchased Butcher's Block "Grand Royale" beef shins for my girls. Those came complete with the tendons, which I carefully remove with a knife to create two treats out of one.<br /><br />So a few months ago, the much-anticipated regular delivery of "tendons" arrived, we were stumped to find flat, dry slabs with sharp edges that look like old jerky. They look NOTHING like the old beef tendons. And my dogs completely ignored them. I though it was a fluke. After two more orders of the same things, I gave up.<br /><br />I can't say what part of the cow the "new" "beef tendons" are, but I can say that my dogs can't stand whatever they are now, and we no longer purchase anything from Cadet.<br /><br />I'm awfully disappointed - those original tendons would keep my frauleins happy and distracted from picking fights with the mademoiselle for hours. So far, we've found nothing nearly as good.<br /><br />TL;DR BREAKDOWN:<br /><br />Product went from:<br /><br />- Thick, meaty, chewy, semi-moist, ropey, treats my dogs chewed for hours, even days<br /><br />to<br /><br />- flat, stringy, sharp-edged, dried-out slabs that look nothing like the previous treats, and my dogs won't touch 'em<br /><br />What happened?<br /><br /> For a pretty good replacement I recommend Butcher's Block "Grand Royale" real beef shins for dogs, but do be a wise consumer and price-check, for you might be amazed at the difference between vendors. Also, fyi, they're messier and more . . . livestock-like, but if your dogs loved the old Cadet tendons, they'll probably like the Grand Royale. Mine do. But we miss the easy-peasy big bag of Cadet tendons. :(<br /><br />If they change back, somebody please let me know!!

The choking episode went on for 15 minutes and ended only when she vomited her entire stomach contents. it was very frightening.

I, however, am thanking my lucky stars I have an airproof tin tub to store these treats in.  The strips are also irregularly sized and shaped.  Again, the dog doesn't seem to mind, but, given the smell, I would prefer not to have to poke thru the bag looking for a large piece when I want to keep the dog occupied for a while.  I assume the dog would give these a five star rating; I give them only a three.

review/text: I don't understand how dogs can chew on these stinky things...but...he does and loves it.  My vet tells me the Beef Tendons help keep the teeth clean too.  The price, when compared to the single tendons you buy at a pet shop, is terrific value for the 1lb bag.

review/text: A little pricey, but the dogs love these and they last longer than other bones.  Much less expensive than buying locally at stores

review/summary: My dog seems to like it but . . .
review/text: I cut it up into smaller pieces for my terrier. She really seemed to go for the treat but after about 2 weeks, I think it's what's making her vomit. She is fine on the days I don't give it to her, but the handful of times I did, sure enough, the same day or next day, she would throw up.<br /><br />I'm returning the product. Also, it smells pretty bad. I'll stick to piggy slivers.
