review/summary: First cooked oatmeal that I've ever liked
review/text: I'm going to sound like a broken record, but this oatmeal is great.  I have always shivered at the thought of cooked oatmeal because I just find cooked Quaker oats to be nauseating (love them in cookies, but not cooked by themselves).  My parents eat oatmeal all of the time, but I just couldn't stomach the thought of it.  However, this stuff was part of a promotion, and people wrote that it doesn't taste like Quaker, so I gave it a shot.  I'm so glad that I did, because they are right!  This stuff is fantastic.  To me, it's texture and taste are soooo much better than what I've had in the past.  Like the reviewer before me, I added some agave nectar and really liked the combination.<br /><br />All four of my tins arrived crushed, and I mean crushed.  However, Amazon very promptly filled another order of them for me as a replacement.  Another example of excellent service by Amazon!

review/summary: No better breakfast, no better oatmeal
review/text: I use the 30 minute method.  My routine:  put the water on to boil, brush teeth, put the oats in the boiling water, stir, lower heat to almost low, shower, blow hair dry, start coffee, stir oats, dress, put the oats in a bowl, put cold water in the pan, eat the oats and drink the coffee, wash the bowl and pan.  These oats are SO good, you don't need to add ANYTHING, not salt, not dairy, not spice, not fruit, not nuts.  Eat slowly, savor each bite.  Your taste buds will love you, your tummy will love you, your gut will love you, your heart will love you.

review/summary: Good Stuff in a handy can
review/text: The oatmeal is super.  The can is quite handy when empty for a variety of things.  We cook it for about twenty minutes which is a bit less time than recommended, but the crunchy feel is, to us, a better one than when cooked for a longer time.  Once you have this you will not be eathing much of the quick oats.

review/text: I am positively lukewarm toward oatmeal the way it is usually prepared: the prepackaged freeze-dried hyper-processed powder steeped for 30 seconds in hot water.  This stuff is different.  It has a deeper taste and an interesting texture.  My sister, after years of singing the praises of steel-cut, finally got me to try it (in a hotel breakfast bar, of all places).  That was last winter, and I've had it every weekend since.

review/summary: My Favorite Oatmeal
review/text: McCann's steel cut oatmeal is the real deal.  Unlike most products which have a plastic or paper container, McCann's still comes in an easy to open tin which a person can use for many things after the oats are long gone.  The oatmeal is not for a person in a hurry as you need almost 30 minutes to prepare.  But the cooked oatmeal is well worth waiting for.  Unlike rolled oatmeal which to me makes a mushy product which I won't eat, steel cut oats actually retain some of their shape after being cooked.  Since I've started eating oatmeal regularly, my total cholesterol has dropped 20 points!  McCann's steel cut oatmeal have a long shelf life, so I'm not afraid of buying a 4-pack or even two 4-packs when they are on special.  I've seen one can go for over $6 in some special food markets.  Enjoy!

review/text: This oatmeal is great. It is a lot more flavorful than typical oatmeal. I heard about it on Oprah and gave it a try from our local store, but paid a lot for it.

review/summary: Taste, Flavor,Time, and Value
review/text: Recently I've substituted steel cut oats for our cereal of choice after years of eating  rolled oats (both regular and quick cook). I've tried McCanns and Country Choice, and since there are many reviews already posted,  I'll slant mine based on Taste (mouth), Flavor (nose), Preparation, and Value.<br /><br />I rate Taste (nutty and chewy) and Flavor (pleasant aroma) a dead heat (5*). I also looked at the Nutrition Labels of McCanns, Country Choice, and Quaker's rolled oats, both regular and instant. List included calories, total fats, carbs, fiber, and protein and all were virtually identical from a nutritional standpoint<br /><br />Preparation. I've cooked all types of oatmeal via stove top but have not used the microwave. However, for the steel cut oats I also used a rice cooker, a Zojirushi model that had the capability for making porridge (this is the setting you want to use for steel cut oats),  and this  model had a timer that could be set in advance to finish cooking at a predetermined time. Although use of the rice cooker still requires a passage of time, actual cooking is automatic,  whereas using the stovetop required at least 25-30 minutes of simmering and close supervision to prevent scorching. (Of course, rolled oats takes less time.)<br /><br />Value: McCann's oats comes in a very attractive and elegant metal container (28 oz) and stresses the fact that it's Irish in origin whereas Country Choice comes in a cardboard container(30 oz) similar to the rolled oats type and boasts the fact that it is home grown (Minnesota) and is certified "organic." It should be noted that McCann also packages its steel cut oats in a cardboard box (16 oz). If you make your purchase via Amazon (current prices) and disregard the shipping expense, the per ounce cost is: McCann's 28 oz container cost 20.6 cents, McCann's 16 oz container cost 19.13 cents, and Country Choice cost 11.27 cents.<br /><br />Since my personal evaluation finds both products even in Taste and Flavor, and both have similar cooking methodologies, my FIVE STAR choice is for the home grown, organic certified Country Choice which also a big budget saver.

review/summary: Fantastic product and price
review/text: This makes the best oatmeal, full of flavor and nutrients. Steel cut oatmeal is not for everyone, including those in my family who are fans of Cream of Wheat. But for those who like to have something with texture, McCann's is excellent: nutty, slightly chewy, and filling enough for a real breakfast that will carry one through to lunch.<br /><br />The cooking time is longer than more processed oats, but those are, well, processed, lacking the nutrition, texture, and flavor of steel cut oats. Others have posted their favorite cooking methods, so one can see that there are several ways to make this faster. I make up a whole batch, which makes four cups, eat one serving fresh and store the rest in the frig. All it takes is 90 seconds in the microwave with a little soy milk, or whatever you prefer, and it's hot and creamy for the fastest breakfast. Great with no sweetener or with one's favorite (brown sugar, real maple syrup, artificial sweetener, honey), with fruit and nuts, with cream, milk, soymilk (in my case), or nothing. It'll stand up to just about anything or, for purists, on its own.<br /><br />I have an Amazon subscription for McCann's steel cut oats, so I've gotten many, many cans of it over the years. A few of them (out of dozens of cans) might have been slightly dented, as a couple of reviewers noted, but only very slightly dented, not more than one might find in the grocery store. The can is solid and has a sealed inner lining, which has always been intact. I've never had one taste stale, as one reviewer mentioned, and I've stocked up on the stuff and had it around for many months. Others have written about the nutritional reasons to go for steel cut oats, and Amazon's prices are great, several dollars cheaper than I can get it in my small town. Plus, it is gluten free, for those with this dietary concern.

review/summary: I cannot say enough good things about this stuff
review/text: I first heard about steel cut oats on the Oprah show about its health benefits.  First of all I DO NOT like regular oatmeal like you buy in the grocery store.  I don't like the slimy texture.  But I figured I'd try steel cut oats and I'm glad I did.  They are delicous and very good for you!  The warm nutty aroma when they are cooking is very appetizing.  I add a little bit of sugar or splenda and some cinnimon, it tastes fantastic!  I also sometimes skip the cinnimon and add a tablespoon of granola and/or some dried berries.  Excellent healthy breakfast.<br /><br />Normally these take about 30 minutes to cook on the stovetop.  I found a way to cut the cooking time in half.  Take 1/3 cup of oats, and 1 1/3 cup of water and put it in a large microwavable bowl.  Cook in the microwave on High for 5 minutes, stir, then another 5 minutes, then stir again, and then cook about another 2-3 minutes until the texture is just the way you like it.<br /><br />For those of you who are asking what the difference is between regular oatmeal and steel cut oatmeal:<br /><br />-Steel-Cut Oats are whole grain groats (the inner portion of the oat kernel) which have been cut into two or three pieces using steel discs. Golden in color and resembling mini rice particles, they are as nature intended - nothing added and nothing taken out.<br /><br />-Rolled oats are flake oats that have been steamed, rolled, re-steamed and toasted. Due to all of this additional processing they have lost some of their natural taste, goodness and texture.

You must cook this oatmeal for half an hour, so put it on before your shower. You can eat it plain if you make it thin, or you can add cream, half-and-half, whole milk, or 2% milk to thin it a bit. I also like it with a dollop of plain yogurt. Sweeten it with brown sugar or raw sugar, or just add dried fruit (dates and figs are my favorites - dried cherries are good also). Goes well also with a sprinkle of walnut pieces. But here is the best way to eat it -- better than dessert:<br /><br />Sweeten cooked oatmeal slightly with a modest amount of brown sugar, add just enough half-and-half to wet it thoroughly, and then add a healthy serving of fresh blueberries. Now THAT is some breakfast.

review/summary: "Al Dente" Oatmeal
review/text: Steel cut oatmeal has a grainy, hearty texture that's more like al dente pasta than mush.  American grown varieties often have a gelatinous texture between the grains.  The Irish grown oatmeal is firm and nutty through and through.<br /><br />My electric range cooks the oatmeal in about 25 minutes.  I use a straight-edged spatula to keep the oatmeal from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Avoid over-stirring to keep that nice, firm texture.<br /><br />More good news: Steel-cut oatmeal, like chili or stew, is better on the second day.  Pour your leftovers into a bowl, lay plastic film directly on the surface of the oatmeal, and store in the 'fridge.  Reheat in the microwave with a spoonful of water for a minute or two.<br /><br />Genuine maple syrup is the best sweetener for oatmeal, in my opinion.  Add diced apples or raisins or bananas, with a little milk, and you've got yourself a bowlful of breakfast!

However, there is a slight stale smell when opening each can and if you eat them without brown sugar or honey you can taste that staleness. I would not buy them from amazon again as it seems they were kept around too long. You can get them for $5 a can at Trader Joe's I noticed today.

review/summary: This is the Best
review/text: McCann's (in the tin)  is nothing like the tasteless mush that passes for oatmeal in the U.S.. True, it does take 25 minutes and sometimes you need to fool with the water amount and/or the flame until you figure out what to do to get it exactly as you like -- too high a flame, for example, does away with the water before the oatmeal is completely cooked, but remember you don't want it to cook so long that the special consistency is lost. I've cooked it for years but even so when I took a can to our country place where we have a propane gas stove, it was as though I'd never made it before. However, the finished product is  well worth the time. Even unadorned or  with just a bit of grated nutmeg, it has a satisfying crunch and slightly nutty taste. My husband, based on bad childhood oatmeal memories, initially turned up his nose at the thought of eating oatmeal; he likes it so much he makes it for himself several times a week. Two of our younger grandkids accustomed to starting the day with cold commercial cereal ask for the "special" oatmeal when they visit. Additionally, it's substantial; a  serving at breakfast easily holds you till lunch time. PLEASE NOTE -- what I've written refers only to McCann's in the tin; I've never tried the flakes.

review/summary: These Oats are Not For Sowing...
review/text: They're for eating, of course (ok, maybe if you're an oat farmer, you have a different persepctive.)  At any rate, rather than argue the relative virtues of rolled vs. steel cut oat cereals, I sing the praises of both.  Maybe it's a seasonal thing, the somewhat coarser, nuttier, rougher steel cuts somehow more fitting to cold winters than are the mellower and softer rolled oats.  It's like black coffee to an au lait, dark beer to light, hard bebop to cool jazz...you get the picture.<br /><br />You'll also feel virtuous spending some old-fashioned time over the stove (albeit not that much, or that arduous).  The warming experience is itself sufficient, you'll feel like mending a fence somewhere (or tearing it down if in a RObert Frost frame of mind), but it's common to top this<br /><br />with contrasting fruit, or perhaps nuts, syrups, flax seed oil, brown sugar, yoghurt, raisins, prunes, lat night's stew?--it's HEARTY enough to stand up to almost anything you can throw at it.  Your doctor will probably extol the nutritional benefits: Fiber, protein, certain vitamins, etc.  McCann's is the best of the bunch, and yes, that is a can that belongs in the Smithsonian--or its Irish equivalent. Hebridean soul food.

review/summary: A fine bowl of porridge
review/text: McCann's is "just" oatmeal, but it's perhaps the best oatmeal widely available in the United States.  It's made from nothing but 100% whole grain oat kernels which are grown in Ireland and cut in a device similar to a burmill.  The cutting technique provides a much firmer and more complex texture than the rolling which is used on commoditized oatmeal products available in the U.S.  This is not an "instant" or "quick" oat product, and these oats have not been precooked at all.<br /><br />What this means is that McCann's Traditional makes a great bowl of porridge with a fresh grain flavor and an al dente consistency.  This is oatmeal with a natural crunch and tang to it.  Rolled oats -- especially instant, sugar-added, flavored rolled oats -- don't come close.<br /><br />The obverse of this is that you are actually cooking these grains rather than merely heating and stirring a pre-cooked product.  Be prepared to spend some time -- a half hour or so -- in your kitchen  watching over these and stirring them with your spurtle (porridge-stirring spoon).  Consider this a luxury, an excuse to slow down for a while.  You can find cooking ideas and great recipes at goldenspurtle dot com, which is the home page for the world porridge-making championships.  Specialty porridges, made with fresh fruits, liqueurs, and cream sauces, make distinctive desserts if you really want to get creative.<br /><br />A few more things: these oats are kosher, the can looks sharp, and they make great cookies.

review/text: SHIPPING<br /><br />As was stated by many others, the shipping for this product is too hard on the cans.  Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged.  One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side.  The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top.  I never buy cans like those at the supermarket.<br /><br />COOKING<br /><br />The cooking went much better than I expected.  The evening before, I put 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan.  I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove.  I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred.  I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed.  In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking.  I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it.<br /><br />EATING<br /><br />These oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were "nuttier" in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts.  The texture was of course firmer.  I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture.  Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the "slime" feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough.<br /><br />NUTRITION<br /><br />I found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container.  I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions.  There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill.<br /><br />REPEAT PURCHASE<br /><br />Now that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future.  The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus.  However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost.

review/summary: THE Best !
review/text: The winter of 2006 found me searching for food items in this price range to add to my order, so I could advantage of a "Special" that Amazon was offering.<br /><br />When I came upon these, I decided that they would make nice additions to Christmas gifts as the tins are so attractive.  Upon receipt of the order, one of the tins was dented.  I decided to go ahead and open the dented tin, since it wasn't pretty enough to be a gift.<br /><br />The prepared cereal from that dented tin was so delicious that I ended up giving only 1 tin away - I kept the others for ME!  I gave that tin to my Sister.  After my Sister tried it she immediately tossed the oatmeal she had on hand, and placed a double order for this!<br /><br />This oatmeal is full of flavor, has a great chewy texture, and is so filling.  It is also much more nutritious than rolled oats.<br /><br />I can't believe how we (in the USA) have had only "rolled oats" on our breakfast tables!  Where has this oatmeal been?  What do the US companies do with the good stuff they remove to be able to roll the oats?  This real oatmeal is nothing like the gooey stuff we were forced to eat as children, and as adults eat to try to lower our cholesterol.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself (and your friends and family) to place an order.  I guarantee you'll never go back to the guy with the funny hat!

review/summary: All cans are dented
review/text: As another buyer mentioned here on Amazon, all four cans arrived with major dents. It seems they are getting rid of dented cans by shipping them sight-unseen to internet consumers. Bad tactic. I'll never buy from these guys again. I could have bought a large sack of 10 lbs of steel-cut oats for about half-price ($11) but the reason I bought this product for $22 is I WANTED TO HAVE THE CANS.

review/summary: Excellent, but over priced
review/text: I completely agree with everyone else that steel cut oatmeal is the ultimate low calorie healthy breakfast.<br /><br />But McCann's oats are overpriced.<br /><br />Steel cut oats are not unique to McCann (though their oats are grown in Ireland); many other food companies sell them. Despite the location of where the oats are grown, the taste is identical and the nutrition facts are virtually the same.<br /><br />McCann's oats are by far the most expensive. Even after Amazon's subscriber discount, Whole Foods store brand steel cut oats, for example, are several dollars cheaper (grown in America and organic). The only difference in nutrition data is that the Whole Foods brand is insignificantly higher in calories from fat as well as fiber, protein and iron. No doubt some of the price differential has merely to do with the tin can and transporting the oats across the Atlantic.<br /><br />So if you want to save several dollars, look at other brands of of steel cut oatmeal.

The expiry date for all cans is March 2012.<br /><br />Apart from that, I am completely satisifed with the quality of this oatmeal and the delivery time.

review/summary: You must have this to make goetta!
review/text: There are a couple of brands of steel-cut oatmeal around but the fact is, it's the single integral ingredient in making goetta, (pronounced "GET-ta).<br /><br />Goetta is a dish mostly of the Cincinnati, Ohio region where it was originally popularized in the United States. (Cincinnati is a very German city, originally called "Porkopolis" for the numerous slaughterhouses and sausage-makers located there.) Goetta is a sort of loaf-type scrapple, utilizing sausage, ground beef and other meats for a base. Some pals of mine often make it up, using organ meat from deer that they harvest.<br /><br />I cannot assert that goetta is a huge favorite of mine but I occasionally imbibe in the sausage-type which is okay. It takes a great deal of time and trouble to make but when it's finished, you cut slices from a loaf of goetta, fry them in a bit of cooking oil or in a great knob of melted butter, and then pour pancake syrup over it, or, if you're a Hillbilly like me, good sorghum molasses. Most generally, I serve it alongside eggs-over-medium or with scrambled eggs. This dish has somehow become a big item in deer hunting camps and I know guys who will eat it three times a day during hunting excursions.<br /><br />Goetta has a long cooking time which is why regular rolled oats won't work in the recipe. In any case, you won't be making goetta without the steel-cut oats... at least not very good goetta!

review/text: I am really happy with the switch to steel cut oats. I find it to be a much heartier and tastier option over the more common rolled oats. The tradeoff is the cooking. I haven't tried cooking it in my Zojirushi rice cooker on the porridge setting, but I did make a batch in my Fagor pressure cooker, and boy was it GOOD. My last serving prepared I added some of the McCann's Oat Bran toward the end of cooking, too, with a fresh diced apple and some walnuts. I wasn't hungry all day and my glucose levels hardly budged.

review/summary: There Is No Better Oatmeal Around
review/text: I'm biased, I'm Irish and overall I think everything is better if it comes from Ireland.  This includes whiskey, beer and now oatmeal!  The oatmeal, of course, is the healthiest of the three!  I know that Oprah has recommended steel cut oats for their health benefits, and while I'm not big into listening to Oprah it appears she's right on target here.  I started eating these right after a cholesterol test, the doctor wanted to put me on medication and I asked if I could come back and take another test in two weeks.  I changed my diet to include Irish oats for breakfast every morning and in two weeks the doctor said "hey, whatever you're doing just keep it up" as the numbers were much better.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there's nothing that is a miracle here, but they are definitely a healthy choice for breakfast that will leave you better off than sugar filled cereals or bacon and eggs.  The oatmeal's taste is fairly bland, as you'd expect from oatmeal so I like to make mine with cinnamon and raisins or with either a little honey or sweetner added.<br /><br />Amazon has always been a better price than any of our normal grocery stores so it's a great place to get them if you're local club store doesn't carry it!

review/summary: Family loves McCann's Steel Cut
review/text: We all love this oatmeal.  We usually use the overnight method because the time at the stove is less.  We follow the directions with two slight changes:  1)  We add two tablespoons of dark brown sugar, and 2)  We cook for 9-10 minutes the next morning so we get the more 'nutty' texture.  McCann's is hard to find in grocery stores, so we order it this way and it seems to store well in the pantry.  We have purchased this before through Amazon and we recommend this to anyone who likes really good oatmeal.

review/text: What can you say about oatmeal? B-O-R-I-N-G.<br />But also F-I-L-L-I-N-G.<br /><br />A good source of dietary fiber, steel cut oatmeal is more interesting than the mushy Quaker Oats kind. McCann's has sort of a nutty flavor, and the texture is much more palatable. If you're going to eat oatmeal go for the steel cut variety. I've tried another brand, and McCann's is on par. Add some fruit or brown sugar to make it more interesting if you must...<br /><br />FYI - Your local Costco might have something comparable

review/text: McCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal has a very rich flavor. The texture is very "whole grain" and chewy, which you may not like. It requires a lot of chewing. This oatmeal is way too fibrous for me, so I ground it in a coffee grinder, as someone else suggested, which eliminated the flatulence and reduced the cooking time to 5 minutes from 30 minutes while retaining the extremely filling nature of this product and its fantastic flavor. [By the way, it is cheaper at W-M.] Unfortunately, I won't purchase this product again because oat bran cereal tastes just as good and is higher in fiber and requires no grinding.

Steel cut oats take longer to cook than traditional oatmeal, but the result<br />is vastly superior...a chewy nutty hot cereal that tastes great with sugar or (better yet) maple syrup. You can<br />prepare it ahead of time and reheat it for a faster breakfast. It "stays" with you, and you will be much less<br />likely to get the mid morning "hungries" that tempt you to go after that hi-cal donut or muffin between 9:00-10:00am!!!

(More like buckwheat)  It's important that you know it will take longer to cook than your standard oatmeal so if you're looking for a quick breakfast you'll have to cook it up the night before.  I just boil water in a pot and then add in the oatmeal. (As the directions state) It will take about 30 minutes to make with some stirring.  Once it's done cooking I'll add a splash of milk, and brown sugar and it's delicious.  The texture is definitely more firm than the "standard" oatmeal.<br /><br />I took one star off since all of the cans in the 4 pack I bought were dented, two of them pretty badly and they don't easily close.  There is a seal on the inside so this doesn't affect the oatmeal you'll just need to put it in a different container if you want it to stay fresh.<br /><br />Yum!

review/summary: better than rolled oats
review/text: Received these oats and cooked up a pot the next morning.Followed the directions on the can. No problems with cooking them. Good flavor..somewhat of a nutty taste..The cans were all dented though but I don't suppose that affects the taste. I would recommend you trying these even if the taste of rolled oats in your mouth makes you wanna gag..you'll like these. They're different.

review/summary: Best You Can Buy
review/text: My brother turned me on to McCann's steel cut oats about three years ago.  I have a bowl every morning.  I've tried some of the short cuts but I find it best to cook it for 30 - 35 minutes rather than any pre-cook or microwave method.  I use a small rice cooker I bought at Target. It's electric with a 4 cup pan, steamer stage that sits on top of the pan and a glass lid.  I put a spoon through each handle to weight down the steamer stage, otherwise, the boiling oatmeal will push it off the pan. I've also learned to not use the glass lid to keep it from boiling over.  When I get up I start it and it turns off when it's done.  In the meantime I get ready for the day. Best with a real nutty whole grain bread and coffee.  I've tried several other brands and nothing compares.  Amazon's price is cheaper than Walmart.

review/text: McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal was a different experience from any oatmeal I have ever tried. The taste and texture exceeds all others. The cooking time is quite a bit longer than regular oatmeal but if you have the time to devote to the cooking then its well worth it. My suggestion would be if you are a diabetic, try it at least once testing your blood sugar 2 hours after your first bite to see what effect it has on your blood sugar.

review/text: So like a lot of people out there, I love these oats!  I've been eating the standard Quaker oats for a long time but after Amazon had a special on Mcann's oatmeal, I tried them and I'm hooked.  The standard oatmeal is more mushy and soft and sometimes made me gag if I ate a lot (I still liked them, go figure..) but these oats are different.  More nutty and texture and flavor.  I make them the Alton Brown's way (3 cups of water for 20 minutes, add 1 more cup of milk for 10) and they're delicous.  I originally bought 8 cans (the special) and wasn't sure if I would go through them or thought it would take a year to finish them, but they are almost gone 3 1/2 months later!  I'm buying more as we speak (or I type)...

review/summary: Wow, what a difference
review/text: between this and the oatmeal I have been eating all my life. I love this stuff and so do the kids, which really surprised me. I mean they liked the regular oatmeal I would make, but they tend to dig their stubborn little heels in whenever I try to introduce something different in food. But one bite and they were instant fans. I haven't cooked it in a crockpot and truthfully I don't find the cooking process to be that tedious or time consuming. Basically spend five or so minutes until it thickens then put a lid on the pot, turn the fire down to simmer and pretty much leave it alone while I get coffee on, the kids chivied out of bed...etc. Then a little butter, a little brown sugar and we are eating the best oatmeal in the world. And I don't think you can find it cheaper. Actually in my part of the world I can't find it at any local market. I would have to drive 100 miles to Tulsa to find a store that carried it. My order arrived before it's estimated date, the cans were not dented. Couldn't be happier with the product and will continue buying it here.

review/text: I love this oatmeal for both the taste and texture. True, it's not refined enough to just soak overnight without much cooking, like you can do with "quick" oats (which I also love).<br /><br />Don't kill me because I bought it for the reusable containers! Yes, they came with a few dings, but that's ok. I bought them last year when on sale here for less than now, and think I got a great deal.<br /><br />I eat them with butter, salt and pepper, or berries, sugar and cream. Their website also has ideas about precooking http://www.mccanns.ie/preparation.html<br /><br />The worst that can happen is that you reuse the can to hold trail mix, a candle, or bath salts, etc.<br /><br />Warning, you do have to gently pry the lid off--every time!<br /><br />I bet they'd be great as a crunchy topping, but I'll have to search around for how to do that without breaking a tooth! (Excuse me if someone has already mentioned this--I haven't read all the reviews.)

review/text: Healthy and Delious . . . what more could you want?<br />1/2 hour is not to long a cooking time in exchange for best oats I've ever had. I've had no problem with them sticking to the pan. I stir them maybe three times during the cook time. I also cooked a double batch and refrigerated them overnight. They were just as great tasting as when first cooked. I then tried freezing some and a few days later had them for breakfast and they were still great tasting. I don't know if refrigerating or freezing them makes them less healthly but it was quicker if you don't have the time.

review/summary: Oatmeal lovers read on
review/text: This product was recently rated number one by readers of Rachel Ray magazine.In that my husband and I both love oatmeal there was no way we weren't going to try this product. Strange as it sounds, it takes some time to prepare correctly, but it is worth the extra time and effort. We are converted!

review/text: McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal, Traditional, 28-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)<br /><br />There is no question that McCann's is the best oatmeal/porridge in the world, and in particularly the Traditional 30-minutes-to-cook variety.  However; the vendor chose not to pack the items carefully and all four of the tins were damaged.  I had intended to give at least two of them as gifts and now I have to do something else.  Try styro peanuts, or even newspaper, next time

review/summary: Steel Cut Oatmeal
review/text: Original order of 8 cans arrived in badly dented shape. I sent email to complain because the severe denting would most likely compromise the integrity of the product. I received a response back stating that I should throw the cans away & a new order was being shipped free of charge!!  This is amazing service and I really appreciate how quickly this problem was resolved. The second order arrived very quickly and the cans were perfect, no dents at all.  Thanks again.

review/summary: Amazing stuff!
review/text: Up til now, I always had a bowl of Quaker Oatmeal each morning. Wilford Brimley's got nothing on me! I've seen McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal in the stores at $6 to $7 per can, so I've always left it there on the shelf. Then I saw it on Amazon for a very nice price, I thought I would splurge because all the other reviews said this is great stuff.<br /><br />Well, although shipping seems to cause dents in the cans (but they remained sealed), I heartily recommend this oatmeal to anyone who likes a hot cereal. This is simply amazing stuff. It takes a LONG time to cook, but it is well worth it! Make a bunch and put the leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator - reheating doesn't take long at all in the microwave!<br /><br />The different texture and great taste will blow you away! Five stars!

review/summary: Great product...
review/text: Top shelf product. Good transaction, fast shipping, however a few of the cans were a little dented-up. That's probibly why the great price, but no matter. Great product, Great taste, I hope they run another promotion like this one...

review/summary: The health benefits had me intrigued....the taste has me SOLD!
review/text: I never thought I'd say I love oatmeal, but here I am saying just that. This stuff is just fantastic!  I hadn't heard of steel cut oats, but when Amazon offers a great deal, I *have* to check it out  (bargain-hunting... it's a gift...and a curse). I did the research and was amazed at all I found about the health benefits of steel cut oats. I was greatly encouraged by the rave reviews on Amazon, but I admit, a bit skeptical. I mean, really, it's JUST oatmeal, right?<br /><br />Wrong! I bought this product and the quick-cooking variety as well. I am hooked on this product!  I am usually NOT one to plan ahead, but I make a big batch of this at the beginning of the week, portion it out into covered bowls and have it for breakfast everyday. I love the chewy texture and nutty flavor. I've made it with water, milk and organic apple juice. My favorite is half water, half apple juice with pecans, dried cranberries and cinnamon. SO delicious and filling! However one of the things I love about buying this "basic" product is being able to mix it up however I like.<br /><br />Yes, the cans arrived dented, but the oatmeal was intact, so it didn't bother me a bit. I did find the same product at my local Publix for $4.99 a can, which is  cheaper than the Amazon price, however, since I have Prime the shipping is free AND I will probably subscribe to the auto ship on this product, which does lower the price to less than my local store, plus, NO TAX (and Tennessee DOES love their taxes on food items). But if Amazon offers another amazing deal on it, I won't hesitate to stock up (and get ONLY the long cooking version this time)!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product and will be pestering my mom and sisters to get some too. I know they will love it, and it's so good for them!

review/summary: Real Oatmeal..Yum!
review/text: There is so much hype these days about eating oatmeal, I thought I would jump on the band wagon and get the good stuff. It is pricey, but the flavor is incredible. It also takes much longer to cook the "porridge", about 30 minutes. They are from Ireland, which is always fun to get something from another country.
