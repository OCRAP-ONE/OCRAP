review/summary: Great tea
review/text: I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.

review/summary: Tried most varieties - this is the best!
review/text: This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!

review/text: I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!

review/summary: It is good tea.
review/text: I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills.

review/summary: Would not order again
review/text: I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment.

review/text: I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*

review/summary: Excellent Mellow Tea, Hot or Cold
review/text: This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet.

review/summary: Lovely Green Tea
review/text: I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil.

review/text: THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality.

review/summary: My 'everyday' tea. :c)
review/text: I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)

review/summary: Time for Tea!
review/text: I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too.

review/summary: Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green
review/text: I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.

Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!

Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again.

review/summary: Cuppa Green
review/text: Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are "watered down" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.

review/summary: Nice way to spice up a meal!
review/text: I found this product to be a nice addition to my oatmeal in the morning.  I don't like my food to be too sweet, but these do a nice job of adding flavor without an overwhelming sweetness.  I love maple flavor and have tried other products on the market, but they usually are some sort of oil that doesn't accurately represent a maple flavor.  Even though it is a bit pricy for the quantity you get, it should last for a while with a couple of sprinkles here and there.  So far, in addition to putting it on oatmeal, I have found it to be a nice addition to a breakfast cassarole, toppings on muffins and donuts, and pastries.<br /><br />I would suggest this product to those who are looking to add a little sweet flavor to something instead of plain sugar.  Used on the correct dish, it would really give that extra dimension of taste.

review/text: This has to be the best 'at home' espresso I have ever had.  I love a very strong cup of coffee, and whenever I go to that chain place, you know the one I'm talking about, for coffee I get a regular coffee with a shot of espresso (red-eye?).  It costs me an arm and a leg too!  Now I can do it at home.<br /><br />Bold, rich, aromatic and it tastes less acid-y than  the other espressos that I've tried...this was an absolute pleasure to drink.  I don't even bother with the frother to top my coffee, because the espresso has just enough crema on top to make this an even richer drink.<br />Yum.<br /><br />AND if you use the subscription service like I did, you can save yourself at least 15% and never have to worry about  remembering to re-order again!

review/summary: Love, love, love this flavor!
review/text: This is my favorite flavor out of all the coffee, teas and espressos for the Kaldi. I've tried them all more than a few times each to give them a relatively fair review, but this one tops my list. I do have to admit that I prefer espresso drinks over coffee and teas, so take that into consideration.<br /><br />The Italian espresso is smooth, bold and full of flavor, but doesn't leave a bitter after-taste. The other two espresso flavors leave a taste in your mouth where it feels like something's missing.<br /><br />My favorite espresso drink is an iced latte, and this makes the perfect latte. Two shots of the espresso with about 6 ounces of milk makes my perfect drink!<br /><br />Out of the three caffeinated espressos, the Italian tops the list for flavor, then the Premium and lastly the Continental.

review/text: Just what I was looking for. This makes a very smooth espresso with good crema. Consistent shot every time, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the espresso actually is out of the CBTL machine, particularly this flavor. My go-to espresso from now on.<br /><br />Update: 4/27/12 Original review was of the pods that I bought locally at Target. The ones from Amazon were noticeably more bitter. Also, the top of the pod on the Amazon pods were not as "domed" as the ones I purchased from Target, indicating that maybe a seal had broken or the pods were bad. It's bearable to drink but not nearly the great experience from the ones I got at Target, which I assume were fresher.

review/summary: Who needs a barista?!
review/text: This is my absolute favorite of all the espresso flavors sold by The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Company! I must confess, however, that I don't make or serve it as espresso. I put the capsule in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SH6UTG">Kaldi S04 Single Cup Brewer, Red</a> and push the button for brewed coffee and that gives me the perfect strength when diluted like that. While the brewer is working, I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SH6V1I">CBTL LM-145P Milk Frother, Black</a> to prepare my milk. When that is done I add a packet of the CBTL vanilla flavored powder and whisk it. HEAVENLY!  This has a very smooth flavor, their darkest roast - and is a great way to start my day without having to go to a coffee house and pay those high prices. If I don't have extra time or am in a hurry, I don't use the frother; I just add my favorite creamer to the hot espresso -- I prefer the International Delight Coffee Creamer, Caramel Macchiato, 24 Ct (Pack of 4).<br /><br />The capsules are about 60� each when you order through the amazon subscription service or you can buy directly from the online website of the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf company using their premium club and thus save on shipping. I do hope that these capsules will be available in my local grocery stores to make it more convenient for purchase.<br /><br />The CBTL single cup brewer, the CBTL milk frother, and this Italian Espresso used in combination make great coffee. You can experiment with all the different flavors and find the one you like best. You can make coffee drinks just as good as any barista!

review/summary: Delicious Flavor - Eat in Moderation
review/text: CarbRite Brownie Mix includes chocolate chips in it - and the resulting brownies are only 1.5 grams of net carbs per large brownie!  That's only 174 calories. This is definitely recommended for anyone who loves chocolate and wants to be healthy too.<br /><br />The brownies are very easy to make. You add in 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of butter and a teaspoon of water. That's it. Bake for just under an hour, then chill for an hour in the fridge.<br /><br />What's neat about the brownies is you have options as to how they come out. Depending on how long you bake them, you can get them to be more cake like or fudge like. We like them about half and half.<br /><br />The chocolate chips seem to "sink" into the mix, which gives it the fudgy aspect on the bottom layer. It's a really nice texture, with a crispy top. Even several days later, the ones that are left (assuming you eat them at a reasonable pace) are still quite tasty.<br /><br />Now I do want to comment that you SHOULD eat them only one at a time. My boyfriend was a bit greedy when we first made these, and ate a bunch. These are LOADED with sugar alcohols.  There are 15g of sugar alcohols per serving. This gives it a fantastic sweet flavor - but they cause digestive problems if eaten in large quantities. One brownie is fine. Six brownies .... less fine. Be wise. Eat just one.<br /><br />Some people ask me why they don't just use Splenda instead of sugar alcohols. Splenda doesn't bake as well as sugar alcohols do - the flavor comes out differently. I really do believe this is the best formulation for its fantastic flavor, but again, be aware of the content. Eat in moderation.<br /><br />I really love these. You get a rich brownie flavor for hardly any calories and almost zero carbs. It really is quite ideal for anybody who loves chocolate - on any eating plan - who wants to avoid sugar.<br /><br />The nutrition values are: 174 calories, 12g fat (no trans fats), 55mg sodium, 3g fiber, 15g sugar alcohols, 1.5g net carbs. You get tiny amounts of some vitamins, nothing to really consider important.<br /><br />I would even recommend parents make these for their kids, if their kids demand chocolate, rather than giving them sugary versions.

review/text: After trying several brownie recipes for our new low-carb diet, I was of the mind that we were just NOT going to be able to find a good brownie recipe.  I ordered this product and was very happy with the brownies.  They do come out of the oven with 2 layers to them - a crunchier top layer and the gooier lower layer. After a couple of days, the layers are not as obvious. These were a big hit with our kids as well - and they aren't anything if not honest.  The portion is smaller than most people would normally cut for a brownie - but after being on a low-carb diet for a while, you are happy with the portion size.  Great product!!!

So with the whole family over, I decided to mix up a batch of these devilish delights.<br />Well, let me tell you, I don't know what Doctor would recommend the intense intestinal distress caused by these brownies. Holy Hell! Myself and my Christmas guests were utterly disgusted by the brown, methane cloud that resulted from my consumption of said brownies. I have since discovered other foods which contain Malitol (artificial sugar-izer) and carry a warning of "may cause possible intense intestinal distress". Well let me just cut to the chase for you: These brownies cause some seriously foul smelling gas. I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 beacuse they DID taste pretty good goin' down. Thanks for that Dr. Carbrite, of that is your real name.

review/summary: Never underestimate the power of these brownies.
review/text: I do not know what is in these brownies to cause these reactions, but hear and heed my warnings. I wish I'd read the truth, the naked truth, the unvarnished and ugly truth:<br /><br />1 Brownie - strange tummy rumbles. Sounds like thunder. Caution, you want to be near the plumbing fixtures.<br /><br />2 Brownies - Thunder, plus the most unexpected gastro warnings. Think a high wind on the Sahara. You might want to move the chair closer to the bathroom. Start practicing your prayers.<br /><br />3 Brownies - You should just make your bed in the bathtub. You'll be there all night.<br /><br />More than 3 Brownies: The refrain: "Dear God in heaven" is heard echoing against the porcelain.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: These brownies come out perfect and are very good considering that youget 1 gram net carbs per serving. I have to say it this way so that you don't try to compare it with regular brownies. If you are on a low carb diet or for whatever reason are trying to control your carbs, then this is the right product for you. Great chocolate flavour, no after taste and quick and easy to bake. If you want a nice treat of brownies and ice cream, you can get CarbSmart regular vanilla ice cream with 4 grams of net carbs per serving and it goes really well with these.

review/summary: Terrible on several levels
review/text: This brownie mix was so very disappointing, and I've been eating low-carb for years so my expectations are pretty realistic to begin with.<br /><br />First was the amount of butter: a whole stick, so in this case, as is so often true, low carb does not mean healthy. Next was the cooking method: a water bath in the oven (baking pan inside a pan of water) is a little complicated for a box brownie. Third is how it comes out of the oven:  greasy and flat, about a half inch tall, and it separates into a mealy, bready layer above and a slab of greasy goo below. It's a complete mess to get out of the pan. Plus it tasted lame - it ranks among the worse sugarless chocolate flavors out there.<br /><br />Finally, the very high amount of sugar alcohols means that if you have a sensitivity to the stuff, you will definitely react to this! I had one brownie and my body's reaction was violent, painful and disgusting.<br /><br />There was not one positive thing about this mix.

review/summary: Most Disappointing Box Brownies Ever = skip the impulse 2 Buy
review/text: While everything is relative and this might be a terrific brownie IF you worship at the Temple of Low Carb diets, this version of Brownies was a monumental disappointment. The process requires 3 eggs and lots of butter (read Unhealthy), then requires cooking in a water bath (dish within a dish of water), requires glass square dishes, and comes out as a thin brownie with a crust. The process was laborious and the result was very unsatisfying, being thin like the height of bread, poorly textured, and poor mouth feel product. I can't say too little about this product, except that this product makes one savor and fully appreciate the genius and deliciousness of Ghiradeli and Betty Crocker box brownies.

I read some reviews and worried they may not be that great, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to try them out. I loved them. I had some friends over and let them try them.. These are friends who are not on any kind of diet, and they all told me they couldn't taste the difference, and had several. But we went through them really fast, so now I'm ordering more. You can call me a regular customer now. Try them out yourself. I can't see why anyone would disagree.

review/summary: Tasty but Gassy!
review/text: The taste alone deserve all the accolades I found from fellow reviewers before I bought this product (4 Boxes). There were only two reviews, one for 5 stars and the other for 4 stars. Not one mentioned the after effects this product causes in the human body. Who said gas is expensive? With this product is free and long lasting! The first time we did two boxes, which is not much in quantity, and the whole family had a go at it. I bought it for selfish reasons, the fact I am not supposed to consume sugars and lots of Carbs, but more importantly because the two reviews sold me! Who else can I trust these days when everyone claims they are the best but the actual consumers, the everyday people of this great land of ours? Yes, I am that naive, I fully trust the opinions of the majority. In this case they were only 2 reviews and I should have been more cautious. The taste great but after eating this product the body undergoes severe swings, all adorned by long lasting gas and in the end by several visits to the "throne". I have always been blessed with a reliable stomach but when I eat something that is not quite right I suffer like everyone else. Another member of my family suffers from a very delicate stomach and almost no will power when it comes to treats like these. There must be some kind of ingredient that promotes this reaction and my question is: Is it safe to suffer the after effects for the taste of the moment you eat it? In my opinion, no, even though I know that some ingredient that makes it sugar free might be the culprit and perhaps the body will adapt and in time become more adept at accepting this side effect, but I do not want my body to participate in the adaptation process. So why was this not mentioned at all? That, in a nutshell, is the question. Are we being difficult and antagonistic? From where I stand (or should I say, sit?) I do not think so. 2 Stars for Doctor's Carbrite Extra Rich & Fudgy Brownies and the 2 stars for the initial great taste, at least that part is true and tried!

review/summary: perfect subscription for the multicat household.
review/text: I get this monthly for my dad. He watches over a feral cat colony of about 1 to 2 dozen cats at any given time. He donates a lot of time capturing cats to get them medical attention and have them fixed. He spends his own money on food for the cats. I live two states away but feel I can lend a hand with canned food delivery. Dad is happy to get the support for his cause and the cats get a treat they normally would miss. The wet food makes it easier to catch new cats that turn up so they can be treated and spayed; most important in keeping the colony healthy and small.<br /><br />I call this brand cat Doritos because it is such a treat for them. If you like to stock up and don't want to carry heavy catfood from the car to the pantry then delivery is great! Subscription is especially nice so I don't have to think about it. I have prime so free shipping on monthly or quarterly delivery.

review/summary: Friskies Cat Food
review/text: This is the 'morning food' for the two cats.  Previously I had been feeding them the WalMart brand generic cat food. It was originally .59 per can, now is 1.28.  After buying some other items from Amazon, I began to 'window shop' for other stuff.  I found out about the pet foods they carried.  Bought some dry and canned foods and haven't looked back.  No more schlepping cat food on the bus, and the cats aren't aware that I didn't spend two hours of bus riding and shopping to get it home. Now to evaluate the food, it is eaten by the cats with as much enthusiasm as cats are generally prone to display.  They are happy, I'm happy, what's to complain about.

review/summary: Perfect with a Cabernet
review/text: Friskies has come up with one of the most exciting new cat foods in years. Invitingly packaged in bright marigold colours, the array of sparkling tins invites dipping in. You won't be disappointed. Friskies has created the recipe around a base of wholegrain rice, which provides a subtle textural contrast to the melt-in-the-mouth nuggets of braised chicken. Meanwhile, the rich gravy sauce explodes with flavour, perfectly complementing the more refined undertones of gluten and tallow. Meaty Bits is delicious served with rocket salad, or as a snack enjoyed with crackers and a light Cabernet.

review/summary: Cats won't eat the "meat"
review/text: What a waste of money. All four cats (three indoor and one feral outdoor cat) won't eat the wet food. They like the juice and will lick that up, but they leave the meaty bits behind. I tried each flavor and not one cat will eat this stuff! I was hoping to save some money with Friskies, but it is what it is. And what it is is food that a hungry wild cat won't eat; she'd rather catch and eat mice. :\ My suggestion is to go to the store and buy a couple different cans and try that out first. If your cat doesn't eat it, it'll save you from having 2 dozen paper weights.

review/summary: Just not great cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

review/text: If you're an instant-ramen connoisseur, this is the noodle you've been searching for. Bowl Noodle is far better than any other instant noodle I've had. The broth is cloudy, rich, and immensely flavorful compared to any soup, not just other instants, but surprisingly light on the tongue and stomach... much unlike the, heavy, bland dollar-a-dozen cardboard noodle. (To emphasize the difference: Top Ramen and Ichiban actually make me throw up now, just because they're too bland and... cardboard... -esque... I can stomach Maruchan if I fill it with my entire spice cabinet.) Bowl Noodle has the same punch as Campbell Hearty when it comes to taste. Two of them fill me perfectly if I'm in desperate hunger. I'll have one for a snack instead of chips because it's a lot quicker and more satisfying. I recommend these to all my ramen-eating friends and they love them to death, but they're around 5-10x more expensive than Maruchan. Every penny is worth it, though. To those who buy: you're in for a treat. Enjoy!

review/summary: Instant noodles for adult tastes; a rich, spicy broth for a cold day
review/text: Was your only experience with ramen noodles as a cheap lunch, either during college or when you were just starting out?<br /><br />Well, you are in for a treat.<br /><br />I warn you though: once you try a Nong Shim noodle bowl and you will never go back to a Nissin Cup Noodle.<br /><br />Nong Shim offers a fantastic instant noodle bowl; balancing the right amount of seasoning and spice to make it a perfect lunch on a cold winter afternoon.<br /><br />Please take a look at the product photo I posted that shows the ChefsBest Award and endorsements. I've recommended this noodle bowl to many people but a few of them, because of the kimchi flavor, have been hesitant to give it a try. I can attest that Nong Shim's noodles are not as pungent as `fresh' kimchi. The noodle bowl has a rich, red broth that is visibly loaded with spices.<br /><br />My first Amazon order included two cases of noodles. Next time, I plan to try Nong Shim Bowl Noodle Soup, Beef & Ginger and Nong Shim Bowl Noodle, Spicy Lobster.

review/summary: Easier than making your own
review/text: First of all, if you get an old batch -- contact amazon and they'll gladly exchange it for a new one. If you never worked with fondant before it's an interesting experience that can be enjoyable depending on what you're trying to do. Everyone should experiment with new things but just realize #1 this stuff does not taste as good as really good "frosting" on the other hand you can make it look better and more uniform and #2 that unless you spend lots of time practicing you probably wont get anything to look as nice as they do on TV. It's an ART not something you buy off Amazon and become an expert in. I'd say it's definitely worth a try so long as you're realistic about what it is you're doing

review/summary: Very Tasty, Easy to Work With!
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Fondarific. Their fondants taste great! I've had clients tell me they prefer the fondant to frosting. One mom even told me her kids picked off the fondant to eat by itself, leaving the classic favorite, frosting, to harden in the trash can. What's more, it comes in a variety of colors and is extremely easy to work with. You can take parts and leave the rest for a later project, as well.

review/summary: Soggy mess
review/text: Okay I usually LOVE Fondarific fondant and order it any time I want to splurge and save myself the work of making my own fondant. Since I had a cake that I wanted to be hot pink I figured I would order some premade fondarific to avoid the hassle of trying to dye marshmellow fondant to the shade of pink I wanted.<br />What a mess!! I started the cake late because I thought "hey I have fondarific and it is a cinch to roll out" WRONG. The stuff was a sticky, gooey mess that kept melting away and tearing when I tried to pull it off the rolling mat. I used a ton of shortening to keep it from sticking and rolled it super thick just to compensate. It sort of worked, my cake had pock marks in the fondant from where it started to tear and stick to the mat but at 1am I was more worried about getting the dang thing covered than I was about pock marks. Seriously it took me about 90 minutes to get my 2 tier cake covered where it usually would take 20 mins with fondarific. I don't know if it had to do with the pink dye in the fondant (I have never used this dark of a pink before) or if there was a manufacture defect with this batch of fondant. All I know is I live in Washington where there is zero humidity and you would have thought I was in Savannah Georgia with the way it was drooping off my hands. I will not be ordering this color again any time soon.<br />I have 3 other colors I ordered and will try out soon, will let you know if I have the same problems with them.
