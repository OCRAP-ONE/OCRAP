review/summary: Simply the best tasting olives on the market
review/text: Usually I get my olives at a specialty store, so I was surprised that there was such a pronounced difference. I then found out that some olive companies use lye for quick curing, but these folks don't. Perhaps that's the reason for the better taste. My friends who recommended Sicilian Village olives also agreed that they were the best they'd ever had. I prefer green olives, and that's all I buy, but I have to admit even the black olives I have sampled were good as well, and that's a first for me.<br />There's a reason they're getting such good reviews ... just taste them and see.

review/summary: Surprising. In a good way.
review/text: These tomatoes are handy to have around the house especially as the weather gets cold and I don't feel like driving to the store. The surprising thing is the wonderful aroma you smell when you open the container: it reminds me of my Gran-dad's garden. I guess that's what happens when the tomatoes are organic, they retain the smell of nature and not chemicals. I used this mainly as an add on in pan stir fry. After I rehydrate them, I just toss the slices into the pan. I also cut the tomatoes up and add to omelets. One note: the instructions say to rehydrate for 2-4 minutes: I prefer to let them boil for around 8 to 10. They come out softer. I also reuse the water after I take the tomatoes out for soup stock.

review/summary: Knocks socks off other veggie "stocks"
review/text: I always have vegetable stock on hand for those emergencies when I don't have time to make it fresh.  Trader Joe's makes a nice little reduced sodium veggie stock that comes 10 or 12 in a box which are about a cup each when reconstituted, and I also keep those in the cupboard.<br /><br />Let me tell you, the day these More Than Gourmet Veggie-Glace Gold packs arrived at my door was a wonderful day for our household because now we can enjoy wonderful sauces that are rick and complex, more so than any I'd made in years.  Unlike traditional demi-glace which is produced by roasting bones, these are strictly meat-free, yet they are so full of the flavors of roasted vegetables, enhanced by the addition of red wine, all which have been reduced to a "gelatinous" consistency.  I've added this to a stir fry when I simply didn't feel like messing with an assortment of spices, and I've also used it in making a rich sauce with nuts for freshly made pasta.  The small size is deceiving because even though each package is a little plastic flat cup with an aluminum seal, it is as dense as would be expected from a demi-glace.  I look forward to trying the mushroom version for variety.  More Than Gourmet offers recipes on their website which I found inspiring.  I will buy this again and strongly recommend it particularly to vegetarians who enjoy complexity in flavors.

review/summary: More than a "Stock"
review/text: I have been buying More Than Gourmet products for just about as long as they have been around.  Some I purchase in the 16oz. tubs and others in these convenient 1.5 ounce pods.  Before this came on the market I make my own stocks and glaces.  It really took a lot of time and money (my kids used to hate it when they came home to wonderful, enticing aromas coming out of the kitchen only to discover that I was "cooking bones").  Although I usually like to do things from stratch this is one product that is as good as better (at least more consistent) than what I can make.  It's no wonder that many professionals use this or one like it.<br /><br />One thing that I would like to mention: this is a demi-glace, not a "stock" and as such it has it's own unique uses.  More Than Gourmet makes an excellent vegetable stock and I use it often.  Veggie-Stock Gold is a classic 20 times reduction of clear vegetable stock with no starches added.  It is a great start for soups or to add moisture and flavor to a wide variety of dishes.<br /><br />This product, Roasted Vegetable Demi-Glase has similar ingredients except that the vegetables have been roasted to add more flavor and color to the product and a starch has been added.  Just like adding a roux (equal parts butter and flour, cooked slightly) thickens your sauce so will adding this.  It is great for vegetarian versions of classic French sauces (Au Poivre, Wild Mushroom,etc.) that would usually be made with a veal or beef demi-glace.  A little goes a long way and you would not believe how easy it is to whip up a sauce that will impress your guests and taste wonderful (a couple of recipes are included and more available on their own site).<br /><br />Both products, along with five or six of their other stocks and demi-glaces, are staples in my kitchen.  If you are new to cooking you will love them.  If you are a pro or have been doing this for a while then you know why you need them.  I highly recommend!

review/summary: Worked
review/text: I ordered 4 varieties, one being More Than Gourmet Classic Roastd Vegetable Demi-Glace, 1.5-Ounces (Pack of 6). This one came soft and of gelatin consistency. The supposedly chicken demi glaze came of  very hard consistency, almost like hard glue, so this one called my attention. I immediately rinsed some pinto beans and filled a pot with the right amount of water to cook them and still have some gravy for the brown rice. When I used More Than Gourmet Classic Roastd Vegetable Demi-Glace, 1.5-Ounces (Pack of 6), after it dissolved I served myself a very small cup of the broth. Noticed very little salt. Also a very subtle taste, kind of bland and vague. I do understand that is the nature of vegetables, they are mild in flavor compared to chicken or beef. I liked the color of the water in the early stages and in the latter one I noticed it had caramelized somewhat and had become the perfect consistency to serve. I did add my bag of tricks to the concoction for they do require all manner of spices and herbs if it is to be truly vegetarian. I previously have purchased quite a few vegetable base products, for I have been always in search of the perfect stock in each category, and this one rose to the top. Once it thicken and the beans were soft and velvety and the mix of the other goodies, including caramelized onions, fresh ground garlic, wine, herbs, spices, sea salt, pepper, jalape&ntilde;os properly macerated in olive oil and then lightly grilled to finally blended form, once the final product was ready everyone that ate it (Im just bragging, there were two of us at that time...) said it was magnifique and I congratulated the results by eating double. This one might not have a lot of taste but it certainly melted divinely and made an all vegetarian rendering quite the novelty act. 4 Stars.

review/summary: Blows other vegetable stocks away
review/text: The manufacturer describes this better than I can. I've been using their products for years with fantastic results. It lasts for years in the refrigerator -- but it does get tough -- so use it within 6 months if possible. It's a pleasure to look at the nutritional information and see that one quart of reconstituted stock contains a mere 240mg of sodium (12% of DV).<br /><br />Veggie-Glace Gold� is a revelation to those seeking the greatest possible flavor in light cooking or vegetarian entrees. It brings a new level of taste and flexibility to your kitchen. You can make classic French sauces by following those wine reduction recipes using Veggie-Glace Gold�. Other flavorful variations can be created by adding other herbs, spices, wines, vinegars, mustard, etc., depending upon the intended use of the sauce.<br /><br />For the first time ever, a true vegetarian (meatless) demi-glace substitute is available for your kitchen. Veggie-Glace Gold� is made from the finest and freshest ingredients without chemicals, MSG, etc. As lifestyles are changing and people are eating more healthfully, the home chef is faced with an even greater challenge - how to create dramatic, flavorful dishes that offer clean, fresh flavors while still being healthy and providing the body and appearance of dishes made with meat based products.<br /><br />Never before has it been possible to prepare classical sauces for those seeking light cooking or vegetarian entrees. Veggie-Glace Gold� brings a new level of taste and flexibility to your kitchen. You can make classic French sauces (i.e., Au Poivre, Wild Mushroom, etc.) by following the classic red wine reduction recipes using Veggie-Glace Gold�.

review/text: I dearly love lychees but had simply forgotten about them until I had them again in Hawaii. Upon returning, I searched the grocery stores in my area and couldn't find any, so as usual, I turned to Amazon. I was not familiar with this brand, but I took a chance and ordered a case anyway. I was a little sceptical because my internet search revealed that these had not gotten the best reviews, due to their sugar content. My response to that, is that unless you are planning to make a whole meal out of them, don't worry about it. Yes, they are packed in a syrup - and so what? Canned fruits are usually packed in syrup. They are delicious! These were a better price than most of the others. Don't hesitate to try them if you like lychees.

review/summary: Great zero calorie drink
review/text: I actually purchased mine in the grocery store, and came here looking to buy more.  I dont drink sugary drinks... ever.  no soda, rarely some all natural OJ or apple.  My diet is mostly water, and for flavor, crystal light(the dieters dream it seems).<br /><br />I had however, tasted a "regular" arnold palmer with some cousins on vacation in the past, so I knew I enjoyed the flavor(I said I didnt drink sugary drinks, never claimed not to enjoy them).  Never went any further because 13g of sugar in 8oz is not how I want to consume my calories.<br /><br />Wandering the aisles of the store I happened upon this "Zero" version.  Im not against some sucralose(at worst its better than the aspartame in crystal light anyway) so I picked up a tall can to try out.<br /><br />I was very happy with the drink.  I am here looking to purchase more obviously.  Take my opinion for what it is, coming from someone that is not used to the "regular" version, or sugary drinks of any kind.  My tastes are trained to the artificial stuff already.  I see other reviews admonishing this as inferior to the "regular" stuff, and I wouldnt doubt it, but thats not the point is it?  For a zero calorie drink, I think this is a fantastic option.

review/summary: Best, best egg noodles
review/text: This noodle is a true, Italian pasta.  It is a noodle best used in dishes like, chicken and noodles.<br />It has a super, "hold up", quality.  It will absorb flavor, yet, remain independent and nice.  It has a beautiful texture and color.<br />It is something, "other", than the heavy,  It is not the  American farm style and good for a change.  This noodle is also  different<br />from traditional pastas, like spaghetti.  It holds its own and is perfect as a side dish with fish and  a green vegetable.  As a side dish,<br />we serve it with butter and salt and pepper.  Yummy and hard to find.  It puts the grocery store egg noodles to shame.  They are<br />bland mush in comparison,

review/text: taste delicious and I was surprised how much it helds its form even though I cooked it for 7 minutes and then cooked it further with the home made spicy tomato and shrimp sauce.  I am not sure about it serving four - more like three, but then it could be we loved it so much a little bit more was appreciated!<br />The ingredients are simple and pure - just the way we like it.  Also the packaging was simple without too much plastic.<br />Great value on Vine (thanks).

review/summary: Not gluten free - But, very good
review/text: Celiacs....Just an fyi...I found these noodles doing a "gluten free noodle" search.  My bad, didn't read the ingredients completely.  They are not gluten free.  Semolina is wheat and very high in gluten.  They cannot be returned.<br /><br />January 22, 2012<br />Just the idiosyncratic, despicable celiac here and OK, have to be fair.  I ended up giving gave the noodles to my grandkids and they tell me they are the best noodles they have ever had, where did I get them?.  Of course I told them. They remain full of gluten,and still come up on a "gluten free" search, but they are absolutely delicious according to four children and their parents.

review/summary: Best noodles available!
review/text: When I was a kid, back when everything wasn't made solely to maximize profits, you could get noodles similar to these in a bag by Golden Grain. No more. I guess what now passes for egg noodles in the store had to be made thick and short and sturdy enough to survive a long shipping haul from China or wherever.<br /><br />These bionaturae noodles are SO worth looking for locally--only because as another reviewer noted, they may not travel well. I've gotten them at an only moderately upscale grocery nearby, but I'd drive several miles to stock up on these. The 'bite' is perfectly al dente, and as noted, they don't gunk up in sauce or liquid after ten minutes. Butter, chopped parsley, salt and pepper. YUM!

review/text: I ordered this pasta, thinking it was gluten-free, as it came up in the gluten-free search on Amazon.  My fault, I guess, because I didn't look at it closely enough.  I am just irritated with both myself and the company as it was not inexpensive.  Of course, I have not tried it since I have celiac disease, but I am sure the rest of my family will enjoy it as per the other reviews I read before I purchased it.  If I had read further down the review list, I would have seen the review by the person who did the same thing as I did.

The coffee folks like to call it finish.. What's really nice is that the price is always lower than the other organic brands. I've served the decaf to friends and they raved about it afterwards.

review/text: I won't comment on the price because that can change. We all do our best to find deals and bargains.<br /><br />This food is wonderful. I used to buy cheap, grocery store stuff and tried this on a whim. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />My dog is a little older and is missing some teeth. Since he is a shih tzu he also throws up from time to time after eating. (Do all shih tzus do this, mine has since birth) Anyway, this food seems to cut down on the incidents. The pieces are very small and easy for him to chew.<br /><br />It's good for him, a great size for my little dog, and I will continue to buy it.

review/text: My puppy has had much better success tolerating and thriving on Science Diet compared with pricier "all natural" brands...you know...ingredients that people would also be happy to eat.  But she is a dog, not a human and so if ground up chicken beaks are one of the fillers, but she is healthy and happy, I don't worry about it period.  At the shelter where I got her they sell Science diet for half the price of what it is available elsewhere...gotta go get some more.  Why, because my dog loves it and is healthy and happy and seeing is believing.  Cheers!

review/summary: Not nutritionally sound
review/text: I had been using this food mixed with the canned science diet for my lab puppy (because that is what the shelter had used), and didn't have any issues.  However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products.  He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)  Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather).

review/summary: Please avoid!!
review/text: Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your dogs.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise. try something like orijen or evo.

review/summary: My dog is happy, healthy, and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs!
review/text: I treat my animal's health as if it were my own and try to not only find the best veterinarian care, but also the best foods.  I've had my dog Brandy on Eagle brand dog food for many years.  I remember when there was the melanine scare, but I didn't have to worry because all of the ingredients were natural and were grown in the United States.  Aside from that, once I changed from an inexpensive food with suspect ingredients, there was a very noticeable difference in her general appearance, especially her fur.  It became sleek and ultra shiny and her body slim and trim.<br /><br />Brandy is now eleven years old and although I cannot credit Eagle for her health, she has had only one minor incident that she's had to be taken to the vet's for outside of regular checkups.  My veterinarian wholeheartedly approves of her diet and is pleased that even though she's getting to be an old girl, she's amazingly healthy.  I used to use another Eagle brand, but since she's getting older,  I switched to the senior brand.  She's getting a tad chunky, but her activity level has changed.  Brandy still is frisky and I do believe a good diet has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />When my vet called me the other day with some test results from another dog, I asked her about the corn in this food.  Everyone is yelling about corn being a poor and unhealthy filler so I couldn't resist asking.  She simply said that she considered corn a vegetable and had little bad to say about it.  In other words, a not to worry situation.  My dog is happy, healthy, and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground Yellow Corn, Oatmeal, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Pork Meal, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Beet Pulp, Anchovy & Sardine Meal, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Wheat Germ Meal, Potassium Chloride, Carrots, Peas, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Dried Kelp, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein (min.)  26%<br /><br />Crude Fat (min.)  12%<br /><br />Crude Fiber (max.)  3.00%<br /><br />Moisture  (max.)  10.00%<br /><br />Calcium (min.)  1.00%<br /><br />Phosphorus (min.)  0.080%<br /><br />Vitamin A  (min.)  22,000 IU/kg<br /><br />Vitamin E  (min.)  165 IU/kg<br /><br />Ascorbic Acid (min.)  30 mg/kg<br />(Vitamin C)*<br /><br />Omega 6 Fatty (min.)  2.40%<br />Acids *<br /><br />Omega 3 Fatty (min.)  0.60%<br />Acids*<br /><br />Glucosamine  (min.)  340 mg/kg<br />Hydrochloride<br /><br />Total Lactic Acid  (min.)  100,000,000<br />Microrganisms*<br /><br />(Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium in equal amounts)<br />*Not recognized as an essential nutrient by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles<br />Eagle Pack Senior Adult Dog Food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for maintenance.<br /><br />FEEDING GUIDELINES (from the website):<br /><br />Transitioning to Eagle Pack�<br />It is important to slowly transition your dog from his/her current diet as it takes a few days for the body to adapt to the new nutrient levels.

review/summary: Great Food
review/text: My two senior dogs absolutely love this food.  They were in good condition before, but are now in excellent condition.  My 15 year old mini poodle had a "gas" problem, but that was all.  His blood work showed an elevated liver count.<br /><br />My 9 year old standard poodle had soft stool, was lethargic and was generally just off.  The vet could find nothing wrong.  She recommended a food change to a "senior" food.<br /><br />We have completed our first full 30 lb bag and what a difference.  No more gas in Gizmo and the Standard Poodle, Clio, is acting very active and young again.  Her stool is also firm again.<br /><br />I am now going to be a regular customer as my vet likes the results also.

review/summary: My Order Experience
review/text: I ordered from this seller for the 1st time and I was definitely disappointed.  The dog food bag was very shabby looking and it only had 4 months before it expired.  That concerned me.  I contacted the seller and he replaced it with another, but the expiration date was exactly the same on the second bag.  I returned the second bag and I'm waiting for a credit on my account.  I would not order this item from this seller again. This item was ordered from Wag.com, not Amazon.

review/summary: Too soon expiration date
review/text: I love lindor truffles, which is why I ordered them.  The dark chocolate filled with chocolate truffles (which I had already tried) came with an expiration date of 04-30-2010.  (I ordered 6 packages of 12 in March, 2010.)<br /><br />They came already encased in the white "dust" that is often in a product when stored improperly, or is beyond the expiration date.  Since the date was within the order date, I couldn't return them.<br /><br />However, the rasberry stuffed truffles has an expiration date of 12-31-2010 arrived in excellent condition.<br /><br />However, if I order Lindor truffles again, I will request a batch that has an extended expiration date.<br /><br />PS - I always try to order from Amazon as you have good prices.  Please correct this problem.<br />Thank you.<br />Julie Kestyn

review/summary: Okay for Green, not minty however
review/text: I've been Ordering another brand for years now, but wanted to switch it up a bit and see what other products are out there.  This brand appealed to me because it cuts back considerably of packaging and waste.  The tea as a green tea is suitable, it tastes pretty standard.  The only problem is that there isn't really any mint flavor to speak of.

review/summary: CHOCOLATE HEAVEN
review/text: If you're a chocoholic you'll find these treats irresistible.  If you're not already addicted to chocolate, you'll be won over.  The taste is pure and sweet, a milk chocolate rather than a heavy dark.<br /><br />  The balls are individually wrapped in shiny red paper, which makes them perfect to be served with after dinner coffee.  Also, each bag is pretty enough to be given as a gift.<br /><br />  I know a pack of 12 sounds like a lot of candy but we keep ours in the refrigerator and have found them to be fresh as new after weeks of storage.  (But do remember to allow the chocolate to come to room temperature for full flavor).  Each truffle is a generous two-bite size.<br /><br />  We especially enjoy this collection because both the solid chocolate truffles and those with a creamy center are included.<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/text: ..At 220 calories for a serving of three 'truffle' balls this candy is sinfully worth it.  I can never get these at any other time of the year than Christmas time.  At least where I live anyway! And now that I know I can get these here and have them delivered to my house...well let's just say I'm going to have to watch my diet in other directions.<br /><br />The semi-soft outer shell cradles a sinfully rich, creamy soft gooey center which is to die for.  Yes I understand that there are thousands of more expensive and presumably better candies out there, but for the cost and ease of purchasing nothing can compare.

review/summary: Best Chocolate on the Planet!
review/text: No other chocolate compares to these little orbs of taste bud delirium.  The smooth outer shell seduces you with its incomparable flavor before releasing its even silkier inner cream for a mouth-drenching explosion of total chocolate bliss.  As with all chocolates, colder temps reduce the flavor, so, in cold weather, make sure you've warmed these up to at least 75 degrees to get your best chocolate "hit".  GREAT STUFF!

review/summary: GREAT dog food but HORRIBLE pacsevere from Amazon!
review/text: This dog food is fantastic! A premium quality at an affordable price.  I have 4 special needs Min Pins, and I've finally found one food that I can feed to them all.  The two boys are diabetic and blind, but they HATED the Sciend Diet W/D food.  And frankly, I did too.  It was so expensive for, in my opinion, a much inferior product.  So now I feed my two boys a combination of this plus the Diamond Senior dry food, and they are doing great!  One of my girls has both a heart condition and allergies, as well as only a couple of teeth, and after a few weeks of feeding her this, the allergies have all but disappeared.  My other little girl was a former puppy mill mommy that we rescued, and clearly she had been neglected and abused.  She was in such bad shape that we had to remove all her teeth, one eye, and shave her whole body. For the last year and a half, we could count how many strands of fur she grew back. She also had food allergies.  But after being on this for a few months, her allergies are cleared up, and she's getting a soft, silky coat of fur - at long last.  I'm not saying this food is responsible for that or that it's a cure-all miracle, but to me it has been!  I've got a happy and healty (well, as healthy as they can be) pack, and I hope that Amazon continues to carry this food.<br /><br />HOWEVER, be advised:  they do not provide enough protection in the way they package the product when they ship it, so I end up with a few dented cans.  In my last order that I just opened today, 13 of the 24 cans were moderately or severely damaged, and I'm contacting Amazon about this because that is just unacceptable.  They need to use the air bags instead of paper filling, and that would solve the problem.  But the food, in my opinion, can't be beat!

review/summary: Smells Great; Makes Things Taste Great
review/text: Several years ago, I started making homemade marshmallows for family and friends.  You'd be amazed at the simple joy that radiates from the face of a person learning for the first time that marshmallows can be made at home.  Anyway, as a special treat for a friend who  is so enamored with France that she grows French lavender in her backyard because it reminds her of her travels there, I decided to try a lavender marshmallow.<br /><br />I was able to find some culinary lavender in my local grocery store (near a pretty urban area), but it seemed so expensive.  In the end, this is about a fifth of the price of my grocery store.  Win!  When I got the package in the mail, I could smell the floral, almost woodsy and astringent fragrance that I associate with lavender (and rosemary) before even opening it.  The color of the flower buds ranged from shades of blue to purple.<br /><br />To cook with it, I dump what I need into a large bowl and use the sprayer on my faucet to put enough water in the bowl so that the flowers float.  I give it a stir and then use a small-gauge strainer to scrape the floating flowers out of the water.  Any detritus that may be mixed in with the flowers will sink to the bottom (though any stems will not - but then again, rosemary and thyme typically have some stems mixed in), so don't just dump it in the strainer.  Glean the flowers from the top of the bowl.<br /><br />As for my marshmallows, which I topped with lavender-scented dark chocolate, my friend loved them and everything I've made since (lavender lemon cookies, blueberry lavender syrup, lavender cream, lavender, thyme, and rosemary roasted potatoes, lavender butter, strawberry lavender butter, etc.) has been quite delicious.  When I need more lavender, I know where to come.<br /><br />Update:  I also wanted to mention that 1 oz. of lavender is about 1.25 cups.

review/text: I smelled this package from the mailbox outside of my house.  When I first got my package, it was completely destroyed in the shipping.  I immediately contacted customer service, they responded to me the SAME day (which is almost unheard of now a days), and they sent me a new package within the next couple of days.  These people are so friendly, so nice, very understanding, and truly have a great attitude for business and their customers. I flavored powdered sugar with it to make Lavender Frosting (sifting the sugar of course, the buds are very potent).  It's so aromatic, a little bit of lavender truly goes a LONG way! I have about 2 cups of lavender from purchasing the 4oz package.  I highly recommend any product from the OliveNation company, they have great products and I'll be getting more!  You get a coupon when you purchase anything, it's wonderful to put towards your next purchase!

I was not disappointed at all.  As soon as I opened my post office box, a waft of lavender hit me in the face.  This product is of high quality, and I would definately purchase it again.  My cake turned out wonderful.  The color is lovely, and if you don't want to use it strictly for cooking/baking, it's more than fragrant enough to put around the house, in the sock drawer, etc.  P.S. Lavender is known for its calming effects.  Feel free to Google its benefits.

review/text: I was amazed!  Shipping was fast and product above my expectations. The lavender smelled so wonderful as I took it out of the box.  I ordered it for a cake I am planning to make but I will have plenty to make vinegars and other things for gifts.  I will be ordering from this seller again!

review/summary: Excellent Quality
review/text: I purchased this Lavendar for my daughter's BumbleBee themed baby shower to make Lavender Honey Scones. Which I did, and they were a huge success, there were no leftovers! But then I got creative and exploded with lavendar recipes. Our favorite so far has been a roasted pork loin on the grill. Yum!

review/summary: so YUM!
review/text: This was delivered quite fast! You get a TON of it too. I've been using it in everything from tea to chocolate and I'm about to start using in my cooking too. I can't get enough!<br /><br />If you want lavender flavor without the sugars or other additives of syrups and extracts, this is definitely what you need. I love it!

review/summary: Really enjoying this lavender
review/text: There's nothing like the scent of real lavender! Just a whiff smells so good. Besides enjoying the fragrance, I've only used a small amount a few times to make some tea but it is wonderful! Can't wait to try it in ice cubes, add a pinch on top of a dessert, throw a little into homemade laundry soap, or whatever else comes to mind. Would definitely buy more!

review/summary: Yummy, yummy Lavender.
review/text: I have been looking for more culinary lavender for awhile after using up all that I grew a couple of seasons back. Lavender cookies, infused oils, and teas make great homemade gifts for the holidays. The lavender was well packed and smelled great!
