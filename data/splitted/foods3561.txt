review/summary: Good Blend
review/text: I've been drinking coffee people kona for a couple months and liked it. I then decided to order Timothy's kona blend and it tastes a bit sour to me. But after tasting Timothys and then going back to Coffee people I noticed how dark (burnt) that blend tasted. I like dark coffee and dont put anything in my coffee and I think that is why I like d coffee people.<br /><br />I decided to get a box of this at the grocery the other day, and it has now become my favorite. Not as dark as coffee people and much better tasting than Timothy's. Very good blend.<br /><br />Wish there was a K-cup full kona/kauaii coffee out there. Until then this will work.

review/summary: Tullys Kona Blend
review/text: I have been buying 100% Kona coffee beans at $39 per pound to grind at home.  Been trying to find something close to brew at work and came across Tullys Kona.  I really can't tell the difference.  Great discovery. No longer have to pay alot of money and grind beans.  If you like Kona coffee try this one, can't believe its only 10% blend, taste like 100% to me.

review/text: I've been drinking Tully's French roast for years as my favorite and I've tried just about everything. Last week my Keurig coffee pot broke and samples came with the new one. One of the samples was the Tully's Kona.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much, but the rich flavor really surprised me.<br /><br />I'll confess that I don't know what Kona is 'supposed' to taste like, but whatever this is, I like it very much.<br /><br />I've now ordered more and I expect this to be my new favorite for a very long time.

review/summary: "Blend" is right
review/text: The word Kona is used more for marketing than anything else. It's 10% Kona and 90% of the other stuff. Kona coffee has a distinct taste that you won't find here. It's a good, strong cup but doesn't have any of the flavor that makes Kona so highly desired. I recommend getting a bag of 100% Kona and a Solofill reusable k-cup if you want to taste Hawaii. You'll get the good stuff for less without wasting so much plastic.<br /><br />This is the reusable k-cup to get: Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig Brewers, 1.6-Ounce Package. The Keurig My K-Cup is a piece of junk.

review/summary: My favorite K-Cup
review/text: Some people just don't understand this is a Kona blend. Meaning its blended with Kona and most likely to make it affordable to consumers. Not everyone can afford 40 dollars for 18 k-cups especially when I bought these for 8.99 for 24 at Sears.<br /><br />This coffee is by far nothing like Folgers and is a ridiculous statement. I've tried folgers and it is Horrible!<br /><br />This cup of kona blend is really nice. I love the extra bold flavor and this has converted me from flavored coffees. I can't stand the taste of flavored coffee now! In my honest opinion, this is the best flavor K-cup I've tried to date and has gotten me to appreciate the flavor of coffee. Perfect!

review/text: OK:  First, a confession:  I love a great ham.  I said a great ham, not an ok ham.  Here is a great ham with delectable, applewood smoke flavor mingling with the wonderful taste of a high quality ham.  It is a big ham and about the size of maybe half a basketball or so and it was shipped well although they could have used two cold packs instead of only one in my opinion.  Nonetheless, it came well packaged and cryo wrapped.  This is a serve the crowd if you want to impress type of ham, not a dried out preservative laden styled ham product from the local grocer.  Sure, it costs a bit more but you get what you --y for....  (Missing letters P and A.)  Anyway, enjoy with confidence and the seller is a good communicator as well, advising if any delays are happening and when it ships.  Not bad.  Not bad at all....

review/summary: Best forumula for colicky babies / allergy issues
review/text: My son had very bad colic and spit-up issues and after running through every brand of formula out there and trying gripe water etc., we moved onto this. Within hours, he was back to the child we were used to before the colic began. It's pricey but so, so worth it. Some reviewers have complained about the smell, and while it definitely does not have the sweet aroma or breast milk or regular formula, after dealing with projectile vomiting, this is a MUCH sweeter alternative!<br /><br />This formula is where you turn if you can't figure out what is causing the reaction (it is lactose, soy, colic etc.?). Basically the proteins are broken down into such tiny particles that should your baby be dealing with any of the above mentioned issues, this formula should work for them.<br /><br />Our insurance wouldn't cover it, but I have friends whose plan do, which is great given the high price tag.

review/text: I'm lactose intolerant and went looking for a new milk substitute. I was a Silk drinker for years but felt it was too watery and didn't have the creamy texture of milk that I missed. Zensoy fit the bill. I purchased the chocolate and cappuccino. My young nieces love the chocolate but since I drink it everyday, it was slightly too sweet for me. But chocolate will still be a staple in my fridge for those cravings. This cappuccino flavor is light compared to the real coffee cappuccino. Also, no bitterness or coffee aftertaste. Creamy and smooth like milk. It makes a great snack.

review/text: When I first starting buying soymilk this was my go to brand. Once I moved out of the New York area I could not find this anywhere. On a whim I decided to check if Amazon sold it, since I buy tons of things on this website, and wouldn't you believe it they sell single servings in cappuccino, vanilla and chocolate. I bought the vanilla and cappuccino. They are amazing. Creamy, sweet but not too sweet and reasonably priced. I bough these when they were in the warehouse deals and go them super cheap. I would still buy them via subscribe and save. I would recommend these to anyone.

review/text: The "juice box" has become a popular accompaniment to a packed lunch, particularly a lunch which can have no dairy (because it is vegan or because it is a kosher meal containing meat) but this soymilk is a more nutritious alternative, with 7 grams of protein, 30% of the calcium and 50% of the B-12 recommended each day.<br />Unlike some "juice boxes", the straw stays attached to the package and is sturdy.<br />It tastes good, too.<br />I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Great soymilk, perfect for college kids
review/text: I am a college student and I bought this soy milk to use for my early classes when I do not have time to grab coffee.  I am impressed.  I wish it did have a bit stronger taste, but I also don't like coffee that's too strong so it is better mild than too strong in my opinion.  It reminds me of Starbucks frappuccinos, actually, but better because it's soy milk!

review/summary: Delicious and Convenient!
review/text: This drink is convenient for those who are busy, and it is a delicious soy beverage.  I like to put mine in the freezer and drink it when it is like a frappachino.  It does not have a strong coffee flavor, but it is not the same as chocolate soy milk.  I also like to mix mine with a frozen banana and peanut butter for a good shake.  I definitely recommend it to others!

review/text: Simply put, this is green tea at its finest, not that crap American companies try to push.<br /><br />I have purchased this brand in its 2 liter variety at Japanese supermarkets for years now. If you've drank the original green Ito En Oi Ocha, this is the stronger, bolder, older brother, and it does not disappoint. The lighter variety has a subtle, mellow, nutty, and delicate flavor. While I enjoyed the light, this dark green tea just sings. All of the same flavors in the light, but magnified. It is the quintessential drink without the sugar and artificial ingredients we unfortunately see today in American supermarkets. Let's also not forget the anti-oxidants.<br /><br />Remember to always keep it refrigerated, and enjoy it with ice.

review/summary: Another Keeper...
review/text: Well the labels now say "Made in Japan". This tea has a very complex nutty flavor. It is loaded with tannin meaning it is astringent like a young Cabernet red wine, so much in fact sometimes it will affect your speaking! Ito En used to make another Roasted Green tea version in the rectangular bottle but for some reason they stopped making it. I kind of liked that one better. I rotate between this and the mint and the original green tea on a daily basis. They are all good. If you need some sweetness you can add some agave sweetener after you open the bottle. A teaspoon is roughly 20 calories and is plenty sweet, which is about how much you will put in to the rim after you open the bottle. Enjoy.

review/summary: Back to Japan production! Very Good stuff!
review/text: Edit- I am leaving my original review, but now adding that since moving back to Japan, the tea is perfect again!<br /><br />I have been drinking this Tea daily for about 5 years. It had a robust earthy flavor that was the perfect for somebody who likes strong dark tea.<br /><br />My last 2 shipments came from Ito En in a new Eco friendly style bottle- great! Why not save some plastic? Then I tasted it. It was awful! Not as strong, not as tasty (unless you like the Vitamin C taste to shine through in your tea). It is no longer made in Japan (a decision that might be blamed on the earthquake but in reality was in motion before the earthquake hit as is evidenced by Tea's Tea production being moved there a while ago).<br /><br />I have cancelled my subscriptions (one for the office one for home) and will be buying my tea at a local Japanese supermarket until they move production back to Japan.<br /><br />I have found that Suntory makes a dark variety for the Japanese market that is imported here by a company in Queens, NY.

review/summary: China made Dog Treats
review/text: Both my dog and cat got sick eating these dog treats by Dogswell. My cat, smart enough after getting sick refused to eat anymore, but my dog of course wanted more each day. After a few days of eating one piece each day my dog had blood in her system. I had a vet bill just to tell me that she had a gastro. infection from something she ate. Instead of taking the prescribed antibiotics I took her to a Chinese Medicine doctor and got her an herbal treatment. After a few days she was fine.<br />China, unfortunately has been a very poor and dirty country and also not controlled by any healthy system to prevent problems. Their doctors know this and do very well after thousands of years treating diseases from this condition. If I would not eat this treat, if I am afraid to eat it, I will not give it to my pet and I certainly do not want to pay for two doctor's bills for the cheap treat again. Either I get more expensive and healthier or treats or I simply give my pets the chicken or duck pieces I eat as treats.

The Lindt milk chocolate is one of the best in the industry, and the size and quantity of raisins and nuts is very proportional. I prefer to eat this chocolate bar after it has been in the fridge for at least 10 minutes, because it snaps better in the mouth. It also taste great at room temperature. I recommend this chocolate bar to anyone, especially to those who enjoy milk chocolate.

review/summary: Nice Flavor for an Instant Soup
review/text: Out of all of the Thai Kitchen Rice Noodle Bowls, this one is by far my favorite when it comes to the flavor.  The noodles don't get mushy and the broth is nicely done (for something you just pour hot water over).  It even has a little bit of a "zing" to it.<br /><br />Not sure it would rate high against real Thai food--what packaged food would?--but for something that you can snatch up on the way to work and have something easy to make and hot to eat, its great.  If you want soup you can use more water and if you want noodles, just use less.  Plus its gluten-free!<br /><br />The sad thing is that I can't find the mushroom one in the packets rather than just with the bowl.  Yes, its handy to have the bowl already when you go camping (which I've done), but I'd prefer to have the option.  Hint!  Hint!  And its not just because the packets are  cheaper to buy, but if you want to make this at home I'd rather heat it up in glass than plastic.

review/text: I can't speak for this product's authenticity as a piece of Thai cuisine, but I do enjoy it very much. The soup is made up of rice noodles, a powdered flavor packet with little green onions in it, a little cute packet of dried mushrooms, and a small clear packet of oil.<br /><br />When cooked, it's flavorful without being overwhelming and the mushrooms add a nice variation in texture. It's really tasty for the price (though I think it's slightly cheaper at my local grocery store) and it's very quick and easy to make. Salt content isn't exactly low and you do add a little oil for flavor, but you can cut those things out or limit them pretty easily during preparation.<br /><br />I've had this several times and at least once I added some sliced mushrooms from a jar during cooking. Made it even better!

review/text: It's a nice stack, but way too salty. I think that I will stick to the naked version of these chips, those taste slightly less salty. I wish that they would release a reduced salt version or make the naked version actually naked.

review/summary: Fantastic and more healthy than potato or corn chips
review/text: I warn you, these pita chips are ADDICTING!!  I have only gotten the multigrain pita chips, and Stacy's puts just the right amount of sea salt on them.  You can just eat them plain (oops, the bag is empty!), but I especially like them with hummus.  They are more healthy than traditional chips, but be careful - it is easy to just keep on eating them!

review/text: The chips definitely get five stars, because I couldn't imagine how I could improve them. The minus one star is Amazon. Although I appreciate that they carry these and the price is fine, the expiration date is too soon. One bag, maybe. But for 12, they should have a much later date.

review/summary: Good product and better deal than retail
review/text: I always enjoyed the larger 24 oz.Stacy's Simply Naked chips (bought at Sam's Club). Getting the multi-grain version at retail outlets is difficult at best and impossible in larger bags than 8 oz.  Stacy's is still on the pricey side no matter where it's bought but Amazon has the best value.  Too bad Stacy's doesn't make a more nutritious 100% Whole Wheat variety (the multi-grain pita chip is NOT 100%) but it's still better (fiber content)than the Simply Naked product, and was delivered on time with nary a broken chip in any of the bags (almost finished the entire box). These are the best chips out there for serving with dips and especially hummus!

review/summary: WOW!  All four of my cats love this stuff!
review/text: I highly recommend the Pinnacle brand. I buy the Pinnacle chicken and tuna for my four Cats, because it's a Holistic Cat food without the animal by-products and doesn't have all the grain fillers, which is what I was looking for.  I checked the listed ingredients on several brands before I bought the first cans to try, and decided to get three cans of each brand. Pinnacle was the only brand my babies would eat.  They just sniffed at their bowls, then walked away without eating it, which I can't blame them for, considering all the YUCK! stuff in some of them.  I ended up giving the other cans away.  My two Ragdolls go absolutely wild for their Pinnacle everyday, like it has catnip in it.  If I'm late feeding them, they follow me around the house and just beg.  They can hear the can top popping from the other end of the house, too!  It's so funny to watch them and hear the little meows. My two boys just can't wait for me to put it in their bowls...they're gobblin' it faster then I can dish it out.  So, I'll keep on buying it on Amazon (my local pet stores don't stock it).

review/summary: RANCID!
review/text: Any whole grains that are cracked open can go rancid easily, as they contain higher fat content than their processed versions.  That's why it is recommened you store whole grain flour in a freezer, only up to several months.  I don't know if it is the manufacturer or Amazon who did not warehouse these cans properly, but they are BAD!  I usually read many reviews before I make purchase decisions, but as I did not have any problem with one can of this multigrain before, I did not bother to check this time.<br /><br />Well, after a week of consuming this, my baby got sick.  As we were expermenting with variety of solid food, we weren't sure what was giving him diarrhea.  We removed almost everything from his diet over the course of that week, until we were left with this cereal and his formula.  Only then, it dawned on me that it could be this cereal, again, with which he didn't have any problem before.  As I read some reviews only at that point, some parents had pointed out these were rancid, and I could confirm my can smelled bad as well.<br /><br />Too bad Amazon would not accept returns on these products.  The trouble we went through warrants more than a refund - my baby developed a severe diaper rash due to constant bowl movement, and we ended up seeing a pediatrian to get a prescription for his open-blistered bottom.  This was his first diaper rash ever, and no diaper rash cream would help as he was going too frequently.  I feel terrible for not checking when I first opened this box.  Please learn from my mistake and DON'T BUY THIS!

review/summary: Not so happy mommy
review/text: While I typically like the Happy baby products, I was very disappointed with this product. Unfortunately when I opened the first of six containers it smelled stale as if it had been sitting on the shelf for a very long time. I decided to mix up a bowl but after tasting a bite, it confirmed my initial thought--it was old despite the expiration date. My guess is that I received a bum batch however, I am not willing to try it again when there are other organic cereals I have been happy with.<br /><br />I will say I was extremely pleased with Amazon's customer service. Although this item was non-returnable, they still issued a refund to me promptly.

I thought is was such  great idea to have multigrain cereal just like what I eat.<br />BIG MISTAKE.<br />This gave my baby the most horrible gas and it took me months to realize it was the cereal causing this. Only when my mother-in-law said "Boy, if I eat whole grain cereal in the evening, i act like a trumpet all night" did I think. "Waou, maybe it's the cereal".<br />I've stopped giving her this and no more crying, arching and farting!

review/summary: probably good, just not for my baby
review/text: My baby has the milk protein allergy and also seems allergic to soy. I am exclusivley breastfeding, so once I cut dairy and soy out, he was a very happy non-gassy baby who slept better at night. It was time to start rice cereal...I started a little before his 6 month birthday and I found this brand because of all the reviews. I neededsomething that would not upset his tummy. We tried it for a few nights. My baby loved it...he took down every bite with a spoon. Unfortunately, though,he was up all night every night with gas. He also stopped having bowel movements for several days...before we started the cereal it was every day. I went online to ask if rice cereal could cause constipation/gas and I was alarmed by all the moms who had the same experience. I was hoping the happybellies cereal would prevent this, but it didn't. I have 6 cans of it since I couldn't buy one alone, so I'm not sure what to do with them. I went straight into giving him homemade baby food and both baby and his tummy love it...we started with avocado, then banana, squash, and now sweet potatoes. I know he still needs cereal, so I'm thinking about trying the oatmeal. I was so disappointed this cereal didn't work for him.

Since her diet is so restrictive we often add HAPPYBELLIES as a additional supplement for nutritional reasons.  This has been a lifesaver for us.

review/summary: Revised and Yummy
review/text: I have purchased and tried all Happy Baby products and have liked them all (or at least my children have liked them all).  I really enjoy reading peoples' product reviews to see what they think of the products that I am thinking of buying.  I have to say I was a bit concerned about the number of negative reviews that were posted on the oatmeal cereal.  I bought it many years ago for my oldest child when she was a baby and we loved it, now we are buying it for my youngest child and she too is a big fan.  All of the negative reviews that I saw were 2010-2011 (back when I wasn't buying the product).  I don't know if things were changed, but my newest addition is enjoying the oatmeal just as much...if not more than my older one did.  I am really happy with the quality, quantity for the price and healthiness of the product.  We use the cereal as just plan cereal for the little one, but also got some great recipes off of the Happy Baby website and have made some other great snacks for the older one as well. It is a definite buy again and hope that Happy Baby continues to make such great, healthy products.

review/summary: Toxic Hexane used in extraction of DHA
review/text: I bought both the rice and oatmeal 6 packs.  The cans clearly state they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek).  If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae.  Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane.  Will never reccommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid.  I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead.

Now that we have our second, I'm going to seek out an iron-fortified rice cereal that DOES NOT have DHA crap added in. We're breastfeeding, so why jam in more synthetically-derived, solvent-extracted DHA? The manufacturer has been suspiciously silent on this issue, so I'm not convinced they are "above board" on their product's purity.

I've tried the rice and multi-grain cereals too but prefer the consistency of the oatmeal better than the multi-grain (which is a good cereal too but was more flakey and "soft".
