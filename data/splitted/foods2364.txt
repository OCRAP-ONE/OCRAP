review/summary: Excellent taste, very convenient packaging, great for lunch
review/text: I've been having one of these for lunch regularly, paired with whole wheat crackers;<br />it's a quick and filling lunch, protein packed,<br />and very tasty (the Sweet and Spicy flavor is especially good, and so is the Hickory Smoked one).<br /><br />And the convenience is unbeatable - there's no need for refrigeration,<br />all you need is a fork or spoon and a napkin, and a paper plate if you want one.<br /><br />You can always add some fresh green salad or fruits to round off the meal.<br /><br />I've actually lost about 8 pounds over the last month, and some or most of that has to do<br />with having this for lunch instead of eating out.<br /><br />The cost seems to vary across grocery stores, from $1.79 per packet to about $3.50.<br /><br />Regarding mercury contents in tuna, the MA state guidelines have this to say:<br /><br />Can I eat canned tuna?<br />Yes. "Light" tuna as opposed to "Chunk<br />White" tuna (also called albacore) contain lesser amounts of mercury.<br />Consumers should eat no more than 12 ounces per week.<br />Very small children, including toddlers, should eat less than 12 ounces per week.

review/summary: Excellent flavor
review/text: I love this coffee, especially for every day use. It has a light flavor, not overly sweet - so it is good for daily drinking - and very low acid. I especially like that it is part of the Newman organization and that their company gives a percentage of all proceeds to their foundation, so when you use their products, you are helping children get well, be healthy, and have better lives. But even if you don't care about that, then you might care that it is organic. This term is highly regulated in the U. S., so the use of it means that the product is healthier that those products that don't carry the tag, and it is just good ocffee!

(Pack of 12) 20.4 oz. net</a><br />I purchased these cookies in the store several times and thought they were a great alternative to other indulgences.  When I saw them on Amazon, I thought it would be a super savings.  However, these cookies must be fresh, or they are simply not worth eating.  The photo above is a very good sample of some very old and dried out cookies.  When they were received in fresh condition, they were excellent, with soft moist cake and marshmallow and a chocolate coating that was a solid, shiney dark brown.  In this photo above you can see a very dried out product with an old and  pale, discolored coating.  I ordered 3 seperate times, 1st box was "great"  other two were not even edible.  1 FOR 3 MAKES THEM A VERY POOR VALUE.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XOQZC">Nabisco Snack Wells Creme Sandwich Cookies 1.7 oz.

review/summary: Thank Goodness For These Little Tasty Snacks
review/text: I could eat a devils food cake a day. . .but then, I'd be so big I would require my own zip code.  So I'm darn glad the folks at Nabisco came up with SNACKWELL'S DEVILS FOOD COOKIES.  These are the real deal:  a little devils food cake, surrounded by a marshmellow layer, covered in chocolate.  Zero fat, zero cholesterol, only 50 calories--but this little snack sure doesn't taste like no fat/no cholesterol.  It tastes like sheer indulgence, and that's always a good thing.<br /><br />So I always keep a box around when the sweet tooth starts to take over and I'm needing some guilt-free pleasure.  SNACKWELL'S DEVILS FOOD COOKIES.  Devilishly good.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/summary: Loaded with sugars and contains undeclared fats; not a health food
review/text: People, learn how to read nutrition labels. Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the "Fat Free" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type "snackwell devil food nutrition facts" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that "Fat Free" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other "health-conscience" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore "helpful review" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics.

review/summary: A good deal?
review/text: I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.  I thought that was kinda "iffy", and the cookies were a bit worn (they had that patina of old chocolate), but they were edible, so, okay.  In April, the expiration date was sometime in the far future (September or October of 2011), so I figured the March shipment was a fluke.  In May, the expiration date was *again* 12 March 2011!!  They were PAST expiration.<br /><br />Of course, I'm a carb freak so that didn't stop me from eating them, but, C'MON!!  I'm almost scared to get my next shipment.

At one time FD had duplicated Nabisco's packaging, now its in a green and white box. These Devil's Food cookies cost $1.00 as oppposed to N's supermarket prices of close to $4.00 if not on sale. They are probably made in the the same factory. Plus they have a money back guarantee.

I'd suggest this bulk purchase to anybody who wants to break free of the $1.25 to $1.75 per pack that a vending machine or the cafeteria will wring out of you...even a convenience store gets right around that same amount, too, so again, just about the best price I can find!!!! =)

review/text: I remember seeing these cookies and imagining how nasty they must taste. I tempted myself into trying some and was quite delighted. Granted, they are not the best cookies (that title belongs to Keebler's Soft Batch) but they are certainly an excellent substitute for those who like to eat cookies and not worry too much about weight. They're quite expensive at the stores (between $3.5-4.5 a box) so I ordered them in bulk from Amazon which bought per box cost down to $2.50.

review/summary: Not a ringer for Nabisco!
review/text: I can't speak for anyone else, but I am most definitely not a spokesperson for Nabisco!  I love these cookies.  They are super yummy,not too sweet, not too "blah."  They do not taste like a "diet" cookie.  I like these as well, probably better, than your normal, everyday "who cares about weight" cookie.<br /><br />I will say this.  I am not a fan of marshmallow.  I don't like marshmallow peeps, marshmallow in cookies, marshmallow "moon pies," any of that. I DO however, like the marshmallow in these cookies.  So that said, it means the marshmallow in the Snackwells is very different than what you find in the above-mentioned snack/sweets.  Therefore if you do like the peeps, moonpies, etc., you may or may not like the Snackwells.  However, the marshmallow is such a small part of this cookie, I don't think it will matter.  The star of this show is the fudgy chocolate.<br /><br />For the person who felt the cookies were bad, I wonder if there could have been a small hole in the packaging and they were, in fact, stale.  I don't typically have any sitting around long enough to go stale, but when I do, they do lose their positive attributes!<br /><br />I think my only "complaint" about this cookie is the fact they are so good, I end up eating too many, taking away any advantage of the fewer calories they contain.

review/text: I loved the drinks. I had been wanting to try this for a long time and this was the first time I found a variety pack for a reasonable cost. The shipping is pretty high though. Unfortunately I bought this specifically because of its variety and there must have been a problem in the packaging because it only came with one kind of pearl tapioca. ZERO COMPANY RESPONSE. I tried writing the company three times over five - six weeks and NEVER received a reply. At first I wanted to exchange it, then return it still no response then I asked for a refund from Amazon (Very high marks for Amazon)<br />End of story. The drinks were great, especially for the novelty factor. Questionable if the shipping is worth it. The company's consumer support is non-existent. I would buy the drinks again; just not from this company.

The tapioca pearls have to be cooked, so they're not instant, but since you're doing it yourself, I think they taste better, and you have more ability to make it taste "just right" according to your preferences. More flavor options for the kit would be good, giving the customers the ability to choose 4 flavors, etc.

I vaguely remember somebody mentioning they didn't try the taro for the fear of what it would be.<br />So I tried it first, tastes like oreos and it's purple. -haha.<br />The black milk tea, not quite my tastes, but I'm not a big 'tea' person but it was alright.<br />Mine came with all black pearls, none of the clear pearls, which is fine I didn't really care.<br />Fantastic.

review/summary: Safety Instructions for coca tea
review/text: High quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />Organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All coca tea Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods. An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store coca tea products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea.

review/summary: WARNING***COCA LEAF TEA WILL SHOW POSITIVE FOR COCAINE IN DRUG TEST***
review/text: My boyfriend just got fired from his job b/c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b/c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as "illegal" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that "coca leaf" is a schedule II substance and illegal.  [...]<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court.<br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com.

review/summary: Exotic Coffee
review/text: I am an admitted coffee snob and am very picky about my coffee. It must be perfect, or I will simply leave it be. After years of Starbucks, I tried Cameron's coffee and am hooked. Cameron's Intense French Roast is by far the best French Roast on the market. If you like strong, rich coffee without a burnt taste, this is the one. Now, if you do not like strong,  European coffee do not buy this coffee. It is strong, rich, intense coffee just like it says. My neighbors have been known to come visiting just from the aroma of this blend. I highly recommend this brand, this flavor, and even recommend it in decaf. It can sit in the pot for several hours without burning; now, that some coffee!

It is also really good for making chocolate milk.  The natural sweetness of milk makes it taste quite decadent and certainly better for your body than chocolate syrup!

review/text: This is a fairly decent, commercial berbere mixture.  It has a fair bit of heat, owing to a large amount of cayenne/red pepper flakes (some of which seemed to have missed the grinder).  The balance in flavors isn't what you would expect from a fresher product or if you ground/toasted your own spices but it gets the job done particularly if you like your wats spicy.  However, for the price this isn't a good value.  The American Spices Berbere sold here has a deeper, balanced flavor profile and is vastly cheaper than this product.

review/summary: A spicy little shell game!
review/text: This Zamouri berbere spice that i received did NOT have the same list of ingredients that are listed here for their Berbere. It contains no chili peppers even though Berbere should contain five (5) different peppers; but unfortunately this mix DOES contain BOTH cumin AND tumeric.<br /><br />Most ardent Ethiopian foodies know NOT to include tumeric with the cumin in Berbere spice. They are not used together in the same dish.  Ethiopian dishes are made with one or the other, but not both.  Also. the ingredients were listed in a completely different sequence, which changes the taste considerably, not to mention how much the lack of chili peppers changes the balance, keeping it way too bland, and without any heat.<br /><br />Fortunately, i live in Los Angeles where there is an Ethiopian section of town where injera and classic berbere can be purchased. I ordered a lot of Moroccan spices from Zamouri, and added the berbere just to try a new product.

review/summary: A really great classic breakfast cereal--but not so nutritious
review/text: Frosted Flakes has always been my favorite cereal. It's sweet, crunchy and it keeps for at least a year after you buy it. It has some vitamins packed in as well and that's a plus. The cereal gives you a sugar kick which is great on those mornings when it's hard to get started. It's even fun to eat without milk!<br /><br />On the other hand, it's not the most nutritious cereal you could buy. It lacks any real vitamin punch; and the sugar is terrible for your teeth! Brush your teeth after eating this to compensate for the sugar.<br /><br />Overall, however, Kellogg's Frosted Flakes are fun to eat and they do have some nutritional value. This is no substitute for real vitamins and the sugar can be a lot for your teeth to take. It's a great breakfast cereal especially if you want a sugar kick and you take a moment of two to brush your teeth after eating it. If you're careful about the effects of the sugar, I would recommend this cereal for all ages! SMILE

I had heard so many wonderful things about "Jamaican Blue"...Boy was I disappointed.<br />First of all, when I ground the beans, there were these husk-like particles that flew all over my counter.  I just thought it must be a particular characteristic of this "special" type of coffee.  I don't think so...the coffee was just "ok". Nothing special at all to me.  I have tried lots of different coffees and this one just isn't that good. And, it definitely is NOT WORTH the money in my opinion...especially for the extra shipping cost!  Actually, I wanted to send it back, but found out that it "isn't eligible for return".<br />If you truly want my opinion, order coffee from [...]. It is THE BEST COFFEE I HAVE EVER HAD....hands down...regular or decaf, it doesn't matter...THE BEST..and the price is VERY reasonable.<br />I will NEVER order "Reggie's Roast" coffee beans again but, will definitely continue ordering from Amazon.<br />If you truly love coffee, don't order coffee beans online if you don't know for sure they will be FRESH

review/summary: Nature Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal
review/text: I truly like this brand of Cereal. It's crunchy and low calarie with all good healthy ingredients.  The flax taste initially takes a little bit to get used to.  I mix in fresh berry fruits such as rasberries, blueberries or blackberries which enhances the cereal flavor. It is also a good deal to purchase under the special promotions for grocery products. The only downside to watch for is the packaging expiration date. I found that the expiration date is relatively short. For example, I purchased this product in May '09 and it will expire in July '09. It comes in a pack of 6 boxes each weighing 10.6 oz. If you are a big cereal eater, that shouldn't be a problem.

review/summary: good overall ingredients, very poor proportions
review/text: I should have been more careful in checking ingredients and get very angry when products purport to be healthful (ie, organic, gluten free, top-notch and unusual grains) but miss the mark.<br /><br />Nature's Path describes this as "...cereal of flax, corn and amaranth." Now look at the ingredients which, of course, are listed from most to least. The first 2 are cornmeal and corn flour--hardly the most nutritious of grains. Third is organic evaporated cane juice yielding 4 grams of sugar per serving, and then come the flax, buckwheat, quinoa and amaranth.<br /><br />JUST HOW MUCH OF THESE SUPER GRAINS CAN POSSIBLY BE INCLUDED if the 3rd highest ingredient is the sugar at 4 grams?!<br /><br />And that's another pet peeve: why any added sugar at all. Most health-conscious consumers do not want added sugars, even cane juice.  And this also leads me to question the "nutrition facts" posted on the products. If cane juice is the 3rd item in quantity, and corn has a relatively high sugar content, can there really be only 4 grams of sugar per serving?

It's light enough to munch on to keep my energy up, without giving me a sugar crash later, and the fiber fills me up. It can be difficult to get quality, convenient whole grains on a gluten free diet, but this cereal helps out.<br />i love that I can fill up a big bowl without consuming tons of calories (I'm a volume eater!)<br />it has a light sweetness that makes it tasty to snack on plain, and mixed with nuts and dried fruit for a snack to go.<br />and of course its great with milk, yogurt, and mixed into smoothies. I highly recommend this cereal, its the best gluten free cereal I have tried, and I've tried lots!

review/summary: Is it really worth the money?  Lets see...
review/text: I am still experimenting with the best mix for me, but so far, the milk is too overwhelming for a person in me that likes his chocolate/cereal/etc. with his milk rather than the other way around.  In other words, I'm tasting too much of the milk and it's not a taste I care for.  It is better than the cheap stuff like store brand or Swiss, etc. but I would much rather use it in my espresso machine than boil off milk (will be one of my next experiments).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Very good chocolate.  I have used the straight cooking based Ghiradelli cocoa and it is intense, but good actually in an espresso type situation.  I'm thinking this stuff should be a bit less intense than the cocoa made for cooking and be even better for my personal purpose with it.<br /><br />-Beats the store brand or use with water stuff if you either have the mix down or do not mind the extra milky taste.<br /><br />-Even though milk has to be used and milk does cost more than free water, the chocolate is not only worth it but cost to cost, the intensity level of Ghiradelli vs. Swiss or other is a lot higher.  In other words, while Swiss may be cheaper on paper, it will take a TON more to get to the same intensity level as Ghiradelli AND it will not taste as good.  So the having to buy milk is really the only additional cost factor going on here.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-I have yet to figure out a good enough potion that makes the taste less milky.  If I cannot figure one out, I will have to downgrade this review for the product being of use for only specific people or applications.<br /><br />-Have to buy milk and with such a nice chocolate, I'd recommend an organic or nice albeit expensive milk.  I will update this review if I find that using water/espresso machine/etc. factors can take the a good bit of milk out of the equation.<br /><br />So there you have it.  More pros than cons from me, though I am only partially satisfied at this point.  Will update if I can figure out how to nail down better solutions to my liking, and if anything, I can always use it how I did with the Ghiradelli type made for cooking!  Afterall, I bought this hoping it would make good hot cocoa, but knowing it would be top quality chocolate that I could at least toss into my espresso mixes if it didn't work out.

review/summary: way too much sugar and too little cocoa bean
review/text: If you had a real hot chocolate in Europe before tasting the rich aroma of cocoa beans and were lucky enough to try some of the ready made cocoa mixes from Switzerland or Germany (e.g. from companies like Hachez, Lindt, Movenpick) than this Double Chocolate product from Ghirardelli is a bitter disappointment. It is way too sweet (too much sugar) and has too little cocoa beans in it (to maximize profits). I am almost done with one of the 16oz tins and will not buy this product again nor can I recommend it. Too be quite frankly honest, it is not just Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mix that is too sweet, it is pretty much impossible to find a good-quality-lower-in sugar-and-richer-in-cocoa hot cocoa mix in the States. And no, I am not willing to pay 12 bucks for a hot cocoa tin from Godiva, that is a rip off.

I also enjoy the Ghiridelli shop in the gas light area of San Diego when there on business. Mama mia that place smells so delicious! However, this particular hot coco mix is simply too rich and overly sweet. Almost on the undrinkable side of things. My kids actually dislike it for this reason and prefer Swiss Miss packets. Reviews here indicate it's good for making cafe mochas mixed with coffee, but I haven't tried that yet.

review/summary: The secret: need to mix it with a whisk!
review/text: I've bought Ghirardelli hot chocolate before, but it was a different type.  The Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix doesn't mix well with hot milk, and you have to smash it up against the side of the cup with your spoon to break up the blobs of powder.<br /><br />This hot chocolate isn't as sweet as the other Ghirardelli cocoa I've bought before.  All in all, I'm a bit disappointed in its suitability for hot chocolate, but might try using it for baking just so it doesn't go to waste.<br /><br />Update: I've found out after a lot more experimentation that the only way to make this hot chocolate mix correctly is with a whisk.  A spoon simply will not do.  If you mix it with a whisk, the chunks break up and the hot chocolate blends pretty well with the milk.  I still wouldn't use as much in a single glass as the directions on the canister indicate, but the hot chocolate is okay with a little added sugar and/or a few drops of flavoring.  I've bumped my rating up, but I still think they should mention in the directions that you need to mix it with a whisk.

I dontaed the other 3 cans to the food pantry.<br />There is no flavor to it - just makes the milk kind of greasy until you add about 5 or 6 scoops - then you get at least a chocolate flavor.

review/summary: Really good for a mix
review/text: In the category it's in, I rate this 5 stars.  Sure, there are higher quality cocoas and chocolates out there, but for the price, and the ease of use, this rates high in my 'recipe' book.  This does have a bit more sweetness than what I would normally drink, but adding semi-sweet chocolate chips to the cup cuts down on that aspect.<br /><br />I use the Back to Basic Hot Cocoa/Latte maker and it does a wonderful job of mixing all lumps out (of any brand) and heating my hot chocolate or hot cocoa fast and thoroughly.  The difference is that hot chocolate is made by melting chocolate bars or morsels, it has a higher cocoa butter content than your cocoas.  I sometimes use a mix of both cocoa powder and a handful of chocolate, makes for a decadent hot drink.  I also use a splash of heavy cream with whole milk to make my hot cocoa, it makes it extra rich and creamy.  Don't forget to add a few drops of real vanilla extract to add a sublime nuance to your cocoa and chocolate drinks.  I also enjoy mixing a few brands of cocoa powders and chocolate bars to make outrageous hot cocoa/hot chocolate drinks.  I haven't tried the frozen hot chocolate by a famous restaurant (S3) yet, but this brand, along with others I purchased on Amazon will all be thrown into the mix :)<br /><br />This mixes smoothly, is slightly sweeter than others I use, has a perfect color, and the powder is very finely milled making it excellent for sprinkling on top of cappuccino or whipped cream.  Not bitter, just a good chocolate taste that comes through.  Can't beat it for the connoisseur hot cocoa drinker to add to their arsenal.

review/summary: Milk Only!!
review/text: Only to be made with heated milk!  My wife tried to experiment with water the other night, much to her dismay.<br /><br />But, provided you use milk - this is really some of the finest U.S.-made hot chocolate (as anyone who's tried knows, nothing here really compares to a good Belgian or Swiss hot chocolate) made from a powder that either one of us has ever tasted.  Each tin uses a bit more powder than we expected (only about 12 servings per tin), but the quality really is top notch... and when we run out, we're likely to restock with this same variety.

review/summary: Great Hot Chocolate
review/text: I have always used this hot chocolate.  It is excellent.  I used to buy it at Whole Foods but the price there went up to an outrageous $7.99 a can so I decided to try buying it from Amazon.  I am always worried about ordering food online as I am concerned that I can't see the expiration date.  The date was over a year in advance on the hot chocolate so I know I can use up the four cans in that time span.

review/summary: Great for coffee and makes a rich hot cocoa
review/text: I don't like the hot cocoa mixes that include sugar, milk solids, milk chocolate and ingredients I can't pronounce.  Ghiradelli Double Chocolate is my go to choice.  I like adding it to my coffee instead of sugar... and it makes a very rich, delicious cup of hot cocoa.  I was nervous to try it based on some of the reviews, but now it's the only hot cocoa we use.  High recommended.

review/summary: Great hot chocolate
review/text: I love this hot chocolate, it is really easy to make as well.  We used to use Hershey's powdered coco and add sugar, vanilla, and salt, but this is a lot quicker and taste much better.  That being said, it is typically only $2.99 a can at local stores and $4.50-$5.00 a can on Amazon is twice the price.

review/summary: Not your average hot chocolate.
review/text: My wife and I LOVE the Ghirardelli Brownie mixes, so when I found this hot chocolate mix, I ordered without batting an eye.  Upon receiving the order, I eagerly heated a cup of milk.  The first taste was surprising.  After five or six cups, I have decided that I like it better than any other brand chocolate mix that I have ever tasted.<br /><br />Usually, I make a double batch, with works perfectly in our mugs.<br /><br />That being said I also ordered the hazelnut flavored mix that I actually prefer more.

review/summary: High quality hot chocolate, but you must use milk
review/text: I'm a big fan of Ghiradelli chocolate bars, especially the 80-90% cocoa dark chocolate.  I wanted to try this product because I find Swiss Miss and Nestle's hot chocolate mixes to be too sweet and targeted more towards our kids.<br /><br />I was delighted with this hot chocolate the first time I made it.  I used whole milk and gently heated it in a pan until it was just steaming, then added the hot cocoa mix.  The powder dissolved easily and the smell of quality chocolate wafting from my mug made my mouth water.  And the flavor was divine - deep, dark, complex, with a nearly coffee flavor. It was mildly sweet, just like dark chocolate should be.  This was not something my kids would enjoy, which is why I keep my Ghiradelli Premium Hot Cocoa mix on a high shelf and only fix it for my husband and me.<br /><br />I read a few reviews where people weren't happy with the taste of it - be sure to use milk and not water.  This is pure cocoa powder and doesn't have any milk in it.

review/summary: Excellent Chocolate Taste
review/text: This is a fantastic product.  It does take quite a bit per serving and that may be why they offer 4 cans.  However, as a hot chocolate mix with milk, it is excellent in taste and mixes very well and easily.  We have not tried their other flavors and will probably not since my family loves this flavor.  We make our hot chocolate using the Cocomotion Machine by Mr. Coffee.  We will certainly order this hot cocoa mix again when we run out.  The instructions are easy to follow and they are correct in their recommendation on how much to use per serving and how to reduce that if their original recommendations yields a sweeter taste than you like.  We generally used 3 tablespoons versus the recommended 4 per 8 ounces of milk.  We have not used this with water only, but with 1% organic milk and it makes a very tasty hot chocolate with a creamy consistency.
