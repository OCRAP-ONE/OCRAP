review/text: Feridies has the best peanuts -- large and perfectly roasted.  The spicing is nice but a little too salty -- ironically, the salted variety is less salty and in my view tastier than the smoked variety.

review/summary: Moliterno Black Truffle Pecorino Cheese
review/text: I was very disappointed when I received the cheese.  I ordered this to take to my sister-in-law's house for Easter (we both had it a relative's house and loved it).  The taste of the cheese without the truffle, is really nothing special.  But with a large amount of black truffle, it's wonderful!

review/summary: Pre-measured servings, convenient for take out lunches and those who count calories!
review/text: I buy the Kraft Parmesan Grated cheese every month. I love the taste and put in on a lot of foods. There are two downsides to a regular container: it is tough to measure out servings, and once the container has been in the fridge for a day or so, the cheese begins to stick together (then you have to open the container and use a fork to break the cheese up; pain in the neck!).<br /><br />The individual packages are the perfect solution. One package is about two table spoons (one serving). I typically use two packages at a time (it is great for those who are counting calories!). The packages do not have to be stored in the fridge, hence no sticking of the cheese. They can be taken out to work, school, on a picnic. The price is comparable to the price of the cheese in a regular container. I hope Amazon will stock the light parmesan packages soon!<br /><br />Bon Appetit!

review/text: This is one of the worst ideas I've ever seen. The wastefulness of this packaging is incredible. By buying this item you are contributing to filling of landfills, environmental destruction, and overwhelming inefficiency. Furthermore, on a per-ounce basis this item is considerably more expensive than cheese in large canisters. Avoid this silly product if you care about the environment or your wallet!

review/summary: Drinking tea is fun!
review/text: These flowering teas are a wonder to behold and fun to watch.  The tea ball, right out of the package, looks like a funny colored nut with the scent of tea and jasemin.  Place it in the bottom of a tea cup or tea pot (the best show happens in an all glass one), and add hot, but not boiling water, sit back and watch.  It's amazing to see it open up into a beautiful bouquet.  The green leaves are the tea (green scented with jasmin) and the flower are one a 12 different selections.  As one person said to me, "tea flowers make you sit and relax in a go-go-go world."  I would recomend this to anyone who loves tea.

review/summary: Title is a little misrepresentative
review/text: Assorted Green Tea Flowers should be called Assorted Jasmine Green Tea Flowers.  It's the blooms that are assorted not the tea flavor.  They are all Jasmine.  Having said that, it's a wonderful surprise when you put in the bud and don't know what kind of flower you're going to be getting next!<br /><br />Usually when I buy Jasmine Tea I get the finest- A small 4 ounce bag that runs me  $20 and although this tea isn't as good as what I regularly buy it's still very nice tasting.  The best part is that it's practically impossible to overbrew.  Jasmine Tea in particular can get really bitter easily if it is overbrewed even a bit and I was afraid I would have to take the flower out after a couple of minutes to stop the brewing process.  But NO!  The makers thought ahead and made it so that you can leave the flower in and it won't overbrew.  The only bad thing about this is that if you like your Jasmine Tea really strong then you won't like the way this works for you.  But strong Jasmine Tea is always bitter so you might want to try a lighter brew like this.<br />Hint: If you never liked the way Jasmine Tea tasted because of it's bitterness here's a trick.  Standard instructions for Jasmine include having your water at around 180 degrees and brewing for aprox 2 minutes.  Instead of this, try using a lower temperature instead- say 130ish and brew for 7 minutes.  What you'll get is a tea with all the Jasmine and none of the bitterness.  With these flowers however you don't have to worry about brewing time (unless you like your tea VERY weak) and are free to enjoy the flower until your tea is gone.

Also you can get more than one pot of tea from a tea flower so they last longer than a normal "tea bag" does.  In my opinion this would make a perfect gift for ANY occasion for anyone that likes tea.

review/summary: Flowering Teas Exquisite
review/text: Who knew that enjoying a cup of tea could be a treat to the eyes as well as the taste buds?  Primula is evidently a label to be trusted for quality as I find each tea a delight.  The aroma and taste are only rivalled by the spectacle seen as they bloom when introduced to hot water. No narrative can do justice to the experience.  These teas need to be experienced first hand and not vicariously.  I bought the Primula 12 oz. Personal Glass Mug Tea Maker (3 piece set) with Loose Leaf Tea Infuser which came with a bonus Tea Flower.  I was immediately hooked and now must search to satisfy my addiction.  I fully recommend this product to anyone who likes tea and especially advise the use of a glass infuser in order to get the full experience.  Bravo Primula!!

review/summary: Lousy tea, no flowers
review/text: This product was a huge disappointment. I bought this planning to serve it at a Witches Tea party. It's a good thing I did a "rehearsal brew" first, because this was an absolute dud. The product is packaged attractively, but with no instructions. However, I'd read enough about presentation teas to know the procedure, which I followed carefully. Using my brand new, purchased-just-for-this borosilicate glass teapot, I chose a tea ball and placed it in the empty pot, then gently poured in very hot - but not boiling - water. The tea ball immediately floated and bobbed around as it slowly unfurled into a mass resembling a clump of seaweed. Eventually a whitish mess became visible in the middle, not in any way resembling the gorgeous yellow blossom pictured on the tea packet. Although disappointed, I thought the "flower" looked pretty creepy and just might work, since it was a Witches Tea after all. When the correct steeping time was reached, I poured a small cup of the heavenly fragranced tea to sample it. UGH. So bitter and vile, even witches wouldn't want it! I tried adding some honey, but still couldn't drink it. Really nasty stuff!<br /><br />I'm going to try another variety, just in case that one ball was defective. If I get better results, I'll post an update. But as of now, Primula Flowering Tea gets two thumbs down from me.

But the Primula Gift set is wonderful.  The green leaves unfurled and revealed flowers with red and sometimes white blooms.  Not sure how they accomplished that, but the display has got my children begging to drink tea.<br /><br />The flavors are nice, similar to what I am served in asian restaurants.  I like the taste better than name brand boxed teas.  I also like that the flavor is maintained even after adding hot water for a third steep.<br /><br />I received the Primula set as a gift and I'm addicted to the flavor and the appearance!  Highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Pleasing to both eye and taste
review/text: I purchased this tea for my sister's birthday present.  We were both enchanted by the display as the hand-tied tea ball unfolded into a lovely flower.  However, the best was yet to come.  Primula teas are delicious.  The green tea is robust with just a subtle hint of jasmine.  Furthermore, you can infuse the flowers three times in a small tea pot.  You will definately want a clear glass tea pot to display these lovely flowers.  I highly recommend this tea to anyone who loves tea.

review/summary: Not my cat's favorite..
review/text: I had to take all these back to the store after I purchased them for my cat. He just hated it and wouldn't touch it. I think the cuts got stuck in his teeth too much and they were just tougher for him to chew. He prefers the sliced variety much more so than this filet version. He just won't eat these filets so it's definitely the sliced in our house. He loves turkey but just wouldn't touch this stuff. It seems as if the sliced version is easier for a cat to chew since they are more tender than these filets, so I'm sure that's probably the reason. Maybe try one of these first before buying a bunch like I did just to see what your cat likes.  They looked and smelled more like people food so I thought they'd be a "go" but apparently not!

review/summary: Possibly the best small dog food
review/text: I've got a small poodle-mix. I've tried almost every premium food for my dog. With completely grain free foods, I've seen the coat dry out and become dull. Solid Gold produced too much gas. Canidae ALF and grain-free went too stale for her taste in less than two weeks. The other foods I've attempted simply were rejected.<br /><br />Wellness Small Breed to me is a miracle. She will even eat it without having to load it up with cheese. Her coat is a shiny silver. She's actually grown a healthy undercoat. Like most little dogs with allergies, I've noticed the eye discharge is minimal compared to other foods.<br /><br />So for any super-finicky small dog parent, I would definitely recommend this kibble.

review/summary: My picky dogs eats every piece!
review/text: I have a three year old yorkipoo who has always been extremely picky about his food.  We had some success (by "some success" I mean he'd eat half of what he was supposed to) with the Prarie brand by Natures Variety, but he always had runny eye problems and had trouble keeping weight on.  My mother's vet recommended the Wellness brand for her dog to lose weight and suggested I try the small breed formula for my picky dog. I'm so glad I tried it! Since switching my dog to the Wellness small breed formula my dog eats every single piece.  I don't have to sit there and encourage him to eat. He willingly eats the whole bowl and cannot wait for his next meal. I'm convinced that I could feed him 5 times a day and he'd still eat every last piece because its just that good. I have never seen him so excited to eat! On top of this his coat is as soft as ever and his watery, running, cloudy eyes are completely clear. He has the same amount of small dog energy but doesn't seem as anxious when I leave (apparently filler in dog foods can cause anxiety in sensitive dogs).  I'm amazed at how great this product is working for my little man. Highly recommend for those with picky, small breed dogs.

review/summary: Hands down one of the best foods on the market today
review/text: I have two Basenjis both of who are under breed weight/size and who have corn allergies. I cannot stress enough how awesome this food has been for them. Their appetites are up, they are putting on weight, they have more energy where their other food (which was also on the Top Ten Dog Foods List) made them sluggish and caused one to lick a hole in herself. This food has given me my girls back and I recommend it highly to anyone who has issues with small breeds with allergies. I could go on and on about the differences but honestly, buy a bag and try it. There is nothing I can say that you won't see for yourself.

review/summary: One of the best dog food you can buy for the price
review/text: Ok let me clarify first of all, why I gave it 4/5 instead of 5/5.<br /><br />If it were to up to me alone, this food is 5/5.<br />The ONLY reason why I took 1 star off, is because my dogs hate the taste :(<br />I have a Pomeranian and a Maltese. Both of them would often just sniff the food, and walk away. They will eventually eat it when they are really hungry, but they just look very disinterested in the food overall. I have the same issue with Blue Buffalo.<br />However, when I alternate them to Orijen, or Taste of the Wild, or Acana, or Fromm, they pretty much gobble them down instantly. (I tend to alternate around different brands and flavors just to make sure they are not deficient in a specific nutrient/mineral).<br />This *small* problem is NOT universal. I have friends whose dogs love this food, and I have seen dogs that absolutely won't touch Wellness. Every dog has its preferences, so its best to experiment around.<br /><br />However, I like feeding my dogs WELLNESS most.<br />Their poop is solid and doesn't stink, and based upon the ingredients list, it seems really good!<br />No by-products<br />No corn<br />No fillers (well except for tomato pomace, which some people consider it as a filler. I personally don't)<br />Omega 3 and 6 levels are on the higher side (which is a big plus!) compared to other brands/foods!!! ^_^<br /><br />I have fed about 2 bags so far, and my dogs haven't had any health problems.<br /><br />Only thing I wish the product can improve, is to maybe include Chicken Fat, instead of using Canola Oil. That will probably make the taste much better for my dogs making them much more interested in it. Canola oil is a cheaper alternative, but its really not a biggie.<br /><br />This is definitely something I recommend to include in your feeding rotation!<br /><br />On the sidenote: if you do not want to risk having a 15 pound bag of food that your dog hates, contact Wellness for a sample! They will send a 4oz packet to you, so you can "test" if your dog likes it.

review/summary: She's licking the bowl twice a day!!
review/text: I have been trying to find a nutritious food for my picky 6 pound, 1 year old, terrier/poodle/mutt and runt of the litter. Went through Puppy Chow, generic puppy chow, and Iams and then I started reading up on dog foods- and boy, did I learn a lot! No more grocery store food unless it is an "emergency" where getting online is not possible or we run out before the shipment arrives. That stuff is pure crap.<br /><br />We then went through a bag of Orijen, which I think is an excellent food, but not for her. She would eat it with toppings only and rarely ate all of it. Stools were often loose- not to mention the gas.<br /><br />A tiny dog can only eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of food per day so he/she needs to eat it all and it needs to be packed with nutrition. Back to the drawing board since the Orijen didn't work!<br /><br />Next we tried the Wellness Super5Mix Adult Small Breed. She eats every bite and licks the dish and sometimes wants an evening snack of the plain Wellness kibble. She eats it without any topping but I do usually mix in a TBS of wet food (or cottage cheese) which Wellness recommends in order to give the dog a bit of extra fluid. We live in the desert, so that's important. Anyway, she REALLY loves that! She has cleaned her plate twice daily ever since I started her on this wonderful food. The stools are formed and no gas.<br /><br />It seems to be the perfect food for her- and maybe for other dogs too which is why I am writing this. It is such a relief to see her eating a good nutritious dog food and enjoying it.<br /><br />I would definitely give it a try if your dog has "pickyness"/appetite/digestion issues, or if you just want to provide 4 star nutrition. It costs more than the grocery store stuff, but a small dog doesn't eat much so I make it fit into my budget. I try to include it in with the occasional larger Amazon order and get  free shipping. It may be available in pet stores as well, but I have to go 15-20 miles out of town to find a pet store, so ordering online is easier.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this food.

review/summary: Everything my little guy needs
review/text: I can't say enough good things about this food.  I have a � Pomeranian � Yorkie mix.  I don't feed Jake human food and his meals are measured according to his size.  As he matured into an adult he started to get blocky looking.  His stools were loose and he was constantly eating grass and even other animals fecies.  After much research on line I determined that though I thought I was giving him good dog food, I in fact was not.  I narrowed it down to this as being the food that I was going to switch him to.  The difference is like night and day.  He now has the shape that he should  Broad in the chest and narrow down through his belly and hind end.  He no longer eats grass or other fecies.  His coat is softer and his eyes do not water near as much.<br /><br />I highly recommend this food.  As an aside, Holistic bought Wellness.  Once I finish this bag of food I am going to switch Jake to Holistic, not because Wellness is not excellent but because Holistic is one step above and they now have Small Breed food.  It is important if you have a small dog that you feed them food specially for small breeds.  The little ones need more protein and fiber because of the energy that they expend.<br /><br />Switch your dog to this or Holistic and you will not regret it.  You will see a change in less than a week.

review/summary: Havanese is a happy camper!
review/text: We have had our little guy on Purina Pro Small breed since we got him as a 1 year old. We are having some issues with him in regards to weight. He was getting far less than the recommended amount, but still within what our vet thought was OK. This was the same food he had been on at his breeder. I was reading labels and have never been happy that the Purina had such a large % as corn.<br /><br />We tried going with Orijen. That eliminated the objectionable grains, but doubled the protein %. He did not handle it well, even with a slow transition period. Stools changed to more greenish and became much larger, then eventually much less formed. He seemed happy to eat it, but apparently his GI tract did not agree. Back to reading labels.<br /><br /> I had used Wellness with cats before and had good response. Then I checked to see if it appeared on animal food recall lists during the 2007 rice gluten (melamine) scare - it was never recalled. The label guarantees no wheat, soy or corn. He transitioned amazingly well and is behaving very puppy-like. It will take months to see if this is going to be a good weight control choice, but in the mean time I feel better he is not getting any corn or soy.

review/text: Great dog food for the smaller dog.  I have two very picky Shih Tzus and they loved this kibble right from the start.  The kibbles are small, which are easier for the little dogs to eat.  My dogs both suffer from itching allergies.  These have all stopped since changing to this dog food.  I also have purchased the Wellness brand treats too and my dogs love them also.  I highly recommend this dog food!  Pet Food Direct is pretty fast on their shipping also when you buy through Amazon.

review/summary: The best!!
review/text: I have a 3 yr old toy poodle that has never been able to gain weight due to a liver disorder the vet has never been able to pinpoint. No matter what I tried to feed him,  he has never weighed more than 2.5 lbs, no energy, listless, thin coat and no matter how interested he seemed at first to diet changes or supplements, he quickly lost interest and barely ate. Being an extremely gentle and friendly dog, I feared he would not live a happy, normal life. Wellness small breed has been my dog's life saver!! He just finished the first bag and the change is remarkable! He now weighs almost 4 lbs, his coat is fuller, he is spunky and energetic like the young 3 yr old he is. It is not often one tries a new product and sees such obvious positive results. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Wellness!

review/summary: One of the best out there, and great for picky eaters!
review/text: As the proud owner of a very picky Jack Russell/Chihuahua mix, I feel it's my duty to share my dog food success story with others who have also struggled to find a quality food that their dog(s) will eat.  We have tried so many different foods, including expensive grain free formulas, with no luck.  Even if we could get Bandit to eat, he was bored with each brand within a few weeks, or sometimes even within a few days.  I started to become very concerned that we weren't ever going to find a food that he would be happy with, and then we found Wellness Small Breed.  This is the only food he's accepted and consistently eaten!  He usually gobbles it right up, and his coat is soooo shiny!  The smaller kibble is perfect for his little mouth... I think part of the problem with other brands was the kibble size.  He seemed to actually tire of chewing the bigger pieces.  This formula has tiny pieces that he can easily crunch, and he finishes the whole bowl! :)<br /><br />We LOVE Wellness in our house... currently in the process of using up the remainder of another brand so we can switch our 8 yr old Miniature Schnauzer over to a Wellness formula too!

review/text: For the last five years I have been lucky enough to own an unknown age rescue dog that is part Mexican dog and part English dog -- my guess.  About two years ago she started to have upset tummy/loose bowel problems and was constantly on vet medications and eating grass.<br /><br />While on a shopping trip with my daughter to get her pet food I talked with the (Austin, TX) Tomlinson's pet store stocker and she recommended Wellness Small Breed adult health.  Within three days my dog's health was fine.  This food has no corn and weird ingredients so I think this dog food is the reason she is completely off all vet medications and has her health back.<br /><br />I'm ready to buy this Wellness brand forever.

(she's a little overweight) lol she refuses to eat the Healthy weight so i Ordered for her a 12LB bag of this and she loves it.<br /><br />I ordered from Amazon. Shipping was fast and efficient. delivered to my door and package was easy to open.<br /><br />Amazon = Amazing + Happy Costumer :)

review/summary: Finally!!!
review/text: I went online and did some research on dry dog foods.  I thought of course that I just had to have a 5 star food.  What I now know is that  tons of protein is not always the best for every breed.  I started my three little dogs cavapoo 15 lbs cavachon 12 lb yorkie 5 lbs on Wellness Core which is I'm sure a wonderful food but the protein is rated at 36% which turned out to be far to rich for my little dogs. After talking with the breeder of my yorkie she explained that too much protein in some breeds can be taxing on the liver and kidneys. I saw this in my dogs right away so I knew I had to make a quick change.  I definately wanted to eliminate the gas and copious amount of poop do to the protein content so I checked with the other foods made by Wellness and found that the simple five mix has a lot of the same wonderful ingredients as the Core but with a much more practical protein content for my dogs life style at 28%.  The results were amazing, immediately I saw a reduction in the amount of poop fewer times outside as well.  Everybody seems happier and life is easier with all three dogs on the same kibble.  I'm THRILLED.  Thank You WELLNESS.  I would strongly recommend this product.  One more side note...I really appreciate the promise made by Wellness on the front of the bag.  IT STATES: NO meat by products corn or soy  and so on.  Check it out for yourself you will be glad you did:)

review/summary: Great product, worth the extra cost.
review/text: Usually after a new kibble is introduced, even with gradual transitioning, dog vomits right after meal time for a few weeks. But he has not vomited once after 2 weeks of this kibble. Switched from Blue Buffalo because of the protein to grain ratio and also quality of ingredients. Well worth the upgrade in terms of cost per pound.

review/summary: Great mixer with wet foods
review/text: My little terrier mix is certainly a picky eater - unless we're out on the sidewalk - where there is nothing, NOTHING he won't turn his nose up at!<br /><br />I've discovered he will gobble this up if I mix a handful of this dry mix with a tablespoon of the wet food also by Wellness <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFRYWU">Wellness Canned Dog Food for Adult Dogs, Turkey and Sweet Potato Recipe, 12-Pack of 12-1/2-Ounce Cans</a>... and maybe as a special little treat some cooked chicken or ham. It sometimes helps to give it 15 seconds in the microwave to release some of the smells and its seems to stimulate his appetite somewhat.<br /><br />It definitely feels like it's good for his energy and digestion. We were having problems with his previous diet - without being too graphic - to our GREAT relief, he's now never gassy and it's much easier to pick up after he's 'done his business'.

review/text: I purchased this food to give my shih tzu. We slowly introduced it by mixing it into his old food. Unfortunately my doggie can't tolerate it even though he loves it. We found that he'd vomit it up.<br /><br />So we switched to using this as a treat. He gets 5 to 10 little bits a few times a day as a reward. We still need to be careful. If we give him too many of the bits, he throws them up. But in the long run, a bag of this will last us a very long time and we will end up saving money on treats. And he loves the flavor!

review/text: This food may be very high in quality, but not all dogs can tolerate the high protein content.  Our Schnauzer / Lasa Ahpso mix was drinking water all the time and urinating frequently.  We looked on the bag and noticed the protein level was much higher than the old dog food (which was 21.5% protein, 13% fat) .<br /><br />To be fair: this is one of the few dog foods that is made in the U.S. and they do have another version (purple bag) with less protein.  We may try that some time.

review/text: I guess everyone has to do their own trial and error to see what works for their little fur friends. After researching alot about the best thing for dogs to eat, Wellness is one of the brands that has my respect... but...<br />it makes our little BOM (beagle/pomeranian) & our rough coated jack russell mix<br /> THIRSTY, FARTY & WEEPY. (that sounds like a bad mix of creepy dwarf names)<br /><br />To be fair, THEY LIKE IT... This small breed kibble is happily gobbled,then they insist on drinking aLOT! and then they fart a little bit, too....and it makes my terrier's eyes weepy, too... with those icky rust stains, and she NEVER has had that problem.<br /><br />So, we are back to our other favorites, which is the rabbit kibble from Nature's Variety Instinct, and the frozen PawNaturaw beef medallions, and of course, their fav breakfast is<br />a Stella and Chewy's Dandy Lamb dehydrated steak. (those don't make the girls thirsty!)<br />These choices are a little closer to the raw diet which I prefer to feed when I can.<br /><br />So, sorry, Wellness, we tried ya! We will finish the bag, but won't be buying any more...<br />I figure we got about a week of dog farts to suffer through yet.

But I do know that Wellness which is made by Diamond Pet Foods....are now being recalled.<br />This is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br />I loved this company's Grain Free dog food.<br />I loved that the first ingredient is actually the real meat.<br />My baby girl loved the food, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison mainly.<br />I searched relentlessly for a reasonable priced food that has no by-products, dyes and are grain free.<br />Which my lil' white Maltese needed for her horrible allergies and out of control tear stains.<br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

review/summary: Caviar That Not Really Worth It
review/text: I recently found this caviar product here on Amazon and was tempted to try it given the fact that the shipping was free with Amazon Prime. Some time ago I bought Black Capelin Caviar 12oz here on Amazon, but the $18.00 or so for the shipping nearly doubled it's cost, so free shipping with this Marky's caviar was very tempting for me, so I placed the order. The shipping was fairly fast 4 days, and when I opened the box I found 4 jars, each packed into a clear bubble wrap and then wrapped into a sealed green plastic pouch. Upon the opening the bubble wrap from all 4 jars, I unintentional touched the lid of one of the jars and heard a distinct "pop", which meant that the lid was not hermetically screwed to the jar. I immediately notified Amazon about this and when I woke up on the next day, a refund of $6.00 was issued to me. Each full and sealed jar weights 202 grams and an empty one (jar and lid) weights 105 grams, which means that you get 97 grams of caviar per jar. All the caviar roes are very uniform and glossy. When I tried a teaspoon of this caviar I immediately noticed how artificially salty it was outside, probably due to added preservatives, stabilizer and spice. I also noticed that the small roes were somewhat hard but made distinct "pops" when you bit on them, and the internal flavor was bland to nonexistent. Later when I spread the caviar on a slice of bread, the whole caviar mass was difficult to spread around and the roes stuck to each other very firmly. In the end I concluded that this caviar is mediocre and most (if not all) of the flavor comes from the added ingredients. I did not feel like a sultan while eating this caviar, but rather than like an easy mark who fell for the low price and free shipping.<br /><br />The ingredients of this Lumpfish Black Caviar are the following:<br />- Lumpfish roes<br />- Salt<br />- Water<br />- Stabilizer (Xanthan Gum)<br />- Spices<br />- Citric Acid<br />- Sodium Benzoate<br />- Blue #1 Food Coloring<br />- Yellow #6 Food Coloring<br />- Red #40 Food Coloring<br /><br />I would not buy this caviar ever again, even with free shipping. The Black Capelin Caviar 12oz was distinctly better than this mediocre caviar. And like with the Black Capelin Caviar 12oz, you also get green poop if you eat 3/4 of the 3.5oz jar.

I am hoping that Maxwell House will come out with the Chai Coffee (or Tea) Latte in sugar free and then I will try it again.  I am also disappointed in the other Maxwell House line of coffees.  They are very weak in flavor.  I have tried the David Rio Orca Spice Chai Tea (sugar free) and it is OK a little sweet for me, but better than nothing.

It also used to be availabls to me in my area; it has been off the shelves for months now and I was very happy to find a supply on Amazon under the new ownweship.  I have tried other chai mixes, powdered and liquid but this is hands down the best and easiest one to make.  Make it with milk to get the best flavor.  Now if only Amazon would make it a subscription like they used to have it when it was with General Foods!

review/summary: Caribou Morning Starter
review/text: It is quite difficult to order the Caribou Coffee Daybreak Morning Blend  from area coffee suppliers.  I have searched other online coffee suppliers too and Amazon is the only place to obtain our desired morning K-Cup coffee.  We had ordered 24 K-Cups in a box, but the Caribou goes cery quickly and we all were delighted that we could order a quantity of 80.  We buy two boxes of 80 K-Cups.  Amazon is also the only convenient site that I can order my boss her Earl Gray DeCaf K-Cups.  I order a variety of coffee of K-Cups.  It is easy to use the site and the delivery is faster than area coffee suppliers.  Excellent Caribou Coffee Daybreak Morning Blend.  Extremely satisfied customers in the office.<br /><br />China Blue Eyes

review/summary: Very sweet version of hazelnut flavored coffee
review/text: This is a lighter roast, hazelnut flavored coffee, one that is probably the most favorite of the flavored coffees along with French Vanilla.<br /><br />For me, I found it was too sweet--not that there is sugar in it, there isn't; I drank it black, but it's a very light, fragrant blend and the sense I got is of sweetness. If you don't like bitterness in your coffee and like a strong hazelnut fragrance, you are going to love this. I like my coffee a bit stronger so even on "strong" this wasn't dark enough for me. But it is a very intense, sweet scent and there is no doubt that there is HAZELNUT in your cup.<br /><br />Coffee such as this makes a very nice iced cappuccino. My late husband (who worked as a barista when I met him, that was a match made in heaven!) had a secret recipe for an iced coffee drink that was sweetened with maple syrup.  It was a best-seller at the shop where he worked and people would stand with their tongues hanging out, waiting for the next batch to be ready when it ran out. I still don't have ALL the formula, which sadly he took to the grave, but I know a few of the ingredients  You can make a variant of it with Gloria's Hazelnut, by brewing this over ice and mixing with half and half or evaporated milk and adding a touch of maple syrup. Serve on crushed ice. It's usually a big hit with people. The maple and hazelnut are very compatible. His flavored coffee used a different flavor (I think....) but this works really well, too.

review/summary: Awesome brand
review/text: This is an excellent brand rice. We keep 4:1 (water:rice) ratio in a pressure cooker, and rice comes out fluffy. Very tasty and never had problems with it. It is wrapped in a plastic slim cover and covered with the nice cloth cover. Had used for over 2 years and never disappointed.

review/summary: ABSOLUTELY the WORLD's BEST TASTING RAW HONEY - FROM AMAZON
review/text: This Propolis enriched Raw Honey purchased from AMAZON, which is the only place I have every seen it for sale, is unheated, unprocessed and unfiltered so that all its attributes are fully preserved. Propolis enriched Honey consists of pure raw honey (39-oz) enriched with all natural Proolis (30,000 mg). Propolis gives raw honey distinctively appealing taste.<br /><br />I have been buying raw honey from all over the world for many many years looking for just the 'right one'.  I have had different raw honey's from all the continents except Antartica, and from most countries where raw honey is sold.  That includes Iceland, Ireland, Scotland, England, Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa, China, Near-Middle and Far East including Japan and so on.  The most unusual tasting honey came from some rare trees found only in New Zealand.  OK but takes getting used to.  Be warned it is really costly and the amount you get is small.<br /><br />The best: RAW HONEY ENRICHED WITH PROPOLIS.  Best in all categories:  Best tasting, not overly sweet; best unique palate friendly taste; best texture; best color - not the see through stuff but a light tan thick creamy appearance with the propolis mixed through; best cost for 40 oz.  Use it for cooking, sweetner, as a pick-me-up  and by the way it is NOT overly oppressively sweet, but modestly sweet with a friendly flavor.  Wonderful in all respects and way worth the money.<br /><br />My second favorate is simply called RAW HONEY.  These honey's also have medicinal qualities.  Got a burn or cut, spread some on.  Applies to animals too (if they can't reach it with their tongue), or you can cover it.  The  country Vet was right and saved us a bundle.<br /><br />I continue to look for new types from small producers from all over the world but in 20 some years of searching RAW Honey Enriched With Propolis is the best tasting, the best for cooking, eating and best for the amount and cost.  I have sent jars to my four sisters, parents, friends, and others as birthday and Christmas gifts.  They all say pretty much the same as above.<br /><br />Daniel H.

review/summary: VERY FRESH PEANUTS THOUGH AN EXPENSIVE WAY TO BUY THEM
review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: EACH PACKAGE CONTAINED 2 OZ. OF FRESH PEANUTS OR CASHEWS<br /><br />These 2 oz. packages are filled with fresh nuts with nothing but salt added [& peanut oil or cottonseed oil]. As snack foods go, this is a very healthy choice. Although expensive on an ounce for ounce basis, as portions of snack foods go, this is still a fair value and a relatively healthy choice. Bear in mind that about 75% of the 170 calories per ounce are from fat, but there are NO TRANS-FATTY ACIDS or CHOLESTEROL while there are some healthy mono-saturated oils.<br /><br />My big complaint against many other snack-nut products is their lack of freshness, and in fact a rancid taste to the nuts which NEVER happened with these Planters nuts. In fact, each individual package has an expiration date clearly marked on the front of the package.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I PREFER THE LARGER JAR BECAUSE I EAT MORE THAN 2 OZ. AT A TIME<br /><br />My preference is to get these peanuts and cashews in the larger jar and unsalted, but for the summer, the salt is okay and the freshness was consistent in every package.<br /><br />For product info, Kraft has a website [plantersdotcom]<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: Costly and product varies in taste
review/text: This looked like a great way to buy a variety pack of nuts, in snack sizes that would keep me from eating too many. The problem is that peanuts are sort of the "junk" nut if you're trying to eat healthy. (stick to almonds and walnuts)<br />Plus buying individual packs is more expensive. But the worse offense- several packages were rancid! It seemed to be the plain salted peanuts mostly. The honey nuts had a slightly off taste, but not as bad as the salted peanuts. The cashews were OK, but not as good as cashews I've had from regular cans of Planters. I think what might happen is that shipping in the summer in the Southern states causes a lot of degradation in the flavor in the packages.<br />Don't waste your money on this, because you just don't know what you're going to get.

review/summary: Package Theft and Tampering
review/text: Nothing wrong with product as Planters nuts are always a favorite. But the box arrived with one flap pulled up and after counting the packages inside I discovered that it was one short of the salted peanuts (should be 12). Because of the limitations of contacting Amazon about problems - you must repackage item and return everything - I am keeping the item because it is part of a care package for my Marine nephew in Afghanistan. I am just so disappointed that someone was so hungry they had to steal from my shipment and I wish there was a direct contact with Amazon where you could share this kind of incident instead having to return everything for replacement or credit.

review/summary: BEWARE - Sizes have decreased - no longer 2 oz packs
review/text: I have ordered and reordered this item several times.  The last shipment I received (two boxes) the package sizes had decreased from 2 oz to 1.75 for the peanuts and 1.5 for the cashews.<br /><br />I realize this is from Planters and it's a sign of the times but the product description needs to be updated.<br /><br />We like these at work but just like Granola bars, the price stays the same (or goes up) and the product size goes down.<br /><br />The product itself is fine but I am sick of getting ripped off by changes in product portions. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6GZDA">Planters-Nuts On the Go Snack Packs, 24/2 oz Variety Packs</a>

review/summary: Convenient to have when on the go
review/text: This package of variety nuts is very convenient to have when on the go and for my son's lunch box, he likes these but the price on Amazon is too high for mostly peanuts. It is a much better price at Sam's Club for the exact same thing. I love buying on amazon (sort of an Amazon addict)because of the convenience and great prices but you do have to keep in mind Sam's Club is very competitive price wise it's just a pain in the neck going there (when spoiled by Amazon) plus always end up spending more and having to bring it all home. Love the free home delivery Amazon offers so if you want to pay more for the convenience then you should buy these on Amazon.
