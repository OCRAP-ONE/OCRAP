review/summary: The Best K-Cup Decaf So Far and I've Tried Many
review/text: What can I say. I've now tried nearly every Extra Bold Decaf K-cup made and this is my favorite. It's a full bodied, rich, complex coffee that tastes "better" than 95% of the leaded coffees I've tried over the years. I set my Keurig to the 10 oz. mug setting, push the button, and enjoy! My second favorite (and very different) coffee is Coffee People Donut Shop Extra Bold Decaf, although I am looking forward to trying Coffee People Extra Bold French Roast.<br /><br />PS. I have to drink decaf only now, but no compromise in taste thanks to this great coffee.

review/summary: Bad after-taste, not bold, tastes awful.
review/text: This coffee has a very bad, bitter after-taste.<br /><br />It's not really bold per se, either.  It's basically a morning blend light roast, but just made too strong.  A bold ought to be a darker roast in my opinion.  This coffee is for people who have lost their sense of taste.<br /><br />I feel bad throwing this coffee out, but once I tasted the Newman's organic decaf (smooth and tasty), I can't go back. The only hope for this coffee is that it will compost.

Even at the 8 oz and above this brews a cuppa with depth, flavor, and body, even in decaf. Amazing with a brownie on the side or on its own.

review/text: For anyone who still thinks that decaf coffee means Sanka crystals, you are missing out on good flavored coffee without the caffeine.  I enjoy drinking several cups of coffee a day, but the caffeine can make me edgy.  So I balance out my regular blend coffees with a decaf like the Green Mountain extra bold.  You still have plenty of robust coffee flavor, but no caffeine.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: Since purchasing our Keurig I have been consistently disappointed in getting a bold cup of decaf (or a bold cup, period!)  This decaf is an exception, and while it's still not up to regular brew standards, it's the best bold decaf I've found yet in a K-cup.  It's a deep, complex taste without being bitter or harsh.  Good coffee!

review/text: I've tried many of the decaf coffees available for the Keurig (not the flavored ones, though) and I've found this to be the best.  It's full bodied, tastes great (and I use the 12 oz water setting so it would be even stronger at 8 oz.) and it doesn't give you the jitters.  I just wish Amazon would offer it on their "Subscribe and Save" program.  It's a tad expensive.

review/summary: Decaf Dark Magic
review/text: This coffee is rich and tastes great!  Served it to friends who do not like "decaf" and they had no idea that this was a decaf.  The flavor is really good.  I took off a star because it is not as aromatic as the Nantucket blends.  To me, a coffee should have a coffee aroma when brewing and therefore making my anticipation greater.  Also, the fragrance of brewing coffee reminds me of my Grandma making (remember this?) perked coffee; and, truly, this is a good thing.

Most decafs are too weak and I usually have to change the settings on my brewer to a smaller size just to get a decent tasting cup. The Extra Bold tastes like a great cup of regular coffee. I doubt most people would even know it was decaf unless you told them.

review/text: We have tried many different brands and found Green Mountain Coffee products in general to provide the boldest, richest flavor. We prefer decaf coffee, but most large retail outlets selling Keurig products only offer a very small selection of decaffeinated K-cups. We are so excited just to be able to find our favorite, impossible -to-find coffee at Amazon, and to be able to purchase in quantities larger than the standard 18 ct. box. Even factoring in shipping costs, Amazon's unit price is less than most retail outlets, Walmart included!

review/text: If you are a person who loves a strong regular cup, but can't find a strong decaf, well now you have.  This Dark magic Decaf tastes so much like regular that I have to double check my k-cup after I brew just to make sure I put in the decaf.  It is strong, rich and has no weakness or after taste.  I have been searching YEARS for a good decaf. I wasted a lot of money on weak decaf,Starbucks Verona decaf was the closest I came, and this is even better, and it is a k-cup!<br /><br />Bravo Green Mountain, thanks for the great brew.

review/text: These k-cups are certainly bold and strong, but the finish is flat and thin. It's lacking in overtones after the initial dark wave. I just started exploring k-cups since my machine arrived last week. Initially I was surprised how watery the house blends are. I wanted something dark and rich in texture. But so far, I'd rather drink Tully's French Roast extra bold k-cups which is just about as strong as Dark Magic but with a wider spectrum and better finish.

review/text: If you drink 1/2 gallon of coffee a day as I do then you have to make some concessions.  After my first 2 cups of 8 o"clock french roast in the AM, I switch to decaf, cold brew,dark roast with chickory. My greatest addiction is chewing Sonic ice by the bag over which I pour all this wonderful coffee. My sister introduced me to this Dark Magic espresso blend for an afternoon pick-me-up while on a visit to Shreveport, La. and I've been in love ever since. Hot or cold it is very smooth and a real treat any time of day,mixed with a little milk,or however you drink yours. Try some. What have you got to lose!!

review/text: Yes, FINALLY, a K-Cup decaf choice that doesn't taste like piss water.  It has a bold flavor that stands up to it's caffeinated cousins.  I've added this one to my "reorder often" list.

review/summary: Full-bodied Flavor
review/text: Usually I find decaf coffee to be too weak, but this product is an exception. It has a nice round full-bodied coffee flavor that isn't diluted by the flavored creamers I occasionally use in place of dessert. I would recommend this decaf above all others I have tried.

review/summary: Strong coffee lovers, rejoice!
review/text: This is some of the best decaf coffee I've ever had. Many of the other commonly-available decaf K-Cups are weak or too light a roast for my tastes. This product holds up to plenty of cream and sugar. I've even started making Irish Coffees with it! If you like espresso drinks (even Americanos or straight espresso), this may be the blend for you. Perfect for settling a late-night coffee craving and then going to bed moments later - still tired, with nary a spec of heartburn (as some of us tend to get from caffeinated dark roast blends).<br /><br />The only downside for me is that the jury is still out on the decaffeination process they use in the beans that go into this K-Cup. I'm guessing it is chemically decaffeinated since Green Mountain is not exactly forthcoming with the info (not on their website or on the box). Many K-Cups do use Swiss Water, but I've noticed some K-Cups also note chemical decaffeination on the side of the box now. This is a small price to pay for a great cup of coffee before bed, as far as I'm concerned... and if you're using a Keurig, you probably don't drink too many cups of coffee each day, either (and thus are limiting your exposure to any harmful side effects from the decaffeination process). Still, I would be happy to pay a bit more for a Swiss Water version of this product.

review/summary: Good strong coffee
review/text: The Green Mountain Extra Bold Dark Magic decaf is a very good, strong coffee. It does have a slight bite, but then I like that in a coffee. Many decaf coffees have little to no taste, especially using K cups, but this decaf actually tastes like coffee! For those interested, the caffeinated version of the Dark Magic coffee is great too! That is why I ordered the decaf to try. I highly recommend that you give it a try.

review/text: I have been buying the Timothy's Decaf K-cups for a long time now.  I think my taste buds have gotten bored as recently, I drank some Starbucks Via Decaf and was shocked with how much better that was.  I did some searching and decided to try this Extra Bold to see if the Keurig could produce something with more flavor.  It did!  I really like this coffee and will use it as my daily drinker from now until I get bored again.  The bummer is that I bought this last week and it cost me about $12 less than what the price is today!

review/text: The sticker on the Green Mountain. K-cup box said: Dec Magic but it was placed over the real title of the box which was Our Blend.  When I opened the box it was not decaf but regular coffee: Our Blend.  As I am too busy to mess around with returning it, my husband will use it at work for the office.

review/text: What I bought is not what I got!  I thought I was getting Decaf and it isn't.  The shrink wrap on the outside labeled it as Decaf but it was regular roast coffee!  If you have to drink Decaf, be wary!  Luckily my husband drinks regular coffee and he can use this but I was really disappointed that it wasn't Decaf.  I had one cup and was pretty hopped up.  I can't drink regular coffee because of my thyroid disease so it was a tad unnerving.

review/text: I needed some pickled pork hocks and decided, what the heck, I'll order a sampler. Yum! These are the vinegared mysteries you used to see on the counter behind the bar at not-so-classy joints and think 'who on earth would eat that stuff?' The turkey gizzards especially look suspect. But when you try them, they're all really good. The hocks are wonderful cooked with cabbage or added to stews. The gizzards are good over rice. The eggs are great cut into a salad, and add an interesting twist to deviled eggs. And the little Polish sausages remind me of *somebody's* great aunt playing pinochle. Especially if you know someone who hails from the rust belt, this would be a great gift and a taste of the past.

review/summary: A Great Sampler
review/text: I love pickled sausages though I'm used to the "Fat Freddies" and other convenience store/gas station products that have the texture of a vienna sausage.  The only problem is that not many of those places here in the Las Vegas area carry them so they are a treat when found.<br /><br />On a whim I started searching the net for them, and of course searched here on my favorite online store, Amazon.com and found this sampler pack.  Of the four products in this sampler, I'd only had pickled sausages before.<br /><br />My wife and I both loved the sausages.  They were certainly superior to the mass market ones I've bought as mentioned above.<br />The gizzards were good and tender.  I'd never had them pickled, but they were a nice treat.<br />The pork was good as well and another first for us, but I doubt that I'll be ordering them again.<br />The eggs were a disappointment.  They weren't bad or anything but I guess I was expecting more.  Again, those were a first for me but I won't be reordering them.<br /><br />However, I used 5 cans of pickled beets and 18 eggs and pickled my own eggs last week, alternating layers of eggs and beets in a gallon glass jar, leaving them in the fridge for a week before tasting.  THOSE we love.<br /><br />Everyone has different tastes, so you all may love some of the things we didn't find all that special.  That's why this sampler is a good idea.  You get to try the foods without the risk of having a gallon of something no one likes.

review/text: Product arrived promptly and securely packaged. The turkey gizzards were very tender but somewhat mild in flavor (dipped them in mustard to add a little "zest" to them when I ate them). Pork Hocks were also tender with a mild flavor. The Polish Sausage I liked the best - a sweeter, vinegary taste (it was hard for me not to eat the whole jar of Polish Sausage in one sitting). The eggs were fine (used them - sliced - on salads).<br /><br />All-in-all, I was very pleased with the sampler as well as the service from WisconsinMade.

review/text: These candy bars aren't available where we live so every-so-often just got to order them.  My absolute favorite bar.  Chewy taffy with just the right amount of peanuts within the taffy.  Plus a generous amount of dark chocolate on the outside of the bar.  A perfect combination of sweet and chewy with dark chocolate.<br />A tip for breaking the bars up into bite size pieces is to place a bar into the freezer for about 5-10 minutes prior to eating.  "Rap" in on a hard object like the kitchen counter while in the wrapper and the bar will shatter into small pieces.  Makes the candy more enjoyable and easy to share.

Often, there is something lacking and you just have to resign yourself to the fact that it simply isn't as good as you thought.  Not so with the Look bar.  It tastes just the same as it did when it was the most popular bar at the little league park.  You can stretch em, whack em into pieces, or suck on 'em.  It's simply my favorite candy bar and always will be.  The chocolate is bittersweet, and the nougat is well balanced with just the right sweetness and texture.  American confection at its finest.

review/text: We love Sunbutter! I don't have to worry about using it, as it and the company is completely PEANUT FREE!. Sunbutter taste great, unlike Soy Butter which is gritty and awful tasting. I use Sunbutter for anything that I would use peanut butter for cookies, frostings and candies, dips, etc. Sunbutter has the same consistency and texture as peanut butter and doesn't need refrigeration. When using Sunbutter for baking you do have to cut back to about 1/2 of the baking soda and/or baking powder or you can add a little bit of lemon juice to prevent your baked goods from turning green from the sunflower seeds. If your cookies do turn green it doesn't affect the taste just the looks (guess how I know that little bit of information :). Sunbutter also has a great website at sunbutter dot com with recipes and information about their products. Check out their site and defiantly get some Sunbutter.

But then I had a third child who was severely allergic to peanuts & nuts.  I tried all the other peanut replacement products out there and they were terrible.  The Soy Nut butter tasted awful and was very gritty.  But then we found Sunbutter.  Oh my gosh!!! It tastes better than peanut butter and has the same consistency and health benefits of peanut butter.  My two older kids easily switched to Sunbutter and love it.  We use both the creamy and crunchy versions -- both excellent.<br /><br />In addition, I use Sunbutter to make cookies (peanut butter cookies made with Sunbutter) and Chinese Sesame Noodles -- without the sesame oil and seeds (my daughter is also allergic to sesame) and use Sunbutter.  It is excellent!  I love, love, love this product.  I love the fact it needs no refrigeration and is nutritious.

review/summary: We Love Sunbutter!
review/text: We became Sunbutter fans about five years ago, after our daughter was diagnosed with a peanut allergy.  I tried Soynut butter (gross!) and all the nut butters we could find had peanut warnings on them.  Sunbutter is a safe alternative.  I use it for baking (sunbutter krispies, sunbutter cookies), cooking (Thai dishes), and for just eating.  Check out Sunbutter's website for tips on baking, as you will need to decrease backing soda in recipes, so food doesn't turn green. We all love it.  Most of our friends, who have tried it, have switched to Sunbutter also.  I can't tell a difference and it has opened up endless possibilities, enabling our family to feel "normal".  When baby #2 came along, we used it "safely" from age 1-3, when most doctors tell people to avoid peanuts.

review/summary: Tasty and a perfect substitute
review/text: I developed a peanut allergy later in life so when I found this brand of sunflower butter I was so happy. It tastes more like peanut butter than anything else. Which also means you can use it as a substitute in recipes and it's very unlikely anyone will notice.  While I have never gotten a tub this big it's only because it isn't available for order right now. I buy it by the case.

review/summary: We feel "normal" again after finding Sunbutter
review/text: When our oldest son had a reaction to a cashew and was rushed to the ED, we knew he had an allergy.  Little did we know, that day would change our lives.  Giovanni had to be antihistimine free for 30 days before being tested for allergies.  After having the test done, we discovered he had treenut, peanut, fish, egg, wheat, oat, and carrot allergies.  I was crushed.  No parades, trick or treating, holiday baking, etc.  Reading lables on EVERYTHING.  Then, I got a ray of hope.  Sunbutter.  With the help of Sunbutter our holiday baking can be done.  We didn't realize how many of our favorite holiday treats have peanutbutter in them.  I've used Subutter in cheesecake, cookies, bars, and obviously, sandwiches.  This product has made us feel a little more normal again.  Thank you!!

review/text: I was first introduced to SunButter on an interstate flight and feel in love.  I have never much cared for Peanut butter and SunButter is soooooo much better :  I have been ordering it in the 5lb tubs for several years now and have NEVER been dissatisfied.  I pay a little more for it, but you get what you pay for, IT IS WELL WORTH IT.  My grandchildren love the stuff either in sandwiches or just a spoonful or both....THANK YOU SUNBUTTER!

review/summary: Starbucks Makes the Best Instant Coffee Ever
review/text: There is no such thing as a perfect instant coffee. There is no such thing as a perfect instant coffee. There is no such thing as a perfect instant coffee.<br /><br />Now that we've made that perfectly clear, Starbuck's Via is the best there is. The Italian Roast is absolutely amazing...for an instant coffee. I drink it when I teach, and it is so much better than the watered-down rat pee in the teachers' workroom. Incidentally, that an instant coffee is superior to a brewed coffee is a sad reflection on the quality of coffee brewed at the workplace, but I digress...<br /><br />The rich flavor of this coffee is an unexpected treat, and although it is recognizably instant to the taste of a true coffee-lover, it is not bad. The quality and character of this coffee are incredible... for an instant coffee.

It will never be as good as fresh brewed quality coffee, but hey, if you're at home then don't be lazy and brew some real java. This stuff is perfect for backpacking and camping- I also brought a large amount of it when I travelled to India and Nepal...my fellow backpackers were begging me to have some...Overall, it is the best instant coffee that I have ever tried.

review/summary: Not instant, but not real
review/text: I like one cup of coffee in the afternoon at work and I want it strong.  With Via I can make one cup of decent coffee quickly.  It's also a good product to take traveling.  It's so much better than restaurant coffee but you don't pay the ridiculous price you can pay at a Starbucks. It's a huge improvement over instant coffee, but it's not equal to the real thing.  Honestly, I think it deserves 3 1/2 stars.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I have been using Walden Farms products since the company came to North America and they are a regular part of my shopping list. Their pancake syrup is thick and fantastic. This is so versatile and great on Salmon (maple glazed), chicken, turkey etc, in chili and stews instead of molasses, great in butternut/carrot/pumpkin pureed soups, in milkshakes, on toast (french toast, biscuits, bread puddings, or breakfast bakes, on eggs, pancakes, high-fiber cereal, in puddings, hot and cold cereals, desserts, ice cream souffles,and in steamed milk and hot coffee! This is great on waffles, or to bake with (great for cakes/muffins etc); I love pouring it on top of crumb cakes and letting it soak in. I especially love mixing it into Greek yogurt or cottage cheese. Adding it to pumpkin puree with some cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and sweetener makes it tastes like pumpkin pie in a bowl, but healthy. Great way to have flavor without the added sugar.

review/text: Normally I don't even think about drinking vodka (too many bad college memories!) until my husband brought this home one night. He claimed it was a sipping vodka and in all honesty there was no way I could believe him. So against my better judgment I decided to mix it with some orange juice. Wow...I have never tasted a vodka so smooth and there was no burning sensation and rubbing alcohol aftertaste. Even when you shoot it there isn't a burning sensation and almost feels like you are drinking water. And come on now, the bottle is pretty freakin cool! A must try vodka for the non-vodka drinkers.

I will admit, I am not at all a vodka connoisseur, so take this review for what it's worth, but it's almost invisible to the tongue aside from a very light hint of mellow, spicy flavor. No burning or stinging at all to the nose or throat.

review/summary: Fantastic Option for Chronic Pancreatitis Sufferer
review/text: This has been a life-saver for my aging heeler.  He's had chronic pancreatitis for years, and I finally had to resort to cooking food for him daily (this gets old, with 3 large canine mouths to feed).  We found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCOZ3E">Castor & Pollux Organix Adult Canine Formula, Chicken, Brown Rice & Flax Dry Dog Food, 25-Pound Bag</a>, which was a great solution (wet down a little to provide enough fluid for digestion).  However, he also has worn down canines as a result of spending his first year living on the streets of Cody, Wyoming, and his teeth aren't completely adequate to a kibble-only diet.  Adding this canned food has been the best thing ever!!  We have struggled to meet his needs for years, and this just works!  He's comfortable, now.  No more tummy rubs and aspirin every night after supper (although he did do exceptionally well on the home-prepared diet, also, for about the same cost).  I love seeing my boy happy and thriving, and I honestly have this food to thank.

review/summary: Very Safe and good brand for large breed puppies
review/text: Large breeds such as Bernese Mountain Dogs should not be fed puppy food due to very high protein content in puppy food. So our Bernese puppy typically has adult kibble with lower protein content. However, his litter have a lot of digestive issues so now and then he needed a soft food versus kibble & needs t be bland - that's where this product comes in. Our puppy (who's never been a good eater) will eat Organix canned chicken& rice especially when he's not feeling so great. We've noticed that his tummy's able to handle this food without him being in pain or having diarrhea. He also loves the kibble version (once in a while for a change from his usual kibble).

review/summary: Excellent packaging and rich flavor...
review/text: These bundt cakes come well packaged in a sturdy cardboard box which is sealed with plastic.  Inside, is a plastic molded bundt pan which is also fully sealed in airtight plastic wrap.<br /><br />Originally, I purchased both Tortuga and Wicked Jack's rum cakes to compare against each other for an upcoming party I was hosting.  The Tortuga rum cake was tasty and what you would expect from a pre-made cake.  However, the Wicked Jack's Tavern rum cake is so much more moist and flavorful.  It is amazingly moist, drenched in butter rum flavor and can go from box to serving platter in seconds.  Since I mention how moist it is, (after a couple purchases and messy flip-overs) I would suggest flipping it onto a platter and making sure to tap the bottom of the bundt pan several times so that when you lift the pan it fully comes out in one piece.<br /><br />I think that you could even pass this off as home-made if you wanted, it's actually that fresh.  However, since my family and friends already know exactly what my rum cake tastes like (a holiday tradition here for years) I have no problem bragging about the Wicked Jack's brand.  I have yet to hear a single negative comment about it and I've actually served these cakes about a half dozen times now for different get togethers.<br /><br />Huge thumbs up on Wicked Jack's and I'm glad I went ahead and tried this out through Amazon, having never seen it in a store.  This blind pick is actually one of my most satisfying (literally!) purchases I've made in the last few months!

review/summary: Yum
review/text: This is the first time I've tried rum cake, and I'm really liking it. Rum cake is made by letting rum soak into the cooked cake, but the cake is not soggy - it is nicely moist. The cake comes sealed in a disposable bundt cake tray packaged inside a box. It does not taste stale or overly processed. There is obvious rum taste, but it is not overpowering. For those who might be concerned with alcohol content, I ate a rather large slice, and did not feel a buzz at all. You don't have to worry about having anyone 21 or over sign for the package, it's just a regular grocery item. The package seems to suggest slicing the cake into ten pieces (210 calories per slice), but that leaves you with a smaller slice than I normally like to eat. I could live with slicing it up into eights. The cake is decadent enough, you feel satisfied after eating one slice for treating yourself to something good for dessert, though I would happily finish off half the entire cake in one sitting.

It comes in a scary amount of packaging, which keeps it soaked with sweet sweet syrupy rummy flavour.  If you're taking it to a party- make sure to unwrap it first as the packing really is scary.  But once out of the plastic, you could totally pass this off as your great-grandma's rum cake recipe.  It's that authentic.

review/summary: Just ok
review/text: I like the Tortuga original better than this cake. First of all the rum is cooked with butter and other ingredients, depending on how you like to make it, and made into a glaze. There are some people that think the rum is soaked in straight from the bottle and I am going to assume that these people don't drink. In this brand the rum is not as intense. I am not sure what brand or type of rum they use but it is weak. The cake is crumbly, it was falling apart as I tried to slice it. If you serve this with ice cream or create some kind of dessert dish then I am sure your guests wouldn't mind. On the other hand it is a good price.
