review/summary: Tastes just like bacon!
review/text: I had a bag of these during a trip to London. I was looking for Walker's Frazzles but this was the only bacon-flavored chips I could find at the Tesco. The taste is very similar to Frazzles if not better. It tastes just like bacon! Even suitable for vegetarians.

review/text: This chips kind of reminded me of bacon bits. The six small bags were the perfect size and there's no MSG. They were a little expensive, but considering they came from the UK it's understandable. Half the price was in the shipping. They are well worth the indulgence once in awhile.

review/text: This could possibly be the best tasting chip I have ever eaten. It has a nice smokey bacon flavor. I would make sure this item was always stocked in my pantry if the price was not so high for the amount you get, or if they would sell this "AMAZING" chip here in the states. I would highly recomend someone paying the price one time just to try this.

review/summary: Walkers Crisps 6 pack
review/text: I ordered this product on Amazon to get some of the flavors we can't get in the US, namely, bacon, worcestershire, and prawn cocktail.  The photo of the product was so small and the description was so vague that I didn't realize until it came that what I was getting were actually 3 flavors of crisps that I can get down the street from my house:  cheddar cheese and onion, salt and vinegar, and regular flavor.  I was VERY disappointed.  Instead of trying again to order online, I will ask friends in the UK to shop and mail them for me.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: I am not one for flavored chips. Anytime I buy chips with any type of flavor (sour cream & onion, cheese, etc) They are usually DRENCHED in some strange and super salty powder. They always end up being too overwhelming for my palate. So I usually buy natural chips with only salt or I will buy unsalted. I saw these on sale and thought maybe I would try them. I've tried unsalted and regular Boulder Canyon and thought they were good enough. I hesitated at first. I added and removed these from my cart 3 times because I thought maybe Parmesan & Garlic would be too much for me. However something finally made me just take the risk and hope for the best. I was highly surprised at their flavor. They were NOT drenched in powdery stuff. YaY! The amount of flavor is just right for these chips. They are super crispy and taste fresh. They have an expiration date of Dec 18, 2011 so we have plenty of time to finish them.

review/text: I have been a hardcore fan of Kettle Fully Loaded Baked Potato chips for the last three years. My regular order wasn't available in my subscribe and save account, so I ordered these after reading the reviews. These are delicious! The flavoring is not heavy, just enough to know what you are eating and certainly not too salty. They are gluten-free and I hope that will make a difference in my diet.  They make a nice break from my other fave and from popcorn. I thought I was ordering smaller sized bags and I passed a few around the office. I will definitely be ordering these again!

review/summary: Best ever cheap chips
review/text: Bought a couple of boxes of Boulder Canyon chips [Hickory BBQ and this one] for the family gathering over the holidays, and every one of us is delighted with them. Best chips I've ever tasted at this price [ETA price was $8.50 at Amazon's Warehouse Deals].<br /><br />Delivered in good time, good packaging, all bags fully sealed, like the easy-access 'tear panels' on the box side. We're about halfway thru both boxes and all bags have been first-class flavor and texture. There's an extra 'something' to the Boulder Canyon chips--a tang or zing--which you don't get in other cheap chips.<br /><br />Mind you, I'm not a chip afficianado or anything, most times I don't notice them, just munch a few. I noticed these ones enough to write this review.

review/summary: A nutritious snack that isn't too sweet!
review/text: I have bought both the Cran-blueberry crunch and the Pom-Raspberry crunch from Mrs. Mays.  Both are a small bite-size block of mixed dry fruits and nuts. Both are "constructed" in a similar way but I like the Cran-blueberry one better. This is primarily because Cran-Blueberry crunch uses almond, cashew, and sesame, which give it a little more variety and texture in the taste.  Pom-Rasberry crunch only has cashew (I think. Thought it also tastes very good.) The snack has a natural light sweet taste from the suger in the fruity ingredients so I don't feel bad about intaking extra sugar from eating it.  I always keep a bag in the office for the mid morning/afternoon snack.<br /><br />I also like how much the company has done to assure its customers that their food products are manufactured in a safe manner and they have been pretty transparent about their selection of ingredients. (Please see my review on Pom-Raspberry pack of 12 for more details on that.)<br /><br />I will definitely recommend it for anyone who wants a healthy snack.

review/summary: Tasty and Healthy Snack
review/text: You know how limited your food choices can be when your plane is delayed and the airport is pretty much closing down for the night? Well, that's how I found Mrs. Mays Cran-Blueberry Crunch.  The candy and gum kiosk at LaGuardia carries them, and I was not going to make it tbrough a 2 hour delay on a Snickers.  The Cran-Blueberry Crunch was wonderful.  Hit the spot and carried through with no sugar crash.  They're delicious without being overly sweet and the fruit is real fruit, not dried fruit with yucky preservatives.  When I got hom, I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered a case from Amazon, and I keep a bag in my desk drawer (for that late afternoon snack attack).  I've shared with my friends, and everyone loves it.  Enjoy!!

review/text: I made this tonight for my husband and I. I'm glad I didn't make this for a party or something. I followed directions exactly. The filling/pudding part came out very soupy, even after being in the refrigerator for 1-1/2 hours as directed. The "meringue" is not enough to cover the whole pie. Not nearly as much as it shows on the box, and my pie plate is small. So I ended up putting it in the freezer and it set well and was really tasty. If I made this for friends & family I would definately have to tweak it a bit.

I beat the filling for the full 3 minutes as stated in the instructions and it wasn't soupy at all (even before I put it in the fridge).  I had plenty of whipped "meringue" topping, just like the picture.<br /><br />It's not the best lemon meringue pie I've ever had, but it's pretty good for instant.  I would definitely bring it to a party or something if I was short on time/too lazy to make it from scratch.  It was fast, easy, and delicious!

Mostly, though, I think it seems "creamy". Yea, I know that sounds weird, but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment. I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.

review/text: I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me.

review/text: I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, "French gray" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.

review/summary: SHORT expiration date
review/text: The case of 6 I received expires June of 2010. Amazon strikes again. I have read about Amazon shipping nearly expired products, but never had it happen to me. I don't know how they get away with it. Description should show almost exired. Very bad business on Amazon's part.<br /><br /> I can live with the short expiration date, I've eaten alot of expired products! All the boxes I've made the potatoes are still hard even after you've cooked it twice as long! So it STILL gets a 1*!!!

review/summary: No Microwave Directions on Box!
review/text: I look forward to cooking in the microwave...means no spattered stove to clean! BIG SURPRISE - no microwave directions. Well this will be a noble experiment because it will be microwaved! Called Miss Betty Crocker @ General Mills and they don't supply microwaved directions either. So wish me luck as I experiment!<br /><br />UPDATE: Found Microwave directions on web BUT you still have to experiment :(<br /><br />MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS<br />1. Crumble 1 lb lean ground beef into 3-qt microwavable casserole or bowl. Microwave uncovered on High 3 to 5 minutes, breaking up beef after 3 minutes, until brown; drain.<br />2. Stir in sauce mix, 2-2/3 cups boiling water, 1 cup milk and uncooked potatoes.<br />3. Microwave uncovered on High 14 to 21 minutes, stirring every 7 minutes, until potatoes are tender (sauce will thicken as it stands). Dish will be hot. Meanwhile, stir 1/4 cup milk and toping mix in bowl 30 seconds; set aside.<br />4. Pour topping over beef mixture. (If topping is too thick to pour, stir in an additional 1/2 to 1 tsp milk.)<br /><br />***High altitude microwave (3500-6500 ft): increase boiling water to 3 cups and last microwave time to 18-25 min.

review/summary: Best oriental noodles EVER!!!!
review/text: After ordering these, I was shocked that I had paid so much for so few servings (about $2.33 per bowl).  Once I got these, again, I had to shake my head at my own indulgence.  Then I tasted them!  OH... MY... GOSH!!!!  These were, without a doubt, the BEST oriental noodles I've ever tasted.  To say that they didn't skimp on the mushrooms is an understatement!  There were mushrooms in every bite.  And not just little bits of mushrooms.  They were whole, and the texture and taste was wonderful.  Another wonderful surprise was that the noodles never got mushy or stuck together -- even when I forgot I had them soaking, and left them for more than 20 minutes.  Another nice surprise was learning that these wonderful noodles have four grams of fiber in each bowl.  Even though these are very filling (probably because of the fiber), they only contain 190 calories, and 1 gram of fat.  One bowl is perfect for any entire meal.  And the flavor is perfect...  not too spicy, not too bland, but just right.<br /><br />Added to all the above is that they're incredibly easy to prepare.  Open the flavor/mushroom/egg pack, put it atop noodles, pour boiling water over everything, replace cover and wait three minutes.  There are two things I do different when preparing these (but just because of my preferences, not because the instructions are faulty -- they're not).  I add less water than the instructions suggest -- I prefer these more noodle-y and less soup-ey, and 1-1/2 cups of boiling water is the perfect amount for my preference.  I also let it set for five minutes, giving the noodles a chance to soak up more of the water.<br /><br />Are these mushrooms pricey?  Yes, they are.  Are they overpriced?  Not at all!  I will definitely buy these tasty and nutritious noodles again!

review/text: These have to be my favorite noodle bowls EVER.  I originally purchased them at Big Lots for 60 cents per bowl.  I wasn't sure if I would like them, so only purchased a few bowls.  Big mistake!  I fell in love with them.  However, when I went back, they didn't have any more!  They did have the vegetable bowls, so bought some of them.  They are also tasty, but not as good as the mushroom.  I would love to buy more, but can't afford the asking price at Amazon.  If you can afford these, try them. They're great!

review/text: These soups extreme sodium content makes me pause each time I order them.  I like having an easy snack on hand for the kids as these taste great, are fun with the various different mushrooms and are filling and easy to make.  The sodium just makes me cringe but this particular flavor almost redeems itself with the very low fat content. :)

review/summary: Good but....
review/text: This is a quality product, the soup base and veggies come in a freeze dried brick that you place on top of the noodles before adding about a cup of boiling water.  Its delightful to see this dry little brick burst into green onions, mushrooms and soup base.  It fills the top of the cup with lots of great stuff.  The flavor was delicate and nice.  Now the part that is a deal breaker for me is the noodles..  They are flavorless, colorless strings that clump together and are not so easy to swallow.  I found myself trying to really chew these because I didnt like the feeling of the long strands of noodles half in my mouth and hanging down my throat.  It was odd..  If you like Mai-fun (cellophane) noodles or you are wanting to try them this is for you..  I prefer wheat/flour based noodles..  But you may love this, and like I said its a quality item.

review/summary: With the recent changes, Cost outweighs, Disappointed!
review/text: I found it least expensive from Amazon at about $8.50 for a box of 6 bowls via subscribe and save.  That may sound expensive (compared to 25 cent ramens and 50 cent cup noodles) but that is because crystal noodle uses a freeze dried process that I feel preserves much of the flavor of the flavor packet of mushrooms.  The noodles are also very thin with a silky smooth texture and easy to consume while absorbing the flavor of the soup.  The sodium level is high (due to MSG probably) so that is a plus for those who enjoy sodium (funny thing I love sodium but despise sweets).  Is this healthy for you?  I don't know about that.  But without regards to whether it is healthy, I deeply enjoy having this for lunch at work.  Easy to make, easy to eat, and simply delicious.  If you do not have access to boiling water, use hot enough water and let it cook for longer (i.e.instead of 3 minutes, let it cook for 7-8 minutes).  P.S. Do not forget to finish drinking the soup!  That is the best part!!<br /><br />NOV03,2011<br /><br />I just purchased another box.  The new cup shows NO MSG.  Also new cup is 1.90oz rather than the 1.98oz they advertise (it was 1.98oz previously and damn tasty but now not so much).  The flavor freeze dried packet is also smaller.  I am going to have to decrease this to 2 stars.  This is more in the I am disappointed lines (instead of increasing costs, they are just going to decrease content...call me a pessimist but I think the decrease in content is not to promote healthy eating but rather to boost bottom line).  Flavor is more bland now, just like any other instant noodle out there...nothing special anymore.

review/text: I bought these noodles at an overstock store once, and had I known at the time how good they were going to be I would have stocked up. As it stands, unless you live near an asian market or similar store you'll have a difficult time getting these locally. Fortunately, Amazon provides. All of the varieties are very good, this one brings out the savory flavor of the mushrooms and the texture of the bean thread noodles is satisfying. It prepares quick and easy, and only requires boiling water like a typical self contained ramen bowl. Great for work, and quite filling for the size and price.

I have to say I was very impressed. A bit on the spicy side though, but it was tasty. I just wasn't expecting it to be spicy though.<br /><br />Also it's listed as 6 types of mushrooms even on the front of the package but if you look at the ingredients on the back there are seven types of mushrooms listed. Bonus...yay.

review/text: Good taste, lower in carbs and sodium than most noodle cups. Said to contain 2 servings; really only one. Noodles are made from bean & potato starch and are crystal clear. I add sliced scallions, raw spinach, raw arugala and/or sesame oil to create some variety and a real treat.

review/summary: Great for people on the go
review/text: I first ate Long Kow Crystal Noodle after finding it at a local Kroger store on clearance. I love ramen noodle soup and thought this might be a little different. It is definitely different than regular ramen noodle by virtue of the noodles themselves. If you like mai-fun, bean threads or rice noodles, you will love this noodle soup. The mushrooms are great and there are just enough to make the soup tasty. If you like this kind, try the egg and vegetable type, too. I love them both. I had to buy from Amazon as the store quit carrying it - I guess it was not a popular item. To me, it is worth what you pay for it. It's a great, quick snack for between meals and people on the go. You won't be disappointed in this product if you like oriental style, instant noodle soups.

review/summary: WE REALLY LIKE THESE FLAVORFUL NOODLES
review/text: I first had these kinds of noodles in Guam and Okinawa. I loved them but  I could not find them locally for years. I had them with strips of lean meat and chicken back then. I think i have had them with Sukiyaki too.<br /><br /> So different than other noodles. I They are clear but absorb flavors and colors of whatever is mixed with them.  I  ordered  the 6 mushroom kind. There were plenty of mushrooms. If you love mushrooms, you will probably love these too.  I don't know, I found them needing meat or chicken I guess, so am going to order the other flavors to try or maybe add my own to these. There are  a lot of noodles here and the flavor is wonderful. It is an excellent quality product, in my opinion.  My son likes them as well. He lets all his noodles set for an hour to fully absorb flavors and become more pliable. These noodles are particularly firm. He loves noodles and since we have discovered the better ones on Amazon, he will not eat the cheaper ones anymore that he use to love. They are different than egg or other types of  noodles but seem to soak up the flavors better. Very filling. I think they would also make a great side dish with other foods. Probably worth the additional cost.<br /><br />I am going to order the other flavors of crystal noodles to try.

review/summary: EXTRA LOW FAT LUXURY Mushroom noodle soup - $2 each!
review/text: Full of exotic and delicious mushrooms, this instant soup rocks!! It is so fresh, so tasty, and such high quality, that if you like mushrooms, you MUST try it! The delicate glass noodles put it over the top! In about 6 minutes you have a tasty, hot meal! Product of China. Per container: 200 calories, 42 grams carbs, 2 grams protein and 1 gram fat (only 5% of calories from fat!) and 1000 mg sodium. Different than "Ramen" style because the noodles are not fried. Do not microwave, just add 2 or 3 cups BOILING water. COVER tightly, and (as others have said) let sit 6 to 8 minutes before you eat it. We find it best to put the dry soup block UNDER the noodles, then add the water. Otherwise the block of "soup" sits on top of the noodles as they swell and may not dissolve properly. Recommended!

review/text: See's chocolates are quite simply the best I've tasted. It isn't just the chocolate itself, which is excellent; it's the way all of the flavors come together. When I put a See's candy into my mouth, it grabs a hold of my attention and focuses it on my taste buds. It says, "Hey, this isn't just a piece of candy, this is something special, something apart." It's as though I can taste each individual flavor note separately, like chocolate, walnut, butter, sugar, a hint of salt...while simultaneously tasting the gestalt of all those flavors blended. Eating a piece of See's is an event.

review/summary: My favorite Sees assortment
review/text: I never used to like nuts and chews before I tried Sees; now they are my favorite.  You really get a mouthful with Sees, and  there's nothing particularly "fine" about them, just good dark chocolate (the "American" version) in this particular mix.  In another review for Sees I mentioned that the first time I ever had a See's chocolate I exclaimed "This is like eating FOOD".  What I meant was, you get something substantial to chew on, not just a mouthful of sweetness and goo.  They are hefty, beefy, and not treacly.  I consider them the very high end of your basic all-around chocolate assortment.<br /><br />I have also special-ordered customized assortments from their website, and I can attest to their really good shipping and delivery methods.  No melting, and every perfect little gem in its place - until I can get my hands on 'em.

review/summary: Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!
review/text: This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.

review/summary: Amazing For Finicky Eaters and Stomach Issues
review/text: If you have a dog that turns his or her nose up to all dry and wet foods from premium names such as Wellness CORE, Merrick, Blue Buffalo, Evo, Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried Patties, Dr. Harvey's etc. then you have to give this a try. My dog is a 40lb Sheltie/Collie mix so having a large highly active dog that wouldn't eat was very stressful I hear many people with toy breeds having the problem but I never thought I would happen with a high energy dog. I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not. When I read that it was jerky like pieces it sparked an interest because she loves those types of treats. The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much. The smell and texture is incredible I never saw her eat so fast and she is so much more energetic and happy this food is amazing and not that expensive considering the smaller portion. I could not be more happy this product has everything I need.

review/summary: One of the best dog food out there.
review/text: I have a very picky puppy that would often rather starve himself, than to eat something he doesn't like. Because of that, he was becoming underweight and I decided to switch him away from dry kibble to have him gain some weight first before worrying bout his picky taste.<br />However when I give him ziwipeak, he would finish it up right away!<br /><br />This brand is expensive, but based upon the amounts you feed, it isn't really that much expensive if you have a small dog. I have a 2 pound puppy that is expected to mature at about 4-5 pounds, and the costs is about 25cents extra a day. If you have a big dog that's gonna gobble up 1/3 of a bag or more a day, then that will be a lot more expensive for you.<br /><br />But......<br />The quality of food and the fact that it is in a jerky meat form makes it a lot better than eating hard dry kibble all day long.<br />Anyone would be bored of eating biscuits everyday for his entire life :/<br /><br />The quality of this food is unsurpassed.<br />There have been no problems at all with this food at all as well either. No recalls, all made in New Zealand as well.<br /><br />Something that I tell a lot of people.<br />Spend more on food daily, and not risk the possibility of having a sick dog due to some pet food recall. Vet bills are going to cost you a few thousand dollars.<br />Expensive dog food will probably add up to the same cost as most over the duration of your dog's life, unless you have a really big dog.<br />So instead of having to go through the grief of having a puppy in pain, and you undergoing mental and emotional stress, why not just give it a food that is good and safe and something that the dog enjoys, and spare yourself from all that unnecessary trouble?<br /><br />Yes times are hard and most people are having difficulty putting dinner on the table for themselves or their kids. So there are situations where foods like this are just too much to afford.<br />So unless if your budget really is a problem, I would recommend this food to anyone!

review/summary: Yes, it's expensive but...
review/text: SO WORTH IT.  And when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is a lot of food packed into those tiny squares.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.

review/summary: Looks gross, smells gross, my dog loves it!!!
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this because it costs a fortune and venison and fish sounded pretty unappetizing.  But I was desperate, because I have a 16 year old dog who's always been a picky eater but had now lost a dangerous amount of weight because of a heart condition.  The pet store said this was the tastiest thing they had in stock and they couldn't keep it on their shelves, so despite its $4/can price tag, I decided to try it.<br /><br />The food looks gross.  It has strange-looking pieces in it (tripe? some exotic part of the venison or blue mussel?), and it doesn't smell like something I would want to eat, either.  But my dog cannot get enough of it. She gobbles it up and begs for more.  She's gained back the weight she lost, and feeding her is no longer an excruciating, hour long process of coaxing and pleading.  Unlike some cheaper canned foods I've tried, it does not give her digestive problems.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater and you've tried everything, try Ziwipeak.  Maybe your dog just has a sophisticated palette :-)

review/summary: Great Product - Too Expensive!
review/text: I've tried raw, canned and dry.  Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.  It is absent the corn and wheat products that you should avoid.  It is not a totally dry food but comes in a bag and is more dry than wet.  I suggest you also store in the refrigerator.  The four rating is because it is also one of the most expensive products - so much so that I may have to keep searching for a less expensive alternative.  I am also concerned at recent reports that the concentration of too much animal protein in a dog's diet may create organ problems.  If you use this food check for portion size which is less than your usual kibble.  And don't forget to give your four legged friend a sprout of brocolli, chip of sweet potatoe and some other vegetables now and then.  Do your research as there are some foods that should not be fed to your dogs includeing cooked bones which can cause havoc for them.

review/summary: raw fed travel made easier  *BUT*....
review/text: I have a small breed service dog and his raw food diet can be a challenge when we travel. I bought this food based on the fact that it's the closest ingredient-wise to what I'd feed him at home. He loves this food and literally spins in circles when he hears me open the container I store it in, something he has NOT done for other foods in the past.<br /><br />My issue with this food is that when I received the bag I noticed through the window on the back of the package that the lower third of the bag seemed to be mostly crumbs; in transferring the upper portion of the bag to a smaller storage container I found that most of the bottom of the bag was almost "dust". The "dust" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.<br /><br />Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.<br /><br />Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the brand - at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and break, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping. Either way, this product makes traveling so much easier and my pup just loves having it at home as a treat so I've ordered a second bag today and will see if the crumb issue repeats itself or not.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/16/12: The second bag (Lamb) was received in perfect condition this time.<br /><br />Would purchase again and recommend.

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: I finally upgraded to the 11 lb bag after purchasing several 2.2 1b bags. I have two small dogs at home, both are 10 pounds each. I was trying out the raw food diet after doing research online, and while the dogs loved it, I was definitely not a fan of the raw meat and having to wipe everywhere when they were done eating.<br /><br />Along comes Ziwipeak, and I tested out the different flavors in the smaller portions, ALL of which the two dogs loved.<br /><br />Here are the marked differences since switching over (previously they were on Merrick dry food, before that was Halo).<br /><br />Fresh breath, no more doggy odor!<br />Stools do not smell (or very very faint)<br />One of the dogs - a Maltese - her tearstains have completely disappeared!!<br />Glossier coats<br />More energetic<br /><br />Etc etc.<br /><br />So even though this is expensive, in terms of the visible differences you can see in the dogs, I believe it's worth it!

This morning i put out a small portion of "ZiwiPeak Real Meat Grain Free Air Dried Raw Dog Food, Venison & Fish" from a 2.2 lb bag and my yorkie gobbled it up. Shipping was quick too.

I never in a million years thought I would spend 26 dollars on 2 pounds of dog food but I did.  I do not feed this to my dog by itself.  I crumble up the pieces and mix it in with my dog's food.  Man....does she gobble up her food now.....it is terrific not having to sit with her to get her to eat.  Even the cat picks some of the Ziwi out of her bowl.  : )  I certainly could not afford to feed my dog this food by itself but for those of us that want to give our dogs a treat or that need a supplement to encourage our pets to eat, I would strongly recommend this dog food.  It is quality through and through.  : )

review/summary: greatest dog food ever, but the price jump the worst
review/text: I can't say enough about ZiwiPeak, hands down the best dog food on the market, both dry (11 lbs) and canned food. I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service. Unfortunately, with the New Zealand manufacturer's new canning supplier and packaging, within two weeks Whole Health Pet started charging freight and their prices jumped up to $2.00 more average PER CAN (plus shipping), and $40 more PER BAG (plus shipping)!! I am not changing ZiwiPeak for my dogs, but I am buying elsewhere which has slightly lower price overall but with faster shipping. I feel I need to talk about the price, because while ZiwiPeak could be the best dog food ever, so many more dogs cannot have them because the price is simply beyond their owners' reach, not good.<br /><br />I hope Amazon Prime will pick up this line soon!!!

review/summary: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the product AND the company behind it!
review/text: I wrote a REALLY long review regarding a different brand freeze dried dog food and now I'm wishing I hadn't because it probably makes this product seem not as good in comparison and nothing could be further from the truth!<br /><br />When I originally read all of the reviews about this product I was a bit skeptical but VERY hopeful (despite the cost)since so many reviewers said that this was the one food that their totally-picky dog would actually eat.<br /><br />When I first tried giving her a nibble while out on a walk she turned her nose up at it like she does with all new things. I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.<br /><br />(I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn't seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!<br /><br />She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it's literally the FIRST and only food I've been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.<br /><br />She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.<br /><br />It's understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw-only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren't that big to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can't say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their "trial size" is a good size bag!) It wasn't until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8-$10!<br /><br />Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn't able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.<br /><br />Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip-lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don't make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn't stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)<br /><br />To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!<br /><br />It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.<br /><br />Can't say enough good things about this food - if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn't be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn't the case.

review/text: My golden|yellow lab mix was adopted from the shelter with a number of health issues including severe malnutrition, a pretty bad skin condition, and chronic  inflammation of the feet and face.  We placed him on an elimination diet and found that he was allergic to chicken, turkey and beef.  I use the ZiwiPeak, fish and pork as the main sources of protein for his diet. He loves the venison over the other flavors and has put on 40 healthy pounds and his skin and allergy issues have pretty much been cleared-up.<br /><br />The food is not the hard dried fare, but small moist squares.  It offered a good option for a balanced meal and you cannot beat the convenience of the pouch.  I would recommend refrigeration after opening.

It is all meat and we supplement with a little people food and snacks but there is no filler and no byproducts and she eats less volume.<br /><br />It was not available in this area, even though the local specialty store Paw Prince gave us samples and carries the snacks made by Ziwi Peak.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase this product from Amazon.

review/summary: Great substitute for raw diet, but expensive!
review/text: We have a 13 month old, 100+ pound Rottweiler who loves his Ziwipeak.  We started him on the raw diet a few months ago, and use ZiwiPeak for training treats and for regular meals.  It combines the benefits of a raw diet with the convenience of kibble.  Notable good points: great 'output' for a dog with a sensitive stomach, gleaming coat with significantly less dander, fresh breath, easy to feed, and good for times when feeding frozen raw is difficult (traveling, boarding, you've forgotten to defrost the raw...).<br /><br />I took away one star for the high cost.  HOWEVER, a portion of Ziwipeak goes a longer way than the same amount of kibble, and the cost is on par - or slightly less if you look around - than most frozen raw foods.

review/text: We are pretty happy with these product. the dog doesn;t have nearly as much gas as she did on other KIbble diet. The only thing that was better was a completely RAW diet, but with that you never know if the product you have purcahsed is the freshes it can be, and the pet suffers for that. where as the ZIWIPeak stay fresh for at lest 30 days after you open it and longer if you serve from the freezer.

review/summary: Best thing on the market (without the mess)!
review/text: My puppy has been on way too many dog foods: Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and now ZiwiPeak. Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!

review/summary: it's like crack for dogs
review/text: i've never met a dog who didn't devour this food with tail-wagging, tunnel-visioned gusto. it looks like tiny pieces of beef jerky and if you have a picky eater they'll probably be delighted with this food.  it's grain free and super expensive but worth it -- it has helped curb the awful gas of our 13 lb chihuahua/min-pin. as a bonus, his coat is shinier too. (now if we could just make his breath & body odor better).... the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price.

review/summary: every dog should eat this!
review/text: This dog food is absolutely wonderful.  If I could afford to, I would feed my dog only this.  My 2 year old Vizsla is the pickiest dog I've ever met (won't even eat most treats) and she can't get enough of this food.  Not only does she actually get excited about her meals, it has had marvelous effects on her digestion, even though she only gets this food about half the time.  Her stools are noticeably smaller and more solid (always a problem with her) and her usually bad flatulence is almost non-existent.  If you have a dog with any food sensitivities and have tried many different foods this will be the last food you will need to try.  My dog has never looked and acted healthier than she has on this food (and I have tried about 20 different brands).  You won't be disappointed, it is worth every penny!

review/summary: Venison Very High Quality Dry & Raw - No Grains
review/text: Have a miniature poodle and he is a very picky eater.  When we eat rib eye, leg of lamb etc that is what he wants too.  Well we love our dog but we were looking for a compromise that would not cost an arm and a leg. He just would not eat other dry dog foods and we were told feeding him canned food should be the exception and not the rule.<br /><br />This seems to be it. He likes this one the best.  But we are going to have to rotate it with other varieties. Because he just wont eat the same thing for any length of time.<br /><br />Definitely, he likes this one a whole lot. And we can feel good about the quality.  Also this supposedly keeps the amount of poo down to.

review/summary: Our Mini Schnauzer loves this!
review/text: If you had a lot of lamb in your life you'd be impressed with how "lammy" this dog food smells. Our little dog absolutely loves it too. Why wouldn't he?<br /><br />A hidden advantage of using this food is that you don't have to pick up much poo at all. Because this food is nearly twice as concentrated as kibble you'd only be picking up about half as much poo, which is a good benefit. Also, it takes up half as much space in your storage.<br /><br />An all around winner which more than makes up for the small premium in price.

review/summary: My Westie loves it!
review/text: I have a 6 year old westie that had the worst food allergies, her coat was very brittle, and she had low energy.  One walk and she'd be passed out.  As many of you on here, I take pride in my dog and pride that I want to take care of it the best that I am able to. I've tried blue buffalo and other high rated foods, but she would not eat them unless I "spiced" it up with something. It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.<br /><br />What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)<br /><br />For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet. For my dog she requires about 0.75 ounces or 3/4 of a scoop and that goes a long way for a 2.2 lb. bag.  So its not like I am buying this dog food every week.<br /><br />The only small negative is the dog food has a slight smell to it.  Nothing that will make you vomit but its not something I am used to smelling when giving her dog food.  For those wondering what the dog food looks like?  It's like small shredded pieces of dark jerky.<br /><br />Recommendation?  BUY

review/text: I have three puppy mill rescue Pekingese and I have tried about every other high end dog food that I could think to try.  This is by far the best dog food that I have found to date.  One of my dogs has terrible food allergies and can't eat ANY other foods without getting a bad reaction.  Another one of my dogs previously had very bad tear staining, but when I asked around I heard various reasons why (I was told hard water- switched to deer park with no results) and after eating ziwipeak my dog's tear stains are GONE.  It's unreal.  Most importantly... they LOVE it!  Even when I walk past the bag, they go nuts.  Worth EVERY PENNY.

review/summary: ZiwiPeak Addict
review/text: My dog loves his ZP. He's primarily a ZP venison kind of guy due to allergies, but with trying to introduce new protein sources to him I've turned to the other varieties of ZP including the Venison and Fish and Lamb. Both were gobbled down without hesitation. Clearly he doesn't know that the food is good for him, or I suspect that he would be requiring it to be doused with canned food! But that is the wonderful thing about ZP - it is super high quality with no grains or fillers AND dogs love it. And my boy Titan looks better than he ever has; he's always been a strong dog, but on ZP he looks like he lifts weights. He's been on an exclusive ZP diet for about 4 or 5 months and his coat is shiny and velvety like a champion racehorse.<br /><br />Something to attest to the supreme flavor of this food: recently I was running low on ZP and so I had to supplement with some raw venison. I put down a bowl of raw venison for him while I was rationing out the ZP. He pushed the raw venison chunks around and then looked at me and gave me that familiar nod as if to say "you gonna give me some of that?" No raw venison for him. Titan wanted his ZP and nothing more.

review/summary: Excellent food for allergic pets
review/text: My dog, Lucy, suffers from a host of allergies.  Of the higher quality dog foods on the market, Ziwi Peak is the only one without carrots or barley (two foods she cannot have).  Lucy loves this food and her allergies are much better--there are no grains, fillers, colors, preservatives or vegetables (I can give her those separately from home).  Without Ziwi peak I would be making stuff at home.  This is convenient and well worth the price--I only wish I could find a local retailer so I wouldn't have to order online...

review/text: Tuffy, my 7 lb Pomeranian, has been the pickiest eater these 12 years and I have spent many hours searching for organic/natural products for him. It's been very difficult to find food he likes, but he went right to the venison and I am elated!<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with air-dried products and was surprised how dense the pieces are. He's eating a little more than recommended, but that's okay with me, it's good stuff.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, not only because Tuffy likes it, but it is also a great value.

She didn't do well with many of the so-called organic products because they still contain a lot of low quality grains/starches.  Even better, there's less dog waste to clean up too because the product doesn't have useless fillers.

review/summary: Great raw food that dogs love...and grain free!!
review/text: We have loved ZiwiPeak for a few years now, when it was introduced to us by our local pet boutique.  (which is now out of business, unfortunately) It is available in venison, venison-fish, beef...and our dog loves all three, but due to past health issues we tend to stay with one of the 'venison' ones.  There is no odor, they look like little dried out beef jerky, but are not that hard.  They also have great treats.  It is a complete diet and it IS concentrated so feed only about 1/3 of what you would normally feed.  I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Pugs love ZiwiPeak!!!
review/text: A must have if you are looking for an alternative to a raw food diet.  Both of my pugs LOVE IT!  It is a little pricey, but you only use a tiny scoop for each portion for a small dog. WORD OF CAUTION: after using ZiwiPeak for several months, I noticed my dogs were gaining A LOT of weight.  You really have to stick to the manufacturers directions.  This is dehydrated food and a little goes a long way. I love too that they use ranch raised animals with no hormones or antibiotics or fresh fish not from farms.<br /><br />From the Raw Food Diet to ZiwiPeak:<br />After much research and debate with both my husband and my veterinarian, I decided to try a raw food diet.  Well, the raw meat was just nasty and my pug would go for several days without eating.  Proponents of the raw food diet say this is normal because the raw meat/bones took longer to digest, but truly, my dog just seemed ravenous.  Normally she was very polite when we ate, now she was begging and even jumping up trying to get food off of the table.  I just couldn't take any more.  Yes, her teeth were gorgeous and her digestion seemed better, but the poor dog seemed very unhappy with her food.  We tried to the frozen food that you thaw out and that worked okay for a while, a nice treat now and then...but then we found ZiwiPeak!

review/summary: Air Dried Venison Formula-Dogs Like It
review/text: I have been a raw feeder now for about a month. I've tried various high quality frozen and Freeze/Air-Dried dog food. I love ZiwiPeak's philosophy re quality and the ingredients seems to be top of the line. This is a nice idea for traveling with dogs who normally eat frozen raw (hard to go camping or car-tripping with frozen raw dog food). My Chow Chow first sniffed the food, walked away, then came back and ate it. My shih tzu walked away and left it (though she doesn't like dark meat generally - normally she eats fowl or rabbit - sometimes lamb). I am currently dog sitting for a poodle who will eat anything and he gobbled it right up. I may not purchase this product again simply because my dogs are really picky. But, I would purchase it if I had a dog like the poodle I am sitting for; as mentioned above, I feel this brand's ingredients are top of the line.
