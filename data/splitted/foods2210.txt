review/text: I have to say, I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't surprised by these either. It says something on the package about "no more fighting for the corner brownie" on mine. These are not like the corner piece. More like a very thin layer of brownie batter that's crispy and broken up in large and small pieces.<br />I dipped mine in peanut butter and it was better. I suggest eating these with milk.<br />I got mine at TJ Max so I got them discounted. It's a different snack for people tired of the same old thing.<br />I give it 3.5 - 4 stars.

review/summary: Pretty good candy
review/text: I love sweet and sour candies, so I decided to give these a try. My initial impression is that they don't put a lot of the candy in each box, but I guess that's pretty typical. The candies look good but were pretty stuck together in the bag. No biggie. When I first tried these, my thoughts were that the candy has a nice little sour taste to them when you first put them in your mouth, then the sour goes away pretty fast (within 5 seconds or so). I would have preferred that they have more sourness to them, but that's ok. The flavor is good and is a nice mix between strawberry and watermelon. The texture is more spongy or chewy than a candy like Sour Punch Kids. These "Bits" are not gummy like those.<br /><br />Overall, I like the taste, wish there was more sour, and the texture is pretty good. Not my favorite but definitely still good!

review/summary: SO EXCELLENT!
review/text: Parmigiano Reggiano Top Grade 10 Pounds, I didn't Know what to expect, I saw my Mailman with a Big Box under his arm and I knew right away it was my Big Chunk of Cheese, I got so Excited, the first thing I did, after I stop Dancing, was to put it on the Scale...That's Right 10 Pounds Exactly! Took it out of the plastic bag and wrapped it in a piece of cloth after I cut off a Big 1 Pound Wedge, put it back in the plastic bag. The Smell Filled my Kitchen, Almost like a Religious Experience, I knew then, I had to Cook Something Special and Good!<br /><br />I Made Whole Wheat Penne Pasta with Sausages Chopped Bell Peppers Onions Parsley Garlic and a couple Jalapeno Chiles (no seeds or veins)a little Tomato sauce to the Sofrito not too much maybe 3 Tablespoons and mix it all up with the Pasta and 3 Different Cheeses, Shredded Mozzarela, Low Fat Cottage Cheese and The King Of Cheeses Parmigiano Reggiano, with Homemade Bread crumbs ( I didn't have any, I had to make my own) with Extra Virgin Olive Oil and More Grated Parmigiano Reggiano, mix it all together and Sprinkle over the top to create a Crusty Brown and Crispy Topping, and in the Oven it Goes.<br /><br />I Spend an Hour Creating this Masterpiece, Wow!... was that ever Good! I made enough for the four of us. My Family though I had Lost it, However, They Loved Dinner! I Like to Grate Parmigiano Reggiano over Pasta Dishes obviously and also with a Vegetable Peeler making very thin slices and Sprinkle over Salads, I do that a Lot, but my Favorite way of eating it is by cutting two long pieces like French Fried Potatoes and Pour a Little Good Orange Honey over the Cheese...so GOOD! That's how Italians eat it for Dessert, They might add some Sliced Truffles/ Fruit or some of that 100 Years Old Balsamic Vinegar!...I don't!<br /><br />I had Eaten other Parmigiano Reggiano Cheeses that were Aged for longer than 18-20 months, with very hard texture and all the Crystallized little white specks that tastes like Candy! ...<br />This one from "Go Italy Gourmet" is Top Grade with an Excellent Taste. Another thing I really like about it, is that it doesn't have that much of that Thick Hard Rind so common of this type of Cheeses, Therefore, Not Much Waste! It arrived in Perfect Condition and in Time as Promised with Ice-Packs and Dry-Ice and a Note with Instructions from Francesco, Customer Service, I could tell they took good care of my Order, Thank You. I will Order again when ever I finish all 10 Pounds of this Wheel! ...That might take Awhile!<br /><br />Did you know, Cistercian Monks first created Grana Padano Cheese in the 11th Century, Parmigiano Reggiano came about Two Hundred Years Later, each Cheese is Made according to its Ancient Origin, each Cheese today is still Identical to how they were Centuries Ago. The Name of the Town and Country where the Cheese is made is Parma, Italy, Thus the Name, it takes 160 Gallons of Milk to make a Wheel this Size of Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese, That's a Lot of Milk, and it weights about 80 Pounds!<br />...so 1/8 of a Wheel is 10 Pounds, that's Exactly what I've Got! Thank You!

review/summary: Perfect.
review/text: Boy, does it make me sad to see so many people leaving comments about shipping problems as "reviews," rating the product down because of the service received.  This salsa has only a 4 star average rating, strictly because of people who don't understand what a product review is, and it's unfair both to the manufacturer of the product (in this case a relatively small, family-owned operation in Texas called Riba Foods), nor shoppers who are trying to find a good product based on this review system.  How I wish Amazon would offer a "this is not a review" button as opposed to just "helpful," "not helpful," and "abuse."  (We can all click "not helpful," but that doesn't counter the inaccurate product rating; and it's not "abuse," just ignorance.)<br /><br />Here--before I get rightfully accused of hypocrisy--is my REVIEW of this SALSA: It's fantastic.  There are very, very few salsas sold in run-of-the-mill grocery stores marketed as "hot" that are actually HOT.  I have had "hot" salsas that list no type of hot chilies in the ingredients, and show it.  I have had "hot" salsas that were as tepid as canned tomatoes.  I have had "hot" salsas that, while tasty, just barely break the medium barrier.  This is not one of those.  It is actually spicy, how-about-some-milk, oh-dear-is-that-stomach-acid-in-my-throat-lining, this-can't-be-good-for-my-ulcer HOT!  I love it!<br /><br />An aside: The only other relatively widely available hot salsa that I can think of is Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero.  I love that one, too, but it suffers from the unfortunate problem of being too thin.  Watery thin.  With very few chunks.  The taste is fantastic, but the texture is monumentally disappointing.<br /><br />Well, not so with this one: The texture is perfect--it's thick and it clings to the chip.  You can see all the little flecks of roasted chili skin in there, and all the seeds, too.<br /><br />The one thing that threw me about this salsa--and made me bypass it several times before finally trying it--is that the ingredients list contains carrots.  ...CARROTS?  That's just weird.<br /><br />What's even weirder is that there is no hint of them in the salsa.  No carrot flavour, no carrot texture, and I can't find a chunk of carrot in that jar to save my life.  I suspect they might be pureed for thickening--maybe that's what makes the salsa thicker and more clingy than you usually get with a traditional Mexican roasted salsa like this one.<br /><br />You can taste the roasted pepper flavour, you can really feel the heat, the tomatoes are stellar, and it's not too salty (the tortilla chip provides enough of that!).  The burn lasts, too.  I find myself sucking air over my tongue for several minutes after I've stopped indulging.<br /><br />If you like truly spicy salsa without having to track down a specialty chilihead shoppe, and you know the deliciousness of roasted peppers (heck, roasted anything!), then give it a try.  I can't imagine you would regret it.<br /><br />Oh, and when you do try it and find you love it: Do everyone a favour and leave a review on the product about the PRODUCT.  If you think it's a five star salsa with 2 star shipping... the proper rating is FIVE STARS.  Not four, not three, but five.  Save your shipping complaints for the SHIPPER.  It's only fair.

review/summary: Way Too Hot / Amazon Is Not
review/text: We usually order the medium and ABSOLUTELY LOVE it but Amazon didn't have enough of the medium in stock so to get free shipping we padded our order with some of the hot.  Sorry, but the hot is waaaay too hot and I'm no weenie when it comes to spice.  I'd give it 1 star because it's so hot you can't really taste the salsa - that's a crime because the medium (which you can actually taste) is 5+ stars.  Amazon gets 1 star as well for such a pitiful web setup to report a problem with orders of this salsa.  We didn't get all of the medium we ordered and since the salsa is not returnable there is no way to report a problem online with your order (it just tells you the item is not returnable).

review/summary: The whole family loves these - full of energy and taste
review/text: I brought a bunch of these with me on vacation as I knew we would be on-the-go for long days and "good" food would often be hard to find.  Every family member from the 6 year old to my husband were willing to eat these, and I can't think of many products that holds true for!  The biggest problem was getting everyone to share.  You could definitely feel your energy pick-up as this is a good protein source- not just empty calories like a bag of chips.<br /><br />The "Crunch" is very much like a granola bar, but broken into smaller chunks.  Some chunks fit in one mouthful, but sometimes they take a bite or two.<br /><br />We also love the ingredient list here - so short is great for our allergy set (No Dairy, gluten, soy, etc).<br /><br />I can eat this size in one sitting, but I do try to save some since they are a bit pricey.  They have a 1.25 ounce size also - perfect for the younger kids.  These are very portable.  I've been pleased with Mareblu's other products as well.

It is refreshing and rejuvenating. In my opinion, you cannot get more natural than this brand (no preservatives).  I highly recommend it and proudly give it 5 stars. Delivery was quick and no dented cans.  Glad to see it is back on sale and under $24 with super saving shipping (big bonus).  I am also  interested in automated ordering, if possible.

review/text: The C2O is so much better than the 2 big advertisers in the coconut water market. Only problem here is -- that $17 dollar shipping is a killer. Pushes the cost to 'way too much' land.

review/text: I suppose one's mileage may vary when it comes to consumable products, but I have to say I am VERY pleased with this brand of rosewater. I bought it to try making my own rosewater lemonade, and I was very pleased with the results. It is true that the scent is somewhat faint, but the taste I found fairly exploded in my mouth.  I didn't even need to add sugar to the lemonade it tasted so good as it was with the rosewater. I'm looking forward to trying other recipe with this rosewater. Ahmed definitely has a new customer in me.

IT HARLDY HAS A SCENT AT ALL AND TASTES LIKE TAPWATER WITH BARELY A HINT OF ROSES [IF ANY, IT COULD HAVE BEEN MY IMAGINATION SINCE I WAS EXPECTING A SCENT AFTER ALL]. OF ALL THE INFO THAT I'VE READ ABOUT ROSEWATER AND ABOUT HOW IT SHOULD SMELL THIS ONE DOES NOT MAKE THE GRADE. PRODUCER SHOULD RECONSIDER THE PERCENTAGE OF ROSEWATER TO DISTILLED WATER. VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED.

review/text: I just received my first shipment (I did Subscribe & Save on this item) about 15 minutes ago. I immediately opened the package and then the bag--being very excited to try these out. To my great frustration and dismay, these berries are nowhere near being "soft" or "chewy". They are dry and crunchy. They taste o.k. I didn't notice any "off" flavor or smell, but they are just dry and fairly tasteless. Very disappointed.

The plastic bag seems to work better than the other brands that have used a metallic type bag which in turn gave the other brands of berries a metallic taste like I would imagine aluminum foil tasting.  The fact that these did not taste that way has kept them in our cupboard!

review/text: I have had goji berries from several sources, and the Navitas gojis are the best quality I've had.  There aren't any bad or rotten berries in the mix, and they are fresh tasting.  Also, I pay half the price (for the same brand/product)  when I buy them through this venue in comparison to my local health-food store, and gojis aren't cheap, so that's a big incentive!  Anyway, I highly recommend this nutritious and delicious snack.  I like to put them in goat yogurt with my oatmeal.  :)

review/summary: Navitas Goji Berries - Made in China
review/text: I was really excited to try these and then when I opened the bag I was thoroughly disappointed. They don't smell like they would be dried berries; in fact they smell more earthy than berry-ish. Himalayan superfruit the package says.... These berries have barely any taste at all. I did not enjoy them. Then of course I pan around to ingredients and notice "product of China". I know the Himalayas run to China but still, why is it that it seems almost everything comes from China now? Given their terrible enforcement for quality control in everything across the board, including food production, I don't want to be eating any product coming out of China. Their terrible quality water supply and even worse air quality are enough for me to frown on anything edible coming from China. Not to mention their consistent history for allowing chemically tainted foods to be consumed by their population.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: My father introduced me to goji back in 1980. Yes we are Chinese.<br />My wife likes this product. But they are more expensive than the high quality ones<br />in an herbal store. Now, I have to find out how to grow these in my backyard.<br />My father did it in our backyard in Queens NYC back in the 1980s. Too bad<br />I mow the lawn one time and didn't know that this plant was removed. S*#$<br /><br />We made soup from the leaves of our Goji plant. I remembered that soup helped my eyes open wider, and<br />I felt more awaken.  That was before I turned 20. I was still a virgin, already full of energy,<br /> and this soup helped.<br />If I can grow Goji plants in my backyard again, it will be great. We can make the soup again.<br />If this company sells the leaves, it won't make as much money as the berries, but<br />it will make money.<br />Oh, about this product.  My wife and I are trying to make a baby. This is one of the herbs we are betting on to help. I don't feel sick after 2 hours of eating these. I got sick eating those from Chinatown supermarkets, straight out of the bag.  I didn't know I have to soak and rinse those, and I got sick. With these, I am still fine after 2 hours.

review/summary: Favorite new ingredient in cookies
review/text: I could talk about all the health benefits that goji berries provide, but I would rather talk about my own experience with them since there is so much nutritional information out there. I have used these in oatmeal, cookies, trail mix, yogurt, a sauce on chicken, cake, stuffing and several other recipes. In their dried state I am not as crazy about them because you can not taste the real flavor that they are hiding. When reconstituted with liquid, they plump up like raisins do. They are soft and chewy and my favorite new ingredient in trail mix cookies. I have purchased three large pouches and have used subscribed and save. Buying that way allowed me to get twice as much for the same price as I saw in the grocery store. Great deal!

review/summary: These goji berries not recommended
review/text: Unfortunately I did not read all the 1-star ratings on this product prior to purchasing.  I had similar experiences with this Navitas product having black spots and mold.  Some of the berries were extremely dried out but nothing to be concerned about because it is dried fruit.  I have read articles stating that eating too much of this at one time can cause gastrointestinal issues.  Yes, I experienced that but do not fault Navitas.  I am disappointed with black spots and mold because it was on about 1/3 of the berries.  I do fault Navitas for that.  I decided to throw away the remaining amount instead of picking out the good berries because mold spores can spread and did not want to get sick.  When the local Whole Foods had goji berries in the bulk department, I did not see any of the mold or black spots.  I will look at other brands as recommended by other reviewers.

review/summary: Certified organic but not as tasty as some
review/text: I was really happy to find out Amazon was selling goji berries. They can be hard to find and these are a reasonable price for the convenience factor of having them delivered. A doctor prescribed the berries for general health -- they are supposed to be good for eyes (I work at the computer long hours) and they also have many antioxidant and anti aging properties associated with them.  I use them in tea in the morning. Like others, I found the Navitas brand to be small and dry. I wouldn't say they are good for putting in trail mixes because they aren't very chewy, but making tea with them where they soak and expand works well.<br /><br />Earlier this year I was in NYC and went to a Chinese herbalist shop I have gone to over the years. There I bought some berries that were Lin Sister Herb brand, about $10 for 1-2lb package. These are also marked organic (they qualify "organic or low pesticide residue" on the back of the packaging) but as others note, not certified by USDA, so who knows. I can say though, without a doubt, they are richer in taste, chewy, sweeter (but not artificially sweetened or soaked in sugar) and about twice the size of Navitas Brand. They also say they are from the "Best Region" but don't specify the region like Navitas does, calling theirs Himalayan. The region qualification makes sense to me because some herbs to grow better in certain environments and facing certain directions, so I am sure region can influence effectiveness in herbs. In the package of Lin Sister Herbs I have also found bits of leaves.<br /><br />So reading these reviews I think there is a trade-off going on with the berries. If having them certified organic and kosher is the most important feature of the berries one is looking for, Navitas seems to be a better brand. If you are looking for taste, size and texture (some call this quality), the Lin Sister Herb brand ranks higher for me. However, I haven't found  Lin Sister Herb gojis on Amazon. So I am sure I will buy both again as opportunity permits.

review/summary: Tasty and fresh
review/text: I have read where people have received dried out Goji's. I can say that this was not the case for me. They have a touch more moisture than a raisin. However, in my opinion, they are far more tasty and versatile, in addition to being an incredibly healthy item to consume. We use ours in a variety of things, from homemade trail mix to being mixed into our waffle batter to a salad topping, and finally, we use them in our green smoothies as well. I anticipate finding more uses for them, but for now, that is what we've tried. I would like to say also that 16 ounces of goji berries goes a long way. I thought we would have gone through the bag in two weeks, but a almost a month in, with daily use, for two people, we still have around half a bag. So, that falls in line with the recommended, one delivery every two months, for the subscribe and save subscription. Anyways, i highly recommend this product if you are attentive to your health at all, and for vegetarians/vegans (we are the latter), it's a must have for your kitchen.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Everyone should have it in the pantry !
review/text: I do not love berries, not raspberries nor blueberries commonly sold in US market. Just cannot get used to their flavors. Berries are, in fact, one of the best products nature mother gives us. Goji berries are my alternatives and I would recommend it to everyone like me.<br /><br />This sun-dried goji berries are exactly what we have in China. Unlike other products flavored towards American people's taste, this one is not sweetened by apple juice or honey or sugar. And you can not believe how thrilled I was when I took the 1st bite.<br /><br />You can eat it directly out of the package and it is not bad-tasting at all. Or, put some in your favorite tea. But be aware that it is not compatible with all kinds of teas. Do some research and you'll know what kind of tea goes the best with Goji berries. You can even put it in your chicken soup. Yes, I am not kidding! Stew the chicken with goji berries or other traditional chinese herbs . It will give you a whole different flavor and it tastes like heaven!<br /><br />Stop eating chips and throw them all way, please! Have a few goji berries and you wont regret your choice when you get older.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: I bought a small amount of dried goji berries from my co-op prior to purchasing them from Amazon because I couldn't wait until my shipment arrived.  I really wanted to try them after reading all about their nutritional benefits.  I wasn't super impressed with the co-op ones.  They weren't very tasty.  The word stale came to mind.  I was afraid I had just thrown money out the window.  But when I got my order I cracked open the bag & these were fantastic!  They were slightly sweet, chewy & "fresh" in a freeze dried way.  I will definitely buy from Navitas Naturals brand again!

review/text: These goji berries are quite tasty and chewy.  The price is very reasonable considering they are organic.  I've had other goji berries that were larger and more plump, but also at least 50% more expensive.  These are great for cereals, oatmeal or as a snack on its own.  No unneeded dyes, preservatives or additives.  Give it a try!

review/summary: Gogi super food~
review/text: I give this 5 stars for it's what it purports to be. I don't like to rate on personal taste.  I have seen some describe these as a combination of dried cranberry and raisin.  To me it's a combination between a dried cranberry and a rose hip.  Since the healthy daily requirement is only 15 bits, it's easy to just eat them as they are out of the bag. Research Gogi Berries using Google and you will be impressed with its laundry list of health benefits.<br /><br />I tried putting these in cereal and they don't absorb liquids readily, even if left to soak. I found that the taste is more preferable straight out of the bag. For me it did not 'add' to the flavor of my oatmeal. They may be better in a granola with other dried fruits? I bought the large bag so I will to eat a handful every day until they are gone. Unless I've developed a taste for them by the end of this large bag, I don't know that I will purchase them again. Enjoy the health benefits~

However we seldom eat them as raisins -- they always come as dry goji berries and we put them in hot water to drink water as goji berry tea, or cook them in soups as a type of herb.<br /><br />I was hesitating before placing order on Amazon because many people complained about its quality.

review/summary: Toxic! Find a better source.
review/text: Confirmed Goji Berry causing severe nausia cramping and intestinal pain.<br /><br />I was introduced to goji berries during the summer as a friend I met had just opened a raw food cafe. His food NEVER (I mean never) gave me any problems it was all delicious and much of it was cacao and goji berries. He has very selective about his sources and does not trust many companies out there.(His Goji comes from Sunfood)<br /><br />When I returned home from Alaska I decided to try more superfoods and bought a trail mix by Navitas that was Goji, Cacao Nibs, and Cashews. That day I had a green shake for breakfast and a banana for a snack then just a pinch of Goji Berries afterwards. Within the hour I was writhing in pain and couldn't imagine what it was.<br /><br />This pain is severe. I wanted to die. It lasted about twelve hours. Including vomiting and diarrhea<br /><br />Next day I had a big green salad for lunch and then feeling better grabbed another SMALL pinch of goji and within 20 minutes I was in the exact same pain. I knew then it was the goji and instantly typed "goji stomach ache" into google and found threads verifying it.<br /><br />I called my friend and told him about my reaction and he asked me if it was Navitas.  I didn't recall and didn't have the bag on me but he said he bet 100% it was them.  He had similar reaction to their product and did hydrogen peroxide tests and found them to be rancid.  Got home and verified his assertion.<br /><br />Again, I never had this problem before eating Goji from Sunfood, but this Navitas is killing me.<br /><br />BEWARE: Detox can be painful enough even on a quality Goji berry.  You should start with very small amounts and I would recommend trying alternate brands NOT navitas.

Almost to the point of unedible..<br />Unlike the Mountain ones I bought off Amazon, those seemed more powerful, fresh, and were chewy. And whats this I hear people getting sick?!<br />Wow, really sucks to be them..Anyways, out of sheer money constraints, and a lack of common sense and some desperation,  I will have to stick to these as I always throw away my reciepts, and I Know ghey won't give me a refund..<br /><br />Last thing..If the berries actually HAVE all the antioxidants etc, minerals, I will be just fine eating the hard little berries, but if something happened,  or they didn't DO it right and the nutrients are lacking, Wow...what can I do? Nothing, move on and order from somebody else.  Ps:NN also have acai powder which I prefer, the freeze dried powder acai is in its strongest form besides fresh. Been taking the powder and My skin looks like it did when I was 17.. (25 now). But guys, come on, ob iously thats not 100% whats making it work. I use Pure extra virgin coconut oil on skin everyday. Thats why my skin  women come up to me and feel me up,  well back to the point .. Dont order Goji berries from a pos untrusted brand. And whats this I hear it comes from China? I hope they are not trying to poison us. Its not our fault our government is a....im not going to get into it. Yall just have a nice day. Healthy eating!

review/summary: An expensive but healthy food
review/text: These berries are thought to be one of the one of the healthiest natural foods. There are many "stories" about the amazing benefits of these berries, many of which may be true, but a few verifiable facts about them (in dried form) follow:<br /><br />1) High protein (about 12%), and are a complete protein. This is good for anybody, but particularly noteworthy to vegans, who choose not to get their protein from meats.<br /><br />2) Decent fiber content (about 10%)<br /><br />3) 18 (!!) amino acids<br /><br />4) Like most sweet fruits, high in carbs and calories. 100 grams give you about 350-380 calories; roughly 3/4 from carbs and 1/4 from fat.<br /><br />5) 6 vitamins, 8 amino acids, 11+ minerals (more in trace amounts)<br /><br />6) Carotenoids, unsaturated fatty acids (this is a good thing), phytosterols (help lower cholesterol), and other healthy (or theoretically healthy but not particularly well researched) phytochemicals.<br /><br />Enough with the technical jargon. These berries are great in cereal, smoothies (once hydrated), and tea. For tea, try this:<br /><br />Put water, a small number of berries (6-15ish) and a teabag in your cup, microwave for about a minute per teacup (time varies), drop a small amount in your favorite tea along with the teabag and let the berries and tea steep for about 3 minutes.<br /><br />This adds a subtle character to green tea (plus an unusual, tasty snack to do with a few of the sips). The flavor seems to blend well with chai and jasmine too. This may work differently for those who use creamer.<br /><br />I recommend that you try a bag, keeping in mind that you may need to soak the berries in water/tea/whatever in order to make them soft, and see what you think. I have found they make a great addition to my usual cereal-only breakfast because they give me a much-needed protein boost.<br /><br />If you like them quite a lot, you may want to take the time to look for a supply in a nearby Asian foods store. I have heard they can be purchased at a lower cost in bulk.

review/text: Having consumed Himalania Goji Berries for over one year, the Navitas Naturals Goji Berry is a great addition to the exotic food market. The Navitas Goji is harder and drier than the Himalania Goji, but the flavor is much sweeter and better tasting.<br /><br />I love the fact that they're raw, vegan, sun-dried, and free of chemicals and pesticides! Goji berries are believed to strengthen the immune system, increase energy and reduce fatigue, and reduce the threat of free radicals (due to HIGH levels of antioxidants). Gojis have highest ORAC score to date! The ORAC scale is a standardized test used to measure the total antioxidant potency of foods and nutritional supplements.<br /><br />Definitely, one of my favorite foods!

review/summary: Leaves and worms
review/text: To start with, I'm a big fan of goji berries. A friend recommended another brand that I faithfully purchased until it was no longer available. I just found out it's name and packaging have changed and I've placed my order! In the interim, I purchased the Navitas brand and have been disappointed. There were a number of green and dried leaves in the bag, which I never experienced with the "other" brand. I was about two-thirds of the way through my current bag when I discovered a couple of lovely little worms floating in my tea! FYI, I usually start my morning off with a big cup of hot tea, sweetened with gojis. After seeing the additional protein in my tea I decided to check the remaining contents of the bag. I emptied it out onto a white paper towel and discovered a number of more white worms. The bag has been kept sealed and stored in a dry, cool area so I blame the product not how it was stored. I'm very disappointed and will not be purchasing any more products from this company.

review/summary: Another bag of molded Goji berries
review/text: I believe this is my first review. I am slightly addicted to Goji berries. I snack on them at work and re-hydrate them in tea before adding the mix to a tall bottle of ice and fresh lemon juice. I have a subscription to Navitas on Amazon. I got my first bag. I found the fruit very hard and dry but decent in size and still a great snack until I kept having to spit out mouthfuls due to the distinct nasty taste of mold. I thought I just got a bad bag but when my second order arrived.....same thing. You could see the black spots of mold on the berries. Most Goji's coming from China are dried til they are hard as pebbles b/c of the long month long journey (or more) to get here. They are still prone to pathogens and mold. I ordered Dragon Herbs Heaven Mountain Goji's and will follow up on how they are. Dragon herbs is a reputable company that has a process for dealing with the issues facing Goji's travel from China. If anyone knows a locally grown organic source of Goji's that is reasonably priced, please list it. Goji's grow easily in the US and it's obviously more sustainable. Regretfully, I am cancelling my Navitas subscription. Beware when purchasing. I read other reviews about mold and you can't return this item.

review/summary: Toxic goji
review/text: I find it interesting that folks who like the goji fruit and believe all the hype are so dismissive of the illnesses and reactions to it that a lot of folks have had. I thought they tasted fine, and didn't associate the waking up at 4am in the morning violently and painfully vomiting right away.  I liked the taste and was eating a few before bed each night as I read. It's possible that the berries themselves cause it, but far more probable that they are contaminated.  What I find interesting about the illness is that it wasn't immediate. I ate them for a lot of nights before waking up in agony and spending HOURS vomiting. I would surmise that those eating them after boiling/washing them are probably not having the same issues. The package said it was okay to eat as is, however. And the if you search goji online, there are A LOT of similar stories. I also thought it interesting that the "organic" might not actually be "organic" if they are supplied from China and thereabouts. There are NO organic farms out there. They still use DTT.

review/summary: They Taste Terrible And I've Had Way Better.
review/text: Navitas tasted pretty good the first time I had them, but after having premium berries from California Academy of Health, I can't even finish this bag.  In comparison, CAOH's have a fresh picked taste that is sweeter and softer. The difference is night and day.

review/text: I love Goji berries and often eat them after my weight work-outs. I also throw them in the following cereal (raw & vegan), they make a perfect harmony in this recipe as follows:<br /><br />Oatmeal Cereal Raw & Vegan - the Most Wholesome Cereal on Planet Earth: inspired to me by the Wonderful Magic Man, Peter Ragnar:<br /><br />1/4 to 1/2 cup whole Oat Groats these look like buff colored pieces of rice, you will need to sprout them in filtered water one to two nights beforehand. So they will be ready for you in the morning. I think two days of soaking is best.<br /><br />1/4 cup Goji Berries<br />3/4 cup blueberries<br />slices of banana and any other berry or fruit as you wish<br />1 cup refrigerated filtered water (trust me you want it cold..tastes good)<br />1/2 t vanilla extract<br />Himalayan Salt or Sea Salt<br />4 brazil nuts (soaking unnecessary because these don't have enzyme inhibitors)<br />2 T hemp seeds (Nutiva brand is good)<br />a bit of honey optional<br /><br />In good blender pour 1 cup water, salt to taste, vanilla extract, hemp, brazil buts and honey if you want it (I don't use it). Blend up really well until a smooth creamy milk forms - this is amazing milk folks!<br /><br />Now put all soaked oat groats, berries and whatnot in a cereal bowl. Pour over with the luscious milk you just made and eat slow, chew well because the stomach has no teeth :o) Add more a salt if needed. Don't forget to take your E 3 Live every morning - E 3 Live dot com.

review/text: Don't eat the berries before going to bed as they will keep you awake and give you energy. That's why we put it into our smoothie in the morning.

review/text: I put the Goji berries into my hot steel cut oat cereal to soften them a little bit. The knowledge of having something totally unprocessed makes it even more appealing. If you never had them, they taste like a combination of raisins and cranberries.

review/summary: Disappointed by the latest batches
review/text: I have been ordering these same Navitas Goji Berries for probably 4-5 years on Subscribe and Save, going through a pound every month or two.  I use Goji berries for cooking, snack and tea, and they are great for everything.  The quality and price from Navitas have been very good until the most recent shipment I got.  In the past, the berries are relatively dry but still a little chewy, which I really like.  The most recent batch (shipped to me in March 2012) seemed very damp, and the berries were stuck together in clumps.  When I made tea with it, some berries, which I usually chew and eat, had distinct moldy taste to them.  I examine the bag and found some berries with MOLD growing on them.<br /><br />Very disappointed to the recent QC on this item.  I will not order this item again.

review/summary: Affordible Way To Get This Superfood
review/text: Amazon has the best price I've seen on Goji Berries which can be up to $15 - $19 per pound. These puppies are a superfood and give you a ton of what your body needs. I eat them mixed in with Raw Coco Nibs (by the same company) for a great raw snack that keeps me going.

review/summary: Yummy and Nutritious!
review/text: As other reviewers have noted, the berries do seem to make one feel more energized (and for this reason I would not eat them late at night before going to sleep).  I have bought several brands of these berries and am pleased with the quality of this product (I also like the Navitas cacao powder).  I took off one star for the rating because I am not sure if these berries are any better (in terms of growing and harvesting methods used and nutritional value) than those I found in San Francisco's Chinatown for a quarter of the price of this product.  Overall, this is a high-quality product and I would recommend buying it from this site, especially if you do not live near a Chinatown.<br /><br />According to the product label, these berries are wild crafted and sun dried in Tibet and are packaged in a resealable plastic pouch in California.  They last for about one year at room temperature.
