review/summary: Good Coffee, But Not Great Coffee
review/text: I liked this coffee; it really has a good flavor. It's not the best possible coffee flavor, unless maybe you don't like a very intense, strong flavor. It's not as good as, say, Gevalia - if you like your coffee very flavorful. The proceeds do go to a good cause, though - helping children gain access to the positive influence of sports. If you happen to be a fan of this particular Ethiopian bean and you want to support the cause, then Marley Coffee is the coffee for you. Incidentally, the package design is gorgeous.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: My wife and I are coffee drinkers. We love the stuff. We're addicted. We've got just about every manner of coffee making device you can think of in our home, from French presses to cheap and expensive coffee making machines. And we have a one cup pod machine, sitting next to our Keruig machine.<br /><br />Why do we have all this coffee making paraphernalia? We're old, we've had more anniversaries, birthdays and Christmases than most and everybody we know, knows we love coffee.<br /><br />The above being said, how do I rate this coffee? And how does my wife rate this coffee? Four thumbs up, that's what we give it. Delicious. Just one word to describe it, that's all this coffee needs. Delicious. I'll say it again, Delicious.

review/summary: This makes a Fine cup of coffee
review/text: If there is a negative statement to be made it would be that this product makes only one cup at a time. I enjoy my coffee and found that this brand lives up to its description. Besides the flavor, this brand goes the proverbial extra mile in being earth friendly. The packet describes the treatment of the workers and plants as well as states that part of the proceeds go to an organization started by this brand --- Kicks For Causes-- which assists in the development of youth soccer programs. As stated on the package "the proper place for a child is on the playground, not in the workplace". A statement we as consumers need to be more mindful about!

review/summary: Decent flavor
review/text: The flavor of this coffee is average, in my opinion.  Tastes vary from person to person, and I am not partial to any one brand, I just didn't find this particular coffee to have any stand-out aspects.  It tasted fine, and I have no complaints.<br /><br />I will say, I did not find myself shaking from a caffeine let-down later after drinking it, so thankfully it's not as heavy on the caffeine as some coffees I've tried.<br /><br />I realize these pods are for a specific kind of machine, but I wanted to brew some coffee like tea with boiling water while on our camping trip.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any trouble with making a single serving mug - I simple pressed on the pod several times during brewing with the back of a spoon as it steeped in the mug with the water.  I had rich, dark coffee with very little fuss.

review/summary: Smells Great....
review/text: Love, love, love!  The smell of the coffee packs!  When I got this and opened it, honestly, the aroma was just so amazing, it is one of the best smelling coffees I have ever smelled!<br /><br />  If only that taste transferred over....  Unfortunately, when I actually made the coffee, it wasn't extremely flavorful, not was it as dark and rich as I would have hoped.  In fact, it taste a little more like nutty coffee flavored tea, which isn't bad, I love tea!  But if I was coffee, I usually want something that taste strong.  I have had plenty of non-expresso coffees that are rich and almost thick, but this is not one of them.<br /><br />  It is a good light coffee, I suppose if you don't want something too strong, maybe to have with some cookies or muffins at tea time (not a lot of Americans have tea time, but if you do...), it is a nice coffee for that, since it is not too overpowering, it works well in that way.<br /><br />  As long as, when you get this, you know its not a super rich, strong coffee, I think you will enjoy it, its just all about expectations.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/summary: Coffee for tea drinkers...
review/text: As a general rule I gravitate toward heavy bodied, dark coffees but rules are made to be broken. From time to time even I bring home a medium blend to break things up. I was quite excited to give Marley Coffee a try but found that a name can't make up for a yucky cup.<br /><br />As lovely as the idea behind this particular line of coffees is I found it lacked the body I look for in a cup of coffee. That said the taste was so pleasant and delicate I actually tossed a couple of the pods into my tea pot and used them like tea bags. The result was actually delicious but far more tea-like than I would pay for in a coffee pod.<br /><br />If you enjoy lighter roasts or prefer tea I would definitely recommend the One Love Organic Coffee pods. Otherwise I would suggest a pass.

review/summary: Rich, bold flavor....makes a lot of coffee!
review/text: Update: I have come to realize (from others) that this is meant to be used in one specific machine. Unfortunately, that was not apparent at the time of my selection, and I just thought they were tea bag type coffee-bags. I have also learned that my taste in coffee is WILDLY different than most others, or at least it would seem. I have since tried to brew it in my Keurig (anothers recommendation that I read on a message string) and found it came out pretty good still. I still give it 4 stars, and I still think it wasn't bad at all, in spite of using it the wrong ways. :-)<br /><br />This is so strong that I could almost make an entire pot of coffee with one bag. I love it. A little goes a long way for me. I also like the tea bag type of brewing. Keeps everything clean and good tasting. This is great for those lazy days when you just want to boil water and have a coffee. If you like your coffee really strong, put one in a mug and you will have one VERY strong cup of coffee. If not, make a small pot and you will also be very pleased. I really didn't know what to expect. I remember trying something similar a long time ago with an instant type of coffee and it was terrible. This is much better than I expected. I also think this offers a good value. Try it, you'll probably like it.

review/summary: Great fragrance, disappointing when brewed
review/text: I love the smell when I open one of these foil pouches - whatever one thinks of the coffee, they have packed a great smell in every bag.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I normally like dark roasts. I expected this to be a medium roast, good for variety, but it's really a very light roast. There are some nice berry notes in the bean, but the coffee flavor is just too weak.<br /><br />It also brews up too weak. I don't know if there is too little coffee in the bod, or if the pouch material isn't as effective as others - but something's not quite right here.<br /><br />So: 4 stars for fragrance and berry notes, 2 stars for the pouch material, 3 stars if you like mild roasts.

review/summary: I like it more and more
review/text: Coffee for me is a necesity now. Because of that, combining with availability at different moments, I have developed a broad palette.<br />I also pretend to be hip sometimes and opt for LOFT("local", "organic", "fair trade") and eclectic. So this one - organic artisan roasted Ethiopian yirgacheffe - seems to fit the profile quite nicely.<br />After figetting with the pod and the holder for quite a few minutes and finding that this pod is about twice the weight of Senseo pods, yet it would not fit snuggly into the double holder, I tentatively plugged it down with the single pod holder into the Senseo machine and made a 8oz cup.<br />The taste was bold but not bitter (maybe slightly bitter, but quite enjoyable). However the nose or the smell made me hesitate - it was too earthy, almost herbal medicine like.<br />I left the half drink cup there.<br />As I went about my day, I remembered one of the best cup of joe that I've ever had was boiled under open fire in a copper pot, not even a percolator, just a regular old copper pot, where you have to drain the dregs.<br />So I went back and heated up the now cold cup and drank it up. It was fine - I guess the nose was no longer strong.<br />So I decided to make a new cup and try again. The taste is still very good, and now I think I am getting used to the nose.<br />Now I have used up 9 pods and I am liking it more.

review/text: I don't have a Keurig coffeemaker which I think this product is made for.  However I was able to simply cut the bags open and put them in my normal coffeemaker filter and make coffee that way.  I found that this coffee tastes slightly bitter to me, and not as hearty as the Java Delight coffee I have been used to.  I can't speak for other coffee drinkers though - I am not an aficionado of coffee.  All I know is what I like and perhaps you may have a different opinion.  Give it a try.

All in all, it was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. From two to three stars based on the aromatherapy of the experience. Mild to non-existent aftertaste.<br /><br />That said, if you LIKE milder, blander coffees, this might fill the bill. I just expected a heartier coffee.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

There was nothing remarkable about the flavor, it really was quite boring, if one can call a coffee boring.  This coffee would do the job in the morning if I didn't have any better stuff to drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.  It's just not very flavorful.  If it tasted like it smelled it would have been so much better.

review/summary: A bit acidic, but great flavor!
review/text: This coffee is a great way to start your day! I read a few other reviews that said it was weak.  Perhaps some of that is machine? We use a Keurig and empty each packet into our re-usable filter.  My husband says it's about as strong as his other "medium/bold" roasts, but with a better flavor.  I would agree with that - the flavor is better than most coffees, and I can drink it with my regular 2 creams, which I can't do with "bold" coffees.  I only knocked off one star because of the price.  I can get 15 of these for ten bucks, or 50 of the Donut Shop Brand for thirty bucks.  If it were a little more comparable, I'd probably be willing to spend a little more for something both my husband and I really enjoy.  As it is, we will stick with a slightly more economical brand and this might be a "treat".  :-)

review/summary: You Can't Hammer with a Nail with a Screwdriver ...
review/text: ... well, actually you can but the results will be something less than stellar.  Well, imagine someone did that and then complained about the quality of the nails they received.  That is what is happening with some (but not all) of the bad reviews here.<br /><br />Coffee pods are made for coffee pod machines.  They are not made for use as "teabags with coffee" and they are not meant for Keuring machines.  If you put Keurig cup inside a regualar drip coffee maker, would you expect coffee to come out the other end?<br /><br />Now for those who have a Keurig machine and bought these, there is a solution.  If you have one of the cartridges that allow you to use loose coffee, for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>, then you can cut off one end of the pod and use the coffee.  This will give the product as intended.<br /><br />With that out of the way, let's turn to the product if you use it as intened or the "Keurig workaround" I illustrated above.<br /><br />Each pod comes individually foil wrapped for freshness.  When you open it, you are hit by the smell of strong coffee - perhaps even to the point of being pungent.  When brewed, however, it is strong but not overpowering and actually has a surprising sweetness to it one would not have expected from the aroma.  This is not a coffee that would appeal to those used to the mass produced variety or those who prefer a mild brew.  It is fairly strong and best savored rather than guzzled.  Overall, a solid coffee experience.

review/summary: Road Trip Companion
review/text: I like good coffee and when I find it I stick with it.  Nonetheless, when a chance comes along to try something different, I'm willing to give it a try.  When I got the samples from Marley Coffee, my first reaction was the socially responsible credos listed on the box.  Nothing wrong with that but if the coffee isn't good, the good deeds don't matter to me.  After tasting it, I found that the coffee IS good.  The blend I received was "Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe" and it is very enjoyable.  The coffee is packaged in individually sealed coffee in their own filter packets.  Having an ample supply at home of other good coffee (and after enjoying a weekend of Marley Coffee) I decided that this was the coffee to take on the road.  I have been using motel coffee makers for years with the ground coffee I took with my wife and I.  We even bring our own measuring spoons and filters.  Alas, the motel coffee-makers have shrunk in size and I can't make a good job of making my own coffee.  These packets are just the right size for those dinky coffee-makers so I'm taking Marley Coffee on the road.  In fact, I did just that last weekend.  I even threw an extra packet in my coat pocket.  Good thing too because I had put the other packets in a different bag which left me with the local mediocrity.  Why the long story?  Well, the quality of coffee was the difference of night and day and I made sure I now have ample packets in all my travel bags.  It's that good.

review/summary: GREAT coffee in a self-contain package
review/text: I love a good cup of coffee but hate to brew a pot or even brew one cup in a pot.  Marley Coffee gives me the option I have been looking for.  Coffee in a bag - you know, like a tea bag!  The coffee comes in a 15 single serve pods.<br /><br />While the box doesn't state that it is to be used in a one cup brewer or as a "tea bag", I tried it both ways.  It brews a great cup of coffee either way.  In fact, I brewed the bag in a one cup brewer first and then saved it for the next day.  I then tried it as a "tea bag" and even having been used previously, it brewed a great cup of coffee, dark and rich.<br /><br />I normally put milk/cream in my coffee but I found I liked it black.  WOW!  Even my picky husband liked the taste.<br /><br />I did note the box mentioned KICKS FOR CAUSE FOUNDATION.  It is nice to see a company care about our children.  They believe children should be able to be children so they started this soccer program.  Good for them.<br /><br />Good coffee and a children's program sponsor all in one product!  Go for it!

review/summary: I am picky about my coffee but this is good stuff
review/text: This was the first time that I had tried any Marley Coffee but I really like it. It is certainly a high quality coffee and has an excellent flavor. I am a little picky about my coffee and usually stick to Starbucks Sumatra or Caff&eacute; Verona because I enjoy bolder and more flavorful coffee. Marley Coffee One Love blend is every bit as good as my favorite coffee and I really enjoy it. There are 15 single serve pods in this package and each pod is packed with plenty of coffee so it makes a great tasting cup of coffee. The pods and individually wrapped in foil so they stay very fresh and it makes them easy to store and carry with you.<br /><br />These pods are for a pod brewer not to be mistaken for a Keurig, Tassimo, CBTL or any other type of single serve coffee maker. I have noticed that some people are saying that these pods make week coffee and that just shouldn't be the case at all. They might be using them incorrectly or in the wrong type of machine if that is the case. The pods also tell you which side is up so maybe if you brew it backwards then it might make a difference but I honestly haven't tried it that way.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I must have somehow "missed" that this was designed for a pod brewing system.  I thought that these were just individual brew bags.  I am not sure exactly what pod brewer these were designed for, but I was pretty sure that these were not going to work in my Keurig, so I decided to go ahead and try to use it as a brewing bag anyway.<br /><br />I filled a microwave safe cup with water, and put the packet in the water.  At this point it is important to note that there are no directions on either the box or each packet.  So, I was pretty much winging it.  I put the cup (with the coffee packet in it) in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I knew this would make it very hot, so that it could continue to steep/brew as it cooled down.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I took the packed and squeezed the excess water out.  The cup of coffee looked robust, with a dark brown color and a nice smooth scent.  This was my first experience with Yirgacheffe, and while it tasted good, I did not taste any of the berry or floral notes that the description mentions.<br /><br />So all in all, a decent cup of coffee, but there are much better brews out there.

The scent was fragrant and inviting but the taste fell flat. After drinking 3 cups I think it is a bit bitter and it has an aftertaste with no hint of the "floral notes and reveals hints of blueberry, cocoa and spice. This well-rounded coffee features a bright acidity. One Love tantalizes your palate, and leaves a profound cherry finish" as described by their enthusiastic marketing department.  Try Komodo Dragon by Starbucks instead. Bob Marley needs to stick with his day job.

The taste was bitter and a little acidic; even experimenting with different flavored creamers didn't completely mask it.  Which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.  It's not bad if you're into bitter coffees, but since it's billed as being made with "exotic floral and berry beans" I can't really recommend it too much.

review/text: I have a Gevalia pod coffee maker with 6, 8 and 12oz. cup choices. Most of the pods I try need two pods for any size larger than 6oz. This makes a robust but not better 12 oz cup. And to boot it's cheaper than the other pod coffee brands. The senseo pods  are useless if you want a man sized mug. At the price of most pod coffees {$12.99 to $19.99) using two pods per cup is not cost efficient. I only wish Marley Coffee had more blends to choose from.

review/summary: Good coffee in a conveniet package.
review/text: I prefer coffee that is a little bolder, but if you like smooth, mild coffee, this is a good choice.  The flavor is mild, but with some subtle accents.<br /><br />I tried making this coffee first in the type of single pod machine that it is designed for, but found it way too weak for my tastes.  Next I put several of the pouches (6) into a regular machine, with three cups were of water.  Even in like this it was too weak for my taste, but you can tell that it is good coffee.  It is smooth and delicious.<br /><br />The packaging is nice, but I found the little packs to be hard to open.  I couldn't get any of them open with my fingers, instead having to use scissors.

review/summary: Coffee  ***UPDATE*** added
review/text: I love coffee, and a particular fantasy of mine would be to go to all these exotic places, make friends with the natives, tour their coffee plantations, sample their wares, and pack my bags with a supply of their goods.  (Of course, I would pay them dearly for their goods and services.)<br /><br />Since I can't go to any of these places, I have to settle for imported coffee.  This box of coffee is "Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe", "ethically farmed-artisan roasted", and is also fair trade certified and USDA approved.<br /><br />This particular coffee that I am reviewing is "exotic floral and berry".  This particular box has 15 individual, individually-wrapped (that's the part I like!) servings.<br /><br />I made this coffee this morning, and I love it.  It isn't very strong, so it might not be for everyone.  (Sometimes coffee is just too strong.)  I plan on making more of this coffee later today.<br /><br />I currently don't have an Espresso machine in my kitchen, but I hope to one day have one.  Whenever that time comes, I look forward to the day that I can make cappuccinos and other exotic coffee drinks with all these exotic coffees.<br /><br />UDDATE Sunday, April 15, 2012:  I did make more coffee last night (the coffee was so good - who could resist?); however, that was a big mistake.  I did not go to bed until early this morning; consequently, I slept late, missed church, and the day was ruined.  (I will go to church tonight.)  The caffiene must have been strong.  From now on, I will only drink this coffee in the morning.  I sure wish I had of had this coffee back when I was in the Army and had to pull all-night duty.

review/summary: I Really Wanted to Like This
review/text: I am convinced that fair trade, organic food is best for us, the planet and our neighbors. So when I saw this option for coffee I was eager to give it a go as good organic coffee is rare. This is a good, but not great, option.<br /><br />I found that most of the time I would get either too weak or too strong coffee. If I went with one package it was too weak. Two packages was too much. I couldn't find the sweet spot. With the packets being pre-packaged you would think the amount would be just right.<br /><br />Incidentally, the packets are hard to open. I don't know if I got a pack of glitched packets but mine did not have notches in them. This didn't affect my score.<br /><br />Overall, if you can get the right mix it is still organic, free trade coffee and I'll take it any day over the stuff from the big manufacturers. But I was hoping for an easier just-strong-enough experience.

review/summary: smelled & tasted burnt
review/text: My husband has one of the Hamilton Beach One Cup Coffee makers that uses Senseo pods.  So when I saw this coffee came in pods, I decided to try it since I haven't found any other competitors for Senseo.  Unfortunately, this was just bad.  When I opened the pouch, it smelled bitter.  When he brewed a cup, it smelled and tasted burnt.  It wasn't weak, as some other reviewers have stated, but it tasted so bad he poured the rest of thecup down the drain.<br /><br />Obviously, any food item is a matter of individual taste.  However, this smelled bad to me (a non-coffee drinker who loves the smell of brewing coffee), and even flavored creamer couldn't make it palatable for my husband. The price is reasonable, but I just can't recommend it.

review/summary: Weak, tho tasty
review/text: I read some of the other reviews here and decided to try putting a pod in my espresso machine. Worked fine, except the coffee was not very dark. Then I took the pod and dropped it into the coffee to make it darker. Still weak. This is the same problem I have with all the pod/cup/premeasured coffees. While I do know people who drink coffee brewed like this, it's not strong enough for my taste, and I think most people's. The flavor is good, would be delicious if strong, so maybe next time I will use two pods. However, the price is kind of high if you have to use two pods per cup.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today, I tried using two pods and boiling them in a cup of water, thinking it might work for camping. Still weak. I think you'd need two pods and half a cup, 4oz or so. I noticed that the coffee does not taste full-bodied. It could be dried out from all the processing -- ground coffee should probably be stored in a packed brick, not individual, non-vacuum-packed packets. Oh well.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this but..
review/text: Given the name and the talent behind it, I was convinced this would be awesome. Even the description had me sold however it just didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />Since I didn't have a pod brewer, I originally tried brewing this coffee in a standard coffee maker which came out super weak even though I used 3 pods. Then I tried squeezing each of the pods into my coffee cup which made it a tad better but still weak. I drank this coffee black which I rarely do but any creamer would have just ruined it.<br /><br />I also tried brewing it like a tea which just didn't work at all. Eventually I found a pod machine and it was weak just using one pod. After using about 7 pods to try out this coffee and get a desired result, I just gave up. I couldn't get the desired quality and as for taste, it's equivalent to something you'll find in McDonalds. I didn't get a hint of anything else.

review/summary: Best organic single serve coffee.
review/text: We have tried a couple of single serve coffee varieties to offer guests and put out along with our single serve tea selections at parties and gatherings. Nearly all foods in our home is organic or better so I am only comparing this with other organic single serve varieties we have tried (and there aren't that many). This is by far the best one we have tried. Even our coffee-discerning Colombian friend really likes this coffee. It is a true medium roast, not too rich or bitter. Very smooth and not acidic. Good enough to have with cream alone. When this box is through, I will buy this one again!<br /><br />I hope this was helpful. Thanks for reading!

review/text: 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - means a very distinctive aroma and flavor that may not be familiar to many American consumers. This coffee brews up a nice medium roast with exotic floral and berry notes. The pods work well, as intended, and the company certainly tries to spread around the positivity. The individual foil packets keeps each pod fresh and ready to use. I have since tried several of their different coffees, and yet this remains my favorite!

review/text: This tastes like I remember coffee tasting and has a wonderful aroma.  It comes in a box of 25 single serve pods that you just drop in your cup (the pods are marked with "this side down") and add hot water.  Let it steep for a few minutes then remove the pod and enjoy.  One Love is smooth and mild with a nutty coffee flavor.  I keep a box of it at work since each pod is individually sealed in a foil pouch.  That way, when I just can't stand another cup of "work" coffee, I brew up a cup of One Love and become the envy of all my friends.

review/text: I am not sure if these are meant just to be used in those coffee makers that make one single cup at a time. I don't have one of those. But I still am enjoying this coffee. I heat water in a mug and then add one of these coffee pods and brew it like a tea bag. I also take a spoon and squeeze water through the pod while it brews in my cup to get a strong coffee out of it.<br /><br />Of all the different coffees I have had, like Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain, Folgers, and so forth, the coffee this most reminds me of is Starbucks. It is not exactly the same, but I would think someone who likes Starbucks roasts would probably enjoy this.<br /><br />I like the nice box and especially that each coffee pod is individually wrapped to keep them fresh.

review/text: I usually like to grind my own beans but tried this because I had it once before and because it's organic. I tried it a few months ago and only had one cup and was pretty sure I liked it and wanted to confirm.<br /><br />I got this to use in my Cuisinart that is made for keurig k cups - I cut open the pods and poured the coffee into my set reusable kcup. Because the coffee is ground so fine, it didn't work too well in the keuring but I expected that. I just brewed two small cups with the one kcup-ful and it worked fine. The coffee is rich and full bodied, not bitter and only mildly acidic. And, it tastes pretty fresh for preground coffee.<br /><br />I love a deep, bold coffee but don't like acidic or bitter flavor, and this was a pretty good cupful, and it's organic to boot. I find it a challenge to find a bold coffee that I like that isn't bitter/acidic, so was pleasantly surprised with this. I would probably buy again if I could use pods directly or if I could get whole beans.

review/summary: Dark and Rich and Very Good
review/text: I drink two cups of coffee each morning and I make them with a pod brewer. I used to drink more. I'd make a pot of coffee in the morning and drink it all day. Sometimes I'd do two pots. It seemed that just the thought of that coffee waiting for me was all it took to get me out into the kitchen and pour another cup. The pod brewer was the answer. Now I make a cup when I get up and have my second cup with breakfast.<br /><br />I do have several different kinds of coffee, but after having tried this, I've been mostly sticking with it, because it's dark and rich and very good with kind of an earth taste that I really like.<br /><br />In fact this coffee is so good that sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes, I'll take a third cup upstairs with me to my home office. If you haven't tried this, I think you should. I think you'll like it.

review/text: Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee makes a tasty cup of coffee.  However, I have to say that nowhere on the box, or the individual packets, are instructions for actually making the coffee.  Also it doesn't tell you what type of coffee maker to use or even how much water to use for each packet.  I use K-cups and my daughter uses T-cups.  I had to make this product in my old automatic drip coffee maker, and I had to guess on how much water to use.  Once I was able to make a cup, it was very good.

I haven't tried anything remotely like it; it is definitely addictive.

review/summary: Pricey, But Delicious
review/text: These are pods, designed to be used in a single-cup brewing system made for pods.  I don't have one of those expensive, pod-using, coffeemakers.  I do have a single mug coffeemaker, which I normally fill with water using the provided fourteen ounce mug.  For the purposes of this product, I tried just putting in a cup (8 oz) of water, and placing the pod in the basket.  This produced a weak, undrinkable liquid.  The second time, I filled the pot with 8 oz. again.  I cut open two of the pods and put the coffee in the usual No. 2 filter.  This produced a very strong, but very delicious cup of coffee.  I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.  Filling the one-cup coffeemaker with the usual full mug of water and the contents of two opened pods makes a slightly weaker but still very full-bodied, rich coffee.

I purchased mine from Tassimo Direct online. Gevalia, Starbucks, HAG,  and several other brands were my main brews. I love the convenience of the Tassimo system and easy cleanup. However, after drinking this Marley Coffee, I am now rethinking how I brew coffee. The Tassimo takes up a fair amount of counter space. You have to use the Tassimo disc coffee packs and they are limited in choices. I wish this Marley coffee came in Tassimo discs. I love it.<br /><br />I am now thinking that I will simplify my coffee station by getting rid of the Tassimo and using a french press or this Aerobie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a>. Not only can I get everything off the counter and store it in my cabinets, but I can also use any kind of coffee I want. I have an instant hot water unit that is supplied filtered water from a sediment and carbon block filter. I also already have a spinning blade coffee grinder. So I think I am going to purchase the Aerobie brewer and open up one of the Marley pods and give it a try.

review/summary: tasty coffee, with additional novelty value
review/text: These coffee pods are probably intended for use in one of the  single serve  coffee machines. There were no instructions anywhere, they do have "This side down" on the pod but there was nothing on the box, outer pouch  or in the product description that indicated that the pods were not  the (identically appearing) coffee pods that are directly immersed in water.<br /><br /> You cannot  use them successfully just by putting them in a drip filter and pouring water through because the water flows through too swiftly. I was able to get  very nice coffee with these pods  by putting them in the cup of hot water and bobbing the pod up and down to keep the water flowing through the pod and the natural oils from settling on the grounds. It did not take long to brew.<br /> The coffee made this way was good tasting, reasonably strong but not overwhelming and somewhat sweet. The coffee was  does not have much caffeine. This would not be  the cup to have when you really need a stiff jolt  to wake you up. This is definitely a coffee I could drink at night without having any problems getting to sleep.<br /><br />Marley One Love Coffee pods are elegantly packaged in cream colored mylar pouches with red green and gold accents. There are images of Bob Marley and the Ethiopian Lion on the package and pouches. These would almost be  worth it for the conversational value of the package alone. Everyone who came into the kitchen and saw the box was enthralled. Everyone who tried the coffee enjoyed it.<br />I do not have a single serve  coffee maker so I cannot tell you  how well the pods work in a coffee maker.<br /><br />.

review/summary: Not A Winner
review/text: A box of this coffee contains 15 packets. There are no preparation instructions so one would think that one packet means one cup. Since coffee makers consider a cup to be 6 ounces that was my starting point. One of the reviews mentioned that the coffee is weak so I doubled down on the amount. This meant two coffee packets in 6 ounces of water. While the coffee was brewing it emitted a very slight and barely detectable odor. When the brewing was finished it was time to drink coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the weakest coffee I have ever tasted. It would take all 15 packets to make  one 8 cup pot of weak coffee at a cost of over ten bucks. Not a good choice. There are far better coffees available at far more reasonable prices. They would be a much better choice than this Marley.

review/summary: Blech
review/text: This is probably good organic coffee in whole bean form.  It seems pretty fresh, even for ground coffee, and it's roasted the way I like it, which is medium-light.  The flavor (once you get some, more on that to follow) is mild.  It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br /><br />Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.  Two stars for the fair trade.  No stars for anything else.

review/text: To start with, I'll be upfront about a few things:<br /><br />A) I got this coffee free to try through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />B) I don't have a pod coffee maker, so I ripped open several bags and put the grounds in a normal filter, making a full 10 cup pot at a time.<br /><br />This said, I'm not in much of a position to assess the pod concept as I didn't use them this way.<br /><br />As far as the coffee itself.  Its fair, but not great.  Like other reviewers have mentioned its pretty weak stuff.  The taste kinda reminds me of a smoother McDonalds coffee.  Not bold by any means, but certainly drinkable if you're open to that kind of thing.<br /><br />I prefer a stronger flavor, so I won't be buying it again.

review/summary: Use a French press
review/text: I poured boiling water over the pod and worked it over really well with a spoon until the water was good and dark. This produced a good, full bodied coffee with a rich taste. For my next cup, I put the pod in a French press and let it set for a few minutes before pressing, and the flavor improved even more. If you don't have a single pod brewer, this is the way to brew an excellent, environmentally-friendly cup of coffee from the individual packets.

It wasn't too strong or too weak. The taste was just right. The taste was not in the least bitter and I did not have to add a sweetner or cream. It was als very easy to use, no measuring.

review/summary: A Mild Taste That Pleases
review/text: I normally enjoy my coffee with a little bit of a kick to it.  I'm a fan of strong coffee that slaps you around and wakes you up in the morning.  Marley's One Love Organic Coffee, though, was a nice change of pace for me.  It has a very mild flavor (I detected no bitterness myself) that may not have enough punch for some folks, but for an afternoon break it is perfect for me.<br /><br />I removed this coffee from the filter pods it comes in and filtered it myself in my own coffee drip pot.  I used two pods for sixteen ounces of coffee and it came out wonderful.  I actually enjoyed just sitting down on a lazy afternoon to watch the world fly by for a few minutes while drinking this coffee.  I know it sounds a bit strange, but the coffee actually relaxed and calmed me down.<br /><br />I recommend this coffee for folks who enjoy a quick break once in awhile.  If you're in no hurry, this is a great brew to spend a little time with.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/text: I am relatively new to the world of pod coffee, but bought a Bunn My Cafe that I am thrilled with because it brews at the right temperature, easily, and with no ecological waste.  One of the fun aspects of all this is trying out all sorts of coffee pods made by different companies.  Most of what I have tried so far are very good, so I have no complaints about any of them, but the Marley One Love coffee pod is perhaps my new favorite.  Wonderfully smooth coffee from Ethiopia, and from the moment you open the wrapper and smell the first whiff of heavenly coffee until you get to drink the freshly brewed cup you will not be disappointed.  This is going to become a regular order for me.  YUM!

review/text: I liked the smooth, rather mild flavor of this One Love, One Heart, 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe bean. My only complaint is the single packets with no instructions anywhere.  I assume the packets are for a single cup brewer.  I cut open the packets and used several in a multi cup brewer.  I wish there was a number to call.  Beautiful packaging and an excellent flavor.  Wonder if there's an instant version as well as packaging as beans and ground.  In my limited experience, I think Ethiopian coffee ranks among the very best of natural coffee flavors.  I bet even Bob Marley would like this along with his morning ganga.<br /><br />"...let's get together and feel all right"  Indeed.

review/summary: A Very Tasty Cup of Joe
review/text: My husband and I travel for several weeks a year in an RV, and always take "instant" and "single cup" brews along with us. I have taken both Maxwell House and Folgers "brew in the cup" coffee bags, and found them acceptable (in lieu of a fresh cup of coffee from an actual coffee pot), so my expectations were that this coffee would be similar in taste and quality. I was wrong. I thought this was an exceptionally tasty cup of coffee - on par with coffee that has been brewed in a coffee maker. It is smooth and flavorful, with a very fresh taste. I highly recommend it for those who want a good cup of coffee without committing to a whole pot - or to lugging a K-cup type brewer along to work or on the road.

review/summary: Smooth, slightly sweet flavor
review/text: When I ordered One Love for some reason I thought they were single serve packets that you just add hot water to but they are not. My fault for not reading thoroughly. Since I don't have a pod coffee brewer this review is based on using these pods with my Keurig and French Press.<br /><br />My Keurig model is the B60 Special Edition that I purchased attachments for which enable me to use pods: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WU8PW8">Perfect Pod Holster Use Any Pod in Your Keurig Coffee Maker - Over 10,000 Sold</a>.<br /><br />The description of this coffee is floral with berry notes. I really couldn't detect the berry in the coffee by smell but the floral was definitely there and both were present in taste with a slight chocolate taste. I think this coffee is very similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>, just not as bold in flavor and more of a medium flavored coffee. I really didn't like the bitter smell of the coffee.<br /><br />Results:<br />Keurig My K-Cup with brew size of 9.25oz: weak, light colored coffee with hardly any flavor.<br /><br />Perfect Pod Holster with brew size of 9.25oz: dark in color with a smooth, slightly sweet medium roast flavor.<br /><br />French Press: near same results as the Perfect Pod Holster except the coffee was darker and had more flavor since I could let the grounds steep in the hot water for a few minutes.<br /><br />The Perfect Pod Holster and French Press were enjoyable successes with these pods, I was able to drink it with 2 packets of Splenda and no cream. I brewed a second cup in the Keurig, adding a teaspoon of chocolate coffee creamer, which brought out the chocolate flavor that's traditionally found in Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee, along with the Splenda made the coffee was very enjoyable. I've been drinking it this way ever since.<br /><br />Since this coffee is very finely ground it leaves coffee sediment in the bottom of the cup.

review/text: This gourmet coffee has a delicious aroma, but a very mild taste. Which is good for drinking while  having breakfast, but not to drink alone or with milk, if one likes strong coffee.  The little pods are convenient for taking along while traveling. They work well on those small coffeemakers provided in hotels. One thing I didn't noticed the first time I had one, and which makes a different when brewing the coffee pods, it's that each one says, This Side Down, and of course, placing it in that position inside the pod brewer helps improve the result. The lack of bitterness is a definitely a plus.

review/summary: A mild smooth coffee
review/text: There are several things a coffee lover looks for in their brew.. the aroma, the color and the taste are what I look for. When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.  The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs.  This is a good deal.  The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment.

review/summary: Aromatic Little Pods
review/text: These single-serve pods are everything good; Eco-friendly, "Ethically Farmed * Artesian Rosted," organic, and when you're done, it's ready for the compost bin. Other than the "This Side Down" printed on each pod, there are no directions on the package, but they are intended for use in most home and office brewers....and I guess perfectly acceptable to use like a tea bag, which I tried and got a very tasty cup of coffee from it.<br /><br />The aroma when you break open the individually wrapped little pod package is tantalizing, and the flavor very robust. The box is full of references to the great Bob Marley, and the company is owned by his son. There are other icons on the box too, from the coffee producers, ITAL, who are "...committed to sourcing the finest quality 100% Arabica beans" and "Kicks for Cause" which sends a portion of the proceeds to charity.<br /><br />All in all, this "Exotic Floral and Berry" blend makes a very nice cup of coffee, and is extremely handy if you are busy, so get your One Love pod in a brewer or cup and enjoy! I'm factoring the convenience of the product into my rating. If this was loose coffee, it would get 4 stars.

review/summary: Capitalizing on the Marley Legend-Organic Fair Trade Coffee
review/text: The great late Reggae singer Bob Marley's son has founded marleycoffee.com. The coffee is Fair Trade Certified and quite good. I drink my coffee black without sugar and really am keen on trying different roasts, etc. My only problem with this coffee is that it come in pods. I do own a Keurig and figured that I could put a pod in the fill-it-yourself chamber and brew my coffee. Alas, this doesn't work. I finally brewed it by steeping it in boiling water in the microwave and I must say it was pretty decent. At this point, I am not about to buy a pod brewer (available from a variety of companies including Marley). I think the pods are definitely more environmentally friendly than the plastic k-cups, but I have been buying my own coffee, grinding my beans and using the filters that I bought for my Keurig machine. This is definitely a less costly way to use a single cup brewer.

review/text: The Good: The Marley Coffee One Love coffee pods are simple to use and even simpler to clean up.  Just remove the pod from the basket and throw away.  At $10 a box, the price per cup is not bad, either.<br /><br />The Bad:  The coffee is weak tasting.  I tried several pods with differing amounts of water and the coffee still tasted weak.  My pods were "Exotic Floral and Berry" flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.  I believe that Marley Coffee comes in an espresso flavor and that might be better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this coffee.

review/text: Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.  I find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it, the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak.  I have tried using these like actual teabags, which definitely makes a better cup of coffee, but requires a little more time and supervision than I want.  I presume that the right kind of machine, or the right style of coffeemaking, turns these packets into solid gold for ease of use; for me, though, not so much.  But yeah: seriously tasty coffee, once you get the right amount of coffee-ness in your hot water.

It comes in the sealed pods that are designed to drop right in the the brewer without and mess.  I had to open the pouch to brew it in the Mr. Coffee but still found it made a lot less mess just pouring it from an opening in the pouch.  The first time I just made one cup; the second time I brewed two cups using two pouches.<br /><br />I found the coffee quite good, especially the aroma.  (I really loved the aroma!)  It definitely has floral and berry notes that do not overwhelm the coffee flavor. I like that it is organic and Fair Trade Certified.  This product also claims that "We use beans only from coffee farms that adhere to strict sustainability ethics."  You really can't get a much purer source than this.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee gourmand so I shared this brew with a friend who is very particular about her coffee to see her reaction.  I will drink just about any coffee but she likes her coffee strong.  She found this coffee strong and thought that it came awfully close to the coffee she gets from that Seattle chain.  She found the floral and berry "aftertaste" pleasant and not bitter.  She said for her it's definitely 4-star. (Remember, this is a gal who knows her coffee.)

review/text: My husband is the main coffee drinker in our house and he's always searching for a good brew.  I accepted Marley's Coffee to review, mainly because I'd hoped he would find a good coffee that he liked.  I didn't notice they were pods.  Oops.  I'd literally just given away our Senseos because we can't get pods, only online and it's just too much to buy a case for just hubby to use.<br /><br />So, he had to improvise a little.  He tried boiling water and using it like a teabag.  That worked well.  He even ripped some open and used them in a regular coffeemaker with a filter - that worked well too.<br /><br />It had a good flavor and wasn't too acidic (I'd recently gotten him some Gevalia that he said was way too acidic for his taste, so this was a welcome change).  It wasn't too weak, nor too strong.  He compared it to Dunkin Donuts' coffee, saying it was just as good as Dunkin (and that was saying a lot for him).<br /><br />I'm hoping to find Marley's coffee in a regular grind now for him.  Overall, he liked the taste far better than many I've purchased for him.

Even brewing, the smell is a bit sharp, but that first cup is...<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />I was shocked drinking it, actually. The flavor was not too terribly robust, but not so weak as to be merely coffee-flavored water. Indeed, the flavor is one which is almost minty, but not overbearingly so. I love my dark, robust coffee (the dark the better) in the mornings when I would rather climb under the bed. This coffee, however, seems to be one that I can drink with just about anything thing, at any time.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I'm going to have other cup now.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fair trade, organic coffee that doesn't taste like it, but will add flavor to your morning without tons of sugar and non-dairy dairy creamer. This is a coffee I could drink without that stuff.<br /><br />Good stuff!

review/summary: Smooth - no bitterness
review/text: I made this in a regular coffee maker made for pods.<br />I thought it was find - it reminded me most of a breakfast blend.  It was very smooth with what seemed like a normal dose of caffeine.  It's not at all bitter - unfortunately, around here, we LIKE bitter in our beer and coffee, so I probably would not buy it again.  If, however, you like something like Maxwell House Breakfast Blend with a mild flavor, but a bit more caffeine, you'll probably really like it.<br />I love that it is fair trade.  I had to use scissors to open the packets.

review/summary: Bitter Brew, and that's good
review/text: Note: I snipped open the pod and tasted this coffee after preparing it properly, not in a pod.<br />"<br />This is the "organic medium ethiopia yirgacheffe" (really).<br /><br />I like a light roast; a fruity columbian.  It may be that I am reacting to the omnipresence of that bitter, over-roasted stuff Starbucks pours. Well, this Marley blend is bitter as well, but intrinsically so, with a tongue-slapping sting. I don't feel that it is a product of over-roasting, but rather, the nature of the bean. I like it. It makes me want to sip it while alternating chocolate mousse and cabernet. Seriously. Try that combination for dessert sometime. It is the great triumvirate.<br /><br /> I am particular about my coffee and yet compromise my taste by going the K-cup route. doing the 200 degree water drip through the unbleached paper with freshly ground beans thing is not for me on an very early weekday morning. I can barely put my pants on, let alone manipulate a container full of near-boiling water. That level of love is left for the weekend, when I have the time to take the time to linger lovingly over proper preparation as if it were the Tea Ceremony.<br /><br />That being said, there is no need to compound the sin of employing a pod or K-cup while using that stuff that sits on the grocer's shelf for months. Use good coffee. Marley's is packed in foil and tasted fairly fresh.

review/summary: A fragrant coffee free of bitterness and burned flavor
review/text: Marley One Love Organic Coffee comes in pods, though I was also able to use them in a refillable Keurig-style pod for a K-cup coffeemaker. I am definitely not fond of bitter coffee or of coffee that tastes burned, so this coffee was a delightful surprise. The aroma is quite pleasing, with notes that are almost fruity on top of the basic coffee scent, and the flavor works well on its own or sweetened and lightened to taste. I was raised on Community Coffee, and this is the first brew that might tempt me to switch.

review/text: Good coffee is in the palate of the coffee drinker. I think I have a good one. I love coffee. I drink it a lot, my friends say too much. But I can't help it, I'm gaga for coffee. I've reviewed a lot of coffee, said what I liked about it and now I get a chance to say what I like about this one.<br /><br />One, it's got an earthy taste that I just love and two, it's got almost a burnt aftertaste, almost like a whiff of the taste you might smell in the afternoon rain after the fields have been burned, getting ready for a new crop. I don't know if I'm saying that right, what I'm trying to describe is what I tasted on the air one time when I saw them burning fields in Malaysia.<br /><br />If you like good coffee, I think you'll like this one.

review/summary: Not a strong coffee, but does taste great!
review/text: Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count<br /><br />The Marley Coffee comes in single-serving pods, however I did not have a single-serving coffee maker to test these pods. Instead, I tore open the pods and used my Frieling Stainless Steel French press. I let it steep for about 30-40 minutes as I do my morning routine and let the water cool to a drinkable temperature.<br /><br />The coffee is best described as a medium roast. The taste is very mild and actually complements my breakfast very nicely. There is no bitter aftertaste, and it does not smell or taste burnt. I'm not a coffee drinking expert, but I can definitely tell you this coffee tastes great. I usually prefer my local Kona blend or Italian and French roasts for their stronger flavor, but the Marley Coffee is mild but tastes good. I wouldn't say it is coffee flavored water, but it isn't very strong.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, I'm not a fan of single-serve pods due to the higher cost. It is a mild tasting coffee, so those that prefer full bodied dark roasts won't like it.

review/summary: Nice Morning Cup
review/text: I found the Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee to be full bodied and rich. Pleas take the other reviews for what they are worth. Some of these people tried to steep these "pods" in hot water or use them in machines, and under circumstances, for which they were not intended.<br /><br />Pod brewers (like the Senseo, which I used)force hot water through the pod at pressure, similar to an espresso machine, just at much lower pressure. One pod is intended for a single 4-ounce cup of coffee. It takes two pods and a two-pod holder to make an 8-ounce cup.<br /><br />While taste is of course a very subjective thing, I found this brew to have a very rich and complex flavor. The pods worked perfectly in my pod brewer and made a very nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: One Love Better Than It Smells
review/text: One of the best things about a fine coffee is the aroma. It is part of the entire coffee drinking experience. It is the aroma that strikes you first with Marley Coffee - One Love. The coffee has a pungent, almost "muddy" odor. By "muddy," I mean it actually smells like mud. This was the hardest thing to get past when trying this coffee. Next up is its light color. It almost brews with the color of a strong tea rather than a coffee. I like my coffee dark, so this was yet another hurdle I had to get past. Once I got to the taste, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flavor was light, yet wonderfully smooth. There was not a lot of body to it, but it did taste great. This is a light roast at best. If that sounds like what you're looking for, go for it. I give it four stars on taste alone. A nice organic blend.

It tasted more like black tea than coffee.<br /><br />Immersion brew: Smooth, thick, strong, and huge buzz! (Pour 1 quart of hot water over 3 pods. Let it steep for 15 minutes. For more caffeine, leave the pods in the water for 5-12 hours.)<br /><br />=========================<br />BOTTOM LINE: The pods need to stay in the water longer than conventional methods, much the same way tea-bags need time to steep.

review/summary: Would be a nice gift
review/text: The packaging, the box as well as the individual pods, is attractive to the point where it would make a great gift for any coffee drinker and especially a coffee drinking Bob Marley fan.  I liked the coffee, it smelled and tasted very good and the individually sealed pods assure long term freshness.  The pods appear to be made of high quality unbleached paper and it is strong enough to not tear or break open when saturated with hot water.  I do not own a single serve drip coffee maker so my first try was to open four pods and pour the coffee into my four cup basket and filter.  This worked well.  Then I thought I'd try something different the next time and placed four pods into my coffee maker basket.  This resulted in an entirely too weak brew.  But my experiment led me to discover the best method for using the handy little pods when no one cup maker is available.  When I saw that I had a pot of hot weak coffee I took the pods out of the basket and dropped them into the hot coffee.  I let them sit and steep for a while then plucked each pod out, squeezed, and discarded.  Now I had a good brew, as good as my first.  From then on when I use these pods I place one pod with about 8 oz of distilled water in a ten ounce mug and heat it good and hot in the microwave.  Remove from microwave and cover to retain heat while it brews.  Then squeeze out and discard the pod (they are so easy to deal with compared to loose wet grounds) and you have yourself a great cup of coffee.  All said I am enjoying this coffee as something new to me but I still prefer mu old standby, 100% Colombian.

review/summary: Nice and strong - the way I like it.
review/text: I consider myself somewhat of a coffee expert.  I have tried all types and prices of coffee brewed in every type of container (from french presses to drip makers to keurig and pod devices to cappuccino machines).  Most coffee can be made successfully if it is allowed to steep the properly ground coffee beans for the right amount of time at the right temperature.  Assuming you have the temperature and time calibrated right the end product will show its true nature to you.  In the instance if Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, its true nature is quite good.  It has an earthy, exotic, African flavor that is bold and strong - just the way I like my coffee.  It makes for a perfect after dinner coffee - to be enjoyed with friends and good conversation.  I took off one star for the price, as I feel it is a bit overpriced as sold.  Otherwise enjoy this great coffee!

review/summary: 'One Love' Marley Coffee
review/text: I love the smooth flavor of these single serve pods, but also believe in their mantras of organic, 'fair trade' coffee. I'm much more likely to purchase organic coffee in the first place. Combine that factor with the high quality Arabica beans and the convenience of these pods and you have a spectacular product. Also, partial proceeds of the coffee sales go toward youth soccer programs in the 'Kicks for cause foundation' that helps keep children on the playground and not in sweatshops, etc. Although these pods are not quite right for my home coffee pot (we have too many individuals who need a cup of coffee in the morning), they are fantastic for our various trips. I use these pods in place of the hotel coffee pods they provide in the room (hotel coffee is often not very good where we usually stay). The Marley Coffee pods are often far more tear resistant than the cheap hotel coffee pods. I've also used some of the packets as a unique addition to birthday gifts for friends and family (what great stocking stuffers they'll make for my coffee drinking family members). I also love to grab a  Marley Coffee pod for just a single cup of coffee in the evening if I'm going to be up late at night writing (which happens often). Another strategic place for these pods are the hiking backpacks. My husband, Tony McVay, and I can easily throw these in a small boiling pan of water if we are camping on the Mountains to Sea Trail or the Appalachian Trail on the weekends. The grains stay in the pod and haven't broke open in the pot thus far. I can't wait to share a few packets with a 'thru-hiker' on the Appalachian Trail. Imagine a weary hiker's delight when they treat themselves to a great cup of organic coffee just before hitting another long day on the trail! On that note, they are in a water-proof, light weight packet that fits easily in a backpack, purse and my husband's tool box. If he has a cup and a microwave available it is possible to brew a cup of coffee, although they're not exactly like tea bags. I can't wait to visit Marleycoffee.com to see what other flavors they have to offer. I truly believe this company is well on their way to winning over hearts and 'flavor fanatics' among devout coffee lovers.<br />Chrissy K. McVay

review/summary: Tastes pretty good!
review/text: Before I go any further in this review, I have to admit that I initially didn't know that this came in pods when I requested it. For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.<br /><br />Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.<br /><br />I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a "pot" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.<br /><br />I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole "organic, fair trade" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself. (The whole organic, fair trade thing didn't really factor into my opinion, but I know that this is important to some consumers so I wanted to make sure to make a note of this since the product description for this didn't have any of this in it.)

review/text: I got this for my son-in-law and daughter who love in Washington State and drink a lot of coffee, usually strong coffee.  It was my mistake that I ordered the individually wrapped "pod" that is mean to be used with a specific type of coffee maker.  There were no directions on the box as to how to use them at all, they said.  They were able to adapt it by cutting open the package.  They said it has really good flavor and is in the middle of the intensity scale.  They thought the packaging was attractive, but not eco-friendly since they were individually wrapped.  That's why they are a 4 instead of 5 stars.

review/summary: Weak, uninspiring coffee is the result I got
review/text: The idea of these "coffee bags" is neat. Put the ground coffee into little tea bag like pouches in order to make it easy to brew a cup. However, there seems to be a reason almost nobody else does this: The resulting coffee is weak and lacking flavor. I then tried cutting open the little pouches and making my coffee the traditional way using a single serving cone filter. The result was, to my taste, much better.<br /><br />Neat idea, great brand name and probably terrific people behind this effort, but for me the result fell short. Granted, I like a really strong cup of coffee. Others may have a completely different response.

Once I put three pods into a 20oz coffee brewer and it was sort of like coffee-flavored water.  Then we tried using it like a tea-bag.  We've sort of given up.

We believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial".<br /><br />They also claim to treat their workers ethically and they know where their beans come from and how they are grown(?).  They are committed to "sourcing the finest  quality 100% Arabica beans".  Their "organic coffees are Fair Trade Certified and USDA approved".  The company started the "Kicks For Cause Foundation" of which partial proceeds form coffee sales go towards youth soccer programs.<br /><br />The Coffee:  I like good coffee.  This tastes like instant coffee.  The packets are nicely designed and the coffee is fresh, but the taste is  bland. Even with two packs per cup, the taste was very mild.  I also did not get much of a caffeine kick.  But what do you expect when the cost is about 'sixty-six cents' a packet?  You get what you pay for.

review/summary: Not ESE pods!
review/text: It is not obvious from the product description but these are NOT single serve ESE-type espresso pods.  They do not fit in our Krups espresso machine at all.

review/summary: Disappointing...
review/text: I wanted to like this, Im a fan of the whole natural Ital way of eating/living, but this drink sucks allot. I am NOT a huge coffee drinker nor am I particular about my coffee. Some discribe this as pretty mild with not much of a bitter after taste...to my family it is wartered down coffee flavored old boring plain tea. It is coffee flavored water! All of that said if you like SUPER mild coffee flavored water give it a try, but its a no go here.<br />bummer...

review/summary: Pretty good medium roast flavor.
review/text: This is a good companion to a french press device.  I didn't find it too strong, which means coffee enthusiasts that prefer their coffee too strong, might not like it, but hey, if you think its a good idea, why not use two bags instead of one?  Marley coffee also claims to be organic, so if you are into organic stuff, this could be worth your while.

review/summary: Smooth taste
review/text: Coffee has very smooth taste.  I had to do some research as to how to use the pods.  Best way I found to use pod was to cut open pod and place into coffee filter or just place unopened pod into coffee filter.  It worked quite well and the coffee was not weak, but had a strong smooth taste.

review/summary: Coffee that is exotic hits the mark!
review/text: We were surprised when the packages were for one cup portions.  We are not used to brewing coffee this way.  However, that aside, it is very easy to overcome the simple obstical and brew.  We put the packages (out of the freshness wrapper of course)in the basket where we normally put the grounds.<br /><br />We had to guess how many for a full pot, but we decided that one per cup would do the trick.  It did and we were very happy with the results. This is a full flavored coffee and since we do not add cream or sugar, got the full benefit.  This is a good product and if you have one of those single cup brewers, then this will be even better.<br /><br />The only downside is that if they had some good instructions on how to brew a single cup included they would most likely have higher sales. The roast is really full flavored and delicious.

review/text: At home we prefer to use our coffeemaker, which takes K-Cups, but when camping, these one cup coffee "bags" (like tea bags) are great.  Coffee is good, too.

review/summary: This is a coffee lovers coffee
review/text: When we got this coffee my wife promptly told me she would make if for us the following morning.  She did, and it was one of the best tasting cups of coffee I had ever tasted.  I'm not a coffee addict or a person who would be able to notice much of a difference between a good Starbucks coffee and a cup of Maxwell House, but I certainly noticed how wonderful this coffee was. Great aroma and a full, rich taste!!!  The following morning I was looking forward to another cup of this coffee..... the first thing I notcied was the aroma was different.  Then, as I tasted the coffee I immediately told my wife it didn't taste the same a the previous day.  It was then that she admitted to me that the Marley coffee was too good to waste on my unappreciative taste buds.  She was keeping it for herself.  This coffee is very good.  I'll be buying some more of this just for me and I obviously recommend it.

review/summary: Marley coffee
review/text: This has a very mild flavor to it and no bitter after taste. If you want it stronger you can just let the bag steep longer. I think the price reflects the fancy box and individual packages it comes in. If all you want is a milder tasting coffee with no bitterness there are plenty to choose from in your local grocer that will give you that with a lot less price.

review/summary: Marley Coffee Pods
review/text: I got this for my husband, and he drank a few of these pods, and has yet to use anymore. I think this coffee is too weak, so less water is recommended. Thanks for the free sample, it's fun trying new things. This isn't the best of coffee's yet it's worth a try. Update: I cut up five packets, and put it in a five cup filter, with full amount of water, and the coffee brewed perfectly and tasted really good. I tried this instead of using the one shot packets, and it worked for me.

review/summary: Awesome! Works for Percolators too!  Read How to use for PERCS!
review/text: Works not just with Pod Coffee Makers but Percolators too! This is so absolutely wonderful for those in gourmet coffee such as Starbucks�, Caribou�, to name a few. Marley Coffee has an excellent blend of excellent coffee beans with just a slight hint of floral (not very much) and with the Percolator, the pods fit perfectly in the old 1940s era Perc as I call my heirloom which has been handed me down which I prefer over my Mr. Coffee� and while my Pod Coffee maker broke a long time ago; I never was too happy with it because it is a single serving and I drink a 64 ounce coffee!<br /><br />:-D<br /><br />Yes, 100% Coffe-Holic here and I am not afraid to admit it.<br /><br />This is great for ANYTIME - morning, afternoon, or that after dinner - if you want something different for a change; I strongly would push you over the fence to this one.<br /><br />Having had coffee since the age of 3 years old from Cuban to the most exotic (expensive) - on the scale of 1 to 10; I give this one in this range of:<br /><br />Exotic - 7<br />Blending - 9<br />Fruity - 0<br />Floral - 4<br />Balanced - 10<br />Weakness - 0<br />Strong - 0<br />Evenness - 10<br />Taste - 10<br />Aftertaste - 0  (this is very good when there is a 0 which means there is no aftertaste)<br />Bitterness - 0<br />Sweetness - 3<br />Sourness - 0<br />Richness - 8<br />Boldness - 4<br />Lightness - 0<br />Darkness - 10<br />Deep Roast - 10<br />Medium Roast - 0<br />Light Roast - 0<br />Pre-Odor Smell - 2<br />Unsealed - 0  (meaning full container which like Maxwell House�, Folgers�, 8 O'Clock�, etc)<br />Fold'n'Seal - 0  (meaning you open and then seal, like Starbucks�, Caribou�, etc)<br />Individual Seal - 10 (meaning each is individually sealed; Marley Coffee�, Green Mountain�, etc)<br />Multi-purpose usage - 5 (can be used in Percolators and Pod Coffee Makers only; I have not attempted to break open pods to try in Coffee Maker yet)<br />Need Use for Salt - 0  (Some Coffees, a pinch of salt is needed to remove bitterness or sourness)<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE PLUS BONUS AND ADDITIONAL BONUS (no need for salt usage) = 9!<br /><br />Truly a gourmet coffee for that special occasion / guest(s) / event(s) - you can even purchase multiple packages or bulk orders for the large Percolator (those that serves from 30 to 50 people) and place pods in there and use gallon of spring or filtered water to fill the pot for Weddings to Gala events!<br /><br />What makes this so wonderful is you can easily dump them all into the trash; for Percolator(s) - you can disregard the "this side down" as Percolator(s) operate differently than Pod Maker Coffee.<br /><br />NOTE: Pod Coffee Makers - Please pay heed to instructions and abide accordingly for its effectiveness!<br /><br />See my photos for images for additional pictures for reviews of this ...

review/summary: Smooth
review/text: I am very impressed with this coffee.  The taste is smooth and mellow, but rich as well.  It's a medium roast.  I'm a coffee freak and have tried too many brands and varieties to count, but only a handful merit buying again.  This is definitely one I'll buy again and again.  I hope to find it in a regular drip-grind version so I can make it by the pot instead of just by the cup.
