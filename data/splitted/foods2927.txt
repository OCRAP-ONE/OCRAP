review/summary: heavy duty, attractive, kcup holder
review/text: Holds alot of kups.  Nice solid design.  Pretty nice looking.  Trays slide out easily, easy to fill and dispense.  The top of it is good for cups/sugar/whatever.  I put water bottles on mine, since that is what I had there before I got this holder.  I bought it for a party I had so I would have a good selection, but I will use it regularly because I like it, and the way it looks on my counter.

review/summary: JUST WHAT I NEED
review/text: I wanted a place to store my k-cups because the carosels didn't hold enough so I was constantly filling them.  This holds the equivalent of two carosels and takes up only a bit more room.  I ordered a second one to hold the teas and hot chocolates while the first hold the various flavored coffees we like. The Pod Drawer is sturdy and well made.

review/text: The Nifty 54 Coffee Pod Drawer is the perfect solution for me. It sets nicely beside my Keurig and holds 64 k-cups. The drawers slide easily and have a catch so they don't fall out when fully opened. The top is perfect for my sugar dispenser and extra mugs. It is well made and worth the money. The black mesh design fits any decor.

review/summary: Perfect under the Keurig Mini
review/text: For those of you who have limited counter space, this pod drawer is ideal.  It is made of metal, so you don't have to worry about sagging plastic causing drawers to bind. There is just enough room for a coffee cup to sit upright in front of the Mini, but not upside down. The Mini fits perfectly within the boundaries of the top shelf. And if you load the drawers using the up/down technique, you can fit 21 pods per drawer instead of 18.

review/summary: Coffee Pod Drawer
review/text: I was looking for something that would hold a lot of kpaks and not take up a lot of space.  This is it!  I really like this pod drawer.  The one thing that is sometimes frustrating is when you have to pull a drawer out to get to a kpak in the back if you don't have the paks in there just right it gets hung up.  But overall it works great and takes up little space!

review/summary: Beyond My Expectations
review/text: I read the review and I was hestitant as it was reported the drawer did not come out easy.  Well, it comes out easy.  I have room for plenty of choices in the drawer as my family likes hot chocolate and tea.  Personally I like coffee. The best thing is that it is a space saver.  I put the Kcup machine on it and I have plemnty of room for condiments.  With other storage syatems you place it next to the Kcup machine.  This takes a lot of spce.  Space is important in my cottage which is now my home.  I think this was a great buy for me.  It is funny how sometimes you buy something and it turns out to be a dud.  This is definitely worth the money.

review/summary: Store a bunch of K-Cups and get rid of the boxes!
review/text: These drawers look great in the office.  There is a little lip on the top of the drawer so they can stack or you can put more K-Cups.  Looks so much better than boxes!  Invert every other K-Cup and it will hold 63 K-Cups.  The drawers pull out smoothly & evenly (it might need a bit of wax after a while).  The drawers have a nice little stop to prevent the drawers from falling out accidentally (nice little plus that).  It is kind of long so it might not fit into some cabinets.  If you were wondering about this well, just get it.  We are thinking about getting another one.  Great product, accurate shipping, worth the money.  Thanks!

It's made of metal so it's durable, the drawers slide great even when full.  The top which is also made of metal is strong enough to sit containers of creamers, equal, etc. on it.  Bottom line is I love it!

review/text: I've been looking for a stand for quite awhile.  I almost bought the bamboo stand sold at BB&B but couldn't get past the $32 price.  I'm glad I chose this stand instead because of its large capacity.<br />My family has about 4-5 Kcups on a daily basis.  It's so nice to have them handy on our counter.  The stand is very sturdy and does not eat up to much counter space.  (my counter is on the larger side)<br />I highly recommend this product . It keeps our cups neat & organized!

review/summary: Perfect Solution
review/text: For those of us who place their full size Keurig coffeemaker on the counter under kitchen cabinets, this is the perfect solution for storing K-cups.  I started out with the single drawer, under-the-Keurig type of storage, but found that although it fit fine under the cabinet, I couldn't raise the front to remove and replace the K-cup, and adding water became tricky.  I found the 3 drawer side storage unit to be the perfect solution for this problem without having to move the Keurig to a counter space with no overhead cabinets.

And the price on Amazon is the same as in store at Bed Bath'N'Beyond.<br /><br />Worth the price if you like organization, and not a bunch of K-cup boxes piled in your cupboards.

review/text: The product arrived on time and was well packaged. It's a durable construction, there is enough space for the 54 cups it says it can hold and the product looks great next to my Keurig coffee maker.<br /><br />I ended up buying this design drawer as I think the carousels use up too much space for the number of pods they can hold, and after reading reviews for drawers to put underneath coffee makers I figured that with a drawer underneath my coffee maker there wouldn't be enough space left between the top of my coffee maker and the cupboard to be able to lift the top of the coffee maker open to put new cups in. If I would have had enough space, I would have probably bought the Nifty storage drawer to put underneath my coffee maker. Nevertheless I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Perfect K-cup organizer
review/text: Before I bought this Niffty organizer, I read all the reviews available on it and on the single drawer organizers. It took me quite awhile to decide which type I preferred for the space I wanted to put it in. I even did some measurements. LOL When I got it it fit perfectly where I wanted it to!!! I really love it and have filled it and nearly emptied it already. The drawers on mine work smoothly and the individual rows in the drawers seem uniformly sized. I hadn't really thought about alternating them top to bottom to get 7 in each row until I re-read some of the newer reviews.  63 is the maximum capacity which is great.<br /><br />This is the first review I have ever written for a product that I have bought thru Amazon or any other online "store".

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: Saw item on Amazon was looking for something not to big or too small for hubbys kurig coffee pods. This arrived in only a few days and fits perfectly on the counter with the coffee maker. It holds enough coffee to keep you in coffe for a couple weeks depending on your intake that is. It's made of metal and also has enough room on top for your two large size coffee cups. Would recomend this product to anyone looking for a place for your kurig pods. Neat and size is perfect for small areas.

review/text: I bought this item when it was out of stock.  It was only a few days before it was in stock again, and Amazon shipped it immediately.  When I received it, I noticed that it was pretty heavy duty and well constructed.  Comes straight out of the box with drawers ready to go.  A definite value for your money!  Fits great on the counter top with room for up to 5 regular mugs on top.

review/summary: Excellent holder - Very functional
review/text: I looked at a lot of different types of holders for Kcups then finally decided on this one.  I am not regretting that decision. It's great that it has three segrated drawers.  I use one for decaf, one for regular and one for teas and hot cocoas.  Everyone knows just where to find their favorite.  It is also of very sturdy construction -- heavy, not cheap.  Top acts as a little shelf for condiments too.  Very happy with this purchase!

review/summary: Great K-Cup Holder
review/text: This was a great addition to my kitchen, next to my Mr. Coffee/Keurig machine.  It doesn't take up much space and makes retrieving my k-cups so much easier than digging around in the boxes.  Each drawer holds 3 rows of 6 kcups, however, if you alternate each one (right side up, then upside down), you can get an extra kcup in each row. This is great if you organize your kcups like I do, with one type of coffee in each row. If you just toss them in there haphazardly, turning some upside down isn't the greatest idea.  Great product!

I looked at "other" drawers for more money, but this one had very good reviews. The convience, price and good looking product. I liked it so much, I purchased another one for a gift, and they love it too!...If you need extra space for your k-cups, you won't be dissapointed...also, I always check with Amazon before looking anywhere else.

review/text: I purchased this after I bought my Cuisinart Keurig Coffee Maker.  My coffee maker sits towards the font of my counter and the coffee keeper sits sideways behind the maker.  It fits perfectly and doesn't take up a lot of space.  I love the 3 different sliding drawers.  I use one for regular coffee, one for decaf coffee, and one for tea and cocoa.  I have no regrets in buying this.  It works beautifully in my kitchen.

review/summary: Great k cup storage.
review/text: I liked it so much I just ordered a second unit. We have the chrome carousel on the counter and use these in the pantry for extra storage. It would look good on the counter too. It is all metal, welded construction with a nice paint job. It also has good neutral colored rubber feet so it shouldn't leave marks on counters or shelves. One thing I didn't see mentioned is that the drawers will not come all the way out. Great because your k cups don't end up all over the place, not so great for cleaning. Still think its great, especially when you consider the price. Definitely would recommend.

BEWARE: the product pictured is NOT the product you will receive. The product the company sends is inferior and has none of the same features as the much nicer, higher quality Biscuit Buddy in the picture. I've now requested a complete REFUND from the company. Will purchace the Biscuit Buddy in the picture from a different website. Disappointed.

You WILL lose your Biscuit Buddy if you rely on it.<br />- Belt clip is riveted on, hard to replace with something stronger.<br />- Belt loop clip is flimsy plastic and way too small. It took a lot of effort to get it on my Levi's belt loop, and even more effort to get it off.<br />- Belt loop clip has to be destroyed to remove it for replacement with a bigger metal clip.<br /><br />For the above reasons, I would not buy this again if this one were stolen. But it's good enough for the reasons on top for me not to trash it...yet.

review/text: I have purchased this item twice, once for myself and once for a family member.  Both times I received the product exactly as described.  It has a belt clip, a keychain clip, an external zipper pocket, and a large treat pouch with a drawstring.  The keychain clip is a big tight and snapped after a few uses, but the belt clip is very sturdy and the whole item is remarkably chew-proof.  I have labradors who love nothing more than to gnaw on anything that smells like food!<br /><br />I have attached a "Bags on Board Bone Dispenser" and a clip to hold used poop bags.  Now when I walk my dogs, I only have to grab one thing as we leave the house.  I clip it to my waist band and it holds my keys, treats, poop bags, and a way to carry them and still hold two leashes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this item.

review/summary: My Favorite Powdered Milk
review/text: First, for all of you who have been looking for this product, Nestle's had a problem with their production.  It will not be available until they get their act together.<br /><br />Second, I have tried many instant, non-fat powdered milk brands and this is still my favorite.  I bought the Saco brand at Christmas, and while it was good, it is a bit different than the Carnation brand.<br /><br />Third, I don't think it's over-priced.  Dairy has risen and will continue to rise because they are using corn for fuel instead of feeding it to the cows.  I live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and I don't believe I have ever seen a box this big even offered in any of the stores I frequent.  This size combined with free shipping--I think it's a great bargain.<br /><br />If you keep it in your freezer and take it out as you need it, it will have a better flavor than leaving it on the shelf.  This goes for all powdered milks.  I even keep my homemade hot chocolate mix in the freezer for the same reason.<br /><br />I hope it becomes available soon!  Amazon, thanks for offering it for sale!

My wife uses it for cooking and baking. She adds it to the baby's food. She uses it as a creamer for coffee and tea. We take it along for camping and it provides milk without the need for a fridge. We rely on it when we inadvertently run out of milk and can't immediately get to the grocery store. The taste is excellent, especially if you are used to skim milk and drink it very cold. This is very useful stuff to have around.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: McCann's is the real McCoy!
review/text: This is the real thing, folks -- oatmeal as it should be. If you watch "Good Eats" on the Food Network, you've seen Alton Brown praise steel-cut oats and dis rolled oats (the "Quaker Oatmeal" stuff). I personally love rolled oats, but if you don't, don't let that stop you from buying the McCann's. The texture, the taste, the "oomph" are nothing like your ordinary breakfast oats. Where rolled Quaker oats are a bit slippery and thin, these steel-cut oats are much firmer with a lot more tooth and a much heartier, nuttier flavor.<br /><br />Be aware that you have to invest a little time to cook this cereal -- half an hour on the stovetop. Or try boiling the water the previous night, turning off the heat, and then putting the oats in to sit overnight. Then finish cooking them in the morning for 10 minutes or so. There are other shortcuts, too -- try a Google search. Whichever way you try, you may be spoiled for other hot cereals forever.

The next morning I cook the oatmeal for 10 minutes, I throw in the plumped raisins, an apple- sliced, cored and cut up, add cinnamon and some agave (natural sweetner) and the rest is history.<br /><br />We aren't hungry til lunch.

review/summary: Best oatmeal on the market.....
review/text: McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal has the best flavor & texture of any oatmeal available.  However, it takes a little experimenting with all the methods of cooking to find the cooking method that is right for your individual taste.  I invested in a small (6 cup) microwave rice cooker and use the following recipe:  Bring 1 cup of water to a rolling boil in an uncovered microwave rice cooker.  Stir in 1/4 cup oatmeal, cover and lock rice cooker lid and allow to sit overnight.  The next morning place rice cooker in microwave and cook for approximately 12 minutes at 40% power (Using reduced power keeps the rice cooker from overflowing).  Remove from microwave and let sit for 7-10 minutes.  Remove lid and add toppings of your choice (brown sugar, butter, milk, dried fruit, stir & enjoy. Makes 1 serving.

review/summary: Steel Cut is the most healthy form of oatmeal
review/text: I really prefer McCann's steel cut oats to any rolled oats I've ever had, especially the "al dente" texture, slightly nutty flavor.<br /><br />I often have difficulty finding McCann's at my local grocer, and really appreciate the ease of ordering it from Amazon. With Prime, the shipping is free and the shelf life of this product is well over a year.<br /><br />Steel cut oats have nearly twice the fiber of rolled oats and seem to stick with me a bit longer. Since it does take 30 minutes to cook this up, I make a batch of 8 cups every other week or so, and store it in 1 cup Ziploc or Gladware containers. Under cook the oats about 5 minutes, then in the morning you just pop the container (without the lid!) in the microwave for 2-3 minutes on 50% power. You have a fast and very nutritious breakfast.<br /><br />To vary things a bit, I mix in chopped pecans and maple syrup, or chopped dried fruit (apricots, blueberries, cherries, peaches whatever you have on hand) and honey, or just brown sugar. I always have about 1 Tsp of SmartBalance in with it also. My cardiologist is pleased that I eat oatmeal 3-5 times a week, as is my heart!

review/summary: Great tasting oatmeal
review/text: I'll admit, until recently I didn't even understand what "Irish oatmeal" was. In case you don't either, here's a quick explanation. Most oatmeal we see is rolled oats, meaning the miller gets the oats moist and then runs them through heavy metal rollers to flatten them. To make Irish oatmeal, the miller simply cuts each oat into about three pieces. So, the shape and texture of the two kinds of oatmeal are completely different.<br /><br />Let me also admit that McCann's is the only brand of Irish oatmeal that I've tried. Therefore, I'm really comparing it to the many kinds of rolled oats that I've had, rather than other brands of steel-cut oats.<br /><br />That said, this is the best-tasting oatmeal I've had. It has a much more interesting texture than rolled oats, and a richer, nuttier taste than even the best rolled oats (like Silver Palate). Whereas I find that other oatmeals need butter, sugar, etc. to be palatable, I enjoy McCann's with just a few spices (such as cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg or mace) and some chopped nuts. As a result, it winds up being healthier for me just because I'm not adding so much fat and sugar.<br /><br />So, why only 4 stars? I've found the occasional oat husk in my oatmeal. Husks are unpleasant to eat, and stick in my teeth. It doesn't happen in every bowl, but I still wish they could thresh just a little more thoroughly.

review/text: This is my favorite oatmeal.  It has great flavor and texture. I cook up a batch while we sit down for dinner and then keep it in the fridge for weekday breakfasts.  It heats up nicely when a little water is added before microwaving it.  I like to eat it with a little brown sugar, pecans, toasted wheat germ and a splash of cream.  YUM!  NOTE: when cooking it ahead of time, I have found it helpful to use an extra cup of water (5 c water to 1 c oats) so it does not get so thick and rubbery in the fridge.

review/text: This is the best oatmeal I've ever had.  It's the real deal.  The best method of cooking it is to boil water the night before and put the oatmeal in the hot water overnight.

review/summary: Now THIS is oatmeal!
review/text: After reading all the reviews, and with a young toddler at home, I had to try this to see if it is indeed better - as it seems healthier.<br /><br />Well, it is great, and soaking it really cuts down on prep time.  The fiber is definitely apparent, as we found an obvious difference for our son the first couple of times we gave it too him (sorry to be graphic).<br /><br />We're not over-the-top in terms of eating only local, only whole foods, etc - but that is our magical (unattainable) ideal - so, we will continue to look for products like this, that are high quality, and good, real food (although in a box).<br /><br />Great Amazon price - great tasting - many steps above the boxed envelopes and cans of quaker we've come to accept as oatmeal.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: A couple years ago, I tried to eat oatmeal regularly and bought a box of instant oatmeal. I stopped eating oatmeal as soon as I finished all of the packets in the box. I just did not like it.<br /><br />Last month, Consumer Reports rated Quaker Steel Cut Oats the top choice, so I began contemplating trying those (for whatever reason, they did not rate McCann's Steel Cut Oats). When I saw these on sale, I decided to try them, fearing that six 16-ounce boxes is a lot if I do not like them, but I am glad that I did. McCann's Steel Cut oatmeal is very tasty and I like the texture a lot. You cannot even compare this to instant oatmeal.<br /><br />I cooked mine in the programmable coffee maker. Before going to bed I put 1/2 cup of oats and a pinch of salt in the carafe, added water per cooking instructions on the box to the coffee maker's reservoir, and set the timer to start brewing the next day 30 minutes before I usually have breakfast. It all worked perfectly. I just scooped it out of the carafe into a bowl, added some blueberry preserves, and had a great breakfast.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product.

review/text: Regular rolled oatmeal is just downright boring compared to these steel cut oats.  These have a great texture and much better flavor than rolled oats.  It's become a bit of a tradition for Saturday breakfast to have these oats really done up right with a recipe from America's Test Kitchen that I found on the Valley Fig Grower's website "Perfect Oatmeal with Honey Fig Topping with Vanilla and Cinnamon."  These oats really don't need much help to be a filling, fueling, delicious breakfast, but that recipe just sends them way over the top.  I haven't tried any other brands of steel cut oats, and to be honest, I haven't seen any other brands in our local stores.

We recently discovered McCann's and it has become our regular breakfast. The prices at Amazon are great, the delivery prompt and the product is wonderful. Add brown sugar, a little butter and cinnamon to the oatmeal after it's in the bowl and white raisins to the oatmeal while it cooks. Fabulous!

review/summary: Can fix quickly & so worth trying
review/text: I really don't care for the regular oatmeal.  It's too easy to cook too long and gets too mushy.  Sorta just grows in my mouth when I try to eat it.  These steel cut oats, taste sooo much better.  I don't follow the directions for cooking.  It's just me and I'm not going to go through that much trouble.  I just measure out about 6-8 teaspoonfuls, put in small pot and add enough water to cover the oats well.  I bring it to a boil, cover, remove from heat and let sit for about 3-5 minutes.  They are chewy and not mushy.  I enjoy them with sliced banana, apples & cinnamon (sliced apple, sprinkled with cinnamon & microwaved ~ 1 1/2 minutes), or a little agave, and maybe some milk (I use soy milk, due to milk allergy).  They are also good & add a nice texture when used in baking cookies, bread, brownies, etc.

review/text: This superb oatmeal has a marvelous nutlike flavor and texture all of its own.  I am an oatmeal lover and eat it every season of  the year.  The McCann standard Steel Cut product is my only choice, and well worth the extra cost.  Its only drawback may be cooking time, if you prepare it with conventional pot on the stove techniques.  According to package instructions, you must boil it until it thickens, then simmer for 30 minutes.  Most of this can be avoided if you have a pressure cooker, which it use.  Cooking time with such a device is only 7-minutes.  I combine 3-1/2 cups of water with 1-cup of oats.  This makes 4 large servings, which I refrigerate and savor for several days.  Bon appetit.

The other thing to consider is that despite all the popularity of steel cut oats the rolled oats offer virtually the same nutritional value showing some difference in glycemic index.

We've not tried the overnight method of preparation.  I bought a non-stick saucepan with a lid and cook it at low heat for about 40 minutes; with the non-stick finish, it only requires stirring once or twice in that time. My husband and I have been eating it for breakfast 4-6 days a week for almost a year now.
