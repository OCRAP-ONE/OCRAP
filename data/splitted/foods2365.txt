review/summary: Excellent but very sweet
review/text: This is far above the grocery story cocoa-in-a-pack stuff. Probably the best domestic American chocolate, although you can probably do better with some European imports. But it is very sweet. I regularly cut it with a high-grade Dutch-style pure cocoa, about half-and-half. And it is still plenty sweet to my taste. It is best made by being whisked into a cup of milk heated to almost boiling in a microwave.<br /><br />P.S. for a superior alternative, see my review of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042RBHDG">STARBUCKS HOT COCOA TIN WARM, RICH, CHOCOLATY - NET WT 2.5 lb (1.13 Kg)</a>, here: [...]

review/summary: Smooth chocolate flavor!
review/text: This Ghiradelli Chocolate - Premium Hot Cocoa double chocolate mix is a good substitute for the packets we have all become accustomed to using.  This mix is made with real chocolate and is added to hot milk for an almost instant, smooth and satisfying beverage.  I like this hot cocoa mix so much - I'm ordering more!

review/summary: Great though children may find it offputting
review/text: Just received the cocoa and tried it out with my two children. My older child liked it (after I "spiked" the drink with lots of whipped cream to sweeten it) but my younger child would not have anything to do with it. I could definitely taste the premium chocolate in it and that's exactly the point. I personally much prefer it to the overtly-sweetened Swiss Miss variety, the same way I prefer chocolate that tastes like real cocoa and never touch Hershey's unless desperate...  A great bargain now.

I make it with 2% milk but only use half the amount of cocoa mix suggested on the label and still taste plenty chocolate. A tablespoon in coffee makes a nice treat on a cold afternoon. Enjoy!

review/summary: Good quality, tasty cocoa
review/text: A solid, tasty, rich cocoa, nothing like the instant packets that shall not be named.  Yes, you have to use milk -- save the hot water for the watery, sugary packets.  I would consider this halfway between drinking chocolate (i.e. the kind you have to drink out of tiny espresso cups because it's SO rich, since it's basically melted chocolate + whole milk) and the instant packet stuff, though more leaning towards the quality of drinking chocolate.  I like to microwave milk in a big pyrex mixing/measuring cup, dump in spoonfuls of the mix, then use an immersion blender to make it nice and frothy.  It's much faster than stirring with a spoon to dissolve the mix, and easier than using the stovetop method.  Just make sure you use a large enough mixing container so when you start up the immersion blender, hot chocolate doesn't splatter everywhere!

review/text: I am very impressed with this hot cocoa for two reasons.  It has a delicious dark rich chocolate flavor and it's made from simple, natural ingredients.  There aren't any corn syrup solids or vegetable oils in this product, unlike most hot cocoa mixes sold in stores.  I love it!  I usually add less mix than the directions call for, though, or the taste is too sweet for my family's liking.

review/text: This is my favorite cocoa mix. I often have it when I'm craving a chocolate bar because as long as you use skim or low-fat milk, it has far less saturated fat. I also love the Hazelnut variety, but this one's more flexible -- you can add a couple of drops of vanilla extract, almond extract, orange extract, you name it, to create different-tasting drinks. For a special occasion, top with whipped cream and shaved chocolate, and/or add a shot of your favorite liqueur. YUM!

review/summary: Rich, delicious hot cocoa, mixed with milk
review/text: I love chocolate and need to drink more milk for my bones, being 53 years old and having some bone loss already.  So I was looking for a satisfying chocolate to mix with milk.  Love the Godiva hot chocolate, but that was expensive, and Ghirardelli's is a great alternative.<br /><br />The Hazelnut is terrific as well, but I am not fond of the mocha flavored Ghirardelli's.  My favorite is definitely the Double Chocolate. Both the Hazelnut and Double Chocolate are very satisfying and the sugar content is low enough that I don't crave more.<br /><br />The price I see here is expensive.  If you have a World Market near you, buy it there.  It's under $6.00, more like $5.50, and no expensive shipping.

review/summary: A Great Hot Chocolate
review/text: If one likes hot chocolate, this is the very best on the market, in my opinion. One can even use this with boiling water (which I do) if one wnats to cut down on dairy products. And it is absolutely very good with boiling water. It takes a couple of minutes to cool down from the hot water, but it has the hearty chocolate taste that one gets with dark chocolate, and it doesn't have any of the high fat (butter fat) & high calorie ingredients you get in a dark chocolate bar. I now have Ghiradelli, Double Chocolate, in place of a dark chocolate candy bar and have reduced both calories and fat (cocoa butter). I love this hot chocolate I make with boiling water. As it is difficult to get in supermarkets, I have ordered Ghiradelli from Amazon.com and they always have some on stock. -----  Douglas Glazier.

review/summary: No fillers, Lots of Taste
review/text: I was searching for a hot cocoa mix without high fructose corn syrup and other fillers. Of the several options available at my grocery store this was the only one without a bunch of "junk" in it. I was hesitant at the price, but decided to try it. Oh, what I have been missing out on! Absolutely divine! You don't need to use as much powder as suggested by the package. For best results in stirring the powder in, heat the milk up until is hot (not just "warm"). Sometimes I will add the chocolate in, mix slightly, heat the mixture up to hot, and then finish mixing.<br /><br />The stuff in packets has always been a poor substitue for the "real thing" my mom used to make using cocoa powder, sugar, vanilla, etc. They are thin, watery, and not very chocolatey. To say nothing of the fillers added in. It's a little sad to see so many reviewers actually say they prefer that. More Ghirardelli mix for me I guess! :)

review/text: This is the best hot chocolate mix that I have tried. The suggested recipe is very strong. The instructions on the can say to mix 4 tablespoons of cocoa with 1 cup of milk. I prefer it at half strength (1 cup hot milk + 2 tablespoons of cocoa mix). That gives me a rich chocolate flavor without being to sweet. The can also lasts twice as long with fewer calories per serving.<br /><br />And for those of you who don't always have whole milk in the house, this hot chocolate tastes just fine if you make it with powdered milk instead. Just put the powdered milk and cocoa mix in your mug, add hot water, and stir.

The typical packets flavor is overwhelmed with a non-dairy (palm oil) milk flavor, very little chocolate impact, and sweet blandness.<br /><br />This Ghirardelli mix is basically good quality cocoa and sugar, so the real milk you add tastes right, and compliments, not overwhelms the other flavors.  This mix is also very good when added to warmed cream or 1/2-n-1/2, and the rest of the cup filled with your favorite coffee.  Only "con", might be it does seem very sweet, but adding a little cocoa to "cut it", might help if you find it too sweet.  Overall very happy with the flavor and quality, and will continue to order this little bit of luxury.

review/text: We bought this 4 pack set last year and gave them as gifts--everyone loved them and at that time I had not seen this in stores, so the price seemed OK for a stocking stuffer or inexpensive gift.  It is unusual and nice to give as a hostess gift with a candle or mug or two.  I read the reviews and thought it would be excellent and it is--our kids drank it Christmas morning and RAVED about it.  Two thumbs up from our house!

review/summary: Very good hot chocolate, but not coca
review/text: This is a very good hot chocolate but it does not have the Dutch processed Coca flavor you could expect.  Taste is nice and rich chocolate and if you must you can always add some coca powder.  Heating milk is a problem for me  compared to hot water (I have a Vesuvius on  my sink) so I mix it with powdered milk.  If you use 1 part of powered goats milk to 3 parts cows milk it gives a nice creamy flavor.  I slightly prefer Ghirardelli Unsweetened Ground Chocolate as I can add my own sweetener, but that is very difficult to find.<br /><br />BTW if you are at an altitude 10,000' and above open with caution.  I am still finding occasional powder from  opening a can too quickly.<br /><br />Accidentally found that if you let it evaporate it forms a thin leather that you an peel and goes great with raspberries or strawberries.<br /><br />Its interesting but unfortunate that 2 of the reviewers seem to not be able to mix chocolate or follow instructions.<br /><br />When you mix a powered chocolate you either need to make a paste with a small amount of cool liquid or use some kind of mixing appliance like a frother, hand mixer (if you are making a large batch) or one of the in the glass mixer gadgets.  The reason for buying bulk powder is so you mix it to taste apparently that escaped several reviewers.

review/summary: NEEDS MILK! Actually too rich.
review/text: I loved the rave reviews and I wanted to try something other than my Costco-sized Swiss Miss...so got this. My first surprise was that you need to mix it with milk! Yes, I should have realized that from the small canister (no powdered milk in the mix so it's smaller!)...but I've never bought anything other than the big canisters or the individual pouches, so I didn't even THINK that this would require milk. So that first mug (made with water) got dumped out. But, since we have a toddler in the house we always have milk, so it wasn't that big of a deal once I knew.<br /><br />So, I tried it and...I have to give it a big MEH. Yes, it's chocolaty--but almost too much so. It's so rich it tastes THICK, if you know what I mean. And even though the powder fully mixes, I still want to say it tasted gritty or powdery or something. It was strange. And the recommended 4 TBS of mix seemed like A LOT for 8oz, so I tried less and that didn't work, either.<br /><br />So for the price and expectation, I was disappointed. I think this might be more of a "special treat" type hot cocoa, rather than an everyday hot cocoa. I'll be going back to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JJRS6K">Swiss Miss Milk Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix 56 Oz Value Cannister</a>.

My personal favorite is Caribou's Obsidian blend, however.<br /><br />Note: If you're going to buy it, for Heaven's sake, just get it directly from Caribou. This price of $19.99 for 12 ounces is ridiculous! Caribou sells it online and in their stores for $10.99/lb. They often have free shipping sales, too. And on Mondays at their stores, you can get a pound of it for only $8.99. Don't get ripped off!

That said, we now order our coffee from Caribou through their website; we get two pounds shipped every month and we get to try a variety of roasts. I love that Caribou doesn't have that "burned" taste that Starbucks has (although I'm a 'bucks drinker) and is really smooth. We've tried Ethiopian, Caribou Blend, and Sumatra so far and they're all great. Can't recommend the 'Bou enough!

review/text: Caribou is the best commercial coffee on the market.  If you don't live in Portland, Oregon, which has it's own home-grown coffee genius (that IS NOT Starbucks), and you are a huge coffee snob, like me, then you have to try this coffee blend because it's really AWESOME to taste.  I also make this coffee for the "in laws" and they, regular Folgers drinkers, LOVE IT! Caribou is a chain, that chain is owned by the United Arab Emirates bank.  Despite not being a local business, not being a US owned company, and not allowing for franchising anymore, this commercial coffee supplier is FANTASTIC.  If you have a chance to visit a store, do it.  The sustainable coffee options are endless and the company does a great job with fair trade.

review/summary: One of my two favorite blends!
review/text: I am very picky with coffee. I really dislike the super strong blends that leave a nasty aftertaste, are bitter, and require lots of cream to stomach. According to a recent Starbucks survey 40% of Americans actually don't like the super strong bold type coffee - well count me as part of that 40%. I like a mild to medium blend with a nice flavor without any bitterness.<br /><br />I've tried MANY of the mild or medium roast blends. Until I found Caribou Coffee I thought there was nothing out there for me - and I did all sorts of things just to have a cup of joe to enjoy (mixing hot water in, adding flavored creamers, and so on). I alternate this coffee with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O62ASS">Caribou Coffee Daybreak Morning Blend Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>. Both are outstanding. I've bought bag after bag of this and it's always the same great coffee. Not the cheapest coffee - but for me absolutely worth the price. No need for any flavored creamers - this one has fantastic flavor on its own!

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: Lets face it - if you love Maxwell House, you just plain love Maxwell House.  Yes it's milder than many coffees out there --- that is it's forte!  This product is so convenient.  And what I like best about it is, I carry it when traveling (I may wake up earlier than the people I am staying with) and I can make myself a single cup of coffee.  Some of my family makes coffee way too strong --- with these bags, I can make mine just the way I love it.  And I use them at work, too.  I just plain love this product!!!  PLEASE Maxwell House --- keep making it!!!

review/summary: Easy quick coffee
review/text: I buy this primarily for my husband, who is more of a coffee-drinker than I am. It is very much better better than Folger's. Safeway has its own version, but this is way better than either. Wish it were easier to find in stores. More often than not, I want tea, so this is a good solution/alternative for us. Great to take along when traveling, too.

review/summary: Weak coffee
review/text: These are very convenient and portable, each bag is individually sealed and the flavor is certainly better than instant coffee, however... A single cup (and I mean normal size coffee cup) made with one bag is simply too weak, it's like drinking brownish water. That said, if you still find the cost of using 2 bags per cup to be acceptable then this is certainly a convenient way to have a quick cup of coffee on the go without mucking about with nasty instant coffee powders.

review/summary: Decent, not great
review/text: Convenient and better tasting than typical instant coffee but if you like a medium to strong cup, you will probably be disappointed. Using less water obviously helps a bit. If you plan on having more than one cup, it might be worth your time to brew a small pot, even if some ends up going down the drain.<br />I found the Folgers brand to be marginally better in terms of taste but still weaker than I normally would prefer.<br />Given the convenience factor however, I will likely buy this or the Folgers' product again.

review/summary: Only Coffee That I Can Drink
review/text: Let me explain first why I only drink Maxwell House Coffee singles. For years I drank perked coffee without a problem. I don't know weather it is my age now or not, but about 10 years ago I stopped being able to drink regular coffee. No matter the brand, I would get very sick and shaky if I drank 2 cups of perked coffee. I hated that because I love coffee but I was not too wild about drinking instant coffee--just was not the same. Then one day while visiting my sister in-law she handed me a coffee single to try. I was amazed that I could drink several of these coffee single and did not get sick or shaky at all. And the flavor was so much better than instant. So for years I drank nothing else. Little by little our local grocery stores stopped carrying it until I was forced to drive 60 miles to another town to get it. Naturally I would almost clean off the shelves when I found it so I would not have to drive back that 60 miles so frequently. Then those grocery stores in that town started quit carrying it, one by one. By that time I was getting desperate to find those singles. Finally I looked on Amazon and not only did they have it but I could get it in timely shipments--so my husband started ordering regular shipments for me.<br /><br />Then I got a bright idea of how to enhance the flavor of the singles and also to have it already made for me before I got up in the mornings. Now people here have complained that they have to use 2 bags at a time to get a stronger flavor but what I did not only enhanced the flavor but also I did not have to use 2 bags per cup to get a good cup of coffee. As everyone knows when you use a coffeemaker and it states how many cups that it holds it is talking about those smaller cups you get with a dish set--not coffee mugs which are bigger. I like at least 3 cups of coffee in the morning so I ordered a 6 cup coffeemaker which is actually makes only 3 coffee mugs of coffee. Mine also has a timer that I can set when the coffee is to be made. So every night before I go to bed I make this little coffeemaker up with 4 bags of singles and set the timer for just before I am going to get up. Then when I get up in the morning the coffee is already made. No need to do anything with the singles other than cut off the strings of the bag and then add the bags to the basket. And this coffeemaker is small enough that it does not take up much counter room. Now my coffee tastes like perked coffee and I can't tell you how much more I have enjoyed this new way of drinking my coffee singles. I also take a box at a time and take each single and cut the strings off and then put them in a small lidded container next to the coffeemaker, so now it is more convenient to make up my coffeemaker every night.<br /><br />Other than the above reason for drinking this coffee, as stated by others, it is so convenient if you have to travel somewhere. My husband & I have to make trips out of state to visit relatives, with stops along the way to stay at motels. Most motels now have microwaves in the rooms and one cup coffeemakers but they never give you more than enough for one cup of coffee each. So we bring along my coffee singles and use them in the microwave after we have used up the coffee that the motel provided. One cup is not enough for us to get going in the morning so my singles work out well for me and husband. Hope this review helps others.

review/summary: Folgers Does It Better!
review/text: I thought that this new invention was genius...a brew that can be made using coffee in something that looks like a tea bag. I had tried Folgers Coffee Singles and all I needed was one bag instead of two, like I do with this product. The flavor was also actually really good for being Folgers. I saw Maxwell House Coffee Singles at Big Lots and bought two boxes...at $2.50 it was a bargain because Folgers goes for $6.00 at CVS.  Boy was I disappointed! This brew actually tastes woody and old. The coffee is also weak and possibly requires three bags to make a decent strong cup. Can't wait to go through these two boxes and never buy it again. Nescafe Clasico actually does a better job at a cup of joe. If you like a cup of brownish water then this product is for you.

review/text: I don't drink coffee as I get a stomach ache from caffeine but when someone who visits wants a cup this is great to have on hand.  Everyone whose had one of these  preferred it to my regular instant.  A couple of people took note of what it was so they could buy it for themselves. If the coffee drinker likes it black it's fine.  For someone who likes cream, once I ran out of fancy creamer and it was less of a hit

review/text: We've used these coffee bags on and off for years when camping.  They deliver real brewed coffee flavor just by adding boiling water.  For the past couple of years, my elderly, widowed dad has relied on these for his morning coffee without going to the trouble of brewing coffee.  He loves them.  But they are becoming increasingly hard to find.  I told him I would look on Amazon and thankfully they were here!  I will be buying these again, as my local supermarkets do not carry them.  I'm thankful that Amazon does!

review/text: Firstly...I want to qualify that Maxwell House is the only coffee we ever use and we love it. I will also say that these bags are part regular and part instant coffee. If you are not an instant coffee drinker these may not be your first choice. I purchased Maxwell House Coffee Singles,  with continuous  bi-monthly shipments, for a coffee machine we purchased. It was a single serve machine and when it arrived the bags did not work with that specific machine. Amazon was amazing about refunding my purchase instantly and cancelled my monthly delivery program exactly as stated in the agreement. I have shopped with Amazon for years and this is the first time I requested a refund and they handled it seamlessly. Thank you very much.<br />Truly,<br />Vivian

With the french press, I have waste as I don't drink it all.  I have to say that I am thrilled with the outcome.  This coffee is good!  I put it in the microwave to enhance the temperature even though I used my hot water dispenser.  It is quick, easy, portable and not wasteful.  It also does not take up a substantial amount of counter space.  I was able to purchase it at the Stop N Shop on the Cape (MA), but I don't know how long they will carry it for.

review/summary: he who laughs last didn't get the joke...
review/text: not only does this latecomer not get it, this product is a joke! I was hoping these would be as good as or better than the original coffee single creator, Folgers (or at least that's who I heard of doing it first back in late 90's).  Maxwell House is stingy with the amount of coffee put into each bag, yielding a very weak attempt at brown water. I know the directions are based on 6-8oz servings, but who really drinks coffee in such a small quantities?  Besides, Folgers coffee singles directions are based on those same 6-8oz servings, but just like tea bags, they can stretch and sufficiently flavor much larger quantities of water(I use 2 Folgers coffee singles bags for a 22oz mug and absolutely enjoy the good, strong flavor).<br /><br />In an effort not to be wasteful, I have found two solutions that work for me until the boxes are gone:<br /><br />1) use one bag of this and one bag of the Folgers. Heat water to a rolling boil, pour into cup/mug over bags, wait a FULL FIVE OR SIX MINUTES, discard bags, then serve. This works for up to a 12oz cup/mug imo. Any bigger and you may want to add another bag.<br /><br />2) use two or three bags of this. Place bags into pot, measure and pour in water, heat to a rolling boil, pour all into cup/mug, wait a FULL FIVE OR SIX MINUTES, discard bags, then serve. Again, assuming your cup/mug is 12oz or less.  Any bigger and you may want to add another bag.<br /><br />Either method seems to work for me.  The coffee in both instances was not bitter and was at least better than instant. When these are gone though, it's back to Folgers for me! They got it right the first time and I actually enjoy the Folgers.  With Maxwell House, I'm just trying to get through the boxes.

review/text: Finally a vegan cookie that has flavor options and have some good, nutritional stuff in them. We've tried all of the flavors of these and they are all delicious. Pumpkin is my personal favorite.  My daughter's favorite is the lemon poppy, my husband the peanut butter and my son the chocolate/chocolate chip. We just buy them all now. :) We are vegan and there is no sign of animal products that we can find. These need to be split in two, but we love to share in our house anyway. I sometimes split mine in two and eat 1/2 with my coffee and then half for dessert later. They have so much fiber and protein in them, I'm surprised at how good they are.
