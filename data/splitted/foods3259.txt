review/summary: Jalapeno? More like gym socks and garbage.
review/text: Holy barf bag, the jalapeno Popchips are FOUL. I love the original Popchips and I really love Jalapeno, but for some reason the Popchips people just couldn't get the flavor right. I tried one, gagged, and handed the bag off to my dad to try. He was munching cautiously when I mentioned I thought they tasted a bit like garbage. He paused, considered, and said, "That's it. That's the taste. There's something gym-socky about it." Save your money!

review/summary: The Salt & Pepper version is awful!
review/text: We ordered the salt and pepper version since they were on sale and we really like PopChips.  They were AWFUL!  Honestly, we couldn't eat them because they were so hot.  I would not have thought that "salt and pepper" would have been so incredibly heavy on the pepper.  Our mouths were burning and it wasn't a good burn!  We will continue to buy Popchips but never the salt and pepper variety again.

review/summary: THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD
review/text: I love chips...and have been noshing on the regular Popchips for months now...love most of the flavors. So when I saw the multigrain, I thought, why not?  UGH...it wasn't crispy and the taste was bland and dull. I am so disheartened to have 23 bags left, that I don't know if I will continue my regular subscription.  Do not get these unless you want chips that would be better served as packing material

review/text: I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.  All flavors have a really weird taste to them, except for maybe the plain chips.  The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross!  I took one bite and had to throw the bag away.  Now I'm stuck with a bunch of chips that I'll never eat.

review/summary: Too strong IMO
review/text: I bought the popchips variety pack to try the different flavors and I kept an open mind but I just don't like this flavor.  Their other flavors like BBQ & salt and vinegar are great, but these are REALLY peppery.  I can't even taste the salt on them because the pepper is so overwhelming.  Might be your bag of tea if you like a lot of pepper on food, but my husband puts pepper on everything and even he said there was too much pepper here.

review/summary: They have a strange taste. Much worse than baked Lays or Pringles.
review/text: I was disappointed with the taste of these chips (regular and barbecue). I can't really taste the potato, so it is almost like eating a badly-flavored foam chip. It tastes like it is stale even though it is fresh, and it also has an odd chemical-like taste. The similar baked lays and pringles chips are very tasty. My kids finally ate the rest of these chips, but only after all of the other chips were gone.

review/summary: Healthy really?
review/text: I was excited to buy these "chips" and try them out since they are supposed to be a healthier alternative. But these things are super super salty.  What it lacks in oil, it makes up for in salt.  I would not consider these things healthy at all.  I bought these for my toddler but I didn't know why he only ate 2 pieces before giving up until I tasted them myself. I even opened a 2nd and 3rd bag just to make sure the first bag wasn't just a fluke.  Don't waste your money on these.  Stick w/ the baked chips!

review/summary: Lacks flavor
review/text: Because I like sweet potatoe fries, I thought I would like these.  But, I found them to lack flavor.  There is just a bit of a bitter taste to them.  They may be better for you than potato chips, but they just don't give the same satisfaction.  However, they are not very salty and are in a 100 calorie pack which makes them healthier for you. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my husband and sister try them.  They each gave them a 2.5 rating.  My sister said they were a bit bland.  Hubby said they weren't too bad.  But, none of us are excited about eating another bag.

review/summary: A nice alternative
review/text: I shared these with friends at work.  The consensus is that they taste good, if not quite what some people expected.  Those who enjoy sweet potato fries liked them better than those with no experience in that area.  Price would be a consideration for everyone who tasted these, but not necessarily the overriding issue.  I personally enjoy them.  I'd look for them in a larger bag over a snack-size bag, mostly because I'm cheap that way.  Nobody said they were nasty or that it was something they'd never choose.

review/summary: WAY better than I expected
review/text: The label says they're popped, rather than fried or baked.  However they did it, these are great chips!  They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.  The flavor is a nice balance sweet and salty with not too much of either. At 100 calories a bag, 3 grams of fat (no saturated, no trans fat), 16g carbohydrates and 230mg sodium per bag they're also great nutritionally.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but in this form they are terrific!  All five of us in this house from age 9 to 50-something are fans.<br /><br />I wish I was better at describing flavors but you'll just need to try them for yourself.

Every time I eat these chips I feel like I am taking a whiff of the old codger's rear, and it brings back memories. Sometimes I just open up a bag and deeply inhale the crotchety old aroma. Scottyboy and I eat these by the dozens, and I requested them so much that ol Scottyboy, who's in charge of snack purchases, bought these in bulk, which makes up for the week he bought ten boxes of edible strawberry underwear for the office.

review/text: I like all kinds of snack foods and potato chips. The regular kind, kettle cooked, and the "modified" potato snacks such as Munchos (my favorite) Pringles, Lay's Baked, etc.<br /><br />But not these. They have almost a styrofoam consistency...so they aren't really crisp and snappy, just hard. Like stale styrofoam. Now, I could learn to live with the texture, but the flavor is odd, too. . Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said "I don't like these, they taste funny. Don't buy these again." My 12 year old kids wouldn't even eat them. Maybe the ones with flavoring (like BBQ) cover it up, but not with the plain.

review/text: To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.<br /><br />Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6-flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call "salt and vinegar" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips.

review/text: This is a tasty low cal snack and the single serve bags are good for those who won't rest until the bag is empty.  If you need to watch your sodium this is not a low sodium food.  The Jalapeno is spicy without burning your tongue and lips.

One serving practically fills an entire cereal bowl, but has way less fat and calories than traditional chips.  I'm hooked!  I highly recommend trying these!

They are kind of pricey when they are regular priced at the store, So we buy them in bulk either on Amazon, or when they go on sale at CVS pharmacy. Our favorite flavor is the BBQ.

review/summary: Love the texture and the flavor
review/text: I'm a big fan of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, so my daughter decided to surprise me with these new Popchips.  I really like the different texture...light, tender, and crisp.  The salt and vinegar taste is strong and tangy but not overwhelming.  I like the individual packages, because I actually stop eating when I finish a bag.<br /><br />In each bag there are about 18 large chips, 3 grams of fat (not bad!), 100 calories, 15 g of carbohydrates, 140 mg of salt, and no cholesterol.  They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.  They use heat and pressure to "pop" the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.<br /><br />Finally, these packages have a "use by" date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips.

Costco really has the best price, when they are available there. Since we are a big fan of Jalapeno, we went ahead and ordered them here at Amazon,even though the price was high, and we regret that purchase, the Jalapeno flavor is just wrong. Awful would be the right description. We also tried the Cheddar and that on also failed badly for us. So, we will stick to the BBQ and the Orginals.

It is def not too spicy, so don't let that scare you. If anything the lime is the highest note of flavor. If you already like Popchips, this is a new great flavor to try. If you have never tried them, then this is a great flavor to start with.

review/summary: I still like potato chips, but these are surprisingly delicious! Airy! Crispy!
review/text: These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring. I love the boldness of the chili and tartness of the lime! Each chip appears to me like two thin potato chips sealed together with air inside! That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one. They satisfy my taste buds and I get an extra jolt from the airiness and crunchiness.<br /><br />What else can I say, except: Yum! Yum! And, oh, yes, with all-natural ingredients and only 100 calories for the entire bag, my Dr. approves them too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 22, 2012<br />Author of "Dream Reachers" series of books (with Chase Von)

review/summary: Great crispy crunch and flavor
review/text: My family is addicted to crispy, salty snacks and I've tried a few different kinds of chips trying to find a healthier alternative to the junk food they all love.<br /><br />I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DZIL24">Terra Krinkle Cut Sweet Potato Sea Salt</a> chips for their high level of vitamin A. But they are also high fat, and the texture and flavor don't appeal to my daughter.<br /><br />These chips don't have any vitamin A according the to the label, but they are low calorie, low fat and low sodium. The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family, even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these "chips" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's "good" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.

They don't taste like a traditional chip they seem infused with air or something.  The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues.

review/summary: Chili Lime Flavor - Review
review/text: In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.

review/text: The crisp texture of these PopChips is very appealing.  The chips also stayed whole in the bag, which is a big plus.  They  have a nice sweet potato flavor, with a light hint of salt.  Best of all, no greasy fingers!  I like that they are a healthy alternative to other chips or crackers.  The information on the bag well represents the taste of the chips.  I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.  Overall, I would definitively buy these chips again and look forward to trying other flavors of Popchips.

review/summary: Satisfies a sweet potato tooth
review/text: Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth.

review/summary: A healthier snack
review/text: We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake "healthier" for "healthy."  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those "truth in advertising" points that annoys me so I mention it.

review/summary: Fabulous Taste - can't eat just one but small warning
review/text: These are absolutely delicious and irresistable. The taste is perfect - not heavy or overdone. It actually kind of sneaks up on you before you realize you've just finished the bag.<br /><br />They seem to melt in your mouth even as you are chewing them as opposed to some brands that make you feel like Mr. Ed (the horse). Yes,there is some salt, but it's not like someone just dumped a container of the stuff on them. This time it enhances the chip.<br /><br />Everything in them is terrific except for the inclusion of maltodextrin about 2/3 down the ingredient list. It can have a kind of laxative effect on a lot of people and I just thought you should know it's in there.<br /><br />Other than that - there is nothing about this product that would detract me from buying it for parties, picnics, events, or just enjoying by myself.<br /><br />Seriously, they are that good.

I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything "popped" but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with "real" chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand.

review/summary: Once again, America's food scientists bring us a new snack!
review/text: POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.  I have no negative comments about the POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO product.

review/summary: Taste more like "Tomato and Basil" than "Chili and Lime"
review/text: NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're "probably" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a "tomato" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like "Tomato and Basil" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.

review/summary: Fantastic Crispy Airy Chips
review/text: Somewhere between a rice cake and a potato chip in texture, PopChips are an excellent low calorie snacking choice. I've tried all of the available flavors and here is my assessment of each:<br />Barbeque - A little too sweet for my taste but not bad overall<br />Jalapeno - High on Spice, not too salty, not much other flavor. I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.<br />Original - Not super flavorful but great for dipping<br />Cheddar - Yummy<br />Parmesan Garlic - So Garlicky. Good but make for stinky breath<br />Salt & Pepper - Good<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Hands down the BEST flavor

review/summary: Life-saver for chip lovers trying to eat healthier
review/text: I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.

review/text: When PopChips were really hard to find, I was ordering them by the case from Amazon on a regular basis.  The price was always great and these really are my go-to snack.  They are always fresh and delicious from Amazon.<br /><br />I definitely prefer Original over barbecue and sour cream & onion.  I haven't tried other flavors, but Original works just fine for me because I use it for various dips and will even use dry seasonings on them if I'm in the mood.<br /><br />I don't know anybody that I've offered some of these to who didn't want a bag of their own!  Highly recommended.

review/text: I'm not some fringe mustard snob. I like what i like. it seems odd to me to write a review of mustard, but this stuff has really earned it, and i was just so excited to see that it is now available on Amazon that i decided to clarify things for those who have not tried it. this  stuff is made with beer. in fact, the first ingredient on the label is "Beer." they're not joking either; you can really taste it. this stuff is absolutely worth going out of your way to get for bratwurst, burgers, or pretty much anything. it's rather hard to find in grocery stores, even specialty food stores and high-end groceries, so having it online is very convenient. the point is, do yourself a favor and try this stuff on some grilled brats from the butcher. you will never eat another one without thinking about this mustard.

review/summary: Spicy?  Not so much...Best Mustard in the World?  Absolutely!
review/text: When I first found this mustard at a local grocery store, I was blown away...but then it disappeared from every store that I have been to since, so my only option is online.  Since first trying Plochman's Kosciusko Beer Mustard, (and then agonizing over the loss of it), I tried every Spicy Brown mustard I could find...but no others measured up.  Finally, I found it online, and the celebration lasted for days!<br /><br />This mustard is certainly not the spiciest, but I do believe it is the most flavorful.  It just seems to go with everything I try it on - it makes any sandwich 100% better, plain cold cuts are made magnificent, pretzels reach perfection, and it is not unusual at all for me to sneak downstairs late at night to have a spoonful of this wonderful stuff.  It provides the perfect companion to the cheapest hotdogs, but also to the best gourmet bratwursts.  Bland burgers need just a dab of this mustard to become superb; I have yet to find any kind of meat, sandwich, or snack that is not made better by this mustard!<br /><br />I think this mustard should be registered with the FDA as a drug because it is super-addictive.  Try it, and see if you can put it down.  Be warned...one jar will not be enough.

review/summary: Best cat food in a can, but pricey
review/text: I am a Nutritionist and a cat lover.  I have placed my cats on wet food only - no kibble - as kibble causes kidney disease, in my opinion, and is one of the top 2 killers of cats.<br />All the Instinct products are superior.  Their ingredients are 100% food grade, and believe me, most pet food cannot say that.<br />My girls had no trouble finishing off all flavors, since they are already used to wet.<br />If your cats are eating wet or dry food from major manufacturers, they are addicted to the sugar and MSG in them and it will take a while to wean them onto real food. (The label doesn't say MSG but that's what the "natural flavors" are).<br />Instinct also makes frozen raw food, my next step.

review/summary: Cats don't like venison
review/text: I won't be buying the Venison product again.  I have also tried Nature's Variety Instinct Chicken and Duck diets, and I am happy with both of those... but the Venison had issues.  When I opened the first can, I noticed white spots/specks on top of the food.  It didn't look right, and it also didn't smell as "good" as the other versions I had tried.  It also didn't appear to have much moisture, especially compared to the other two versions I tried.  Through my own research, I found other people commenting on the white specks.  I believe they are bits of fat, but I don't know that for sure.  And to be fair to Nature's Variety, they weren't the only company that I found with complaints about mysterious white specks in their canned cat food.  However, there were several that named this product specifically, so I wish NV would have posted something on their website explaining the white specks.  I am going to stay away from any Venison canned cat food from now on.  Neither of my cats liked this food, but they will eat the Duck/Chicken.  That being said, I do think Nature's Variety has one of the most informative websites out there.  They have a feeding guide which tells you how much of each product you should be feeding your cat/dog, based on weight and activity level.  It was very helpful.<br /><br />***Update 12/14/2011***<br />I ordered the Instinct Lamb formula and it came completely covered in the white specks.  I emailed the company and they responded the very next morning.  Their response:<br />The white specks you are seeing is just congealed fat.  It tends to separate more in our darker proteins like beef, lamb, and venison. We recommend that you simply stir it back in since it is part of the formula.  It's perfectly normal and safe to feed. We don't include any additives in our products to help retain moisture and fat within the protein, so this occurs sometimes in our Instinct Canned products.  Thanks for supporting Nature's Variety!<br /><br />I was really impressed with their prompt response.  I will continue to purchase their canned cat food, just not the venison kind. =) My two cats appear to only like the duck forumla.  I still don't understand why the food looks different with every batch I order.  The first time I ordered the Chicken formula, the cats liked it ok.  It had excess moisture in the can and smelled almost good (to my human nose).  The second time it had the white gunk, no extra moisture, and did not smell so good.  The third time it had globs of gooey stuff on the bottom and stunk.  What is that...?

review/summary: Even Mr. Bi...Witch & Moan Loves It
review/text: A few years ago, my cat was diagnosed with food allergies that previously undiagnosed had led to IBD and then Pancreatitis. We went through just about every limited ingredient food to find one he would eat consistently.  He finally settled on Nature's Variety Instinct. Lamb and Rabbit he'll eat every time and all the time. Duck and Venison, he'll also eat just not always.<br /><br />He still suffers from IBD and will have pancreatitis flare ups if given chicken, but his coat is soft and shiny. He's active (at 13 yrs old). And he rarely throws up. I couldn't survive, he couldn't survive, without this food.<br /><br />I'm glad the company finally started to make 3 oz cans. Mr. Picky doesn't doesn't like leftovers. It doesn't hurt as much to toss out 1.5 oz as it does 4 oz.

review/summary: Low Fat and Few Calories (HEALTHY SNACK); Great Taste
review/text: Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps are a healthy snack and I absolutely love them.  Trying to be health conscious and trying to avoid fats, I was looking for snacks that would satisfy both requirements.  I stumbled on these snacks at two (2) places: Dean's Natural Foods stores and Whole Foods.<br /><br />Be careful that you only select the Glenny's that say Low Fat on the label. Why? This is important if you are trying to cut fat out of your diet as well as calories.  There are no saturated fats nor any trans fats nor any cholesterol in the low fat Glennys.  There is only one gram of fat per serving.  And the calorie count is extremely low (only 70 calories per serving) versus for the regular Glennys over 110 to 120 calories per serving.<br /><br />The taste is great and for those who need a crunchy snack sometime during the day; this is a healthy alternative to potato chips or pop corn.  Two small servings which would only be 140 calories and 0 saturated fat would provide you with 10 grams of soy protein, 25 mg of soy isoflavones, 3 grams of dietary fiber and more soy protein than tofu or soy milk.<br /><br />Cosmopolitan Magazine quotes: "Even better than potato chips. Delicious."<br /><br />Additionally, each serving gives you 4% of your daily calcium requirement and 8% of your iron percent daily value. Each serving would be about 10 chips approximately.  I open the 3 ounce bag and separate the contents into ziplock bags (10 chips apiece) so that I can regulate the calories and the amount of fat in my snacks.<br /><br />What is nice for those who are afraid to buy a 3 ounce bag of anything.  Even if you succumbed to eating the entire 3 ounce bag: all would not be lost.  You would be getting 20 grams of protein, 50 mg or soy isoflavones, 6 grams of dietary fiber and 300 calories total in the whole bag.  The taste is great whether you purchase the low fat apple cinnamon, the white cheddar or the lightly salted, the low fat barbeque...all have a great taste.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this snack..great taste.<br /><br />Sample a bag.  I think you will be a fan after that.<br /><br />The 1.3 ounce bags (which are being offered on Amazon) are even better than the 3 ounce (85 gram) bags that I have been purchasing.  You have the bags already divided into individual snack portions with 24 bags in the pack.  Terrific!<br /><br />Bentley/October 2007

review/summary: Great chip alternative.
review/text: Ordered a case of the Glenny's BBQ flavor and I must say I am pretty impressed. I had previously tried the kay's protein chips and while they weren't bad, good actually, I got bored of the taste and just couldn't even eat them anymore. The Glenny's soy crisps are totally different in texture and taste. The closest comparison I can think of would be to the Quaker Mini Crisps, the Glenny's are very close. The big difference being the Glenny's are low fat, soy based and the better nutritional profile. The bbq flavor was great and I will probably order more of it and give the other flavors a try as well. If you eat an entire bag 37g you are getting 140cals, 18g carbs, 3g fat, 9g protein - the profile really is not bad at all and it actually fit my macros for the day really well. Nothing to feel guilty about eating a bag of these here and there. I like the fact i have a snack I can smuggle into the movies and what not now, I would normally always feel left out while everyone else pigs out on junk food. The glennys 100 cal choc chip brownies are also delicious! and also have a great profile. Definitely recommend both products.

review/summary: Great snack option! Kids even love them.
review/text: I bought Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps/BBQ flavor because it was a food option on a new lifestyle program I was starting. It was a substitute for fatty, carb-ladden potato chips. I wanted to lose weight, so making this trade off wasnt a big deal for me- I was willing to try something new with the knowledge that it's different than the chips Ive been eating for years, but it will satisfy my need for salty/crunchy.<br />I was very happy with the product. It is a little similar to rice cakes, except a lot smaller and much thinner. It has just the right amount of seasoning and has a good crunch factor.<br />My daughter and husband ended up trying them, and surprisingly really liked them. They like the fact that they are a much healthier option than chips and they like the taste. They requested I buy a case of the chips in single serving bags. With auto-deliver, the price is great. You won't find this price buying them by the single bags in grocery stores.<br />If you are looking for a healthy chip substitute, this is a good one!

review/text: You don't have to be dutch to love this licorice. I was born in Holland so I'm well acquinted with the different kinds of products that's available. I'm sold on Gustaf's Traditional Licorice.<br />Not mentioning how many others I have won over by letting them try it, I am truely an advocate for this product and decided to be on the automatic reorder program. Do your research licorice is good for the body.

review/summary: Fresher and cheaper!
review/text: I used to buy this exact licorice in bulk from a specialty food store at $8/lb. At $18 for 42 oz., and in convenient plastic tubs, these kitties are softer and obviously fresher!

review/summary: I've been won over
review/text: I have never been a fan of black licorice ---- until I tried these ! These are the perfect balance of licorice flavor and sweetness. I also like that they are very firm so I suck on them awhile before I chew them up. These little black cats are perrrrrrfect.

review/summary: Great flavor--very chewy
review/text: I have been a lifelong licorice lover.  Recently a friend sent me a six-pack of these licorice cats, which she said have become her favorite. She says she likes the slightly saltier taste than you find in most licorice candy. I was used to the soft and sweet Australian style, so it was a bit of a switch, but I really am enjoying this stuff. I've opened my fourth package now and would say that the chewiness is the only drawback for me. I have TMJ disorder and when I do too much chewing on this candy I end up with a sore jaw, but chewing brings out the great flavor, so I live with it. I would recommend this candy to licorice lovers without jaw problems.

review/summary: Hard Licorice
review/text: I'd had a craving for some licorice. I bought cheap stuff at the supermarket which didn't do it at all. Then l tried the supermarket expensive one. Australian style. Which l liked. Soft and tasty. So l looked on Amazon for a better price. Saw that the dutch style got good reviews so went with it. I find it a bit too dry and hard for my taste. It takes a little longer to chew which is a plus but l didn't find it satisfying when l was done. The cat shape might me fun for any kids that eat a piece but they are really just a cat outline with no details. I did also find this batch to have a laxative effect if l ate too many at one time. This could also be a good or bad thing depending on what you need from your licorice fix.

review/text: I have been eating licorice for over 60 years. This licorice is more like candy. I should have known that  you cant buy this much  licorice for $16.00. I could not recommend this unless you just want candy.

review/summary: Good but....
review/text: I hesitate to criticize a product that is obviously based on family tradition. This sauce, however, is not of the quality I anticipated. Often sauces which please in the restaurant, suffer in mass production and end up a pale sister of the original. I believe this is what happened here. The color and consistency of the sauce set up expectations which are not met by the taste test. There are several, commonly available 'off the shelf' sauces that mimic this Tomato Basil. I wish I could be positive about the experience but this sauce left me wanting more. Of course, the low price suggests low expectations but once shipping is added - I have almost $12.00 invested in this less than gratifying experience.

review/summary: Fruity goodness
review/text: I like the fruit in this rice with just about everything.  It adds a little mystery to chili or a stir fry. I like to have lots of this on hand, because it's easy to alter indifferent ways.
