review/summary: good noodles -- according to taste
review/text: I feel the same way about flavored pastas as I do about flavored coffees:  I don't care for them.<br /><br />I do love a great spaghetti neri if cooked and seasoned perfectly in a fine restaurant.  But, for home cooking, give me a good perciatelli and leave off the flavorings.<br /><br />These are great-quality noodles, however.  No complaints about that.  I just find that their flavor interferes with that of the sauce.  I find the basil especially strong -- even a bit over-powering.<br /><br />Would make a good gift for someone who likes the taste of a good flavored pasta.  Wish I could re-gift these!

review/summary: This is REAL vanilla
review/text: I have to add my accolades for this vanilla product.  I saw it a couple of years ago in a shop in Boise, ID and was told if I tried it, I would never buy grocery store vanilla (extract or pure extract) again.  It was pricey so I tried their smallest bottle.  When it was about half gone, I returned to buy their largest bottle! It seems to keep its flavor better when used in baking, and you'll really notice the difference in things that are not cooked for long periods. I use it for everything calling for vanilla.  Try it - I think you'll also be very glad you did!

review/summary: The most wonderful, delicious vanilla ever!
review/text: I have loved Mexican Vanilla for years and years.  In fact have even been known to go south of the border just to get it.  But I have never found anything of this quality in a border town!  This is by far the best vanilla I have ever used.  I put it in everything; cakes, cookies, pancakes, french toast, even my bath water!  Also, don't forget mexican vanilla is great for burns, and to keep mosquitos away (only real mexican vanilla works for that.)<br /><br />This is also perfect for a gift.  The packaging is darling, I can't stand to put it in the cupboard, I just keep it right on the counter.  It's that cute!  I'm going to give it to my sisters for Mother's Day and my grown daughters in their Easter baskets.<br /><br />Really, trust me on this one....try Blue Cattle Truck Mexican Vanilla, there is not any better.

review/summary: Healthy Alternative
review/text: These are great for people who want to enjoy the taste and benefits of sunflower seeds without adding extra salt to your diet. I am very careful about my sodium (salt) intake. These are unsalted, as well as hulled. I use them for cooking, but you could eat them right out of the bag. I have only found pieces of shell on about 4 occasions. I suggest you take a quick look at them in the pan before adding additional ingredients to check for the occasional shell that may sneak through. I add about 30 seeds to a meal, and the one pound bag lasts about 3 weeks. I have always recieved fresh, good seeds. I am a repeat buyer of this product.

review/summary: Heat with flavor
review/text: Walkerswood anything is very good but, this hot sauce adds more to the dining experience.  Most hot sauces are all about burning you into oblivion but, Walkerswood adds so many flavor's to their sauce that it is much more than "A  hot sauce"  Yes, it has a damn good heat bite and with attitude.  I wish they sold it in much bigger bottles because as is I order five at a time to insure I always have it on hand.  Try it and the price is so reasonable that you can afford to try it and if not pleased not loose much.  I have it daily and mutiable times i.e. breakfast, lunch, diner and any time I need a real good boost of flavor to my food.  I give bottles out to my Mexican friends here in New Mexico and they always say Bueno to the taste.  I have visited Jamaica many times and while the island is full of different kinds of hot sauces Walkerwoods is the one I seak out.

review/summary: These are okay, but you can do better for your cat & wallet
review/text: We have two cats who are addicted to treats.<br />Okay, we made them that way. We fed them Temptations for years, before we really took the time to read the labels and understand what the ingredients really were. That brand is about the same as flavored potato chips for humans - flavor enhancers are added to make us crave the item. Temptations does the same for your cat. No wonder they didn't want to stop eating them!<br /><br />Anyway, we were on the hunt for a healthier treat that wasn't full of kitty junk food.<br />Both our cats love chicken and could care less about tuna or fish flavors, so this was one of the items we tried.<br />The ingredients are top-notch, and the treat's size is really good for cats.<br /><br />However, while both cats get excited about the bag being opened (like a can opener sound or popping the lid on wet cat food),<br />I could swear I hear them sigh when they see this bag! While they do eat these, it isn't a favorite by any means. Both will eat a few pieces then walk away, almost unheard of in all previous treat feeds of all brands. I can leave a few out and they'll get eaten, but it is probably out of boredom, not because they want them. One of our favorite games with both cats is tossing a treat for them to catch. They both love to do this, but are too bored to play catch with these treats. While I am glad that these do not contain the kitty version of MSG, it also needs to have something more appealing to the cats too.<br /><br />There is enough chicken in this to make it a decent product for your cat. However, there also doesn't seem to be a lot of flavor, in their opinion. While I did not buy mine at Amazon, no matter where you shop, Halo treats are pretty costly, given what<br />they are - little round pieces of cat food.<br /><br />We won't be buying them again. For a few dollars more, we can get a 3-lb sack of very healthy cat food that we can use as treats instead. Right now, we are using Blue Buffalo cat food as their treat. They both adore it, it is full of healthy ingredients too (despite being more grains than I really think cats need), and you get a lot more value. We also use Eukanuba dry food as treats, and both of those brands are very popular with both of our cats.<br /><br />So, while everyone's cats have different likes/dislikes just like we humans do, I'd put my money into some other brand.<br />If this one came way down in price, then it would be an okay value as an extra treat.<br />But, for the premium pricing on a bag of treats, you can do just as well by your cat with other brands.<br />There is nothing really special about these, and don't have either the flavor or fragrance to get our cats too excited about them.<br />I think we were all a little disappointed with the Halo chicken treats.

review/summary: I never knew I was a "rice snob"
review/text: After living in Okinawa for nearly 4 years, returning to the US was a bit of culture shock.  We had access to American grocery stores while there, but always bought our rice, fish and produce at the local markets.  I never saw this particular variety there, but I found it at a local grocery in Virginia and tried it.  The taste is far superior to plain old white varieties from the rice and grain aisle in the regular markets, which is not good enough for me anymore.  Even short grain rice, which is hard to find at the best of times, still lacks something.  Koshihikari has superior taste and texture to even medium grain rice that might bear the label 'sushi rice'.<br />Be sure to rinse several times till the water runs clear.  I cook mine in my Japanese rice cooker b/c I cannot trust myself to watch a pot on the stove.  Though my neighbors always told me, for authentic taste, cook it the old fashioned way: rinse well, soak for 15 minutes in measured water, then cook it in a cast iron pot on the stove top.  Let it set covered for 10-15 minutes to steam before serving.<br />This variety is darn near close to authentic Japanese rice, best I can tell without a side-by-side taste test.

review/summary: I was a little disappointed by this canned soup!
review/text: I saw the word 'onion' on the label and thought it would taste like onions, which I love, but it really does not.  It tastes fine but not onion-y.  Once again my expectations were dashed so that is why I only give it 3 stars.  It tastes fine as a slightly watery vegetable soup but I ordered ONIONS!  Of courses I will eat all the cans in time now that I know it does not taste as I had thought when I ordered it.  As a soup lover I am sure any soup lover would enjoy this soup but don't expect it to have lots of onion flavor.  The sodium level is high at 1200 mg/can though I did not feel like it tasted that high.  The nice thing about this soup is that it only has 120 Calories for the whole can plus no fat or cholesterol.  Sugars are only 8 gms/can with 4 grams of protein and it's gluten free with no artificial preservatives.  I suspect the lack of significant onion flavor is because it is THAI and not American onion soup.  I do recommend it now that a I know what the real flavor is and how almost healthy it is.

review/text: Oban 14 is an old friend that I come back to like a comfort food. Though it has changed in flavor profile over the years, it is still a fine single malt whisky. I have sadly seen the price creep up into the stratosphere in recent years, thus a couple of star hit. But if you can get it on sale, give it a try. It is a well-made, uncomplicated, pleasant single malt even your mom will like.  Good stuff.

review/summary: Coffee-Drinking Chocoholics - Rejoice!!!
review/text: Sweet Sunrise Chocolate Fudge Brownie Coffee is just what the doctor ordered for those of us who like a cup of coffee in the morning - but who also love chocolate!  I first found this at one of the big box stores during the 2008 Christmas season.  I was so disappointed when the big box store did not stock it during the 2009 Christmas season.  However, I have managed to to find this coffee sporadically at some of the off-price retailers.  That is a hit or miss proposition, so I was delighted to find that I could purchase this through an Amazon partner.<br /><br />This is a rich, full-flavored coffee with just the right amount of chocolate; it tastes as if it really is a brownie disguised as a beverage.  The smell that emanates from your coffee pot while this is brewing is simply heavenly - at least for chocoholics.  If you add half and half or cream and some sweetner, the result is a decadent morning beverage.  Unlike many of the flavored coffees on the market, Chocolate Fudge Brownie Coffee does not have that artificial smell or aftertaste.  You will not be disappointed if you choose to purchase this flavored coffee - but, please leave some for me!

review/summary: Hint of chocolate
review/text: My husband doesn't really like regular coffee (unless it is drowned in cream and sugar).  But, he does like flavored coffee, in particular Pumpkin Spice because it is so intense.  I picked this coffee out because the blurb and other review said it has a strong chocolate flavor - just like a brownie - and the price is very reasonable.  Unfortunately, we did not find that to be the case.  This tasted like regular coffee with a hint of chocolate, mostly in the aroma.  We get more chocolate flavor from Coffee Mate flavored creamers.  Disappointing.  People who love coffee in general, and chocolate, may enjoy this.  But for those of us who want the coffee disguised by a stronger flavor, this won't do the job.  However, we just loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X7S45U">Vanilla Nut Pumpkin Pie Coffee, Ground, 1 Lb</a>!

review/text: The aroma was amazing but it just tasted like regular coffee.  The coffee was good, it just did not have the flavor I was expecting.  Also this was a present for my dad and the way it was packaged the bag got two holes in it. Luckily only a small amount of coffee grounds were lost and I was able to patch the bag with tape.  Although my dad felt obligated to use this coffee up as quickly as possible because he was worried the holes would effect how long it stayed fresh which is not how I would want him to feel about his present.

It is not overpowering in any way, and makes me feel like I am in a bakery style coffee shop.  I went back and ordered more.  If you are thinking about it, order it and decide for yourself.

I have been fair and tried it several times at different strengths, however it just doesn't taste good. Maybe it is just the batch that I have, it has a very tinny taste. It smells wonderful in the package, but the chocolate brownie flavor just doesn't make it into the cup. I will have to throw this coffee out!<br /><br />Update 7-24-12<br />To be fair, I need to update this review. I ended up giving this coffee to a friend and asked her opinion of it, she said she liked it, and had no problems. Given this info my rating will change from a 1 star to a 3 star.

review/text: I don't know how this company dares to label this as "Chocolate Fudge Brownie" as it tastes absolutely nothing like that. A lot of so called flavored coffees have disappointingly little of the flavor they have supposedly added to the coffee, but this one had none at all. It didn't even smell like the titled flavor.<br /><br />What is worse: other flavored coffees with disappointingly little of the flavor they supposedly added at least still taste like decent coffee. This one doesn't. I even tried mixing it with some Folgers coffee to use it up and noticed it brought down the quality of the Folgers brew. Please save yourself from this distasteful experience and purchase something else.

This is how I tasted it. One other thing I did like was the smell as it brewed,it is not too strong. I would say this is more of an after dinner coffee, or a brunch coffee, and would be great as an iced coffee. My opinion.

I will think twice about ordering coffee from amazon again simply because I would like to get a whole bag, not a 1/2 spilled one.

review/summary: Maybe not a money-saver, but a time saver
review/text: If you're looking at this bulk item, chances are you already know you like the cereal, so I'll skip trying to explain what it tastes like, and tell you about what you'll get and how you'll get it.<br /><br />The package you get is a pretty big Amazon box with another cardboard box inside it--that inner box is manufacturer packaging/shipping material which holds the 6 bags of cereal. You can open that box as normal by cutting the packing tape, or the box has perforations so grocery stores (the obvious intended recipients) can rip off the side & top of the box, making what the box calls a "presentation display", I guess because the bags, lacking their own boxes, might not stand on end by themselves. So you get the package Nature's Path sends to grocery & health food stores, and I guess that's the way Amazon does it with most of their grocery stuff.<br /><br />This was my first Amazon grocery order. The flakes didn't seem to be damaged from their trip. The flakes on this product are pretty hard and small anyway, which I'm sure helps. Looking at the six bags of cereal (I cut the packing tape instead of doing the "display" rip-out), you kind of wonder to yourself and say, "That doesn't look like x amount of dollars worth of cereal". But cereal boxes are packaged so inefficiently, that part of it is an optical illusion. I was able to fill up my refillable cereal container and still have maybe 1/4 of the bag left. One of these bags (32oz) is a little more than two of the "box" versions (13oz).<br /><br />I'll probably close and maybe even re-tape the box while I deplete my mass quantities to keep any curious pests out.<br /><br />While I did get this econo-bag version over the smaller 6-boxes version in order to save money, buying online in itself was not in order to save money. As two reviewers so far have noted, Whole Foods (when they have them) will sell these bags individually or in bulk for a little less. However, that's probably the only reasonably-priced thing in the whole building, as one of my friends calls the place "Whole Paycheck", and which is why I don't shop there anymore (that... and also because I moved to a state where they don't have them!).<br /><br />So getting to a store which actually stocks this cereal is difficult to me. Amazon's free shipping mitigates the price to where it's at least a fair price: close or even with whatever else your best deal would be, especially if you factor in gasoline to make a special trip. You might end up saving money, but for me it's a time and fuel saver, without paying more. Yes, I had to purchase a lot, but it WILL get eaten, even if it takes me a looong time. The upside is that I'm not gonna run out anytime soon! I haven't had this cereal for a year, since I moved! I really missed it!<br /><br />Further product info: it took me awhile to figure out the difference between Nature's Path "Heritage" and "8 Grain" cereals. They look and taste similar, and have very similar ingredients. The biggest difference (in my book) is the use of Kamut for Heritage. Kamut is essentially a "proprietary" grain, supposedly an extinct form of durum wheat obtained from ancient tombs in Egypt. This is disputed by some, who believe it's a "landrance", or regional variation, kind of like how a border collie is still a collie, not a whole new breed. Regardless, the importance to many consumers is the lack of genetic modification. But Kamut planting is strictly licensed, and it's only allowed to be grown organically, so there are extra costs and controls involved--in other words, it's more expensive, or at least more involved, for cereal makers to make stuff using Kamut than just buying wheat off the open market. Interestingly, Nature's Path charges exactly the same amount for both cereals. So, all other things being equal, I choose "Heritage" over "8 Grain" because of the Kamut. Further comparison: 8 Grain has rice and corn, which I consider to be almost fillers, especially rice. Heritage has neither, but has Spelt AND Quinoa, both very nice grains in my view. 8 Grains is heavier on oats.<br /><br />AMAZON DOESN'T LIST MILLET IN THE INGREDIENTS, but it is in there (a good thing) (it is listed in 8 Grain). Millet is an underrated grain, too often associated only with cheap birdseed. 8 Grain also has Buckwheat; Heritage doesn't. Because of the near-equal tradeoffs, I used to buy both 8 Grain and Heritage locally, and mix them together. Bulk-buying on Amazon precludes this at the moment. Either way, you can't lose. I see Amazon sells a puffed Millet cereal; it's cheap and I might 'spike' my mix with that. I also hear Amaranth will pop like popcorn; I don't know if that would work for cereal, too.<br /><br />Heritage/8 Grain are not as sweet as traditional cereals, and it takes about 2 seconds to get used to that, and after that i find myself wishing it were even less sweet (cane juice is the second ingredient in Heritage, but the fourth ingredient in 8 Grain).

review/summary: A truely great product!
review/text: This cereal meets three major criteria:<br /><br />1.  It is low in sugar - no longer a kid and hate cereal that is too sweet.<br /><br />2.  Stays crunchy - the best flaked cereal I have found for staying crunchy in milk, maybe because the flakes seem a little heartier/thicker than standard flakes.<br /><br />3.  Taste - last but not least, too many of the healthier flakes taste like cardboard, but this cereal is so good I can eat it right out of the bag like a snack.<br /><br />This cereal is one item in my ultimate breakfast cereal mix.  The other ingredients are Kashi's 7 Whole Grain Puffs, dried cranberries, pecans, and flax seed. With Heritage & Kashi combined you get all the following grains in one breakfast:<br /><br />1.  Spelt<br /><br />2.  Quinoa<br /><br />3.  Kamut<br /><br />4.  Millet<br /><br />5.  Buckwheat<br /><br />6.  Triticale<br /><br />7.  Rye<br /><br />8.  Red Winter Wheat<br /><br />9.  Barley<br /><br />10. Oats<br /><br />11. Brown Rice<br /><br />12. Sesame Seeds<br /><br />Then I add the following to the bowl:<br /><br />13. Flax Seeds - about a tablespoon<br /><br />14. Pecans - about 2 tablespoons<br /><br />15. Dried Cranberries - about 2 tablespoons<br /><br />Then if you really want to go full-on healthy try Better Than Milk Original Flavor Vegan Soy Beverage, the best soy milk out there...see my review of it.

They are the perfect source for whole grains.<br /><br />We love buying them from Amazon too because we save so much.  We live in Chicago.  The only place you can find them is at Whole Foods, already a huge markup.  Add to that Chicago city taxes and you end up paying 1/3 more.  Plus WF sometimes doesn't even have them or has them only in the smaller size.  Amazon doesn't run out.  Its subscription program automatically sends us the bulk size every few months.  Great deal!  Great program!

review/text: Can be found at a brick and morter store for much less.  I usually find it on Amazon for less.  But, this time, Amazon lets me down.  Plus, the first time i posted this message, it was censored, i suspect because i listed the store where you could purchase it for less.

review/summary: Nature's Path is great- my 2 year old loves it
review/text: I work during the day and one of the highlights of my day is waking up early with my 20 month old daughter while her mom sleeps (stay at home mom). one of the first words out of her mouth is "cer"- meaning "cereal".<br /><br />We have a whole routine of going and taking out the cereal, milk and bowls.  She then sits on my lap and she eats Nature's Path cereal out of her bowl and I eat out of mine.<br /><br />We have been using Nature's Path for a long time. it tastes healthy and (hopefully) is healthy. I feel good about it. What's more it tastes good to me and my daughter.

review/summary: Great stuff but OVERPRICED here.
review/text: I love this stuff...I eat about a bag a week of it. Healthy and nutritious...Quinoa is a gluten-free complete protein. OVERPRICED, though. I get it at Whole Foods for $6.99. $7.99 at New Seasons (Portland, OR) but they offer a 15% discount for a case, which makes it $6.79 a bag as opposed to $7.15 per bag, case price, on Amazon.<br />Not a huge difference, but what burns me is that Amazon says the regular price is $55.80 a case, which is $9.30 a bag--30% above RETAIL!<br /><br />A while back they were selling this for a discounted price you would expect on Amazon...something like $25 a case. That was a great deal. I should have bought a truckload then.

review/summary: Make sure the big bags are cheaper than the smaller boxes!
review/text: The cereal is great--obviously I think so since I buy these huge quantities of it from Amazon. Just a tip: do not assume that you are saving money by buying the big bags of it. Yes, the quantity is larger and there is less packaging, which would make you think that you are saving money, but do the math: they way they are currently priced on Amazon, it is cheaper to buy the 6-pack of smaller boxes than it is to buy the 6-pack of larger bags--yes, I mean price per ounce, not total price. The pricing is similar in my local food retailer. This may be just fine if you are willing to pay more to save the earth and to have the convenience of not having more cardboard to throw away, but I'm not willing to pay more for this privilege.

review/summary: One of my favorite cereals
review/text: Heritage Flakes are sweet and fresh, without any hint of the bitter rancidness a lot of commercial cereals suffer from. They hold up well in milk and they taste delicious. Full points for the cereal.<br /><br />When you buy them from Amazon, they come in a box, which Amazon then inserts into another box for shipping. Since the second box is only padded on one side - just enough to keep the inner box from sloshing around -  it seems rather a waste of packaging material to me.  But if it's the only way you can get this cereal, it's definitely worth it.

A significant savings over buying smaller grocery store size boxes of it, but still quite a large chunk of cash.  I buy it using the subscribe and save feature which gives you 15% off--then it's not a bad deal.  For the cereal itself, as many have already mentioned, it tastes exceptionally good and it maintains texture and crunchiness longer than any other cereal I've met.  Will be back for more . . .

Otherwise, the price per pound is about the same as Trader Joe's.

It's one of the best tasting cereals I've ever had, and with a banana or berries the sweetness level is perfect. But what is most amazing is that unlike with others, I don't get hungry again in a couple of hours. This keeps me going so well that I sometimes forget about lunch! Highly recommended, even at $7 a bag.

Unlike the sauces normally sold in supermarkets, you do NOT have to add butter to this sauce.  You can add this to your wings straight from the bottle.  MUCH better than anything sold in the supermarkets and the 'original' from Buffalo, NY.  It looks like they increased the cost of shipping on here, I would recommend you look at the anchor bar website, they may have free shipping for the same exact product.

review/text: I just got a big box of these ginger chews and absolutely love them.  On the outside of the box, it says "HARD CANDY" and I was about to just send them right back, since I was looking for a ginger snack with a chewy texture.  But the texture is really just like those square caramels in a clear wrapper, but in a 3/4" diameter tablet shape, and there are nice bits of ginger mixed in.<br /><br />You can chew them (which I prefer), or let them dissolve in your mouth.  These have a very spicy, intense flavor - quite a boost!  I haven't tried them for upset stomach, but I can imagine these would do the trick.  I like to chew a few after dinner, so maybe that's why I haven't had an upset stomach lately!<br /><br />I love the fact that each candy is individually wrapped, so you can toss a few in your bag, stick some in your office drawer, and carry a few in your car.  If you get as addicted to them as I have become, you'll need them all over.

You might want to try a small package first if you are on the fence.  These are great on roadtrips.  The kids love 'em.  The cat even likes to bat the individually wrapped candies around the house.  My horse always knows when I have them in my pocket and will NOT stop doing cute, nosey, horsey things trying to get one from me.<br /><br />They are really strong and seem spicy but they actually work to calm my stomach down.  Not sure why, but they do and I don't mind as I've had issues with ulcers and whatnot. and they actually help me, not make my stomach feel worse.<br /><br />Awesome product if you love ginger, and we do!!  This is about as ginger to the max as you can get.

review/summary: Perfectly Intense, Low(er) Calorie, Not for Ginger Newbies
review/text: If it didn't make me look crazy, this review would have tons of exclamation points.<br /><br />This is my favorite Ginger People product, right behind the apple chews. These circular bits are powerful-they contain more than 3 times the amount of their regular ginger chews (30% versus 8%). If you don't love ginger, don't bother because your mouth will be tingling. In terms of mouthfeel, these pieces are more dense than their other products. They describe it as "caramel-like" and that's pretty accurate. I like that they aren't sticky and therefore don't require the dusted powder on most regular ginger chews that always ended up on my clothes like I was eating powdered donuts or something. And as a final plus, they are lower in calories than the regular chews. Each piece is about 10 calories versus 20 calories. Not a huge deal but take it where you can get it. I guess they ease indigestion (in a sense that they've never made it worse), but I just love the refreshing sense and taste more than any possible health benefits.

I can eat pizza or spaghetti for dinner and not wake up with heartburn anymore!!! So I took the plunge today...bought the 11 pound box. Even if I have heartburn it goes away right after I chew on one of these... my sister uses them for motion sickness and swears by them.

review/summary: Good Candy, Tough Wrapper
review/text: This variety of ginger candy is okay (and the shipping was fast enough...all the mechanics of the transaction were just fine) but doesn't really compare to the original ginger chews from Ginger People.  I'm saving this to take to craft fairs and ordering more ginger chews for me.  :)<br /><br />However, this would be a great substitute if your teeth aren't up to the challenge of the chewy original ginger candy.  Getting the wrappers off probably burns some calories, too.  There's no easy way to get them out of the sealed mylar-type wrapper except to get scissors and cut each one open...kind of takes away the fun of eating a handful while you read, watch television or socialize.  Of course the original chews are in the same kind of wrapper but they're 2-3 times the size of these lozenges and totally worth the effort!
