review/summary: Nice flavor... but 11 servings? Three for me if I am good
review/text: I like the flavor of the Nice! fruit & nut trail mix. The mix contains nuts ( mostly Peanuts and some Cashews) and dried fruit (Raisins, Banana Chips, Pineapple, Cranberries and Papaya). It is crunchy, sweet and chewy and often is just the right thing to calm sweet cravings.<br /><br />For a serving size of 1/4 cup it contains 150 calories<br />The label stats that this bag has 11 servings... but lets face it this is not going to last 11 servings.<br />The entire bag (11 servings) is 1650 calories. For me 1 bag typically lasts 3 servings... that means 550 calories per serving.<br /><br />Serving size 1/4 cup<br />Servings per container (12 oz) 11 servings<br /><br />Nutritional facts:<br />Calories total 150<br />Calories from fat 70<br />Total fat 8g<br />Saturated fat 2g<br />Sodium 60mg<br />Carbohydrates 15g<br />Dietary fiber 2g<br />Sugars 9g<br />Protein 4g<br /><br />I like the taste of this trail mix. However the current price on Amazon (seven plus shipping of six) compares very poorly to the price of this item in Wallgreens stores where it costs 3.99 per bag.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

Having to take along cereal and additional cups/bowls to mix makes these harder to use than just feeding out of a jar. I only took one star off because I realize this isnt an issue for everyone.

review/summary: Best Organic fruit ever!
review/text: My son loves these fruit packets, he can eat 2 at a time! and generally does, which means I need to have quite a few on hand always.  I love that I can order them from Amazon in bulk, so that I am always stocked and the subscribe and save is even that much better!  These are delicious little 4 ounce fruit packets filled with organic fruit and sometimes a vegetable as well.  My son does not have a favorite and will generally eat any flavor hungrily.  Ofcourse fresh fruit is always better, but this is nothing else if not a 2nd close option.  Great for portability and ease of use, my 17 month old can just hold it and eat it by himself.. another plus for Mom's! I highly recommend these they are a great source of fruit to fill up that essential food pyramid we know all too well.

review/summary: Cheese?
review/text: Cheese?  I received a cheese of the month package from my son as an unexpected gift just before Thanksgiving.  Surprising!  He knows I like IPA's and Cab's, but cheese?  Doesn't that mean sipping Chardonnay and wearing turtlenecks?  But on opening the package, we found three generous pieces of cheese with interesting names my wife knew, but I could not pronounce. When we opened them on Thanksgiving, everyone enjoyed tasting them and were impressed with the quality -- uh, including me.  So I learned that fancy cheese really does add to the enjoyment of a gathering and enhances the taste of my other favorites -- those IPA's and Cab's.  I don't know if it was just an accident, but it arrived the night before Thanksgiving -- perfect timing.  And there was a chill-pack in the box which kept the cheese in perfect condition.<br /><br />What a nice gift!  Thanks, Son!

review/text: I was introduced to the ALO drink by a friend of mine. She brought it to work one day and gave me one to try. Looking into the bottle, the first thing you see are big pieces of something floating around, which for the first timer, isn't really appealing. However, I looked past those and decided to try it. The texture was a little different, because of the aloe pieces, but when you start to drink it, it actually is good. This particular flavor is one of my favorites! I love it. I will be drinking this on the sidewalk, and people will stop and ask me what it is because of the "floaties". Another advantage (may be just me), but I have noticed more bathroom urges. Which is a good thing. :) Give it a try.

review/summary: Toffee + Chocolate = Heaven
review/text: This matcha is phenomenal! You taste the sweet, buttery toffee and the rich chocolate, even a hint of nutty goodness. And it really is good with the green base! These flavors are like magic, how did they stuff so many aspects of a tasty treat into matcha? I mean, this isn't simply caramel + nuts + chocolate. It really does have that buttery smoothness and a toastiness that I associate with toffee. It's amazing that this has all the full, delicious aspects of a good piece of toffee. It really brings to mind Heath/Skor bars in a mug!<br /><br />Of course, the grassy sweet gentle matcha base blends perfectly with this and keeps you from feeling too full/heavy after an indulgent latte of this. But... it's not really indulgent at all! The perfect way to curb a sweet tooth without ruining your diet is with a nice dessert matcha, and this is one of my absolute favorites.

review/summary: Toffee & Chocolate & Matcha, oh my!
review/text: I tried it as a latte - and it was still delicious, but I was still searching for the English Toffee. I'm happy to say that I discovered the flavour the best in an iced tea with no milk OR sugar! That was super surprising to me! I usually add sugar to make the matcha sweet like the flavours usually are in their original forms, but this one came out the BEST unsweetened. Who would have thunk?<br /><br />I keep seeing online a "recipe" for iced matcha, or rather, instructions where all you have to do is add the powder to a bottle of water and shake like crazy! Well, I have tried that multiple times and it's gross every time haha. I uncap a bottle, sip a bit, shake some matcha in and shake away (for a loooong time) - but all I end up with is murky green water with clumps. Clumps that hit your teeth and dissolve into a bitter mess in your mouth.<br />THEN I read on a website (of course I can't remember which one) where they added just a half a teaspoon of matcha, and a tiny bit of cold water - the same way you would make hot matcha - to make a matcha paste first and then add more water! So I added my half tablespoon of English Toffee Matcha, about a teaspoon of water - and my shaking was vigorous! It created a smooth paste almost instantly with no lumps (I didn't even need to sift), I filled up my water bottle with the rest of the cold, filtered water. The liquid was emerald green, not lumpy or murky, and tasty! I didn't add sugar or anything else, just sipped away and lo and behold - English toffee flavour and natural sweetness from the matcha, with a bit of vegetal tones and no astringency.<br /><br />I'm pretty happy that I figured out the right way to make iced matcha in a bottle - I'm also happy with my English Toffee matcha. We're on good terms now ;)

review/summary: Just like Toffee!
review/text: When I opened the pouch I was excited because the smell was so amazingly good. I was preparing myself to be let down just in case because I figured this would be a difficult one to get right. I mean I really don't know when I can stop doubting Red Leaf Tea lol they have never let me down to date, so why would they now right? But still, I had to be cautious as I prepared my bowl of yumminess not to get my heart broken for the first time.<br /><br />As I am typing this I look sadly at my glass, as it is not half full or even half empty but it is totally empty and I am beginning to eat the remaining ice because there is still a little remnants of matcha hanging onto the cubes. If I could get my tongue down into the tall glass I would lick the inside of it!<br /><br />Having made my typical matcha latte, cold, with ice, creamer, milk, and the matcha mix I  think I gulped it down in a matter of minutes, and I am being generous, it was probably more like a manner of seconds! Its a wonder I even can recall what it tasted like as it blasted past my taste buds so quickly!<br /><br />It was in fact nutty, buttery, caramlish but with the toffee flavor of correctly burnt sugar flavor, and of course just the right amount of chocolate but not so much to mask the other wonderful flavors! And as always the amazing matcha powder base shines through taking away the guilt of the sweetly sinful, ummm sweetness!<br /><br />So again Red Leaf you delight me! Thank you for all your amazing matcha offerings and keep them coming!

review/summary: Great value and flavor!
review/text: I love toffee so I was super excited to give this matcha a try. I have to say this was a great choice for my first matcha from Red Leaf Tea. You can find more information about this beauty and order some for yourself here: [...]<br /><br />First off, the scent when you open the pouch is of creamy, rich caramel toffee. I was concerned that the color of the matcha would have been muddied a bit with the addition of flavoring, but luckily the matcha is a beautiful, deep green. I love that there are no artificial flavorings added to this tea because the color of matcha is definitely part of my overall experience. I don't have a sifter so I was worried that the matcha might be a bit clumpy, but it was perfectly smooth! After brewing this up without additions, it gives a pretty good froth. The flavor is primarily of lightly sweet toffee, but the matcha is not lost against the flavoring. However, there isn't any edge of bitterness like you usually get with unflavored matcha. If you are new to matcha or don't really enjoy the bitterness it can have, I highly suggest this company and flavor.<br /><br />Although the matcha was good without additions, I wanted this flavor as a dessert replacement. Next up, slightly sweetened matcha latte! I added just a teensy bit of sugar and a splash of milk into my chawan of matcha. Yum! This is pretty amazing! It is just like drinking matcha while eating a big hunk of toffee. This is definitely a great dessert replacement! "Wow!" is the only word that truly describes this flavor accurately. This is my first flavored matcha and it definitely will not be my last.<br /><br />I also want to add that my order was sent out quickly and I received both an email after submitting my order and after it shipped with tracking information. I'm very happy with the service I've received from Red Leaf Tea. I will certainly be ordering from this company again.<br /><br />While this is delicious to drink, I'm already planning how I can use this English Toffee Matcha to bake with. I think that this would be amazing in a buttercream icing and equally good in cupcakes or really any type of baked good. This would also be great incorporated into some whipped cream and used to top fresh fruit or angel food cake.

review/text: I've always been a huge fan of English toffee and English toffee-flavoured drinks. I loved English toffee cappuccinos in my coffee-drinking days and now I'm hooked on Red Leaf's English Toffee Matcha!<br /><br />I opened the bag with great expectations. The actual tea blew those out of the water! The scent was enough to send me running to the kitchen to make myself a cup. It smells like caramel and chocolate. A decadent dessert. I made a cold almond breeze matcha latte and slowly savored every sip. It truly tastes like what it purports to be. English toffee! I was skeptical about the English toffee-match combination, mostly because I couldn't conceive how the bitter, grassy matcha would pair with chocolate and caramel. But I was more than impressed. It tastes like English toffee, with no bitterness or grassiness of matcha. A hit!

review/text: Now, I have to say, I am wildly impressed with Red Leaf Tea. With the sheer amount of matcha I've been getting through this promotion, I was starting to feel like I was taking advantage of their goodwill and resolved to hang up my reviewing hat, saying that I had tried all the flavors I wanted to try. Imagine my pleased surprise when I mentioned this in a review and they responded to let me know they were releasing new flavors soon and encouraging me to keep trying new ones and keep reviewing! I know they read all reviews posted and I've received wonderfully kind responses to my reviews and emails to them. Their customer service is stellar and it makes it so that I want to recommend their teas to everyone I meet (and I do!). And while yes, I have gotten a ton of matcha through this promotion, I've also gained an adoration of matcha that will keep me coming to them long after I really do stop reviewing their product. But by now they know me, and they know my reviews and they're just wonderfully kind to me. When I received my package yesterday, I found a little matcha spoon included with my order! I don't know if it's a promotion I just didn't see, or if it was for me specially, but it certainly made my day!<br /><br />I don't know an awful lot about English toffee, but what I do know, I like. I got this one to try with my wife, in an effort to get her to like matcha. We'll see how it goes!<br /><br />When I opened the package, it smelled a lot like the Caramel Matcha from Red Leaf Tea, which is very promising. I love their Caramel matcha. Brewed up, it still smelled like caramel, but with a hint of chocolate. And that's exactly what it tastes like, caramel mixed together with tasty, tasty chocolate. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this is very, very good. Very sweet too, but not overwhelmingly so. But then again, I like my teas sweet. But when I see pictures of English Toffee, this is what I think it would taste like, so yay! I love that it even tastes like that crunchy caramel....mmm. This would be a very good starter matcha for those who like sweet things, English Toffee especially. I might even win my wife over with this one!

review/summary: Don't expect full flavor
review/text: Since this is organic, they water decaffeinate it.  This means that instead of using high pressure C02 they use water.  This removes some of the flavor from the leaves but allows it to be organic.  C02 is not harmful, but the process is no longer organic.  There are other methods of chemically removing the caffeine, but those are considered a bit risky to longer term health.<br /><br />This tea is okay.  I would not expect the flavor from the English breakfast with caffeine.  If you are interested you should look up how to decaffeinate your own tea with water on Youtube.  You'll understand how the tea gets this way.<br /><br />As someone who has to worry about blood pressure genetically I watch my caffeine intake closely.  If you are a big tea person though stick to the stuff with caffeine and decaf it yourself.

Like other reviewers have reported, it needs an extra scoop compared to other decafs we have tried but once that is dialed in it makes a decent cup.<br />Definitely a good value compared to individual bags.

review/text: My picky friends and I all agree that this is close to the ultimate in chocolate . . .<br /><br />. . . BUT . . .<br /><br />. . . at the current (9 April 2010) tarriff of $7.99 for ONE BAR (plus shipping on orders uder $25), we'll continue buying it at local supermarkets (and even at the store everyone loves to hate) for $2.18 or a bit more; sometimes less on sale.<br /><br />Amazon, I ADORE you -- you often have excellent prices, your web site is the best, and nothing has ever gone awry with anything from you, so I buy lots of food here in addition to DVDs, CDs, techie toys, clothes, garden & kitchen stuff, and, yes, books, but surely you can find a more reasonably-priced source!

review/summary: Tasty alternative to rice cakes
review/text: We have always liked these Australian-made corn crackers (I am from Australia and used to enjoy them there also). They are somewhat like rice cakes, but thinner, and obviously made out of corn. They are about half the thickness of your average rice cake and in my opinion, much tastier. They are great as a snack by themselves, our 3 year old daughter loves them, or with cheese or spreads. As long as you close the bag after use, the pack will keep fresh for a few weeks after opening.

review/summary: My go-to snack item!
review/text: It's tough to find a snack item that is<br />(a) organic<br />(b) low sodium<br />(c) in BPA-free packaging<br />(d) preservative free<br />(e) not sourced in China, and last but not least,<br />(f) tastes great<br /><br />but these are definitely it! (or maybe that should be "these are them" or "this is it"... whatever. LOL)<br /><br />I have always gagged on rice cakes (aka flat styrofoam hockey pucks) but when I first tried these I knew I'd found what I needed for topping with my homemade hummus, dips, spreads, nut butters ... you name it, these work great with it. And also just plain, because the pure corn taste is great all on its own. Obviously I buy them by the case. My only local brick-and-mortar source for these is Whole Foods (which is a 30-minute drive each direction, so not as "local" as I'd like) and the online price is better especially with free shipping.<br /><br />I continue to be extremely impressed with the quality of Australian products, by the way. In addition to these Corn Thins (made in the Sydney area) I also regularly buy hair and skin care products, crystallized ginger, and vanilla syrup -- all made Down Under. The Corn Thins were my first discovered and still the most used of my Aussie faves, however!

review/summary: Non GMO Organic Corn Thins
review/text: These thins are so versatile. I love them with both sweet and salty toppings. A great way to top these is with all natural peanut butter, banana slices, and organic agave nectar. It makes a filling snack. On the opposite spectrum, spread a thin layer of cream cheese across, then top with fresh, organic tomatoes, and spice as desired (you can make it Italian, Mexican, etc). These are delicious plain, dipped into soup, or crumbled onto a salad. I am thrilled there is a gluten free, non GMO food out there that is delicious and flexible. I highly recommend these for everyone, allergies, special food needs, or not. You will not regret it.

review/summary: Good toasted with melted cheese, but EXP date might be too soon
review/text: OK, so it isn't exactly as good as grilled cheese, but melting a slice of cheese on one of these crispy discs in the microwave is close enough for me, plus no need for fattening butter. The "thins" are about a quarter-inch thick (maybe a little less), not too thick and not too thin.  They offer a multitude of options for quick GF meals, perfect for someone like me who typically eats several 1-course small meals throughout the day vs. 3 large multi-course ones.  The taste is very mild, relying on whatever you put on them to add 95% of the flavor.  By the way, they are called Corn Thins, but technically they are made out of "popped corn"; so they are a little puffy, sort of like rice cakes but thinner and crispier.<br />My batch just arrived with an expiration date of October 2010, which is a tight time frame but because these are so versatile, I think I can manage finishing them by then.<br /><br />UPDATE (Feb. 2010) The last two unfinished packages were stale by the end of August.  In spite of the inner foil liners, they didn't make it to the specified EXP date and I ended up throwing those two away.  Because the bulk quantity is so high (6 would make more sense) I'm afraid I won't be buying this again; I just can't finish them in time.

review/text: My darling ten month old son is so severely allergic to MANY things including gluten, dairy, soy, nuts, peas, etc... Because I am nursing him, I have been desperately trying to keep up diet-wise with his restrictions.  When you are used to tasty meals and gourmet cooking, this lifestyle change (by force, I might add) is about trying to trick your brain into thinking cardboard tastes good... ie: rice crackers... yuck!  Oh but my delight in discovering Corn Thins!  I think I heard the hallelujah chorus when I tried my first bite and actually loved it!  It is a fraction in thickness of a rice cracker, far more flavourful and comes in a scrumptious variety of wholesome flavours.  And I can actually feed it to my son who LOVES them!  It is our bread substitute so we enjoy it with Sunbutter and honey or avocado & mango, etc... Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as we have.  Who knew healthy could finally taste so good!

review/summary: Xylitol Plus or Stevia Plus?
review/text: I have been using Xylitol for a year now. I am not Diabetic nor am I overweight. I just simply don't like to consume all that sugar. What makes this product bad is not the Xylitol, Its the Stevia component. The Stevia completely hijacks the sweetener to the point you can't taste anything else, not even your coffee.<br /><br />So it comes down to this, If you enjoy Stevia then buy this product. If you have never tried Stevia and your looking for Xylitol then look somewere else. Or atleast go to your local natural foods store and test run Stevia.<br /><br />I on the other hand have three boxes of this that I can't seem to move as quickly.

review/text: I could not find the mix for the Chappli Kabab here on amazon.com, so I wrote my review for this instead.  I live in a remote area of the wild west Rocky Mountains where Indian or Pakistani cuisine is completely non-existent in the form of a restaurant.  Purchasing a cookbook online, even our grocery stores don't sell the spices needed to create such dishes.<br /><br />I met a Pakistani woman on a flight from LA who introduced me to these Shan mixes.  She said they are very authentic, spicy.  All you need to add is the meat/vegies.  The instructions are printed in English on the back of the box and are easy to follow.  She sent me some and I tried them.  They are delicious.  And yes, SPICY!!!!  I was afraid to use the whole packet of spice for my chappli kabab, so I used 2/3's of it.  Even that much was alomst too spicy.  The flavor was magnificent.

review/text: My family and I have been morel hunters for years.  We live in Iowa not far from the published address for FRESHMORELS.  I was excited when I stumbled on this product and the web site touted it as having "three times as much morel flavor as the actual mushroom".  I ordered one bottle of every type they offer. I prepared the food as advised on their website. The first bottle was awful.  There was not a hint of morel flavor and the oil tasted just this side of rancid.  I tried every single bottle hoping the previous bottles were anomalies.  They were all bad.  Then I noticed that the "ENJOY BY 12/01/12" was actually a little sticker that had been added over the label.  Underneath was something that had been scribbled over with a black marker.  I removed the marker with alcohol and revealed an expiration date in AUGUST 2009. I checked the other bottles...ditto.  An email to Freshmorels produced a response claiming that the original expiration date was a "printing error"...uh huh.

review/text: I am originally from Belarus and I used to cook tons of buckwheat in my live.<br />That buckwheat is something different from my idea of regular buckwheat. The grains are smaller, lighter in color, not toasted enough and when done it has bland scent not the full body aroma I remember. It cooks 2 times faster than original one-about 12 min., rather than 25min. and you need extra care if you want it flaky rather than sticky.<br />Here is some advices if you want have it close to my idea of original buckwheat:<br />1. Toast it in the pan or skillet with some butter over the medium heat for 2-3 min.(better to use a shallow pan than a deep one)<br />2.  Add salt, boiling water (2.2-2.5 parts of water to 1 part of gloats)<br />3. Lower the heat to just simmering and top tightly with the lid and cook until all water get soaked(do not stir-it breaks the grains)<br />4. Put it aside for extra 5 min.

review/summary: Are these polished?
review/text: I am Russian and was looking for the traditional russian buckwheat. These look right at the first glance, but nothing like what I expected when cooked - the kasha comes out almost a mashed potato like consistency, with most of the groats sticking together and tasting nothing like a normal buckwheat kasha. Perhaps the groats are somewhat polished and their skins are partially missing, resulting it faster cooking time and lumping together? I have not tried the Belarussian advice of toasting it for extra 2-3 minutes, but if that does not work, I'll have to throw it all away :-(

review/summary: Kasha As Good As You Cook It!
review/text: Kasha is can be a tricky product to cook and requires an extra step if you want it flaky, not mushy.  Many people, especially in Russian-speaking countries, eat kasha as a hot cereal for breakfast.  In that case you simply cook it 1 part kasha to 2 parts liquid with some butter and it will get to the consistency of thick oatmeal.  To serve it as a side dish say as classic Kasha Varnishkas (Bow tie Noodles), you need to first mix each cup of kasha with a beaten egg and toast it in a dry skillet until grains are all separated and browned. Cook them as you would with 2 parts liquid and whatever seasoning and vegetables you desire for PERFECT kasha.

review/summary: If you tried Russian buckwheat - you won't like this one!
review/text: I am originally from Russia and my husband is from Argentina. Both of us didn't like this brand at all - it didn't get that consistency that Russian buckwheat has.  These groats come out like mashed potato. It is too light color. I tried to roast it - I got it a little brownish but the taste didn't come back. Who has tried buckwheat from Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Russia, Belorussia) would know that buckwheat has nice smell - before you cook it and after. This one smelled strange.<br />After I cooked whole package and we didn't like it - our dogs didn't want to eat it too. I had to add their soft food so they would eat.<br />Probably it makes a big difference how buckwheat was raised and where. Also how it was processed. Something is missing in this one. Still looking for Russian product.<br />By the way, some my friends who tried it the first time liked it a lot. So it could be good for you also if you don't know the best.

review/summary: Stay away, or I wish I had listened to bad reviews.
review/text: This product is very poor quality, it cooks into a hummus-like mass in the first 2 minutes of boiling, while about 10% of the grains end up undercooked by the end of the process. This can only be a result of a wrong processing and/or storing of buckwheat.<br />Buckwheat is supposed to cook as a grain, preserving individual grains by the end of cooking time (like quinoa or rice) and not get mushy.<br />in addition to mushiness and inconsistency (=large variance in how much time different individual grains take to cook), it has a flavor of burnt oil, which, again, means it was not prepared properly.<br />I don't know what to do: I paid $20 just to have to throw away the entire thing that I cooked and to have 3,5 packs of unusable buckwheat sit in my pantry.<br />I am appalled that Amazon would carry such a poor quality product and I urge you to stay away (and maybe head to your local Russian store to get some proper buckwheat).

review/summary: Nantucket Blend - not so fresh
review/text: Maybe it depends where you buy this coffee, but my shipment of 80 Kcups from Amazon was pretty stale, flat and weak.  I've had GM Nantucket Blend elsewhere before and it was delicious, not so with this order.

review/summary: Brown rice that actually tastes good
review/text: I never liked eating brown rice growing up even though my parents tried it for quite some time.  I looked and tried several different brown rice brands before sticking with this brand a few years ago.<br /><br />Some of my friends that brown rice takes a lot longer time to cook.  Well, this brand allows me to cook with white rice setting in a rice cooker.  The only adjustment that I have to do is to use 1.25 cup of water for every cup of rice.  I do like my rice to be separated, so I add 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  With this method, the rice always comes up good and chewy.

review/summary: Very flavorful!
review/text: I do not need to put salt in this rice at all. This is very good quality and it tastes great.  We have been eating White Basmati  rice and were spoiled to it fragrant aroma and delicious taste; so we were skeptical when we were encouraged to eat natural brown rice for health benefits. After cooking this and with the unison approval of my young children we are going to be eating Nishiki Brown Rice for the foreseeable future!  Nice Rice, indeed!
