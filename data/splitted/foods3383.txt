review/text: This is my second order of the Coconut Bubble Tea Powder.  I am constantly searching for new recipes to use it with.  I tried Green tea base, white tea; rice milk.  All tastes good. Since it is such a large quantity, I was not prepared on where or how to store it.  Now, I store it in a large glass jar with a wide top glass canister with tight fitting lid available at Crate and Barrel or Walmart.

review/summary: Great Baby Food, but don't buy it here!!!!!!
review/text: My son loves this oatmeal.  I tried it once and I love it too!!!  The only downside that I can say is that the oatmeal consistency actually varies from one package to another.  My guess is that they have different vendor making it? Sometimes one package contains a thicker oatmeal than another.  Either way, my son loves it and he can't get enough of it.  I tried to copy the flavor to no avail.  He's a devoted fan and will not touch any other oatmeal.<br />While my heart is broken, at $0.98 each from Walmart, it may be easier for me to just let him have his way.  Don't buy this here.... Walmart selection of Sprout is somewhat limited, but it's worth it.  The roasted banana brown rice and rice peach pudding are winners too.<br /><br />The Stage 3, however, is not as good as the stage 2.  I tried to give my son Sprout oatmeal from Stage 3, and he didn't want to go further than the first spoon.  I tried it and I'm in agreement with him.  There is an after taste/smell with Stage 3 Sprout.

review/text: Stash sells cheap tea, but, I really prefer it.  The Bergamot (orange extract) they're using is fantastic with their black tea, which is also quite decent.  If you are a tea snob and you like the taste of moldy orange Bergamot of the "higher end" Earl Greys, then this tea is not for you.

review/summary: Two Middle Age Cats Loved It From the Moment It Hit Their Plate!
review/text: Many times I buy assorted "healthy" cat food for my girls and they look at it, sniff and walk away. They eventually walk back and eat it over time. As soon as they heard me open the bag they rushed over sniffing the air. They quickly went to the bowl and finished it up. Finally settling down for a nice nap, they appeared more satisfied and quiet after this meal. I use to buy this brand long ago from another mail order company but they went out of business. I tried to buy it locally but few carry it and others said they would order it for me. Wysong was off the radar for awhile, but I'm glad I located a good source!

review/summary: Error resolved better than expected
review/text: I am switching Sophie over to Wysong as it is what my dog trainer recommended years ago for my cats and my dog.  "People quality" as she called it.<br /><br />The cost for the cat food is $12 for a four-pound bag locally, so I thought I would shop Amazon to see if it was cheaper.  I found a 16-pound box -- four bags I guess -- for about $8.00.  That seemed too good to be true, but I ordered it.  It shipped, and I noticed on the UPS tracking that the shipping weight was just 4.8 pounds.<br /><br />So I emailed PetFood Direct through Amazon Marketplace to ask for return instructions once I receive it next week, as with shipping this would cost nearly double what I would pay locally.  I explained why, and wished them happy holidays.  I just got an email back.  They apologized for the SKU / description error and said that it is in the process of being corrected, credited my card in full, and told me to keep the bag of food when it arrives.<br /><br />I will absolutely shop this merchant again due to their level of customer service.  Thank you to Susan Ferra Kemp, Team Leader and to PetFood Direct.<br /><br />(oh, and the item is superb for the kitty as well!)

For extra good nutrition, they are delicious with hummus and salsa. There is no downside here. They are also dairy-free.

review/summary: AWESOME!  But darn...
review/text: Warning these are highly addictive chips!  I love the sea salt and the salsa flavors - best gluten free taste and texture I've ever put in my mouth.  I can easily clean out most of a bag in one sitting.  Very healthy snack!  Cons:  there's an awful lot of air in that bag... And they are often broken up a lot, so you have to learn to dip your dip with a spoon, then stick a bunch of broken chips to that.  So delicious, I'm willing to do that.  Here's the other bummer.... If you're addicted, you want to buy in bulk with a goal to save money.  I was shocked at the price here on amazon, in bulk.  $46 for 12 bags (5.5 oz) plus shipping at $10+.... That's $57 total which comes out to $4.73 ish per bag (5.5 oz).  I can get them at a Publix grocery store for $2.89 a bag (5.5 oz) -- that's $1.89 cheaper.  You'd think  "in bulk" combined with amazon could do better than that.

review/summary: Nice snack
review/text: I actually dislike traditional dried fruit (with the exception of craisins and raisins), so I was surprised that I liked these. I tried the apples and pears today and liked them both (although apple was better, for me).  It is similar to space-icecream, in that it melts in your mouth, but I liked that it was a crunchy consistency rather than soft and chewy (that traditional dried fruit has). It almost tricks me into thinking I am eating chips because of the crunch. It has the consistency of the cheese puffs that I usually like snacking on. Since the only ingredient is the fruit, I don't feel guilty eating multiple of these in a day. It has 39 calories and 0 fat (per packet), so it will definitely help keep me from munching on more fatty snacks.

review/text: I think these may be good for baking but not great for snacking. The cool thing about these are that the only ingredient is the fruit. The bad part is that they don't really taste good and they have the consistency of styrofoam. They are not the mostly-dried, soft fruit. These things are super all-the-way dried fruit so when you bite them they pretty much turn to powder. My 2 year old son would snack on them but would make a huge powdery mess all over the house. The apple powder was not that bad but the strawberries make a really tough red stain in any fabric they touch.

review/summary: Pleasant Surprise
review/text: The way the shampoo was packaged was a huge disappointment. I knew something was amiss because I could smell the shampoo scent as if I had the opened bottle in my hand, when in fact it was still in the packaging. So when I removed the tape I was not shocked to find 1/4 of the bottle in the packaging. It was a cremay mess, and i kept thinking by this being a creamy shampoo it will NOT rinse well, you see I wear Sisterlocks and my girlfriend traditional locs.<br /><br />BUT.....once I used the shampoo I was surprised. My girlfriend locs are much thicker than mine so I was concerned about the film and residue that would be left in her hair. So we washed her hair as usual 2 times, and rinsed. We didn't get that squeeky clean feel one would get with a clarifying shampoo but the shampoo rinses very well. Her hair was left with a soft, clean feel to it. Her locs didn't feel weighted down by the shampoo at all, however we noticed if you use too much you will get a feel of "too much". Just remember a dab will do it. Her scalp looked clean and her hair smelled fresh.<br /><br />The bottle says "cleanese to remove product build-up and allow the scalp to breathe" I believe this product did in fact do just that. THe moisture 10 system used includes shea butter, natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm.<br /><br />Once you finish with your wash your hair is ready for the next phase adding the "Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil" fantastic 2 step process. You can just use the shampoo and not the hair oil if you don't need it. I believe this shampoo is great for all types of hair African American as well as European, nappy or straight.<br /><br />Complimentary samples of this product was provided by Amazon Vine for the purpose of this review.<br /><br />Missy

review/text: This shampoo does do what it says...my hair doesn't feel "dried out" a day after using it. However, your hair doesn't "squeak" when you wash it using this shampoo. I was hesitant to try this at first, because some products tend to make my scalp itch. I was pleasantly surprised to find this shampoo does not do that. HOWEVER...when rinsing, my hair still feels "slick"...which I would expect if it was a combination of shampoo AND conditioner, but it isn't. It's just straight shampoo. This is why I gave it only 4 stars instead of five. To me, it just doesn't feel like it "rinses clean". But, then again, it's a good to use a different shampoo once a week to remove build-up, so...this may take care of it if you experience the same problem.

review/summary: All You Need is a Little
review/text: Growing up, I was cursed with very wavy, very thick hair. Finding shampoos that really work well at taming frizz and nourishing the hair itself has always been a struggle. I found the CLEAR line a few weeks ago and was highly impressed with their Damage and Color Repair line. Given that, I'm working my way through their different products to see which one is clearly the best and Ultra Shea Cleanse and Nourish is that shampoo.<br /><br />The scent is reminiscent of a Pina Colada. Coconut is there, but it's not overpowering. I love coconut, but my husband and daughter can't stand that smell and make it very apparent when they can smell it on me. They had no complaints.<br /><br />What's more impressive is that with just a dime-sized amount of shampoo, I had plenty of lather to clean my entire head of hair, and my hair is past my shoulders, so I was amazed. It lathers extremely well, so you can easily get a bottle of shampoo to last. Rinsing the suds away does take a little extra time. We have soft water, so I'm not sure if hard water would make a difference or not.<br /><br />After shampooing, my hair did feel softer than usual. That was a very good sign. Paired with the conditioner (I'm reviewing that separately), I was extremely happy with the results.

review/text: I'm thrilled to see and feel what Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Ultra Shea Cleanse and Nourish Shampoo, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9E2">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>, have done for my hair in a single application. I have been using salon shampoos and conditioners on my hair for ages now, and been really displeased with how my hair has been looking. It's grey, very thick and wiry, and was dry and brittle to the touch, and had totally lost its sheen. One wash with Clear Ultra Shea has changed all that. My hair hasn't felt this soft in years, and it's actually shining!<br /><br />Clear Ultra Shea shampoo is dense and creamy and feels incredibly luxurious as you lather it in. I was trying to find a comparison to what it feels like, but couldn't. It definitely doesn't feel like any shampoo I've ever used before. The aroma is very subtle and quite pleasant, and I like the packaging a lot. The cylinders are sturdy, with tops that press open easily, and the shampoo stands on its feet, and conditioner on its head, so there is no confusion as to what bottle you're reaching for, half blind with no glasses on and water running down your face. I'm going to keep using Clear Ultra Shea, and those salon products will have to go bye bye.

review/summary: Where have you been all my life?!
review/text: I was using Dove's Moisturizing Shampoo/Conditioner. It did a good job with having soft hair, but I was having snow storms of dandruff and lots of hair breakage to a point I pick off ten plus hairs off my when I got out of the shower and throughout the day. Also, with the dandruff, after the owner of my workplace (who can be very picky on appearance, down to one flake of dandruff) walked in and seeing the amount of dandruff on my black uniform, I said "That's it!"<br /><br />I walked into Walmart and looked at the dry scalp/dandruff shampoos. Head and Shoulders somewhat did the job, but my hair gets dry and brittle and did an okay job on the dandruff. I then stumbled upon Clear. I figured I'd give it a shot, even though it was a little pricey for me (The only downfall of this product, but better than getting $25 salon stuff). I got the Shea Cleanse and Nourish so that not only did my scalp feel happy, so did my hair. Good news, I needed shampoo and conditioner anyway. I ran out of the Dove anyway.<br /><br />Went home and used it that night. The results were immediate on the spot. 75% of the flakes were gone, my scalp showed major improvements, and my hair was shiny, smooth, and soft (even though I use the Suave Keratin Serum as well, this made it go from bleh to SWEET ZOMBIE JESUS THAT'S GOOD!). The nice scent of shea was relaxing and nice, and it lasted too. I walked into work the next day (I wash my hair every other day) and a co-worker grabbed me and said "Why do you smell sooooooo good?! I want that!" So, told her it was my new shampoo/conditioner.<br /><br />And as for my black work uniform, I have not had to brush off flakes or pluck ten plus hairs off me!<br /><br />My hair has never felt better. I wash it every other day, and focus on the scalp a wee bit more so that I know it's doing its job. I only use a hair straightener (with a heat protection spray) on the lowest heat setting and my hair still feels and smells amazing. A male friend of mine also has the exact same problem as me and he will be getting some today to help him out (I told him they had a mens line he can look into).<br /><br />Get it! Trust me, you won't be sorry. You want a happy scalp and hair at the same time, get this. I'm not regretting it now. :)

Just last month I switched to three products:<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner,<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil,<br /><br />My hair is dryer now that I am older and the shampoo really does the trick of cleaning without destroying my hair, it cleanses completely to remove product build-up. The conditioner allows me to much more easily run a brush through my hair. Without flattening my hair it reduces the dryness that flat ironing can do and reduces breakage.  It really does lock in moisture and provide long lasting nourishment.  The Therapy works best on wet hair, it gives deep, non-greasy nourishment to my hair and lends a healthy looking shine.  I can wash, condition and therapy my hair Monday. Tuesday I can wet my hair put the therapy in and it looks brand new.<br /><br />The real test was going to my salon and my stylist of 8 years noticed the difference in softness. I love the blend of shea, vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm. It really works for me. I did find the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair.<br /><br />KEEPER!

review/summary: It's Wonderful
review/text: I mean I was really excited to use this. I don't actually wash my hair myself-i'm no good at it. So I took both the shampoo and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9E2">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>to my salon and I really felt the difference. I mean it's pretty refreshing. and the end result was really nice, after drying and styling she commented on how nice and healthy my hair was. My stylist has been doing my hair since I was really young and she's never said that before. I generally owe it to her but I think I have this to thank for that as well. I'm looking forward to seeing more results from this in the future like if it helps reduce breakage like it says - I hope so. And being that I recently had a cut I'm looking forward to see how long it's going to grow.

review/summary: PLEASANT BUT NOT OVERPOWERING
review/text: Clear Scalp and hair Beauty Ultra Shea cleanse and nourish shampoo is an effective product. It has a subtle fragrance and is not overpowering. It gives a sensation of luxury in its smooth application. This can be truly helpful for fine and dry hair. Having clean hair with enhanced body is a true advantage. Even the shape of the container is appealing. You will find this product pleasing and not that it does the job. Try it today.

review/summary: Works well as a combo or alone
review/text: Used in conjunction with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9E2">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>, this shampoo is good stuff. One thing I like so much about it is the shea butter smell, which makes me think I'm vacationing somewhere exotic. But the more important positive point is that it leaves my hair feeling full and clean. It also apparently nourishes and moisturizes your scalp and helps it breathe. I use hair gel on a regular basis, and apprently this shampoo cleans thoroughly enough to remove product you put in your hair, which I like.<br /><br />The bottle is long and slender and has a convenient pop-up cap that's easy to open and close. I like how the cap end of the bottle is the flat portion that you place down; all the shampoo in the bottle builds toward that end, so you'll never have to hit the back of the bottle to squeeze shampoo out.

review/text: The third in the series of hair care products by this company that I've reviewed.<br /><br />this is another woman's product and like the last one is exceptional.  Does the job and leaves the hair pretty nice.  No complaints from any member of the family.<br /><br />So far the general conciseness is the products for women are good to exceptional and the products for men are Ok.  This one did not get the rave review from my wife as the last one, but it hasn't gotten the complaints from my son either.<br /><br />I'd say it's worth the bucks.  Give it a shot

review/summary: Just what my dry hair needs!!
review/text: The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse and Nourish Shampoo Gave my hair a clean and airy lift and that's rare because I have thick, kinky, and very dry hair. The Shea butter that is in this shampoo and also in the conditioner gave my hair a much needed sheen and also moisturized my scalp without weighing it down too much. I am so excited about this product and I wish it was marketed to African-American women (It's great for all hair types) as well because this product and others in this line of products provides the necessary moisture that chemicals, braids, and weaves have been stripped from our hair and these products will put your hair right back where it needs to be. The bottle design is perfect if you have a small amount of space in your shower this will fit in any tight space nicely. I like to think of this shampoo as a miracle in a bottle that is very affordable and I love it.

review/text: This shampoo has a silky, smooth texture and a clean, fresh smell. However.<br /><br />After about a half dozen washes, my scalp started to itch like crazy. No shampoo has ever done that to me before. After reading the other amazon.com reviews I notice at least one other user had skin problems with this shampoo. Fair warning: it's not for everyone.

review/summary: Leaves filmy residue behind
review/text: I was excited to try out a new shampoo, especially one that is chocked full of Shea and other healthy oils for your hair. I usually don't fall for the hype when a shampoo says "for relaxed and natural hair" but I'm willing to give things a go at least once. When I opened the box, the product had leaked all over the bag but I was able to salvage a good amount of the shampoo. It smells great, it isn't overpowering but nice and subtle. As I began to use the product I was happy that the consistency was nice and thick, perfect for my thick and natural (african american hair) and it foamed up nicely as I worked it throughout my scalp.<br /><br />When I went to wash it out is when the love affair ended, my hair was left feeling like it wasn't clean and I had this nasty residue left on my hair. It felt like I needed to rewash my hair with a different shampoo. My hair didn't feel softer or moisturized, it felt weighed down and lifeless. My curls were frizzy and dull. So I flipped over to the ingredient side and i realized this shampoo has quite a bit of ingredients, including silicones, that have no business being on my hair.  This is being shoved in the back of the cabinet for days when I run out of my regular shampoo.

review/text: This shampoo did seem to plump up my straight, thin hair more than other brands. But we found it particularly effective on the dry, corkscrew hair of my two children leaving them with fluffy, softer hair. And we all love the shea butter aroma. Bottom line: at this price you feel like you've had a salon wash in your own home.

review/text: I'm completely satisfied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> because it does what the advertising says: makes my hair softer, shinier, well-nourished and better moisturized... All that and it smells good too!<br /><br />The one complaint I have is the same as another reviewer: When I opened the manila envelope it arrived in, shampoo dribbled out onto my hands. At first I thought the shampoo container had exploded, but it actually leaked through the lid. Since the lid wasn't secure, I had to funnel it into another shampoo bottle in order to use it. That's nothing against the product; rather it's against the packager, so this product still deserves five stars, in my opinion.<br /><br />Review by Betty Dravis, June 20, 2012<br />Author of award-winning "1106 Grand Boulevard"

review/summary: Very Nice Shampoo
review/text: This is a thick shampoo that lathers well and has a good scent that is not too strong. I normally only use non-sulfate shampoos, but this shampoo was pretty moisturizing and left my hair soft. I have long, thick wavy hair that gets frizzy and dry easily. I sometimes use coconut oil to keep my hair in an up-do during the day and this shampoo washes it out with no problems. I would still alternate this shampoo with a non-sulfate one since I wash my hair daily, but overall it's a good shampoo. It comes in one of those nice flat type bottles that you can turn upside down when the amount gets low.<br /><br />One complaint about the packaging - It arrived in an envelope and the shampoo had exploded out. The bottle was wrapped in plastic, so it was easy to unwrap and clean with a towel, but I hope that customers ordering this product receive it with better packaging.

review/text: I really like this shampoo!  I have psoriasis on my scalp and usually use shampoos that dry out my hair quite a bit.  I do have an oily scalp and was afraid that the moisturizing aspect of the shampoo would just make me a greasy mess, I don't usually buy moisturizing shampoo or conditioner (when I buy regular shampoos for when my psoriasis is calm).<br />The shampoo combined with the conditioner would surely make me greasy, right?  Nope!  My hair is soft, nice and shiny.  I wash my hair every other day and didn't have any problems with needing to wash between my regular washings.  I'm happy with this, it made my hair soft but not greasy and kept any flakes at bay.  Definitely good stuff for me and hopefully for you, too!

review/summary: Good inexpensive shampoo
review/text: There's a lot to recommend about this product...it holds its own next to brands costing much more, while providing results that are good enough for all but the most severely damaged hair and scalp. Given the large size, it works out to be a terrific bargain on a cost per use basis.<br /><br />Only complaint is that the shipper packaged the product in a fairly thin envelope, and by the time it reached me, the bottle was cracked near the top. About half leaked out when I opened the envelope, and even after cleaning it off, it still seemed to be oozing from the sides of the bottle. Only got to use it a few days as a result, but I definitely liked what I saw.

review/summary: Salon Quality
review/text: I was impressed with this shampoo.  It has a nice mild scent, not overpowering at all.  It works just as well if not better than many of the top salon products that I've used since 1973 when I became a hair stylist and I've tried almost all the major salon quality brands.  I have curly, dry colored hair.  I didn't think my hair felt stripped at all like one of the reviewers said, or coated.  One person gave the shampoo a poor review because it didn't cure her dandruff and burned her eye.  Plain water will burn your eye not to mention any other shampoo or soap and it's not a dandruff shampoo.<br /><br />My scalp and hair feel as good if not better than any of the major salon brands that I've used over the years.  My guy friend uses it and he has fine thin hair.  It works just fine for him to.<br />  I really like the shampoo and have just ordered the conditioner to try too.

review/summary: Gentle On My Scalp
review/text: I have oily hair and have been told to use shampoo for dry hair so as to reach a medium.  In other words, use a shampoo for the opposite hair type you have.  I found that interesting and logical sounding and I've tried it, but the bottom line is that gentle shampoos for oily hair tend to work well for me.<br /><br />I did not know when I got this that the gold bottles in the CLEAR SCALP line were for ethnic hair.  I discovered that this shampoo works well on ANY hair and acts as a softening agent. In fact, I think it would work well for just about anybody's hair.<br /><br />Enter this Godsend of a product.  I JUMPED at the chance to order this!  CLEAR SCALP is a very reasonably priced product and it was very gentle on my scalp and hair.  It made my hair feel nice and soft and it has a pleasant aroma.  I love the scent of coconut and almond and my nose loved this shampoo just as much as my scalp and hair did.  Your hair stays fresh and moist while you wash and rinse and will treat your head gently.

review/summary: An inexpensive alternative to prescription shampoos!
review/text: Lately I have been suffering from dry scalp and have purchased several expensive shampoos, including some prescribed by my dermatologist, to remedy it. While I would not dare compare this product to some of those, I did find that this one was an inexpensive alternative. What I liked about this product.....while I have found that some of the other "dry scalp" products leave your hair feeling a bit dry, leaving you with the need to lock in moisture, this one did leave your hair feeling soft. This product was also moisturizing, with a pleasant smell. Although when you are lathering with it, it smells tropically...like coconuts with a hint of almond, once rinsed, I really didn't notice a strong lingering odor.  This shampoo moisturizes your hair while nourishing it, leaving your hair feeling clean and healthy. The packaging is attractive and fits nicely in a corner of the shower (or bath). The bottle has a tall with a simple, slender design.  And finally, it is affordable. Overall, I give this product a 4.

review/text: This shampoo smells good, lathers nicely, and rinses well with no residue, BUT it left my hair feeling like straw and almost crunchy. This was immediately after rinsing it out of my hair, before applying conditioner. My hair felt so raw and rough. I did not like it at all. Heaps of conditioner were needed for it to feel smooth again. It was still hard to detangle even after the conditioner and I always comb my hair while in the shower with conditioner in it too. It may work well for someone out there, but definitely not me.

review/text: My husband and I both used this shampoo for a 2-week period in order to give it time to "work". The shampoo did nothing for my hair. It feels like a light conditioner, and leaves my hair feeling heavy and drab. I am giving it 3 stars because I think it has potential of working on a different kind of hair (I have very fine, straight hair), and it has a non-offensive scent.

review/summary: Rich and soothing!
review/text: I have been impressed with this shampoo in terms of helping relieve my dry scalp and hair. Anyone with this problem knows full well how frustrating it can be--and if your like me you've most likely tried a lot of different shampoos which claim to help only to be disappointed. This shampoo has such a luxurious feel to it and I love the scent of Shea butter (I note some others don't agree). I use this shampoo 2 to 3 times a week and have truly noted my hair appears a lot less dry and brittle--more importantly others have as well. This comes at the expense of less body though which is the only reason I don't use it every day. This may be an issue (only) for those with thin, fine hair like mine. The good news is this it's a shampoo you need to use daily to get good results. I will defiantly be getting another bottle when this runs out.

review/summary: excellent Shampoo for soft but manageable hair
review/text: This is a great shampoo.  Not only does it clean my hair nicely, but it leaves just the right amount of a very pleasant scent.  I am middle aged, and my hair is getting drier, and from the first use, this has left my hair softer.  I don't have dandruff, but my scalp is dry and will itch after using some shampoos, not so with this one.  One of the benefits I found it that it is a bit richer than some other brands, and being less watery, you can get results with a very small amount so that the bottle lasts much longer.  Since I wash my hair every day, I only use conditioner every other time, and that routine is working well for me.  This product reminds me of a salon quality shampoo at an affordable price.

Hair seemed slightly less prone to frizz especially in the high Florida humidity. Easy to open cap is a nice touch and unlike similar items, this bottle didn't leak. Also, I strongly preferred this fragrance over the other line.<br /><br />All in all, a decent product with decent results for a decent price. Nothing to get overly excited by but all in all, not a bad product whatsoever.

review/summary: Love Clear, but "total care" better
review/text: I have used the "total care" from Clear and LOVED it. Made my hair silky, manageable and smooth. Did not leave my hair greasy or flaky. I love the total care and will go back to it. Love it better than professional lines that I have used in the past.<br />Now to talk about Shea Cleanse. I love the smell, I feel like I am on a tropical holiday (reminds me of tanning lotion). It seems as though it will work as well as the total care. But I only got the shampoo and using Pantene conditioner with it. I feel as though I have gone back to my old products by using this combo (the flaky scalp came back). I would hate to rate it low, because the trust I gained by using Total Care makes me feel as if the Ultra Shea could be as good if I used the conditioner along with it. I find is that the "gold" bottles are hard to find at stores. Because of Vine sometimes releasing products to us sooner, this may change as retailers carry more of the line. I am only saying this because I used the 2 different products together. The outcome might (and probably would have) been better if I had both the shampoo and conditioner. I have found the Total care, but no gold bottles. So that alone, and my overall satisifaction with the total care makes me want to stick with it. I totally recommend this line. Espcially since I have long thick hair. I think It all depends on your hair style. Oh, and the price is great too!

I'm not sure how to explain it, but the scent seems a little chemical to me. It reminds me of a very faint version of the way your hair smells after a perm.<br /><br />This product isn't so bad that I won't eventually finish the bottle, but it's not something I plan on purchasing in the future.

review/summary: Requires lots of extra rinsing, but works quite well
review/text: I have salt and pepper middle aged hair, and it always feels a little stiff. Also, my scalp tends to crack and bleed if I wash my hair as often as I think it needs. This shampoo made a big difference. My hair is much softer, and even better, my scalp isn't as prone to cracking. I like the smell very much, although if you don't like coconut and vanilla, that may be an issue for you.<br /><br />The one drawback to it is that it takes a lot of time to rinse out thoroughly. It also doesn't rinse well with cool water. This means I have to take longer showers, which I do find to be a noticeable drawback. Still, on the whole, I like it and will most likely continue using it.

The scent, such as it is, is not very long lasting.  The shampoo seemed to do a good job of cleaning my hair.<br /><br />After using it, I didn't notice any particular change in my hair.  It didn't seem stronger or shinier.  It's possible that I could see improvements with repeated use, but I've used other shampoos that give a fantastic result with the first wash.<br /><br />It simply seems to be a fine, basic shampoo and seems mild enough for everyday use.

review/summary: Has a funky smell
review/text: I found this shampoo to be okay but not anything I would buy again without some improvement. It had a nice lather to it and washed out of my hair easily, leaving it feeling clean but not squeaky. What I really didn't like about it was the smell. To me the odor was similar to play-doh, which is not a pleasant scent in my book. It would need to be unscented or lightly scented with a more tenable smell before I would use it again.

review/summary: Good Clarifying Shampoo . . . .
review/text: The first time I used this shampoo, I was really surprised how my hair felt when I rinsed it out.  It rinsed out really clean, unlike the Aussie I had been using for two weeks, which leaves a coating on my hair.  I think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> makes a good clarifying shampoo.  Also, my hair did look better the first few times I used it.  (I wash my hair every night.)  But then, the shampoo seemed little different than the others I used, and my hair didn't look any different.  Thus, I just started alternating it with my other shampoos--<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F51PWG">Aussie Moist Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GQ6GLK">Garnier Shampoo Daily Care, 13 Fluid Ounce</a>.  Unlike those two, the Clear Scalp does have a slight perfume smell, but it's not a strong scent and it doesn't linger.  Good for those of us hyper-sensitive to perfume scents.

review/summary: Good for hair, great for scalp.
review/text: Were you to glimpse my hairline, I think it is safe to say you would not find me a likely candidate to review shampoo for Amazon.  There is about as much scalp as hair, and what hair I do have is kept Army-short.  Still, despite being follicularly challenged, I can endorse this product for two reasons.<br /><br />Reason #1 is right there is the title "SCALP and hair".  I've tried a ridiculous number of hair products, yet I always seem to be dealing with dry scalp.  This product is literally the best I have yet found at leaving the scalp moist without feeling oily. This is true even when using it after swimming, which has always tended to bring out the worst in dryness for me.<br /><br />Reason #2 is that I sought out a second opinion.  My wife, who has long and beautiful hair.  She also has a stable of hair-care products that I find bewildering in its extent and price range.  She pronounced this to be a very good product, and would use it "if it's not too expensive".  Having no idea what would be "too expensive", I clarified that this would be about one order of magnitude greater than the current price.  In other words, this is a good deal.<br /><br />So there you go.  Ringing endorsements on both the scalp and the hair aspects of this shampoo.<br /><br />5 stars.

review/text: My hair is thin, and most shampoos leave my hair feeling dry and stringy. The Clear Scalp Ultra Shea shampoo really cleans without drying my hair out. After rinsing my hair, it no longer feels dry and stringy. I use it in combination with the Ultra Shea conditioner, and my hair feels really good. My wife uses both the shampoo and conditioner and also likes them. My one complaint is that it does not rinse off easily. I have to rinse a lot to get it out of my hair, and my hair is short. While I don't like to use the same shampoo very often, this is one that I will use a lot. My wife and I both love how it smells, too. Try it, I think you'll like it.

review/text: I tried this shampoo along with the conditioner of the same kind and found them to be very heavy for my curly hair. It also made my hair look lifeless, which was pretty strange because my hair did feel very soft to the touch. It is a pearly creamy liquid and smells wonderful, I was hoping to be able to use it since it did make my hair feel soft when washing it, but cant explain why the end result was so bland. Anyway, I have a feeling that it is not for curly hair.

review/text: My hair is very dry and my scalp is very prone to dandruff. Usually without an extensive dandruff treatment that leaves my hair really really dry, my dandruff never goes away. Washing it will sometimes make it better for a day or two, but that's about it.<br /><br />This is first shampoo I've tried that doesn't dry my hair out AND gets rid of dandruff. I usually wash my hair every 7 to 10 days. I haven't had a dandruff problem between shampoos since I've been using it, which has been about a month. It feels good on my scalp, leaves my hair soft, and it smells good, too. ^_^<br /><br />I think is probably best for anyone with dandruff or a problem with excess oil or product buildup on the scalp.<br /><br />The conditioner that goes along with this is equally impressive.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I was a bit nervous about sampling this shampoo as I have been using the same cheap shampoo for years since it doesn't upset my allergies and it got my hair clean which is what shampoo is supposed to do isn't it? So this was my first experience with a better bran shampoo and I have been thrilled. The first day I used it, I noticed first of all that while scented it was with a very mild scent which shouldn't be bothersome to anyone. The next thing that came up was driving my husband into the hospital due to a heart problem. As wives tend to do when they are waiting through the ER and finally admission routines, you rub your face and hair wondering how bad this was all going to be. Every time I touched my hair, I was amazed at how soft and silky it felt and then I remembered, "Oh yeah, new shampoo". Then touching my hair calmed me down. Thankfully hubby is home now and feeling much better and as I continue with the use of this shampoo I find it doesn't leave my hair greasy or limp like some shampoos with conditioner tend to do. I really like it and I'm glad I was given a very big bottle to try it out since it will last me awhile!

review/summary: I'm pleasantly surprised!
review/text: Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo is a nice shampoo.  I've got very, very dry and frizzy hair, so I usually avoid products with sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate.  This shampoo has sodium laureth sulfate, but when I used it with its accompanying Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, my hair emerged silky (though still frizzy since the beauty industry has yet to invent a flat iron in a bottle).<br /><br />I usually use $20 per bottle shampoo and matching conditioner from my local salon in attempts to make my hair behave.  I'm not going to stop using those in favor of this more economical shampoo due to the presence of sodium laureth sulfate.  But I'm going to add this one in about once a month for a little variety and as a way to stretch my expensive shampoo out.  Every little bit helps in budgeting!<br /><br />A few bonuses: this product smells fantastic and the bottle design that dispenses shampoo from the bottom is terrific!

review/summary: Hair Felt Good
review/text: I am not a scientist. Therefore I don't know how to speak about "moisture lock" (is that even possible?) or PEG-9M, or "Methylisothiozolinone." I do feel favorably toward shea butter and Sweet Almond Oil." The list of ingredients on the label is two inches long. It has more sunflower seed oil than it has coconut oil. It doesn't appear to have dye in it.<br /><br />As an older woman with "fine" hair I find Clear does a good job for me and smells good. The shampoo is creamy and makes my hair super-soft. This means there isn't as much "movement" of my hair as is normal and sometimes that's good. Since I do worry about product build up, I have always switched off shampoos, never using just one brand. This shampoo works well with that schedule. I've used Clear for almost a month now and have had no problems with it.

review/summary: Nice shampoo, nice price
review/text: I have dry, fine, slightly wavy, shoulder length hair.  It can tend to get a little bit fly-away if I don't use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  This shampoo is working just fine for me, and at around five bucks, it's a good value.<br /><br />The texture of the shampoo took a little getting used to.  It's creamy and thick, almost lotion-y.  It does lather up nicely, but it's a denser lather most shampoos.  From the feel, I was concerned that it wouldn't clean as well, but it does a good job.  My hair comes out clean, soft, and shiny.<br /><br />I notice a bit of residue with this shampoo, but that's pretty common with moisturizing shampoos.  I use a clarifying shampoo (like Neutrogena) a few times a month to remove residue.

review/summary: Excellant Shampoo
review/text: I am no expert when it comes to scalp and hair treatment as it has always been my policy to looks for the item that's on sale. When I got an opportunity to get a bottle of the Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy shampoo I found I  had two very interested "clients", my spouse and my granddaughter. I ordered the Clear on the Vine program and once it arrived both wanted to be the first to try.<br /><br />My granddaughter used the shampoo first and the results were amazing. The end result was that her hair looked fantastic so I asked her what she did and nothing more than a single wash and her hair , according to my spouse, looked the healthiest it has even looked in her 25 years. It was  vibrant and silkily and no longer dry and brittle feeling. She is a young girl thus there was no concern for the graying. My granddaughter said her hair was the softest she has ever had.<br /><br />She said that the shampoo is a heavy dense mixture that feels rather good when applying especially when comparing it to previously used shampoos, which were rather "watery". She said the smell is nice and certainly not too strong.<br /><br />The shampoo came in a 12.7 oz package, which was found to be perfect for leaving in the shower. The packaging is nice and heavy with an excellent top for dispensing. It sits easily in the shower basket or will set on the edge of the tub without falling over.<br /><br />After one washing that may be far too early to really test a product so a couple of days later I ask her to repeat the process. Her hair really did not need shampooing after only two days however she accommodated me by starting all over again. The end result was equally as good as her first shampoo and I have one girl that is really excited about the product. She advises the shampoo goes on cleanly and there is no burning or tingling and the aroma is still  non noticeable.<br /><br />Now she has convinced her grandfather to use the shampoo and that I will do. The results have been great however I must be honest as I don't; have all that much hair. What I do have, ended up soft and fluffy.<br /><br />About the price. This shampoo is not priced any higher than any of the leading brands one can buy at the drug store or the big box stores.

review/summary: It dispelled my doubts!
review/text: To be honest, I was a little nervous about using a shampoo with "shea" on the label since I could only think of shea butter as a heavy-duty moisturizer, but I decided to give this product a shot.  And then when I saw that the shampoo looked creamy, like a conditioner instead of a shampoo, I feared flat, oily hair.  My worries were needless -- this is an excellent product that does not leave that feared residue on my hair.<br /><br />Because I read several years ago that your hair depends mostly on the last product used on it, I tried this shampoo both with and without conditioner (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner</a>) to gauge its results.  After using the shampoo, my hair feel clean and tight.  I expected that blow-drying would result in unmanageable hair that would catch on my styling brush.  Nope.  My hair looked healthier and shinier than it does with my regular shampoo.  It had a clean look without the flyaways.  The scent is light and pleasant.<br /><br />To give some context to my experience:  I have fine hair, although I have a lot of hair which makes it look thick.  I find it difficult to find a balance that calms the static and/or frizz in the fine hair without weighing everything down.  This shampoo is one of the few I've tried that accomplishes that.  Note: my hair is not color-treated or damaged.  With the conditioner, the results were even better, mostly because my hair took better to styling.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

review/text: Mrs. JS says:<br /><br />I have two main requirements for shampoo: lather well, and leave my hair clean with no residue. I also always hope for a shampoo that will calm my somewhat-frizzy curls into softness.<br /><br />While this shampoo was outstanding for the lather (really does a nice job there), it did leave a perceptible residue buildup in my hair after a few shampoos. (I do not use a conditioner.) I also didn't notice any impact on making my hair more manageable or softer looking, sadly.<br /><br />It has a coconut-y smell (maybe that's the shea?), and it does leave my skin nice and soft (I tend to use shampoo as a body wash as well), but since that's not enough I won't be running out to buy more.<br /><br />While Mr. JS says: as a guy, I review from a solid position of ignorant indifference. I say this shampoo feels good and makes nice lather. On second and third day not so much squeekiness from my hair; is that a residue thing? Maybe that's the "nourish" part. But it smells nice.

When I rinse this shampoo out of my hair, my hair still feels coated with it a bit which I guess is how it makes your hair shiny and retains moisture.<br /><br />If your hair is exceptionally dry, this might be worth a try.

review/text: This is a very nice shampoo that appears to work at cleaning hair without any irritation or adverse reactions.  My only complaint is that there is no verbage anywhere on the bottle to advise whether or not this product would be suitable for color-treated hair.  And while I understand that the ingredients are nutritional and balanced for most hair types, I still would have been more comfortable knowing that my color would not be compromised.  So I had my husband use it for 2 weeks.  He was extremely happy with the results and appreciated that there was no heavy perfumed scent to deal with.<br /><br />Update:  August 20, 2012<br /><br />I decided to investigate and found my local Wal-Mart sells the Clear Shampoo color treated/damaged hair version (lavender colored bottle).  I have been using it for about 7 days and am very, very happy with the results.  In fact, it is so rich and creamy, that I haven't had a need to use a conditioner afterwords.  I just put on a little Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum and I am good to go.

review/summary: Works great, nice scent - label is a little misleading
review/text: The shampoo does a great job and the scent is not too strong - although it does linger. You can smell it hours later if you rub your fingers through your hair. The label is a little misleading - the beneficial effects are if you use the conditioner. It's like selling a bike and stating you'll set records. IF you use the optional shift, brakes and seat. So, as a shampoo - great. The other benefits? Nope.

review/summary: Thick, decent smelling shampoo
review/text: I don't ask for much from a shampoo. Clean my hair. Check. Don't smell too strong. Check. The downside is that it is a very thick shampoo like a conditioner, so it doesn't lather very well and it takes more rinsing to get it all out.<br /><br />The cap is really a poor design. When I opened the box from Amazon, the bottle was open. The bottle, packing, and box were covered in shampoo, because light pressure on the top of the bottle opens it. That would probably be fine if you buying this from a store, but it is not good for being shipped.

review/text: There isn't much to say, so I will keep it simple. This is a really good shampoo, leaves my hair feeling very clean and detangles my hair. It smells great<br />and feels very silky. I have used it about 4 different times now, and I have enjoyed it. I have natural, course hair and it does help to soften my hair. I approve.

review/text: This shampoo has a slightly sweet, but pleasant scent. It lathers well and leaves my hair soft and silky. However, after using it for several weeks, I noticed a build-up on my hair. I recommend using a clarifying shampoo about once a week to remove the build-up.<br /><br />By the way, I am the wife of your Vine participant.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I liked this shampoo quite a bit, although please note this review is only after one use. I am not able to agree with the build left behind after once use, but did not experience that so far. I did not love the smell, but I liked it better after smelling it on my hair. I have thick semi-long hair, and I felt it did as good a job at cleaning it as any other comparable shampoo for this price range (like Pantene). I did not think it was the best shampoo I have ever used, but it was as good as I have bought at the grocery store in awhile. Pretty decent shampoo that cleanses well and feels good in the hand and on the scalp, though I would balk at paying almost five dollars for this in the store or on Amazon.

review/summary: Yay for Shea!
review/text: I love the aroma of shea, so I knew going in that I was likely to enjoy the Ultra Shea Cleanse and Nourish Shampoo.  I have a long mane of fine and frizzy hair that is a pain to wash, a pain to comb out and usually requires a quarter of a bottle of shampoo simply to work up a lather.  With this shampoo, a quarter sized amount of creamy shampoo (not gloppy or watery) sufficed for the entire mass of hair, quickly working up a lather.  Being a mom on the go, it's been a while since I considered washing my hair anything other than something to get over with as quickly and with as  little soap as possible (to avoid drying out my skin and hair).  This shampoo turns showering back into a bit of a luxury.  I actually enjoy lathering up my hair, and my skin and scalp do not become dried out or itchy from the product.<br /><br />My budget really isn't up to affording salon level hair care, so having something this good for a reasonable price is a definite plus.  My hair has seen definite improvement, from the shampoo alone (I have to see about getting some conditioner in the same line).  Normally, combing out the tangles from my hair after a shower takes a good fifteen minutes of frustration, pain and endless snarls.  My hair tends to feel sticky and wraps around the brush or comb until I have to pull hair out of my head to free it.  Not so with this shampoo.  My combing out time was cut in half and while I did have a few snarls in my middle-of-the-back length hair, they were minor ones that came right out with a few tugs of the comb.  My hair is less frizzy, has more shine and feels a lot less dried out than it does when I've used other shampoo.  The containers are also well thought out.  They stand easily on the tub corners, or in the shower baskets.  The pop out dispenser means I can flip up the lid and flip it down again with no worries the pop up will snap off and no extra mess.  Containers are easy to handle and visually appealing.<br /><br />Definitely will be looking for this one in the future! It's a winner!<br />^_^ Shanshad

review/summary: Mmmmm.....Nice!
review/text: This is a nice shampoo that lathers well using only a small amount, seems to cleanse acceptably and moisturize "mature" hair fairly well (I still need conditioner, though). It has a very minimal, pleasant fragrance I can't put my finger on to describe, which does not linger. Overall a pretty good product, but if you are looking for a sulfate free shampoo, this is not it. It does contain sodium laurel sulfate. I'm not wowed by it, but it does the job admirably for the price point.

review/summary: AMAZING.  My new favorite.
review/text: About my hair:  Long (middle of back), naturally straight, never been colored or treated in any way.<br /><br />I have awesome hair.  It bleaches itself to a nice dark golden light brown during the summer with great highlights.  I'm lucky and get complimented often on it.  That being said, the most I ever do to it is add in layers or have it trimmed.  I rarely blow dry it.  I shampoo/condition it almost daily (gasp!).<br /><br />My favorite shampoo is Infusium 23, but a couple years ago they changed the scent/formula and it hasn't been great since.<br /><br />Enter Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo (& conditioner).<br /><br />It smells amazing.  My first thought was "warm summer beach day".  Light vanilla mingling with coconut and perhaps a bit floral.  Its intoxicating and I absolutely love it.<br /><br />A little bit goes a long way and it works into a great thick lather.<br /><br />Rinse, and it doesn't even suggest you'll need to repeat - because you probably won't.<br /><br />My hair is left feeling clean, soft, shiny and easily manageable.  Did I mention how great the smell is?  My husband loves it.<br /><br />I use it with the conditioner and I could not be happier.  Definitely will be my new go-to shampoo and conditioner combo.

review/text: Received this product from Amazon Vine.  I have short hair that I guess is "normal" as opposed to dry or oily.  I thought the texture of this shampoo was very thick, so thick that I thought I had grabbed the conditioner instead of the shampoo.  It felt a little greasy to me, and took a lot longer to rinse out of my hair than my daily shampoo.  This shampoo smells good and it's probably a good shampoo for certain hair types.

review/summary: Simply Amazing
review/text: For years, I have been battling with my hair. Too dry. Flakes that I could never get to go away. I have tried so many different products trying to get these issues under control. For the most part, other products seemed to help for a few days, a week or two if I was lucky. Then, sadly, my issues would pop up again.<br /><br />When I first saw the commerical for Clean, I knew that it may be different than all the other products I have tried before. Claiming to work at the scalp then down the hair instead of the other way around. Upon first use, I noticed how light the product was. It didn't feel heavy or feel like it was still in my hair after rinsing. Clean promises to change your hair after 7 days. Mine took two. The first day, I noticed how much softer my hair was. By the second, my flakes were all but gone. I use this product every day and I am still amazed with the results. Something that I have been battling for so long to be gone like that. Clean is a product that I have been recommending to all my friends and family. And I could not be happier with it.

We both found that after washing with the shampoo, our hair had a lot more body and shine and was easier to manage.

This Ultra Shea shampoo works wonders on it.<br /><br />One thing I especially like, because I tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8A2">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>, is that the Ultra Shea shampoo has a very mild, almost vanilly scent to it.  The moisturizing shampoo I tried previously had a perfumey very strong odor.  Not good when you are sensitive to scents.<br /><br />The shampoo is thick, lathers easily and abundantly, cleans my hair without drying it - what more could I want?  My hair has more body and is easier to control, too.  I will continue to use this shampoo.<br /><br />I like the container, too.  Just the right fit for my hand, self-closing, narrow so it doesn't take up a lot of room.

Nevertheless, it is a premium shampoo that I recommend to anyone without overly sensitive skin.<br /><br />Which brings me to the bad news. I love the shampoo - my skin doesn't. The results in my hair are great and I would recommend it to anyone. But I broke out all over from using it. For me, the juice isn't worth the squeeze. I can't have breakouts and soft hair. I'd rather have my usual haystack-style hair and clear skin.

review/summary: Leaves hair soft, clean
review/text: I tried this product and had favorable results.  The smell, color, consistency and lathering potential of this shampoo is just about what you would expect from any shampoo.  I did find that it moisturized my hair, which is prone to being dry, when used in conjunction with its matching conditioner.<br /><br />Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)is an ingredient in this shampoo, and many people have skin or eye irritation issues with shampoos containing SLES.  I didn't notice any irritation.<br /><br />I find this shampoo performs better than some salon brands, or mid-priced shampoos.  For that reason, I will probably buy it again when I run out.  At its price point, this is really a nice shampoo.<br /><br />Update 7/6/2012:  After using this product for 2 weeks, I continue to have good results.  My hair stylist even asked me what kind of shampoo I was using and she said it smelled good and made my hair very shiny and moisturized.  When I told her she was incredulous that I wasn't using a high end product to get these results.  I find that the matching conditioner is a real necessity - it prevents flyaway hair and relaxes my hair.  The shampoo is good at stripping away styling products and buildup.

However, I gave it only three stars because I strongly object to the ad's omission of the fact that Labrada Nutrition's Lean Body contains sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose replaced aspartane---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers.<br /><br />Regrettably, sucralose is known to kill off our probiotics, the bacteria that enable food's digestion!<br /><br />We all have the right to take our chances. Nevertheless, the vendors of products that they encourage us to eat have the duty to inform of what those chances are.

review/summary: No Maltodextrin!!!
review/text: This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date.  I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide.  Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate.  The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index.  This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin.  Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again.  This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great.  Hopefully it has a low glycemic index.<br /><br />The oil blend is this product looks to be good.  They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids.<br /><br />As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving.<br /><br />In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion.  Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research.<br /><br />The only downfall of this product is the cost.  It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent.  All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly.

I've bought it two times and I've dropped off 20 pounds just doing a shake diet.<br /><br />Do one scoop [do two scoops thirty minutes to an hour before going exercising]<br />Do this every hour [you can have two solid meals but don't go over 250 calories, and no drinking shakes or eating after 8]<br />Use water instead of milk<br /><br />That's how I did it and I lost a lot. I would have gave it five stars but the price went up. When I first bought this product, I paid twenty-five dollars and some cents. Now it's almost thirty dollars. They need to go back down on the product. But if you're not doing a shake diet and just use this for workouts and stuff, I don't know how it's going to work you. Well I do know when you workout, you going to feel it like with any other workout but the next day, you will not be sore. That's why I love it. When I'm exercising, I feel the burn, the pain. I even feel it once I'm done but later that day or the next day, the pain is gone! If you buy this product, you'll love it! Great taste too if you know what you're doing.
