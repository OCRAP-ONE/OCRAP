review/summary: Tastes good!
review/text: I've had regular quinoa before and although I did like it, it was a bit gritty. I wanted to give the pasta a try. I read some of the other reviews for this brand, I knew when ordering that this particular brand wasn't glutten-free. I like the taste( on the whole wheat tasting-side). It really came down to what my husband thought since he loves his pasta and since he liked it as well, I will be ordering this again. Oh, & I wanted to mention that on the box it says to boil your pasta for 6-9 minutes. I had to let it boil for a few extra minutes since I thought it was a little too on the al dente side.

review/summary: WARNING - Contains Quinoa and WHOLE WHEAT
review/text: Please note that this product's ingredients contain whole wheat flour in addition to the quinoa.  In my opinion, the product listing is not clear about the inclusion of whole wheat.  The product photo is a small size and it is not mentioned in the product description.  Unless you see whole wheat in the ingredients list, you may think you are getting quinoa-only grain pasta (which Ancient Harvest also sells).  This could be a problem for those who are gluten-free.<br /><br />As for the cooking time, the instructions say 6-9 minutes, but as with other Ancient Harvest pasta products, I find that 12 minutes is the proper time for al dente noodles.<br /><br />Other than these quirks, Ancient Harvest quinoa pastas are a great alternative to traditional pasta varieties!

review/summary: Perfect for Halloween & Any Other Party
review/text: Who doesn't like Hershey's kisses?  I can assure you that everyone does.  I recently served them at a party attended by toddlers through the elderly and everyone enjoyed them.  In fact, the parents had more second and third servings than the kids.<br /><br />The jumbo-sized bag is a better packaging size than many of the jumbo-bagged items sold for Halloween.  Each of these bags is good for approximately 20 kids if they each get a few bars.  The nice part is that if you don't need extra bars then you don't have to open the other two bags so that the other two bags can stay fresher for another occasion.  Some of the jumbo bags sold by other retailers are so large that a lot of the candy ends up going to waste or is eaten during a late-night binge because it goes bad so quickly after being taken out of the original packaging.

review/summary: Love this tea!
review/text: Until just recently, I had an English boss that got me hooked on English and Irish tea--and I shall be forever grateful!  Just about any British tea that I've tried is much better than anything you get off the shelves in our American markets.<br /><br />PG Tips is England's best-selling tea--and no wonder!  Just open the box and take a good whiff.  I've not found its match in Lipton, Luzianne (which is usually dead on the vine), or Red Rose--and that's just its unbrewed fragrance!  But wait 'till you taste it:  a much richer, deeper, stronger flavor than any American supermarket tea.  No, PG Tips is not premium tea, but I have yet to find a premium tea that I like better.<br /><br />Please note:  all British tea is stronger than American--probably so that it stands up to the milk that practically all Englishmen take in their tea--so I would recommend you start with one teaspoon of loose tea per 10 oz. of water and let it brew for 3-4 minutes, then adjust the strength from there.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this tea is the small size of the leaves.  Unfortunately most of the world now prefers tea bags, which make an insipid, and often bitter, brew.  Because that's where the demand is, most tea plantations don't bother with whole leaves anymore.  The processing is more labor intensive, and since the leaves will be cut up into doodle dust to fit the bags, why bother?  This process yields NO whole leaves, so even the loose tea from non-premium brands like PG Tips is strictly flakes of mutilated leaves.  Even so, their loose tea makes better hot or iced tea than their bags.<br /><br />By all means, buy some PG.  And wave good-bye to Lipton!

review/summary: PG Tips is great tea, but you're not getting any benefit from the loose leaf version
review/text: This review applies specifically to the loose leaf variety of PG Tips. I would give the bagged version five stars.<br /><br />Following the directions printed on the box to use 1tsp of tea per serving, the loose leaf variety of PG Tips does not offer substantial savings over the bagged variety. These 250G boxes contain as much tea as the eighty-bag boxes, and this six-pack of 250G loose leaf boxes contains as much tea as the two-pack of 240 bags also offered here on Amazon. The price difference? Three dollars.<br /><br />The savings is negligible for such a large quantity of tea, and, as far as I can tell, the loose leaf form of PG Tips is actually the same exact stuff that is inside PG Tips teabags. That's disappointing. When you pop open one of these loose leaf boxes, you may be disappointed to find that the contents aren't really leaves at all. Rather, you get finely ground (or perhaps more accurately "pulverized") clippings of tea leaves--the same dusty powder you'll find if you rip open a PG Tips teabag. Factor in the need for some kind of infuser or tea filter and you've already overstepped the price line between the bags and the loose "leaves." Then you also have the extra effort of filling your infuser and washing it afterward to deal with.<br /><br />To make matters worse, this stuff is hard as crap to brew even with an infuser. The fineness of the tea particles is, well, too fine. These little clippings have a tendency to escape from whatever you put them in and get into your cuppa, and it's not very pleasant to get a mouthful of them at the bottom of the cup. There are two working solutions I have found. One is to use spice bags made out of cheesecloth. These can be homemade, but I purchased mine at Bed Bath and Beyond. Reusable bags take a few minutes to clean after each use but are inexpensive and can last a good long while. Alternatively, there are premade paper tea filters out there that are exactly like tea bags. If you buy these, you will pay more than the cost of just buying the already-bagged version of the tea. Either way, regular infusers probably won't cut it.<br /><br />The flavor of PG Tips--both bagged and loose--is perfect. It's the best black tea I've had. It's basically a very strong English breakfast tea that brews very dark but does not get bitter (even if oversteeped). This tea also makes great iced tea. Something like four teaspoons of this or four bags of the bagged variety steeped in three to three and a half liters of water with a quarter cup sugar added makes iced black tea that tastes very much like something you would get at a restaurant. Though the loose leaf version of PG Tips makes the same excellent tea that the bagged version does, I cannot rate it above one star because it is essentially a less convenient and more expensive version of a similar product. I'm disappointed.

review/summary: Best Tea for My Money
review/text: This is supposed to be England's favorite tea, and I can see why. I like my tea strong, and had been drinking another brand of Earl Grey. Now and then I'd try some other brand to save money, but it just didn't have the taste. Then my supermarket started carrying PG Tips. It was a good price, so I started using it. Eventually I decided to buy bergamot oil to make my own version of Earl Grey. I bought this loose tea because I thought I could save even more money by buying tea in bulk. You get 6 8.8 ounce boxes of loose tea, and the price per ounce is way better than the supermarket price for bagged PG Tips. I think the bagged tea may be a little stronger because it is powdered. (Hey, maybe I should grind my tea in a mortar and pestle before steeping!) At any rate, this is good tasting tea at a better price. I highly recommend it, especially if you like strong tea. Oh, the boxes are "hermetically" sealed, so to speak. There is thick foil solidly affixed to the opening under the cardboard lid, so until you peel back this foil, the tea is going to stay fresh. When I open a box, I pour the tea into an old tea tin to keep it fresh while in use.

review/summary: Very Good Loose Leaf Tea!!!
review/text: While this may not be "premium" tea, it IS very good tea.  It has a smooth, not harsh, yet bold flavor.  It stands up well to milk or cream and makes a very good iced tea.  After drinking this, Lipton's tea just seems so unbearably harsh and acrid. It brews up well, never seeming to become bitter.  It works well as a general, all purpose, every day tea; also, blending well with mint or other flavors, like cinnamon, if that's what you like.  PG is good black, too.  It is a finely cut tea, BUT, so what?  It steeps well and tastes great.  I use Finum tea filters, available on Amazon, to brew, which catches all the pieces.  I searched high and low, for years, and paid way too much for stale PG Tips before finding it on Amazon at a very good price, especially when purchased at subscribe and save prices.  I prefer the loose tea, but occasionally use tea bags, for traveling.  There are other teas I enjoy, but this remains on my list of favorites, both for taste and price!

review/text: This is a great tea. I brew the bulk stuff in a coffee maker which is very quick, and comes out well. If you're used to lipton, you can make it taste near the same if you water it down by about 3 fold. It's an excellent price, and even if you don''t like something so strong, and want to brew sweet tea, just water it down, and you get about 3x the amount of brewed tea for the same weight of dried tea.<br /><br />I personally like this tea a lot with some orange blossom honey and a little milk- flavored teas I like without milk, but this one is a great alternative to coffee, and tastes better. It wakes you up, but doesn't bring you down as harsh as coffee. I would definitely recommend this black over any others I've tried. Additionally, you can use the brewed tea for some healthy compost.

The ice tea maker's instructions said to use 3 tablespoons of loose tea, but I think PG Tips is much stronger than your average black tea; I use half as much (1.5 tablespoons) and it's perfect for my Southern U.S. taste buds. Do use some standard coffee filters (I double-up) when brewing tea this way. I imagine with 2-quart ice tea maker you can reduce the amount of tea by 1/3 (1 tablespoon), but play around with it and see how you like it!

review/text: I like very strong loose-leaf tea, hot and cold, and has found that Lipton Loose Leaf, despite being a commodity tea, is one of the very best --- lots of bite if it's made strong enough.  The problems have been: 1) Stores don't always carry it, and 2) Some stores that do carry it don't always have it.  PG Tips is the closest thing to it that I have found so far.  I really like the fact that the leaves are cut very small so that it steeps very quickly.  I also like the fact that Amazon sells six boxes at a time and delivers quickly.  There is something still missing from the acrid bite of Lipton, which is why I rate it at four starts, not five, but I've given up on a steady supply of Lipton.  Hopefully enough people like PG Tips to keep it on Amazon!

review/summary: A Few Issues...
review/text: So someone purchased this pack of 6 loose leaf boxes for me on Christmas last year. I really liked this tea after I tried the tea bags from the grocery store. It is a good deal in this form here on Amazon and I am still drinking from the same batch, although I gave a few boxes away to friends because it's too much for one person who keeps a large variety of other teas. I think these loose leaf teas were not as fresh as the ones I purchased from the grocery store. They were not as flavorful, I guess one could describe them as a bit 'stale'. A little after I had these, I had found out that this company only recently stopped testing on animals, too. I do believe that they do not anymore, but it still didn't sit well with me. There are plenty of tea shops that I can get a decent black tea from that don't have a bloody history. They only stopped testing on animals because they finally got all the scientific information they needed from hurting them so that they can brag to us all the health benefits. Now that they don't need to do that, they can say they have turned a new leaf. It is a decent tea, but surely not the best. I think I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DXY0">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, Loose Leaf, 8.8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)</a>. The loose leaf bag of that tea includes full, beautiful leaves with some golden leaves, too. This PG tips contains leaf particles that taste stale. Plus it's just packaged in cardboard. There is no inner lining to protect your tea as it sits in a warehouse, is sent to you, and inconvenient unless you have 6 canisters (or a very big one) waiting to preserve this massive amount of tea for you. Overall, I wouldn't buy this again.

review/summary: PG Tips loose tea
review/text: Nothing too fancy, just a simple, flavorful, full-bodied black tea. I like to brew it in my Bunn-O-Matic because I can brew enough for almost a gallon in just 3 minutes. (I never use my coffee maker for coffee, only tea, because I don't like coffee-flavored tea!) I like to use loose tea for my iced tea, because it just takes 4 tablespoons. I scoop it out of a canister. I would need about 14 tea bags for the equivalent brew strength. That's time-consuming. It's hard to find loose tea in most supermarkets. The few that carry it usually just have 1/2 pound boxes of Lipton for around $5. Too expensive and too small. Otherwise, some have "boutique" tea blends. But that's very expensive, and too frou-frou for good old fashioned iced tea. So, enter Amazon.com. For about $25, I get six 8.8 ounce boxes (more than a half pound each!) of this delicious PG Tips loose tea, shipped to my door as often as I like. I have a subscription, so I get a case every 2 months. That's about $12 a month hassle free. We drink about a gallon per day. So keep it coming. I'm satisfied!

review/summary: Best Everyday Tea
review/text: I enjoy searching out and trying new teas that I find in my travels, but always seem to return to PG Tips as my "go to" tea for everyday use.  I originally tried this tea on the recommendation of a friend that brought some back from a trip to England and also had some sent to me from someone one of my children knew in England.  It's easy to brew it on the strong side which I like as I use milk (no sugar) in my tea.  If anyone had tried a tea that they like better, please let me know.  Give PG Tips a try, sure you will like it.

review/summary: Among The Best Tasting Tea
review/text: I've been a fan of PG Tips Black Tea since traveling to England many years ago. I am no connoisseur, but I like the stronger flavor and very tea taste. I choose the loose tea so I can make the tea as strong as I like, but I also have used the "pyramid" shaped tea bags with tasty results. Unfortunately it has always been difficult to find PG Tips in local (US) markets, but Amazon's food market allows me to get the tea whenever I want. I would give the PG Tips a 5 out of 5, but I reserve the "5" just in case something unimaginable comes along. PG Tips is a great tea.

review/summary: very disappointed
review/text: I really wanted to like this product. I am an Australian who loves good loose leaf tea and have tried PG tips in the UK. I bought a box of loose leaf PG tips in our local grocery store in KY and loved it! Every sip was an "ooohhh, so good!" sip. So I bought the 6 pack on Amazon because I thought it was a great deal. I was worried that it might go stale in buying bulk but none of the reviews seemed to suggest that and most customers seemed pretty happy. However, my first box opened does not have the "so good" taste. In fact, each cup is hardly better than a tetley tea bag. The boxes don't expire until May 2011 (today is March 2010) so I'm not sure what the go is. I'm still debating whether or not to return the product. Just wanted to warn customers who enjoy a good cup of tea that this seemingly good deal may leave you wishing you payed a bit extra and sought out PG tips locally, if possible.

review/summary: PG Tips Loose tea-tastes good but much too finely ground
review/text: PG Tips is by far my favorite tea. The taste lives up to its outstanding reviews in every way, but the fine grind of the loose tea was not what I expected. This is not what I would call loose tea; instead, it is tea dust. It makes for a cloudy, murky brew (looks like a mud puddle). I guess I could use paper filters, but for me the point of loose tea is that I can eliminate the need for the filter. Not only for environmental reasons, but because tea and coffee just taste better when brewed without paper filters. Against all odds, though, the tea still tastes great. Just a little hard to get past the aesthetics. oh well. I suppose there could very well be a good reason for the fine grind.

review/text: Moving to the USA from Australia back in 2006, meant that we had been limited for "home" food options. We still struggle with getting some items from home, but in finding the PG-Tips 6 pack on Amazon, we were impressed with the value.<br /><br />We had seen single packs of loose leaf tea, much more expensive than this option from Amazon. Amazon's 6 pack gives us enough tea for about 4 - 6 months of tea drinking.<br /><br />No specific complaints, it stores well, and tastes great. We are not big tea-bag fans.

review/text: Based on reviews, I expected something better. This tea does beat Lipton yellow bag, but it is not better than some of the better bagged teas. It is nowhere near as good as some other loose teas. It is OK, if you need your caffeine fix without offending your taste buds, but that's about it. If you can appreciate this analogy, it is like a very high quality cigarette: better than low quality cigarette, but not as good a a cigar or a pipe.

review/text: Two primary reasons I didn't like this tea:<br /><br />1) Very small size of the leaf. Actually, I don't think it's even leaf - it looks more like dust. The tea is very strong but the taste is questionable. I would put it in the Lipton league, despite all the excitement from some other comments. However, taste is a subjective matter.<br />2) Poor packaging. Good teas usually come in foil or metal packaging, which preserves the freshness of the tea. This tea comes just in paperboard box. No wonder somebody was complaining about lack of fresh taste despite the expiration date. I think this is very important item, since this offer requires to buy in bulk.

It was  The GREIT TEA! All PG tea sold in UK have the same label. The tea I ordered on Amazon.com in September of this, 2011 year, came in very similar but not exactly the same boxes, without certification, and with taste and aroma of the cheapest assan tea.<br />Overall, I like sop on Amazon.com, and will be very appreciated  if you help me to find source to buy the real (certified, english) PG tips loose tea.

review/summary: Don't Get Sucked In!
review/text: I LOVE watermelon candy of every variety and type.  When I went on a quest to find the Twizzlers that had the watermelon filling, all I could find was this.  I figured that, since they already made a successful (albeit not successful enough) watermelon-flavored candy, they must have the flavoring down. Sadly, I was very mistaken. I strongly urge you NOT to buy this if you're craving watermelon candy! Someone in another review got it right, this product tastes strange.  I rated it at a 2 because it is barely edible. Whatever you are used to in watermelon candy flavors, this is not it at all.  Unfortunately, I subscribed to save on price and shipping and also to get a steady supply.  I've cancelled my subscription and I'm going to try and get rid of the other 5 bags that came in the shipment but I feel kinda bad for whomever gets them.  If the expiration lasts long enough, I might give them away at the Christmas gag party.

review/summary: It works 100%
review/text: This product works very effectively. I noticed a huge difference in my milk production from when I use it to when I do not. I don't think it's a requirement to take this tea, because personally I think that mother nature takes care of providing the mother exactly what the baby needs. But with today's reality, and as a working mom, I went back to work and had to use a pump. I am told that the baby gets 50% more milk when the baby feeds directly, than from what you can express in a pump. Thus,pumping is a very inefficient method of milk expression. I found that with the tea, I could pump more than enough and was able to not only pump, but also feed her in the evenings/weekends, and also express enough extra milk to be able to freeze some in case of 'emergency'. I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I have tried this tea as well as the Mother's milk tea.  I LOVE this tea better than Mother's milk tea.  I didn't really see a difference in my milk production with the mother's milk tea, within 2 days of taking Nursing Time tea and pumping every 2 hours my milk came in enough that my son didn't need to be supplemented with formula.  I am also taking the Nursing Blend supplement that Fairhaven Health also makes.  I just started taking that, so I know that the tea really makes a difference with milk supply even without the Nursing Blend supplement.  I have recommended this tea to many nursing friends and have heard great things from them as well.

review/summary: Best nursing tea on the market!
review/text: While this tea is fabulous for ANY nursing mama in supporting breast health, it's also great for the mother who might be struggling to produce. I've tried every brand of nursing tea that I know of and while they all work great, this tea is the most effective in boosting milk production. As with any nursing tea, if you're trying to boost your supply, you cannot drink 1-2 cups a day and expect amazing results. I have a condition called Insufficient Glandular Tissue (a.k.a. IGT) and the only way I can manage to make enough to feed my babies has been herbal supplements along with nursing tea, this one being the most effective for me. Of course, if you're worried about production the most important thing to worry about is nursing your baby on demand but for mama's like me, or maybe mamas who pump while their away from their baby and need an extra boost, this tea is WONDERFUL!

review/text: I was introduced to this tea at the hospital after giving birth to my daughter.  A lactation specialist highly recommended it.  I didn't think I needed it so I filed the recommendation in my brain like all of the other advice given to me about caring for a newborn!  Well, fast forward four months.  My daughter's growth was beginning to slow and I was concerned about my milk production.  I remembered the lactation specialist's advice and bought the tea from Amazon.  I have been drinking just one cup of tea a day since and it has significantly helped!  You will feel the difference.

review/text: I've tried the pills to increase milk supply and they did nothing. This tea works though.  I notice that my milk supply will nearly double when I drink it.  It will drop a lot if I don't drink it though.  Luckily it tastes good and is all natural.  Its important for me to pump as much milk as possible as I'm a working mom. I highly recommend this tea!

review/summary: Works better than any other I tried and tastes better
review/text: Nursing became a big drama.  It looked like I was done (had tried other options and techniques).  Use of this tea with regular pumping really helped.  Regular pumping alone was not enough and other teas did not work very well.  Considering your drinking a medicinal tea, I think it tastes pretty good. It is easy to make if you get a tea cup with a strainer for making loose tea.

review/summary: Tea works - but the taste is off
review/text: After using tea from this company that aids in conception (and being successful) I decided to try this nursing tea.<br /><br />Pros:  The tea works!  It definitely has helped me boost my supply.  And it seems to help improve the quality because I noticed that my baby is less fussy/gassy after feeding.<br /><br />Cons:  For me the taste does NOT taste lemony.  This tea contains anise which has an over powering licorice taste - which I personally hate.  So for me, the tea is not good tasting.  So I'm basically making the tea, letting it cool down, and then chugging it to get past the licorice taste.  I don't know if I got a batch with a ton of anise or what, but it is very overpowering.  As soon as I opened the bag I could smell it.

Combine that with the velvety center and it's to die for! I want some NOW, lol.

review/summary: Great Tiramisu!
review/text: These were a great base for Tiramisu. I just used the recipe on the back and it was out of this world. Be sure to use Mascarpone cheese, because that makes all the difference despite the cost. This was a big package of Ladyfingers, so there were plenty for the Tiramisu and some extras to eat. They were firm enough that they really held together after dipping them in the Espresso and they soaked up the flavors just great. I would order these again since Ladyfingers are difficult to find in my area.

review/summary: I made a fantastic Trifle
review/text: For those who don't know what a trifle is it's a layered dessert with sponge cake or lady fingers on the bottom covered with fruit cocktail then covered with custard or pudding then covered with whipped cream. I make a traditional English Sherry Trifle where the lady fingers are doused with (a bit of) sherry wine.<br /><br />My friend has celiac autoimmune disease, so I always try to make a gluten-free dish for her when we're at parties together. I came across these Schar Gluten Free Lady Fingers and thought I'd try a gluten-free Trifle (by the way, there is a recipe for gluten-free tiramisu on the packaging). They are stiffer than regular ladyfingers and at first I was worried. They are more like cookies out of the box than cake - you can't cut into them without breaking them into pieces. I was worried that soaking them with liquid would turn them to mush, but I only added a bit to coat each one and several hours later (and even next day) they kept their form and was even spongy (and tasty). I don't recommend drenching them or they will likely go to mush!<br /><br />The dish was a complete success, both in taste and in structure. A very good product!

review/text: I ordered these because I have been deprived of tiramisu since going gluten free :-)  I did not use the recipe on the package;  I used another from a magazine.  The lady fingers held up well and tasted great.  I made it in an 8x8 glass dish but did not go all the way to the sides, a little smaller dish would've been better.  I will order these again, it was just enough to hit the spot!

review/text: I usually buy the Amish Red popcorn, but since I couldn't find  a "great" deal on it I decided to try the Sweet Baby Blue.  THIS IS A GREAT BUY, and it is great popcorn prepared in an oil popper.  Crisp, not a lot of old maids [and they are almost all partially popped, so they are the "best" part], and very tasty.  I like this product as well as my usual Amish Red, it may not be as crisp as Amish Red, but it is close enough for the GREAT DEAL...

Thank you to the farmers that care about the integrity of their food product they grow!!!

review/summary: Cambezola
review/text: An amazing cheese. I've enjoyed blue cheeses for years, and have recently discovered the triple cream cambezola. What a great combination. This is very much a blue-brie.  The light creamy texture and flavor is delicately offset with the pungent blue. This cheese is not only spreadable (crackers/breads), it goes very well with fruits and nuts. I've found myself enjoying several ounces of it, all by itself on a plate with a knife.  I simply cannot speak highly enough about this cheese.  Enough flavor to take it far beyond other triple cremes, and it is truly a spreadable blue.  Amazing.

review/text: I came upon these crisps while cheese shopping with my cousin. I was a little hesitant to try them for a couple reasons. The price and the look of the crisp itself. However, now after giving them a try I can see the benefits of the product! They taste amazing!! I am not a health conscious person, but they taste great and are healthy...that is a true bonus !! They look a little strange yes, but with the all the wonderful delicious ingredients packed into each flavour they're incredible!! The crisps are also very versitile. We tried the Rosemary flavour with all types of cheeses...bries, stiltons, blues, cheddars, all types ! Also with liverwurst and cheez whiz! They really are great and now I can say....worth the price, because you know you are getting truly high quality crisp!! I have since tried the rest of the flavours and am relieved to tell you all of them our delicious and unique in their own way..the Rosemary one still stands as my fav, but the cranberry one is a close 2nd! You won't regret trying these crisps !

review/text: I haven't bought it from Amazon since it was out of stock for a few months while I was looking.  I also tried buying it at Walmart in Elk Grove, CA too based on the other reviews with no luck.  I went to SAM's club too with no luck.  I resorted to buying 2 "cans" (cheaper than the individual packs) off ebay.  You can also buy them directly from the the [...] website, but its kinda expensive.<br /><br />I got hooked on this when they had the individual packs out for a 2-day training I was attending.  Mind you, on the 2nd day, no packs were left.  (because I took them all!!!-hahaha)  This cocoa is soooo much better than any other hot chocolate and the real cnady cane flakes in there gives it just the right minty flavor...not overbearing.  I'm pretty picky too :)

review/text: I'd bought otherer varieties of the Stephen's Gourmet Cocoa in the past and been very pleased, so when I saw the Candycane Cocoa in a special tin at my local supermarket, I picked two up.  The Stephen's Gourmet line of instant cocoas offer a velvety cup of rich and satisfying cocoa without that instant powdered milk after taste that you sometimes find in other instant cocoa brands.  The Candycane Cocoa is no exception.  The peppermint is nicely balanced to the cocoa and the candy bits dissolve readily. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys mint and chocolate.

The candy cane pieces stick to the spoon you stir it with really badly though. I keep packets in my office and one in my purse for when I need a pick me up. I recommend this product.

review/summary: Good but a little too sweet
review/text: I just received my shipment and the packets are individual tossed into a plastic bag.  Some of the bags are broken so there are powder everywhere.  I'm going to attach a picture to this item if they would let me.  I was looking forward to trying it but I will need to return it.  It is unacceptable to have open food packages.  I'll update my review once it got resolved and I am able to taste it.<br /><br />Update: Amazon customer service is great.  They have a replacement on its way.  They said to throw out the broken package.  So I opened it to see what go damaged.  It might have been a manufacturing issue.  It looks like some of the seam busted open due to lack of glue or the pressure inside the package is so great that it burst.<br /><br />Update: I received the replacement hot chocolate and these showed up in perfect condition.  The chocolate is tasty but a little too sweet for me.  The added crushed peppermint might make it sweeter than normal.  Great for when you have a cold.  It is so soothing and no need to heat up milk.  Just add water.  Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: Good, but not chocolatey enough.
review/text: I'm glad that this hot cocoa had actual bits of candy cane in it instead of just "flavoring" but it was sort of bland when it came to the actual "chocolatey taste" Good for the price though.

review/summary: great tasting hot cocoa!
review/text: I tried it during backpacking and at home.  It did not disappoint.  For backpacking I use 8oz hot water but the sweetness is just want I need after a hard day of hauling a 30lb backpack up some elevation and distance.  At home I use 12oz hot water to dilute the sweetness to make it a perfect bed time snack.  The minty flavor from candy cane bits makes a huge difference in taste in comparison to other hot chocolate brands.  The only gripe I have is the packaging.  The packets are too loose inside the box therefore if not sealed well, content will come out to make a mess inside the box.  I had to clean each packet to rid sugared powder before putting them back into the box.  If you have roach, roden, or ant invation at home, you should be very mindful of this potential danger to the storage problem.

review/summary: Just try
review/text: My daughter picked up a couple packages at Wal-Mart. We loved it and had to buy the big container. This stuff is really good, but I add a bit more powder than the dirctions call for.
