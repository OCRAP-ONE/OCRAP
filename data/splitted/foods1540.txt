review/summary: So relaxing
review/text: I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!

review/summary: It is good tea.
review/text: I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills.

review/summary: Would not order again
review/text: I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment.

review/text: I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*

review/summary: Excellent Mellow Tea, Hot or Cold
review/text: This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet.

review/summary: Lovely Green Tea
review/text: I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil.

review/text: THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality.

review/summary: My 'everyday' tea. :c)
review/text: I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)

review/summary: Time for Tea!
review/text: I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too.

review/summary: Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green
review/text: I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.

Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!

review/text: This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste "green" (ie: doesn't have that fresh "grassy" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again.

review/summary: Cuppa Green
review/text: Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are "watered down" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.

review/summary: Doesn't Taste Like Hay
review/text: I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Tidy Cats Breeze system..
review/text: I've had this for a few weeks, and I'm really happy with it.<br /><br />The hugest advantage to this system is the urine is separated from the 'litter' and odor is greatly reduced.  The litter consist of pellets similar in shape/size to the wood-based natural litters, but they are of a hard clay, which doesn't break down with moisture, and they keep their shape.  Thus, the urine drains straight down through a grid to the pad (in its own slide-out drawer), and the poo stays on top to be scooped away.<br /><br />The pee will not ferment with the characteristic stench, and you don't have to deal with clumping litter which doesn't really clump, and is just plain stinky and messy to scoop up.<br /><br />The proprietary 'pee' pads are kind of like a giant maxi pad, and absorb a lot of liquid.  Also, the bottom side of the pad is plastic, and the pad fits into the tray in a way that the plastic is upturned to keep the tray itself dry. Maintenance consists of merely taking the drawer out to the trash, and sliding the pad out, putting in a new one, and sliding the drawer back into the bottom of the box.<br /><br />The litter itself are hard pellets, which hardly get tracked, and it is 100% dustless.  A pellet or two stick to paws, but are easily picked up and tossed back into the box.  Scooping is easy, and if the poo is dry, you can kind of shake it around in the scoop to knock off some of the pellets, then throw it in the trash instead of wasting water with a toilet flush.<br /><br />It takes mere seconds to maintain the box vs. 10 minutes of scooping and scraping soggy clumping litter which doesn't really clump, but falls apart.<br /><br />When it's time to change the litter (once a month), it just pours into the trash, no scraping the soggy wet concrete of old.<br /><br />Some say you get a 'poo' smell, since kitties can't bury it quite like they did with the old type of litter, but I'll take that over the overpowering stench of fermented urine any day.  And, the smell goes away quite shortly, just like human smell in the bathroom.  Note that you should just use one bag of the pellets in the box, the litter won't be as deep.  I just give the box a quick shake daily to even it back out.<br /><br />Cat adaption to the new box:  This won't work for everyone, but this is what I did:  I set up the new Breeze system next to the old box (which was fairly gross, as I let it get bad) to see what would happen.  I placed a clump of the old litter into the new box to let him know it was 'his.'  My 9 year old fellow was pretty much using the new box right away (probably out of curiousity more than anything).  After 3 days or so, I removed the old box and inserted it directly into the garbage, never to be dealt with again.  No problems, 100% compliance on Max's part.<br /><br />If Tidy Cats came out with a fully hooded version of the box, it would be great for the folks who have standing pee-ers, but my fellow doesn't do that, so I'm lucky.<br /><br />Finally, some say the pellets and pads are expensive, but I estimate the cost as about equal to the old style of box over the long run - and the convenience and ease of maintenance should erase any other doubt.<br /><br />Also, this system has the potential of keeping tons of conventional clay litter out of landfills.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: like it so far(1 day) , added info after a week
review/text: I got this yesterday and so far it looks good, I've been using silica litter but even the cheap stuff is not that cheap and is fairly dusty, so I've been looking for an alternative and this seems to be it.  The silica works great for drying up odors until it gets pee saturated. I sprinkled at little of the old wet litter on the breeze litter and the cats used it right away.  The pee does drain through and the pads are good, they've used it quite a few times and the pad still feels dry.  I'm actually hoping they DON'T poop in it and continue to use the silica for that, then I'll have the best of both worlds, the poop will dry and the pee will be able to be gotten rid of so the expensive silica will last longer.<br /><br />After a week, still on the first pad and haven't noticed any odor problems.  Have 3 cats and left the silica so they are using both but they are using the breeze a lot.  Adding crystals or enzyme spray to the pad might stretch it's life out even longer.  They've pooped in the breeze too and I haven't noticed a smell but lots of pellets glue tight so I'm losing quite a few each time.  I'm used to the silica, which is much cleaner than clay or clumping and I haven't noticed any increased odor with the breeze.<br /><br />Changed the pad on the 8th day because, well really how far do you want to push it, and no sign of trouble.  It was HEAVY with no sign of leakage or deterioration  (I didn't really try to stress test it, but it came out of the tray and into the bag with no problem).

review/summary: Worked great for pee & hard poo, BUT could not stand the poop smell
review/text: Back when I used the breeze cat system, there were 4 cats in the apartment (2 are my cats, and the other 2 were my brother's cats that I was temporarily taking care for him).  I had the breeze next to the original litter box for 3 days and none of the cats used it.  They all went on top of the pellets to check it out but did not pee/poop in there.  One of the cats tried to eat a pellet and I took it away from him.  I *think* none of them actually ate it.<br /><br />On the 4th day, I took the original litter box away, and then they all started using the breeze.  There were no "accidents" in the apartment and I did not find pee or poop on the floor or carpet.  I think the fact that I placed some of the pellets with their original litter really helped them get accustomed to the product (and also since the breeze system was sitting there for 3 days, they were at least familiarized with it).<br /><br />The pad that sucked up the pee worked really well.  I experimented to figure out the right time to change the pad for the 4 cats.  It turned out to be every 3 days.  As for hard poop, I was ok with it staying at the top of the system and would pick it up with a plastic bag and throw it out (very easy).<br /><br />The problem is with the runny/watery poop which will go all over the pellets and is tougher and takes longer to clean.  A lot of the pellets ended up getting thrown out once the watery poop touched them.  Also, this system does not do anything to help minimize the poop smell, which is the main complaint for my boyfriend regarding this system.  In the end, we did not keep the breeze because the smell was too horrible.  Even if you clean it up immediately after the cat pooped, the smell was still there.<br /><br />We went back to the original litter box.  I am going to keep my eye on this product to see if tidy cats come out with better pellets that will do something about poop smell.  If that time ever comes, I would buy it because I know my cats will use this system & it did wonders for the pee... now if only the poop situation works out!

review/summary: My tips for making this system work
review/text: We have 3 long haired cats and have tried every litter box under the sun that promised "no tracking".  This system is the first that truly delivered.  WE still get a few pellets outside the boxes but they are easy to pick up with our hand vacuum.<br />We've been using the system for 4 months now and here are some tricks we found to make it work. We find that Pet Fresh (made by Arm & Hammer and usually used for carpets is a BIG help in keeping the odors under control. It's really cheap too.)<br /><br />1. Right after they go number 2, we sprinkle Pet Fresh on it.  This is because one of our cats doesn't cover his poops after he goes. The scoop works best after they have a chance to dry out a little.<br /><br />2. The loose stool issue.  It can be a real mess trying to get them out with a scoop.  I found that using paper towels or toilet paper to pick them up is the easiest and cleanest way to get them out.<br /><br />3. The pan that holds the pads starts to retain the smell of urine after a month or 2.  Solution:  Sprinkle Pet Fresh on the pan, then put the pad in the pan.<br /><br />4.  Issue: the sides of the pan start to smell and poop gets stuck to it. Solution:  We keep Wipes, paper towels and spray cleaner near the box and wipe the box and scoop whenever it gets dirty.<br /><br />5.  Expense:  We have found that if we look out for coupons and sales we can get the pads for about a dollar each and the pellets last a month in each box.  We used to change the litter ever week and went through so much that we have found this system to actually be cheaper.  The worst place to buy the pellets and pads is Petco  - they are triple the price. Best place for us has been Target and Stop & Shop - we stock up when they are on sale.<br /><br />6.  Transitioning: It took us almost a month of increasing adding the pellets to the old litter.  Every time we scooped the old litter we added more pellets.  The whole time we had the new system right next to the old one. By the time the old system was almost all pellets they were using both so we got more breezes and got rid of the old. We did have a couple times where they went outside the box, but that was it.<br /><br />It wasn't easy to change, but to not have litter and urine tracked all over the house is such a god send that it was well worth the trouble.  My greatest fear is that they might stop making the refills!  I was glad to read that someone said you could use the system without with the pads if you dump the urine every day.  That would be not be ideal but it's nice to know it works.  I was also thinking you could use doggie pee pads if necessary. As for the pellets, I'm going to try "Yesterdays' News" pellets and see if they would work.  or may even tiny river rocks that are washable?  washable pellets you don't have to replace would be awesome for the environment.  Trouble is they won't get to make as money off them - but I"m going to be on the look out for something that works!

review/summary: Great System, but not inexpensive
review/text: I have two cats (male, 12 pounds & female, 7 pounds) and just switched from the Scoop Free (because I had to scoop constantly due to my cat's litter habits) to the Breeze.<br /><br />I love the Breeze because it is very easy, low maintenance, and has excellent odor control.  The only negative is the maintenance cost, but I figured out the usage for my household and it's virtually the same cost as the Scoop Free system.  It is not an economical system compared to scoopable litter, clay litter, or all natural litter alternatives.  You are paying for convenience and the neatness.  It's really mess-free and I never have to touch the pad, just dump the tray into the trash.<br /><br />I'm confused by some of the poor reviews because it really is a simple system.  Honestly, you'd have to be really drunk or half brain dead to screw it up.  It has to be used as a complete system.  It doesn't work if you try to not use the pads or take some other random cost-cutting measure.  I cannot figure out how the urine pan could leak at all if you are using the pad (right side up with the green plastic side down and the absorbant white side up) and you are changing it when it becomes full.  It functions like a diaper, once the absorbancy has been exhausted, that's it.  You get longer life/better absorbancy if you rotate the tray since cats tend to pee in the same area of the box every time.  If you have multiple cats and one box, or a large cat that pees a lot, you may need to change your pad more often, but that's specific to your cat.  If you are using the box properly with any amount of common sense applied, it will not leak.<br /><br />The bag of pellets is sparse, but that's because it is just supposed to let the urine pass through and give your cat a comfortable environment to allow burying.  The pellets are not meant to absorb the urine, or stick to the poop.  They do recommend that you completely change the pellets every month, so you don't really want to put in more than you need for your cat's comfort.  Both my cats are quite content with one pack.  There is no tracking with these pellets, I rarely find more than two or three pellets on the floor near the box.  I do not find that the pellets remove any odor from the solid waste.  I do notice an odor right after my cat has a bowel movement, or if the box is left longer than day without scooping out the solid waste.  I scoop daily into a litter locker and have no odor in the general areas of the box (unless there is something very fresh).  My pads last a full week, I do have to rotate them once. I have never smelt urine from this box.<br /><br />I do want to point out that because we have two cats and three levels of the house we did add additional boxes per the mfg recommendation (which I thought was crazy initially), however, it really did improve my cats' litter habits.  One cat was using alternative (and undesirable) areas to relieve herself (like my suitcase, laundry basket, etc.)  Once I put in multiple boxes, that behavior completely stopped.<br /><br />We have three boxes for the two cats, one at each level: basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor.  The pads generally last at least a week for all boxes, occasionally one box will be used less and a pad will last two weeks.  The pellets are still odor free after 6 weeks.  I agree that the refill costs are high, but as I said, comparable with the ScoopFree system, but this was actually cleaner and easier given the unique habits of my cats.  For me, the cost is worth the ease, convenience and general cleanliness of the system.

review/summary: BEWARE! READ UPDATE!!
review/text: I purchased 2 of these systems for my 5 cats (we have 3 other litter boxes).  One of my cats injested some of the litter pellets and has been in the veterinarian hospital in bad shape for the last 3 days.  After xrays, and sedatives, enemas and iv fluids and blood tests, the vet removed 9 pellets, found a raging UTI and his kidney values are through the roof!  I called the manufacturer to find out what was in the pellets and was told: zeolite, silica, cement, and polysomethingorother.<br />Their website does not tell you that, just says no problem if your cat ingest - it'll will pass thru.  Not so!  I already have a vet bill in excess of $500 it is climbing because they have to keep him there!!<br />Update September 15, 2008<br />Vet bill in excess of $1000, kidney failure and Freddie died on Saturday, September 13, 2008.

review/summary: A little secret/new product idea
review/text: Previously to receiving this system, hubby and I were attempting to train our 2 young kitties to use a human toilet, to no avail.  I learned about this system and decided to give it a try, thinking I'd buy some reusable training pads instead of the ones made for this system (which were more than I wanted to pay).  That way we would be able to save some money and the earth a little bit as well.<br /><br />Then, I realized I could potentially skip the pee pads entirely and just replace our toilet training system with the Breeze litter box...on top of the toilet, sans tray (and toilet seat/lid/mounting parts).  This is exactly what I did this morning when I received the system, and the kitties were ecstatic not to have to use the wretched toilet training system anymore.  They took to it immediately... probably because they were glad to go back to a litter box and also because we had been using Feline Pine with them, so they were used to pellet-type litter.  So we're all happy... the kitties are peeing in the toilet, although they don't know it, and all we have to do is scoop the poo, which doesn't smell as bad when the kitties bury it.<br /><br />I was really hoping they would be able to use the toilet on their own, but I think we've reached a pretty good compromise.  I did have to cover up part of the grid with some clear mailing tape, however, because the corners of the rectangle grid did not quite fit over the oval toilet bowl.  Had to clean up a puddle of piddle after I realized I had miscalculated.  :P<br /><br />All that being said, it would be great if a company came out with a Breeze-like system made for toilets.  That would be AWESOME... *nudge nudge to the litter companies*

review/summary: Works, but still sticks to poop. Washable!
review/text: I got my 6-pack in a larger bag that was packed in a cardboard box about 2 weeks ago - no tears or rips in any of the packs. Thanks to the Amazon Subcription Service, cat litter is now delivered to my door with free shipping and I don't have to lug a 20lb bag from the store anymore.<br /><br />Reason for the 4 stars: Poop still sticks to the pellets and I lose a few everytime I scoop, and it does not control poop odor. But that's ok, I just use an air freshener spray. I use 1.5 bags each time since 1 pack doesn't seem to be enough.<br /><br />Anyway, the pellets are washable! I was curious - so I tried and the pellets weren't all that dirty anyway as I had already scooped the dirty (pop-covered) ones out. I poured the used litter into the bottom part of an old hooded litter box that had hot water and detergent in it (I use the hood for the Breeze litterbox!). I let it soak for about 20 mins whilst I washed and dried the Breeze litter box, changed the pee pad, and poured in a new bag of litter. I used an old kitchen/dish brush that has a long handle and sort of "scrubbed" the used pellets in the soapy water for a few minutes and then drained the water into the toilet bowl and then rinsed it out a number of times until the water was clear. Drained it as much as I could, and then left the box in the bathtub with the window open to air-dry it, and closed the tub screen so my cat wouldn't think he had an extra litter box in the bathtub! The pellets were clean and completely dry within 2-3 days. Kinda interesting that it can be washed and we're not generating more garbage to pollute the earth. Plus, for anyone wanting to save some money....

review/summary: Pure heaven!!!!!
review/text: I was skeptical, as I'm sure you are! I read review after review just to make sure I knew of any known issues. Which are few are far between. To say the least, I am absolutely amazed by this litter box and wish it came out 10 years ago!<br /><br />I am, now, the un-proud owner of a Litter Mate litter box. For the last year I have used it as a regular litter box (where I would scoop myself. Just too frustrated with the mechanism of the whole thing.) Anyway, I finally found a litter that did a decent job in that box, it's hard to find one! I settled on Tidy Cats scooping litter. Well, one day I was comparing prices online at my local grocery store and at Target when I came across this system. I decided to check out Amazon and the reviews.<br /><br />With little hesitation I ordered the litter box, pellets, and pads. I also put the pellets and pads on Amazon subscription to receive 15% off each order and I could cancel at anytime. I ordered the pellets and pads because I didn't think the litter box came with anything and I was anxious to use it once I received it. Well, it did come with a 4 pack of pads and a 3 lb bag of pellets, enough to get you started.<br /><br />I set it up right away, right next to their usual litter box. I checked the pad the next day and a cat, or two, had used that box! I was so excited! I left it there for 3 weeks because neither one of my cats went #2 in the new box. I was getting discouraged. I did what was suggested by putting some of the pellets in the regular box so the cats could get used to the feel of them. Still nothing. So finally, with fingers crossed, I eliminated the regular litter box and only made available the Breeze litter box. I came home from work that evening and prayed they would use the box for both duties.....AND THEY DID!!! I was thrilled!!<br /><br />I have never smelled the #2 like some reviewers have mentioned, I don't know if they do it while I'm away or asleep, but there has been no odor.<br /><br />I would suggest either getting more than one box if you have 2 or more cats. Tidy Cats suggests 1 box for each cat plus one. I only have one box and change the pad 2 times per week and it has worked perfectly, but knowing how well it works and how easy it is to maintain, I will be buying a second one!! I love that there is no litter to vacuum up or get tracked on the wood floor only to step on in bare feet!<br /><br />I love this litter box!!<br /><br />August 9, 2008: UPDATED I still LOVE this litter box!! It is by far one of the best things ever invented! I am telling all my cat owner friends about it and insist they buy this! I have to admit, I am a lazy litter box care taker, because of a busy life. This litter box makes it a lot easier to care for and it's so quick to clean! I plan to move it to a bathroom soon so I can flush the solids since I tend to scoop them out every day or two, it would make it that much easier.<br /><br />If you are hesitating at all, you really should give it a try. I bought it before they reduced the price by $20! I risked $40 to try it, you can risk $20!

review/summary: Good for baking
review/text: I use a lot of dried blueberries in homemade protein bars and granola, and was tired of always having to make special trips to a natural food store to get dried fruit without high fructose corn syrup.  I decided to try this based on the positive reviews and the ingredients being only blueberries, sugar, and a little oil.  These were also the most economical per ounce sugar sweetened dried blueberries I could find on Amazon.  I'm satisfied with the purchase.  They are sweet, but not overwhelmingly sweet.  Each 4 ounce bag yields about 2/3 of a cup, which is good for most recipes.  They are fresh enough to snack on, too.

review/summary: Good flavor but clumped up
review/text: We really liked the flavor of garlic salt.  This product is very simple, ingredients are salt and garlic- and we like the company.  The only problem was that multiple bottles came clumped up and almost sold- like it had been wet.  We have to scrape it with a spoon to get it out.<br /><br />Now to be fair, perhaps if it had artificial ingredients it wouldn't clump.  I don't' know.

review/summary: Breakfast Blend - Nothing Special
review/text: Long time Keurig user and lifetime coffee drinker.  Breakfast Blend is for the most part a plain cup of coffee.  Light and smooth, but with a slight bitterness at the end.  I still prefer Donut Shop as a light everyday go to coffee choice, but wanted to try a box of Green Mountain BB.  Probably won't purchase again.  No one in the house has stopped me and said, "thats a great cup of coffee".  It's just plain and blah.  I'll probably struggle to finish the box honestly.

review/summary: Fine, But There's Better Out There
review/text: The Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups are pretty decent.  The main selling point of this product is its price point.  Is it good coffee?  No, not really.  Is it good coffee for 60 cents a cup?  It sure can be.  These K-Cups taste good on both size settings of Keurig machines.<br /><br />I would like to point out though, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop</a> brand of K-Cups are sold for the same price.  The Donut Shop coffee is a bit smoother in my opinion, and again, it's only 60 cents a cup.  Either way, the coffee you get won't be great, but it will be good for what you pay for.

It is  available in both regular and decaf.  And for extra savings you may want to order the 50 count box from Amazon which is only $0.60/cup now.

The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is the perfect lighter blend to exactly match my needs for a cup of coffee to start my day.

I was not disappointed.  In a couple of days I received my order.  I am drinking a cup as I write. I enjoy the flavor of the coffee with just a little sweetener added. A perfect start to my day.

review/text: I typically prefer espresso when I drink coffee beverages. However, when my in-laws bought me the Keurig I decided to start drinking regular coffee. I enjoy Breakfast Blend because it is a rich, smooth coffee without being too acidic. I can make iced coffee out of it and it doesn't get too watered down or lose it's flavor (assuming I wait about 15 minutes after brewing for the coffee to cool before pouring it over ice).

It's still too strong for my wife but it's as close as I've been able to find to satisfy her taste (she adds water to every cup no matter which setting it's brewed on). I've been unable to find a "lighter" K-cup so we've been drinking this blend for years now. If anyone knows of a "weaker" K-cup coffee, let me know!

review/summary: Mild and Pleasant.
review/text: A very mild, but pleasant blend. Not as strong as I normally prefer, but the taste is so good I drink it anyhow. It's perfect if you like to drink coffee late in the day but don't want the stomach side effects that often comes with it.<br /><br />Definitely in my top 3 of all K-Cup blends.

review/text: Having a delicious, hot, instant cup of coffee in the morning is the perfect picker-upper, eye-opener, and motivater to leave those toasty blankets behind.  BUT it took more than just the brewer to do all that.  We received ours for a Christmas gift along with our first pack of coffee and quickly had to order a new supply from you.  Why did the world wait so long for K-Cup Green Mountain Coffee?  We feel like kicking up our heels--at least mentally!  AMAZON, you are s-o-o-o good and up-to-date.

review/summary: Great breakfast coffee
review/text: I love it! I received a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas and have been trying all the different flavors. While I enjoy a flavored coffee, I like my first cup of the day to be just "coffee". I've found the perfect one with Nantcket Blend. It's not too strong, not too weak. And the twin pack is a great value. Haven't found it at the grocery store so I'm very pleased to see it offered at Amazon. While I have a supply of various flavors, Nantucket Blend is my "go to" first thing in the morning. Best way to describe it? Smoooooooth.

review/summary: Nice mild coffee that still delivers a morning kick...
review/text: My days of enjoying bold, dark coffee times have long past. Maybe it's age, or maybe it was my time in the navy when midwatch coffee was always black and bitter, and the only thing that changed when the daywatch came around was a freshening of the grounds.<br /><br />This coffee is mild without being weak, and is a nice way to start the day (or finish up a meal and settle with a good book).<br /><br />Good choice for your K-cup pantry.

review/summary: Bland
review/text: Really weak by my standards, I have to use the smallest volume on the Keurig to get decent flavor. Get extra bold cups instead if you don't like watery coffee.

review/summary: delicious
review/text: This coffee is perfect for those who don't like strong coffee shop coffee.  It's mild yet has a bold flavor.  I actually make two cups with each k-cup.  That helps me save lots of money and works perfectly when I want more than one cup in the morning.  Second cup is lighter, but it still has good flavor.

review/summary: Not What Expected....
review/text: I ordered this coffee under the impression that it was a medium roast,that was according to the brief description & by zooming in the box on my laptop. On the the side of the box it stated medium. When the coffee arrived today it is not medium it is light. No medium on the box at all, just light. I am very disapointed with this purchase as I wanted at least a medium roast flavor. To be able to get a full flavor at all you will need to use a very small amount of water & make a very small cup of coffee. I'm sure I could send it back but the hassle is not worth it, but will not buy again. If you like extremely light coffee this is for you, if you like to taste your coffee this is No good. I will order bold from now on. As far as taste there is none unless you make about a 4 oz. cup even then it's not very good.<br />Amazon did ship very fast,I received the order sooner than expected & it was packaged very well.<br />Too bad the coffee was not what I ordered/ expected.
