review/summary: PB2 is awesome
review/text: I tried PB2 at work one day and I have to admit I love it. I eat a lot of Peanut Butter and thought there is no way I would like it but it actually tastes awesome. I just wonder if you can make it ahead of time and and let it sit in the fridge so you don't have to make everytime you want to eat it.<br />So Good!!!!

review/summary: Not quite peanut butter, but a reasonable substitute
review/text: I've been on a diet and exercise program and was eating peanut butter as a snack and it started to get out of hand and I couldn't lose any weight. Well with roughly 200 calories in 2T of peanut butter, it is easy to figure out why. My trainer told me about PB2 so I got some to try and I do like it. It is NOT peanut butter, it lacks the creamy smooth taste. I guess if I had to explain what it tastes like, I would say peanut butter cookie dough - basically imagine what peanut butter would taste like mixed with flour. But given that I can eat it for 1/4 of the calories, it is a reasonable substitute when I crave peanut butter.<br /><br />As I recall, the instructions call for 2T of powder and 1T of water. I found that wasn't enough water to mix it up properly and had to put in a little extra. Over time I've found 1T of water is needed for every 1T of powder (equal parts), and that provides a creamier texture.<br /><br />If I've got a few extra calories to burn for the day, I will sometimes mix 3T of PB2, 3T of water, and 1T of real peanut butter.<br /><br />So PB2 is a great product and it is helping me meet my diet goals, but I wish it tasted more like real peanut butter. I haven't tried it in smoothies or anything like that (because I don't drink them), but I can see how that could be good if you enjoy them. I've ordered some of the chocolate flavored and I look forward to trying it.

review/summary: Peanut butter for the chubby set
review/text: Does it taste like a full fat peanut butter? No. Is the consistency the same as a full fat peanut butter? No.  Does it taste good and act as a good substitute? Yes!  I've made PBJs with this and it is not quite the same (but good), PB and honey--I don't advise it, Thai peanut sauce--excellent..  The best use of this product is in smoothies with bananas, blueberries, protein powder, and coco.  I've ordered this product twice and will continue to do so but it is by no means Jiffy in a powdered form.

I can measure my portions much more easily.  PB2 is so much easier to take with me for lunch or snacks.  PB2 is only 45 calories compared it the oily stuff's 220 calories.  PB2 is great for adding into smoothies, yogurt, curries, soups, and just about anything you can think of whilst in the kitchen.  The best reason for eating PB2-it tastes GREAT!

review/text: I am a huge fan of PB2 and have been for years.  PB2 isn't a perfect replacement for peanut butter, but it has a natural taste to it, is MUCH lower in fat and calories and is very versatile.  I was pleased to see that they are now offering larger packages of this product.<br /><br />When turning PB2 into peanut butter, don't add too much water, or the consistency will be funny and the taste gets a little diluted.  In addition to using this as a peanut butter spread, I also put PB2 powder in smoothies, on cereal and with oatmeal.

review/summary: Much Healthier, Yummy REAL Peanut Butter! Amazing!
review/text: I have difficulty controlling portion size when I eat peanut butter, which wrecks my diet, and is preventing me from losing the last 20 lbs. I need to lose. After trying the revolting Walden Farms 0 Calorie Peanut Spread, several Amazon users recommended this product. PB 2 is real peanut butter in powdered form. It's had most of the fat extracted from the peanuts. It contains just three ingredients: peanuts, salt, and sugar. It's more natural than many regular PB brands. Each 2 tbsp. serving contains 45 calories and just 1.5 g of fat (compared to 190 or 200 calories and 16 g of fat in regular PB). You mix one to two tbsp of water per two tbsp of PB2. This is one of the few diet foods that tastes the same as the regular stuff, instead of being an inferior chemical tasting imitation of the original. I mix it with sugar free syrup and spread it on an apple for a 115 calorie dessert that tastes awesome!

review/summary: For those who truly care about a healthy lifestyle with good taste
review/text: I first tried PB2 in D'Lites located on Cedar Rd. in Chesapeake. The owner raved about it and offered me a sample. I was sold at first bite! I loved the clean taste without all the sugar and additives. I bought a jar and as I continued to eat it on our Daniel Fast, I just had to go on line to order more. I offered some to my 14 yr. old granddaughter and  she is sold on it too. She also thinks it tastes better than regular peanut butter.  I can have 3 TBS, get the same amount of protein with less than 68 calories. I have mixed it in oatmeal & I have added part water and part total fruit spread for a sandwich. You get all the fun with none of the guilt and it has so much nutrition! Eating this is saying goodbye to empty calories and being able to carry it with me is a great benefit. If you really care about living a healthier lifestyle, you will want to order this awesome peanut butter.  It also comes in chocolate with the same food value. I even posted it on my facebook page.

review/text: As a major peanut butter fan, I was a little dubious when I started hearing people talk about this powdered peanut butter as if it were the best thing since sliced bread. As it turns out, PB2 is quite compatible with sliced bread, or smoothies, milkshakes, ice cream, or just by the spoonful.<br /><br />This is the real deal. All of the flavor and taste of peanut butter, without all the peanut oil.

review/summary: Great for protein bars and more!!
review/text: I love this product!  I use it as an ingredient in my homemade protein bars but also have tried it every way I can think of.  As a peanut butter junkie, I was not sure I would like this, but its great.  Mixed per the instructions with water and I think it tastes as good or better than most commercial brands and without the fat.  Okay, but I am lazy, too. I empty the original package into a glass container with a snap on lid.  I find it easier to get the product out without spilling this way.  It also makes it easy to dip bananas for each bite.  Sprinkles on vanilla or chocolate ice cream? You betcha!  Here is one that sounds weird, but don't knock it until you try it.  Mix two tbsps. powder with one tbsp. water and five or six drops of your favorite hot sauce.  Spread this over a freshly grilled hamburger and enjoy.  It sort of tastes like Thai beef satay, only better and juicier.  It is a little pricey at this size and I am hoping to find larger, bulk sizes.

review/summary: Where has this been all my life?
review/text: I hesitated to try this as, frankly, powdered peanut butter sounded repulsive.  However, since I was getting free shipping, I gave it a try.  At first taste, I thought it maybe needed a little more salt, but by my second taste, I was hooked on it, just as it is.  I like that I can add a tiny bit more water than it calls for and make it a little creamier, easier to spread.  I LOVE peanut butter, but almost always avoid it because of the fat and calories (even though I know "it's a good fat").  When you're counting calories, you just can't have 200 calories for 2T of peanut butter very often.  45 calories?  Done!  I love this stuff and don't think I will ever be without it in my pantry again.

review/text: Yeah, you have to add some water to it and you have to be good at that to get something you want to eat, but it's not impossible.

It's real peanutbutter with the fat taken out.  Other companies have tried to make this, but none have sold it in the powder form until this.<br /><br />  Put some dry powder in your cream of wheat....yum!<br /><br />So this works.  I bought the packets so I could try it out.  Love it.<br />Buying more.<br />Just know, that it's going to be a little different, but in the end, you'll learn how the product works and you'll find your own wonderful uses!<br /><br />Sprinkle on popcorn with splenda and I can't believe it's not butter spray!<br />HEAVEN!<br /><br />:)

review/summary: Very Good But Not Peanut Butter
review/text: I used to buy Better'n Peanut Butter but this is by far a better alternative. At first, I was a little leery about having to reconstitute my peanut butter but this is a very tasty alternative and the dehydration makes the product more versatile. I would suggest that you make sure that the product is well mixed or the consistency will be bumpy/powdery and not as good. Occasionally, I will add a little stevia to sweeten the mixture and make it a little more like peanut butter. Today, I am buying 6 more so I definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Simply Amazing!!
review/text: I was pretty excited when I accidentally came across this product on Amazon! But --- I really like peanut butter, and how could they make it taste good and take all that oil and all those calories out? A ton of reviewers claimed it was good - but I just had to see for myself. I ordered both the regular and chocolate.  I couldn't wait to get the shipment. It came today (sooner than expected) - and I immediately mixed up the regular PB2. At first it looked like grainy stuff and water. I kept stirring - and pretty soon my spoon was coated with peanut butter - and I had a nice little mound of peanut butter in the bowl! Well - at least it looks like peanut butter - that's something! Then I tasted a little with my finger. Wait .... WHAT?? Seriously - it really IS peanut butter!! It looks like it, smells like it and tastes like it! I grew up in the mid-west, enjoying peanut butter and sweet pickle sandwiches. (Yes - sounds weird, I know - but have you tried it? Wonderful!) I'm trying to lose weight and eat healthier - and those can't be enjoyed very often. I've been using the high fiber whole grain tortillas that are only 50 calories - so I spread some PB2 down the center - and placed a few pickle slices on top. I rolled up and tasted ----- perfect! I know I'm going to love this stuff! Another thing I like to do - is just scoop a spoonful of peanut butter and eat it (we call it a "peanut butter pop"). Well guess what - this is good enough that you can even do that! If you are used to Jiff like I am - just sprinkle a bit of Splenda in the PB2 as you mix it up for that little bit of extra sweetness! I read a few reviews by people who said PB2 wasn't anything like real peanut butter - and I have to say, I have no idea what they are talking about!! I was fully prepared to sacrifice flavor for the goal of lowering fat and calories - but I'm so excited to find out I don't have to! Oh - and the PB2 Chocolate is pretty darned good stuff too! Buy PB2 and try it for yourself - you'll find a million ways to use it, I'm sure! All I wonder - is where has this been, and why didn't I know about it? I'll be telling every nutrition conscious person I know! Happy, healthy eating!!

review/text: Bought this product on Amazon just over a week ago, and it's almost gone already! That should suffice for the "how'd you like it?" part. It's a pretty good sub for actual pb on sandwiches, etc., (found it mixed better with a bit of hot water rather than cold) but it's at least as good if not better in smoothies. First day, I tried it with the banana as folks had suggested, but discovered I liked it even better with just cold almond milk. Since then, I've been adding a packet or two of stevia and a tablespoon of ground flax to the mixture and having it in a tall glass with ice cubes; tastes like a pb milkshake! Yum. Only slight negative is the sugar they add to the powder; would prefer if this company sold a plain pb version (with or without the salt). Other than that, it's just about perfect.

review/summary: The Best Thing Since Sliced Bread!
review/text: I used to go to summer camp when I was a kid and my nickname was the Peanut Butter Kid because I put peanut butter on everything.  I put it on watermelon and I used to put it in my cup of vanilla ice cream.  This was in 1970 before peanut butter and ice cream was an actual flavor at ice cream parlors.  I should have patented it at that time, but what did a 10 year old girl know?<br /><br />As I got older my love for peanut butter grew and I continued to put it on all kinds of things and of course, peanut butter sandwiches.  Sometimes with jelly, sometimes with marshmallow fluff and frequently just plain peanut butter on bread!  To this day, it is still one of my favorites.  Because peanut butter is so fattening, I hardly ever eat it.....until, I discovered PB2.  Oh my goodness, what an awesome, awesome discovery.  Peanut Butter with a fraction of the calories and all of the taste.<br /><br />PB2 is dehydrated peanut butter where the fat has been squeezed out of the peanuts so what is left is pure protein, no guilt goodness!  I'm always dieting and watching my weight and PB2 has made it so much easier.  There are so many ways to eat this PB2.  I add a teaspoon to protein drinks in the morning.  I rehydrate it with water and dip carrots, apples and watermelon in it.  I mix jelly directly into the PB2 and put in inside a whole wheat tortilla and roll it up.  If you like Pad Tai, make some noodles, shred some carrots and other vegetables and toss some PB2 in and you have a nice Pad Thai.<br /><br />When mixed with water, the texture is very similar to smooth peanut butter, but a bit drier because the oil has been removed.  The taste is pure peanut.  A drop of honey can easily be added for a sweet touch.<br /><br />PB2 is easy to travel with and I always have some with me when I leave home as I like to have healthy snacks when the urge hits.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this peanut butter for anyone who loves peanut butter and is watching their weight.  With PB2, you can have your cake and eat it too!

review/text: I have not used this on a sandwich bread to make a peanut butter sandwich but i have used it to enhance my whey protein shake, and ON natural vanilla whey with water was ok but not good, adding some pb2 to it made it good enough for me to drink daily.

review/text: I've been buying this wonderful product in the jars, but since I use so much of it, and the taste is so great, I've not upgraded to buying it in the larger bag.  So happy that this product is available to let me enjoy my peanut butter taste, without so much fat.  I don't know how much sugar is in it, but I don't think it is a big amount, and not worried about it.

review/summary: PB2 is good
review/text: I'm a big peanut butter consumer but was on the lookout for a lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, then I found PB2.  This stuff makes it very convenient to add extra protein and flavor to your diet at any time of the day.  No mixing thick, oily peanut butter is really nice.  Or, wondering what the other 10% of the ingredients are in that off-the-shelf brand of peanut butter. The single packages are pretty expensive, so I think next time I will be ordering the twelve pack of 6.5 ounce bottles instead.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: Being a peanut butter lover, I decided to try this in my daily protein shakes to cut back on calories. I add 1 serving to my usual fruit smoothie and it blends very well and tastes great.  I also like to add a serving of it to my coffee drinks, but just know that if you mix it in with a spoon, it will eventually settle at the bottom of water based drinks. The nutritional benefit is 5g of protein per serving and a mere 40 calories (versus 180 calories for a serving of peanut butter). Unfortunately when you cut out the calories, you also cut out the heart healthy fats so I wouldn't recommend it as a complete substitute for real peanut butter if you're eating peanut butter for healthy heart reasons. However, if you're like me and love the peanut butter taste and your want a quick 5g of protein here and there, and need to watch your calories, it's definitely worth it.

review/text: Although it doesn't compare to Jif, which is my favorite PB, it is very good. I do miss the salt though, so I add just a pinch. My daughter and niece(who is one of the pickiest eaters)like it also. I love the fact that it is so low in fat because I eat a lot of peanut butter. Its nice to have a lower fat product to choose from. I also really like the larger bag compared to the jar.

review/summary: Tastes like real peanut butter
review/text: At first, using PB2 was confusing as the ratio of powder to water in the directions gave me a very dry crumbly mess. As I experimented, I found adding more water, a little at a time, gave me the consistency of peanut butter that I desired. I like that the fat is almost all removed and when prepared, can be used just like regular peanut butter with much less calories. A treat for me as I love peanut butter but can enjoy it more so using PB2.<br /><br />I did remove one star as I'm not happy that sugar is added to this product (wish it was an artificial sweetener or nothing at all).

review/summary: Pros and Cons
review/text: In my never ending quest to find low calorie nutritious food, I bought some of this powdered peanut butter. I love peanut butter and eat a little bit most days of the week.  I am somewhat conditioned to the natural flavor and richness of the real thing.<br />I'd read that this PB2 is not the same as regular peanut butter, but many reviewers say it's a good substitute.  Therefore I expected it to be different, but not distasteful. I'm used to eating healthy fare and realize there has to be a trade off.  However, I was quite disappointed in this product. It feels chalky and tastes like stale fake peanuts. For someone on a restricted diet who is desperate to eat some type of peanut butter, this may work. I'll stick to the regular stuff and continue on my way.

review/text: So, I have to admit I was initially skeptical of powder and water making peanut butter, but this stuff is pretty good! It's my first try, so I will have to perfect measurements - so far I'm thinking I might try closer to a 1:1 ratio instead of 2:1...it will help the product to go further too. It tastes good and smells even better - very pure and peanutty, plus, I am always happy to save calories, especially on higher fat foods like nut spreads. I imagine it would travel well in small containers. Of course, on the downside, it's quite bit more expensive than good old Jif...

review/text: I was excited to try PB2 after reading so many rave reviews.  Now that I've tried it, I wholeheartedly concur. This really is an amazing product.  It's easy to prepare and it tastes fantastic!  I love to cook.  Anything and everything.  But I've been looking for new ways to curb calories without losing flavor and the joy of the food.  Initially when I bought this, my goal was to make a lower calorie satay sauce without losing that wonderful peanut flavor. Now that I've tasted PB2, I'm sure it will make a great peanut sauce.  Plus I can imagine making lower calorie cookies and PB&Js and who knows what else?  If you're experimenting in the kitchen like I am (a la Bobby Deen reworking Paul Deen), consider giving this a try.

review/summary: Roxy loves it! It must be Good :)
review/text: We recently acquired a beautiful Yorkie named Roxy.  Roxy is very sweet, energetic and well behaved, rarely barks and only as a real "alert".  However, having a cat for many years who has recently defected to my son's house, I was not "geared up" for a dog, much less a picky eater.  As she stayed with us, we fell in love with her and I was concerned that she was not thriving on the other brand of dog food.  At the local PetSmart I saw this on the shelf and bought the small bag on impulse.  The cost was more than twice what I paid for the other brand, but Roxy now eats her entire portion as soon as it has been placed in her dish.  She gets excited when I am cooking supper, because she knows her dinner will be served before mommy and daddy sit down to eat!  She is thriving and still energetic and her coat seems to be getting silkier.  Roxy votes 4 paws up for this!

review/text: I ordered an Aglaia Odorata Chinese Perfume Rice Plant Bonsai from 9GreenBox on September 27, 2012 and it arrived 4 days later on October 1, 2012.  It arrived in good shape, wrapped in plastic.<br /><br />The plant splits into 2 branches or stems.  It is 9" tall and 9" wide.  There are many little green leaves.  There are no flowers or buds.  It is a nice-sized plant and it does look like a little bonsai or penjing in its shape or form.<br /><br />October 17, 2012 Update<br /><br />In less than a month, the plant is growing fast, perhaps showing about 2" of new light green growth on each of four separate tips.  I had previously repotted it in a regular unglazed clay pot, about 1 or 2 sizes larger.  It receives a little sun and bright indirect light and I water it like a regular houseplant.  Temperature is about 73 degrees during the day and about 65 degrees at night, with the humidity on the high side.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />Bonsai (Japanese) comes from penjing (Chinese) as this art of shaping miniature trees or plants was first developed and continues today in China.

review/summary: too sweet
review/text: What do they add?  Is it the marshmallow root?  (There's no stevia.)  This tea has a sickening sweetness all its own.  If you accidentally bought it, like me, here's a tip:  try adding lemon juice to your cup just so you can use up the box without throwing it away.

review/summary: A great discovery
review/text: My voice is my job. In the last months I felt a bit tired. My voice was a bit veiled. In some specialized Linkedin forums someone sayd this product is a sort of cure-all. So I bought it, but I was a bit skeptical. I was amazed by the positive effects on my voice. And now Throat coat tea is one of the most important working tools.

review/summary: Best tea ever . . . for the benefits
review/text: I think people these days would benefit from being schooled in writing an appropriate review.  Really now.  I'm on here because of the person that gave this product 2 stars.  This product is well known in the voice over/singing  business - as the best tea for the benefits it provides.  You do have to steep it a while before drinking & in my opinion, the tea is not very paletable.  But I am willing to drink it for the benefits it provides.  If you are a singer or voice over artist - it does exactly what it says: it coats your throat & you can sing or talk for a very long time.  It's worth a try & the Slippery Elm DOES indeed coat your throat.<br /><br />Thanks ~<br />Rose of Rose Recordings, LLC<br />rosecllc dot com

review/text: I never rate things on here but I had to make an exception for this tea. Usually any hot drink will alleviate some discomfort in a sore throat, but this throat coat tea goes above and beyond that. No matter if it's a sore throat from sinus drainage, a cold, or whatever else, this tea has always cleared up all the itchy, scratchy, and painful problems I've had for at least a couple of hours at a time. That's more than a lot of medicine is able to do.

review/summary: Healthiest Dog Food Available
review/text: I have large German Shepherds with sensitive tummies who are also fussy eaters. Outside of a RAW diet, Wellness CORE, canned and kibble, is the ONLY food I will feed them.  Grain free with human grade meats, no fillers or meat by-products, CORE has helped stabilize their digestive systems, control their weight, and minimizes the size of their stools (highly digestible content means less output - gross, but those with big dogs will understand!) The 95% canned meats are also great mixed with kibble as an occasional treat (expensive per can) and I am looking forward to trying the new canned stew products.  My three cats are also Wellness Heathy Indoor Cats kibble fans though they won't touch the canned products. Wellness is hard to find (Petco is the only chain I know that carries it) so I appreciate being able to get it through Amazon.

The Grizzly brand I have used for year always came leaking so much that the cardboard box was saturated.  Even the replacements were leaking!  After the last time I purchased Grizzly off Amazon even the UPS guy complained about the leaking and smell to his truck.<br /><br />I like the aluminum can, making is almost crush proof and the fact that there is virtually no scent to the oil.  Maybe the dogs will not enjoy it as much with out the fishy odor but I certainly prefer the scent-free oil.

review/text: I took off 1 star as it states unscented - it is very scented! Extreme fishy smell, but the cats like fish, so it actually enhances some of the bland smelling canned foods to entice them. I squirt the recommended amount on at least 1 of their 2 meals per day. Two of my cats had places on their tummies like a "hot spot" in dogs. Both are healing after using this oil daily on their food.

His hair was very lank and thin and lots of little bumps and sores.  I read many reviews for the different kinds of fish oil for pets and settled on this one not because it was the cheapest but because people said it worked.  Within less than a week, my cat's fur was looking better and the sores were healing.  This product positively works and I will buy it again for my cat. Easy to use and my cat loves it!  Laps it up all by itself; don't even have to put it on his food.

review/summary: This oil is from farmed salmon, beware!!
review/text: If you are giving your dog salmon oil, I would highly suggest finding one that is from wild salmon - it has many more benefits than farmed and is much healthier for your dog.  Farmed salmon are given antibiotics and fed grain, and therefore don't produce the pink color naturally as they're not allowed to do their native behaviors. I had been using this brand for about a year, and once I found this out I switched to Alaskan as it's the same price and much healthier. Do your research before buying the right salmon oil.

review/summary: Human Consumption or Not?
review/text: The product description here states "These bottles are FDA-approved to hold liquids used for human consumption", however, the label on the bottle states "for animal use only". Technically, people are animals of course, and I assume the manufacturers means to say "not for human consumption". Amazon's description of this product is misleading I think because the statement about the bottle suggests this can also be used by humans. I know I bought it thinking to use it for my cats and myself. Now I don't know what to do.

I'm still unsure whether the noticeable calming feature is a placebo effect or is actually due to certain substances, but either way, it works.

The quality of Tim Horton's coffee is pretty remarkable -- it is very, very good -- and the price is not outrageous (I picked up a 39 ounce can in a Canadian Walmart for about $16.50 in American dollars toward the end of november, 2010, which was about the same price they were selling for in the Tim Horton's stores.) Note: Their decaf is every bit as good, but I haven't been able to find it in cans larger than 13 ounces.

review/summary: Fantastic Fondant!!!
review/text: This is great fondant. I always get compliments on its taste. Rolls out easy, great flavor, brilliant color. Fondarific comes in great colors (no more stained hands). Only complaint is that it sometimes is a little too pliable and it does get that elephant skin issue. Hands down way better than any fondant found in chain craft store. Plus it's a better value!

review/summary: Delicious and easy to work with
review/text: I purchased this recently and have been pleasantly surprised by the taste. It's a chocolate flavor and very smooth when you work with it. The only problem is that it can get a bit too soft, so you can't roll it too thin or it'll tear when you're lifting it up to put it on the cake. I've had to re-roll it on more than one occasion because of this. It tastes worlds better than Wilton fondant, that's for sure.
