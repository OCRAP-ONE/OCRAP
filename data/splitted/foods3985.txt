review/summary: Terrible Deal!!
review/text: Come on, people!  This is a complete rip off!  Paying at over $36 for only 12 bottles at 50.7 ounces apiece is paying over $3 for not even a HALF gallon!!  If you buy at this price you are paying over $6 for a single gallon of FUJI water!!  Outrageous!!  DON'T BE A FOOLISH SUCKER!!  DO NOT BUY AT THIS CRIMINAL PRICE!  There are much better deals for water that tastes just as good.

review/summary: Best taste but a bit expensive
review/text: The best water for tea is not heavily mineralized, orderless, and crisp. By these metrics, Fiji is by far the best water. And so, I buy Fiji to drink straight. Crisp (vs flat) means to have disolved oxygen - which is more likely if cold and not repeated reboiled. Tap water is not acceptable due to typically being chlorinated and deoxygenated (filtering will likely not help). Some people prefer the taste of highly mineralized water (such as Tucson's tap water). And so, the two best selling brands (Pepsi Aquafina and Coca-Cola Dasani) are just straight from the tap. Coca-Cola even adds salts to help create that perfect tap flavor. But, salts can produce negative interactions with tea. Water for tea should ideally be pH neutral (7). My son feels a neutral pH is most important - but I normally drink tea with lemon juice ... and so a high pH might actually be better for the low pH of lemons. Did a blind test taste with friends and found the one water everyone liked least (always below Tucson's hard tap water) was Costco's Kirkland brand. Moreover, my son (and others) agreed Fugi is the best tasting water. To save money when making tea (I drink more tea than plain water), however, I use Highland Spring.<br /><br />Well recognized waters that tea experts around the globe agree are ideally suited for making exceptional tea include (in order of my preference):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T7YQFK">Highland Spring Non Carbonated Spring Water, 50.7-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> (United Kingdom)<br />Best deal at half the price of others (pH 7.8)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013T5YO4">FIJI Natural Artesian Water, 50-Ounce bottle (Pack of 12)</a> (Fuji) Best tasting (pH 7.5)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIPAU">Crystal Geyser Spring Sport, 33.8-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> (United States pH 7.9)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267A38Y">Volvic Natural Spring Water, 500ml- Bottles (Pack of 24)</a> (France pH 7.0)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANW7HQ">Nutriteam Countertop Water Distiller Stainless, Glass Collection</a><br />Don't use water immediately to allow for disolving of oxygen

review/text: I have a Pur faucet filter so I usually do not buy bottled water. At a local store the 1L bottle was on sale so I got one thinking how different can it be. Very different. I could drink a gallon a day of this water. I have kept filling up the bottle with my faucet filter water. I have been sick all summer and not done much at all so I am treating myself to this water at the subscribe price. Maybe only twice a year but a no calorie treat that I really love, what could be better. :)

review/text: Unbelievable. I don't know if this water actually comes from Fiji but I do know that anyone who would buy it is a fool. Not only is it ridiculously expensive, but the environmental impact is unconscionably high. You've got not only the plastic bottle, which will be around virtually forever, but you cause water - WATER!!! - to be shipped from the other side of the world to you. Which do you think is greater... the number of gallons of water moved or the number of gallons of fuel burned in this preposterous venture?

review/summary: Smooth and Rich
review/text: A friend brought a high quality black tea straight from London for me to try. I didn't have the heart to tell her, but the Yorkshire tea beat it hands down. This tea manages to have a very rich, bracing, flavor without any sharp edges to it.<br /><br />I normally drink gourmet quality, loose tea in Oolong, green, white, Mate, and sometimes black. I will still always choose the Yorkshire when I crave black, even over the high grade loose. All you have to do is put a little milk and sugar in it and you will not find a more satisfying cup of black tea to be had anywhere. Thank you Taylors of Harrogate for getting it exactly right and at a good price.

review/text: Yorkshire Red is a great tea which makes a good strong, but not too strong, pot of tea. It has a nice smooth mellow flavor and a pleasing aroma.  It's my wife's favorite tea.  She uses one tea bag to make a whole pot. I myself prefer the Yorkshire Gold, which is a bit stronger and has a bit sharper taste.  I don't take milk in my tea, but I would bet that both of these teas would be great with milk.

review/summary: Not the lovely tea I remember from England....
review/text: My first experience with this tea was nothing less than magical.  We had flown over, not slept particularly well in coach, powered through a whirlwind tour of London with a friend, and ending up celebrating Guy Fawkes day.  We had not slept in two days, It was one o-clock in the morning in England, and we were wide awake with fireworks still going off.  What to do?  The curious little red teabag and some sweet biscuits were in sight.  Let's just have a cup of tea.  From opening the bag, the magical fragrance filled them room.  The tea itself was nothing short of amazing.  Let me emphasize though, THIS IS NOT THAT TEA.  If I wanted something akin to lipton, I could have bought 200 bags for $3.00 at anywhere in the states.  This is what I would imagine would have been swept from the floor and thrown away in England.  "Nah, we'll put it in bags and send it to the Yanks, they won't know any better".  I am definitely happy I did not order the bulk shipment.  The only tea I have seen so far that drinks like a proper english cuppa is Ty-phoo.  The box I received just tastes really old, the date on the side is still good for another year, truthfully though, I would be embarrassed to serve this, it's terrible.

review/summary: Good results but contains soy
review/text: I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with "filler" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.

review/text: I tried this food for free through BzzAgent. My dog is about a year old but VERY active, so have him on puppy food still because he's smallish and has trouble keeping weight on. He is allergic to something, I'm not sure if it's environmental or food, but he didn't have a reaction to this food. This is corn-free so I'm wondering if that's what he's allergic to.<br />He did very well on it, and had nice solid stools and wasn't excessively flaky or itchy. He tends to bolt his food so the very small pieces weren't that great. He wouldn't chew it and then ended up vomiting afterward; I had to give him small amounts at a time. I'd rather they had kibble size options, but I'm being picky now.<br />I'm not thrilled that the second ingredient is wheat, but at least it's not corn. Sagan seemed to do well on it. If it was less expensive than the food I have him on now (that he also does very well on), I'd have no problem using or recommending this food.

review/summary: Doesn't Have Unpleasant Odor
review/text: If you've bought the new formula of Hill's Science Diet dog food, you may have noticed an extreme fragrance.  It is unpleasant to humans, but the dogs seem to like it (if you get my drift--think, "base of a fire hydrant").  This is unnecessary because the dogs liked it before and it had a tolerable dog food odor for humans to smell.  The new stuff is odiferous in a disgusting way.  I don't want that fragrance in my house, let alone the kitchen, which is where the dogs eat.<br /><br />This new stuff is probably the same as the old stuff only now you get less of it and it costs more.  Sigh.  So you pay more for less food, but at least it isn't stinky.  The dogs like it just as much as they did before.<br /><br />I hope Amazon will begin to carry this product in the large size.  We have two "mature" labs, so we will always need a supply of this food.  The local pet store isn't open 24 hours and doesn't always have what we want.<br /><br />This would be a terrific item for "Subscribe and Save".

review/summary: Food You Can Feel Great About Feeding Your Dog
review/text: I have a 8.5 year old Jack Russell who I view as one of my 'children' and not just a dog. She is very food motivated and we're yet to find a dog food she won't eat, however, she's struggled with acid reflux issues and all night 'hiccups' for most of her life. So I was excited for the opportunity to try HIlls Science Diet Ideal Dog Food to see if it would help her with this issue. I am also very pleased to be feeding her food with NATURAL and REAL MEAT ingredients as it makes me feel better about what she's taking in and the quality of the food. Not surprisingly she took to the food right away. I've never been one to like the smell of dog food, but I certainly didn't find the smell to be any more offensive than any other food like the other reviewer mentioned. I actually placed out a piece of 3 different types of food in front of my dog and she immediately whe went for the Hills Science Diet Ideal Balance food, so I'm guessing that she found it to be more appealing too. Although I haven't seen a HUGE improvement on her reflux issue, it has seemed to helped a bit and I'll take any help I can at this point. In fact, she's only been on the diet a few weeks now, and I know it generally takes a bit longer for it's full effects, so I'm very optimistic that it will provide even more improvement in the future. The only negatives I have about the food are that I had a hard time opening the bag and the top actually ripped open so I wasn't able to use the reasealable closure (but that could've been due to my impatience), and it seems to be a bit pricey. BUT, it's worth it for the quality and if it helps. Definitely would recommend! I am a buzzagent and did receive a free 4 lb bag and coupons to try the product.

She also has itchy problems for a lot of the year but improved with the use of this food.<br />I also noted that my girl seemed to need less of this than most other brands of dog food out there. This means I'm buying less food in the long run which makes the food comparable in price to less healthy alternatives.<br />The only complaints I have is the use of the wheat ingredient plus the soy. I really would like to see this product use another protein source that is more within the natural diet of a canine.

review/text: I used this instead of the water called for in an Umbrian Fish Soup recipe from epicurious.com<br />This was the only fish stock available at whole foods, so I figured I'd try it...The flavor is excellent. You can make about 4-5 cups of stock with the small tub of concentrate. It was worth every penny.

review/summary: Detailed reply from company over infant feeding and DHA/ARA
review/text: MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!<br /><br />Hey guys,<br />So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.<br />So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature's One�.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic� formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic� formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic� falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic� formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic� formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials� DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials� DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, "The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children," Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your interest in Baby's Only Organic� formulas. Please let me know if you have additional questions.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Lori<br />Nature's One Inc.[...]

review/summary: Wonderful formula
review/text: It's so nice that it's not filled with things that should just NOT be in formula.<br />No ingredients are purchased from China.<br />Contains no palm oil.<br /><br />I also am impressed that they don't use corn syrup to sweeten their formulas. It's brown rice syrup which is a better carbohydrate than most use.<br /><br />In response to no added DHA/ARA this is found on their website so it is not lacking.. and who wants DHA/ARA made by martex which is derived from laboratory-grown fermented algae and fungus and processed utilizing a toxic chemical, hexane anyway?<br /><br />Baby's Only Organic� pediatric formulas contain two essential (precursor) fats: Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA) and Linoleic Acid (LA). Alpha-Linolenic and Linoleic fatty acids are called "essential" because the human body cannot make these fats and therefore it is essential to derive them from food sources. Alpha-Linolenic Acid is an omega-3 used by the body to make Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA). Linoleic Acid is an omega-6 used by the body to make Arachidonic Acid (ARA). DHA and ARA are called "non-essential" fatty acids because full-term, healthy infants, children, and adults can manufacture these from Alpha-Linolenic and Linoleic fatty acids.

review/summary: Good formula but doesn't contain DHA or ARA
review/text: Just to clear up some confusion here is the quote from the manufacture's website:<br /><br />"Baby's Only Organic� Dairy-based Toddler Formula contains alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA), the fatty acid precursors for Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Arachidonic acid (ARA)."<br /><br />Conversion of ALA and LA by the body to the more active longer-chain metabolites is inefficient: 2-5% for DHA.  So while adding ALA to your child's diet is helpful it is not a complete substitute for the ARA and DHA found in breast milk (of course no formula can match breast milk).<br /><br />If you want to use this brand of formula you should consider adding DHA and ARA some other way.  This same company makes a supplement called "Baby's Only Essentials� DHA & ARA" and there are others on the market.

review/summary: Finally a great formula!
review/text: I have been using Babys Only Organic Formula (dairy) for my daughter for 2 months now (she was 4 months old when we started) and I am absolutely thrilled with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very complete formula, superior nutritional value (more calcium!) than leading brands and YES, IT DOES CONTAIN DHA & ARA!!! (not like another reviewer says. Check out Nature's One website for more info).<br /><br />It is less expensive than the leading brands!!<br /><br />My daughter never had any problem digesting the formula, and is absolutely thriving on it :)<br /><br />I tried Enfamil (what I used with my first child) and other brands of formulas, but she would not drink them. This is the only formula she has liked. It DOES taste (and smell!) better than the leading brands.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It becomes foamy when you first shake the bottle to dissolve the powder, but the foam disappears if you let the bottle sit for a few minutes.<br /><br />The powder dissolves better if you mix it in warm water.<br /><br />Overall, a great formula that I have been recommending to many of my friends. :)

review/text: I was unable to breastfeed my daughter and after much research of formulas and stress as to what to feed my daughter I decided on this one.  She started gaining weight and is healthy.  Unlike my other children on Enfamil she did not have the gas and colic that went along with them. She is a happy, healthy baby.  I love that fact that the formula does not have sugar but uses brown rice syrup because of the health factors associated with sugar and fructose.  I am glad that it is organic and does not have all the garbage other formulas carry as well.<br /><br />An overall great formula!

review/text: This is the best formula ever. be careful using it in infants under year. they can react to the brown rice syrup. My daughter had a mild reaction so I kept using the Carnation Good Start Purple can without the harmful DHA additive and then at 11 months switched her to this organic formula and it was a total success. We have chosen to keep her on it until 2 since she is soooo healthy and is never sick. I buy it direct from the vendor but saw the review here and had to share! You will be so happy with this baby milk. So easy to use and if you call the vendor directly they will mail you scoopers! Sooo convenient.

review/summary: taste and smell good but not suitable for  my baby
review/text: - Pros: Smell and taste much better than Similac and Enfamil. Cost much less.<br /><br />- Cons:<br /><br />1. No DHA and ARA. You would need to buy DHA/ARA supplement from Nature's Ones.<br /><br />2. After mixing, it makes a lot of bubbles on top of the milk as well as within the milk. That bothers our baby very much.<br /><br />3. Stool is very loose (if not diarrhea). One time our baby was constipated and I fed him with Babys Only formula and it helped with constipation.  So cons turns into pros in this case :-)<br /><br />I really like the taste of this formula and thought we could use it for our baby. Too bad it seems causing diarrhea/very loose stool and our baby poops 3 times a day instead of once.<br /><br />We are using Similac Organic and everything wents very well. Except when we tried to feed our baby rice cereal in addition to formula, he got constipated and we use Babys Only formula to solve the constipation problem.

review/summary: The best formula out there
review/text: We love this formula, but in particular the probiotic supplement that Nature's One makes works so well. Our 3 month old had her second dose today and her stools are already back to looking exactly like they did when she was breastfed. I think the best part about this formula is that the milk comes from organic farms that graze their cattle 250-300 days per year and take excellent care of the animals (Cornucopia Institute report). Animal welfare is extremely important to me and I can feel good about this product (my husband and I are vegan). I was devastated when breast feeding didn't work out but at least we found a formula that is truly filled with the best organic ingredients and comes from reputable sustainable organic farms that treat the animals well. It also tastes better than other ones I've tried and my chubby little girl sucks it right down. The same company also makes DHA supplements from organic eggs, even though the formula itself contains more of the precursors than the leading brands...which they say leads them to believe the amounts in Baby's Only are sufficient for the baby to truly make their own DHA (Nature's One website).

review/summary: Arsenic
review/text: Research the latest news on arsenic levels in Babys Only formula.<br /><br />Unfortunately the FDA is behind the power curve when it comes to regulations. More often than not products are put on the market and the consumers are the guinea pigs. The FDA and the pharmaceutical companies that fund them and money making corporations exist on greed.<br />China is the only country that sets limits for arsenic in food - 0.15ppb. Rice grown in the US has 250ppb of arsenic.<br /><br />I am sick that I gave my beautiful baby boy Babys Only Organic Formula.<br /><br />As the company was not forthcoming about the levels of arsenic in the formula prior to being exposed by the Dartmouth study I will not buy their product. To me their responses on the website seem defensive and an attempt to put down non-organic formula rather than truly apologize for any distress they have caused.<br /><br />Naturally their self appointed testing company would show low levels of arsenic. They would not be employed otherwise. How much arsenic was my baby exposed to? I will never know. The effects can be insidious.  Did he have headaches? Difficult to prove and unless you can prove nothing will be done.<br /><br />The kicker is - it is Organic!! I know about the toxins in the non organic formula. Everyone who buys organic does. That is why they buy organic. Sadly money talks. You can't even trust organic.

review/summary: The yummy goodness of dried Sichuan peppers
review/text: Sometimes a new flavor is off-putting.  Sometimes we have to try it a few times before we get past the unfamiliarity and are able to appreciate the new sensations our tongue is telling us. But sometimes you try something new, and you just think "Yum!"<br /><br />That is what happened to me when I was living in Japan, and I reached for the unfamiliar little green bottle with the indecipherable writing and sprinkled some on my food.  Yum.<br /><br />Sansho is the dried and ground husk of the Sichuan pepper, which is neither a peppercorn nor a chili pepper.  It looks more like a berry when you see it on the tree, or like a coffee bean.  The peppers are used widely in Asian cooking, especially Chinese Sichuan (also spelled "Szechwan") cooking. Sansho has the unique quality of slightly numbing the tongue, which allows you to experience more of the flavor and less of the heat of other peppers. That makes it is one of the key ingredients in the famous Chinese 5-Spice and the Japanese 7-Spice blends.<br /><br />On its own, sansho doesn't taste like pepper.  It has a more aromatic character, almost a lemony/spicy quality.  In Japan, it is said that sansho tastes like spring. The spice is traditionally used on unagi eel, or as a topping for hot noodle broths like udon.<br /><br />Personally, I can put sansho on pretty much anything.  It tastes great on scrambled eggs or pan-fried potatoes. I even recently made a batch of sansho chicken sausage that turned out fantastic. If you give it a taste, you will soon find plenty of foods that you think will benefit from a sprinkling of sansho.<br /><br />This little green "S & B Sansho" bottle is about as ubiquitous as it gets in Japan.  I don't know if I had any other kind of sansho, and I am thrilled that I can still get this in the US.

review/text: I've never been one of those chocolate addicts, but could always appreciate the intense flavor of dark chocolate. Plus the antioxidant properties in cocoa beans have are one reason to eat it. This company is located in beautiful Boulder, Colorado. I find their flavors to be really good and well thought out. Having bits of things in the chocolate make it much more enjoyable than just some boring flavored chocolate.<br /><br />The crystallized ginger bits are great in the bar. The flavor of the chocolate is not overly bittersweet at all like some other bars, which makes it almost addicting. I do wish they added about twice the amount of ginger though and that it would have a more chewy texture than just crunchy. Some bites you get very little or none but some you get a nice amount, so it varies and that is okay. I also didn't really find that spiciness I wanted from the ginger. The flavor was there though and sometimes pretty intense, so overall it was great.<br /><br />A great product from a good company.

They honestly don't taste like there are any anchovies in there.  Even when I pick out one of the things they claim are anchovies, they don't really taste much like anything.  The olives more than make up for any lack of stuffing.  Some green olives are fairly firm and kind of bitter.  These are soft and buttery with a mild flavor.  And they are some of the best olives I have had.  The cans are kind of small as they are only 3 oz.

review/summary: tasteless olives
review/text: Roland Anchovy olives I purchased for the zing and flavor I expected in full bodied Anchovy olives. The olives are OK for those that do not like Anchovy taste.  My opinion, the olives need more Anchovy taste.

review/summary: Roland Stuffed olives
review/text: The olives arrived fast and were delicious.  The cans are small but are perfect for one person.  The best olives with anchovies are the La explandia gourmet olives in a black can. They are kinda expensive so these olives are the perfect compromise to the premium brand.

review/summary: I wish these olives tasted better
review/text: I love olives, but these are not up to par. There is an aftertaste, perhaps due to the added chemicals?<br /><br />The juice, however, is wonderful, so be sure to save it for a drink--I like it as is, but it would be great in a dirty martini*.<br /><br />It was difficult to discern any anchovy taste (or texture), but these are quite passable with a dollop of cream cheese. It seems to cut the aftertaste.<br /><br />Wish I liked them more, I really wanted to...but had I seen the ingredient list, I wouldn't have bought them.<br /><br />If you love green olives and anchovies, buy some of each and stuff them yourself.<br /><br />*If you're stuck with most of the 12-pack, throw a martini party, one can per drink :) Let them add their olive juice and olives. If they like olives, after the martini they will eat them :)

review/text: Anchovy-stuffed olives are the best stuffed olives of them all, and no, the anchovy cream has a very mild taste and does NOT taste as strong as the canned anchovies you put on pizzas. A perfect balance between the saltiness of the olive and the creaminess of the filling.  These are my husband's favorites, and he doesn't even like anchovies!

review/text: I used to get these from my brother who was working in Spain and would bring them back. Went into withdrawal when he moved back to the states. These are the real deal and with prime not too expensive. I love the flavor on salads, so I buy salad olives and use a can of these to marinate the cheaper (already slice) salad olives. Works great.

review/summary: Experience the Taste!
review/text: Some time ago, my wife came home with a small container of Mediterranean Sea Salt. I was somewhat taken back by the price, but it was an excellent salt, of that there was no question. Well, that salt is now almost gone, but we were wandering down the spice isle in our local warehouse store and there was a grinder/bottle of Kirkland Signature Mediterranean Sea Salt. Well, we just had to try it. As for the cost, the Kirkland salt was under half the cost on a per ounce basis.<br /><br />The Kirkland Signature Mediterranean Sea Salt is excellent. The flavor is bright and crisp and wonderful, just like the other sea salt we had. It's just marvelously salty! I wondered, what makes this stuff so good? After all it's just salt and salt should taste like salt no matter what. Yet, this Mediterranean Sea Salt is markedly better than our Diamond Crystal Salt which we have generally used for cooking as well as a table salt. Well, I looked at the Diamond Crystal list of ingredients. In addition to salt, there's sodium silicoalluminate, dextrose, potassium iodide and sodium bicarbonate listed. Well, no wonder the salt tastes different! The Diamon Crystal salt is full of additives! I suppose Morton's is the same way, although I've not had a chance to check it. The only ingredient listed on the Kirkland Signature bottle is Mediterranean sea salt.<br /><br />Well, we're planning on using this as a table salt from here on out. Once you've experienced the taste, you just can't go back. Try it. You'll lke it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Kirkland Sea Salt Grinder
review/text: The salt is passable, but there is no indication of its provenance on the label.<br /><br />That is: where does the salt come from?  From 'the Mediterranean' perhaps, which is somewhat large body of water.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a handy implement to have around - the grinder is built right in to the top of the plastic container of salt and it works very well.  It's easy to 'grab for' when you're in a hurry or doing a time-sensitive cooking operation that needs salt 'lickety-split'.

I can still use it but I bought both the pepper and salt so they would match and one of them has tape on the top of it now.  It was just too much trouble to send it back when I still could use it.  The Sea Salt itself is amazing, I use it for everything.

review/summary: Loose 'English Breakfast' style Tea (assam), at a good price
review/text: If, like my wife and I, you're blessed with soft tap water, and like a good robust "English Breakfast Tea", I've found that this blend (mostly dark assam) is a pretty decent choice, and a good value.  I believe it's packaged by the same company that makes "PG-Tips" in the handy pyramid bags.  The quality is comparable.  I generally buy the brooke bond loose for making everyday tea by the pot, and I buy pg tips pyramid bags for travelling.<br /><br />Anyway, I buy the Brooke Bond loose on a regular basis - either online, or at a local indo-pakistani grocer.  I've also bought the Taj Mahal label by the same company, but they appear to be interchangeable, and differ only by the art on the box.  The loose tea is in small granule form, and comes sealed in a foil pouch, for freshness ... it's not flushed with neutral gas, and they dont vaccum pack it because they dont want to crush the tea, but otherwise the quality is pretty decent.  It comes in a variety of sizes, buy the most common size I buy is 900 grams (2 lbs) or 1800 gr (4lbs).<br /><br />The resulting tea is not quite as floral as some assams I've had (hey, it's bulk tea), and there's often a modest amount of tea dust in the bottom of the pouch, but the dust is easily removed by pouring the dry tea into a fine strainer, and tapping the strainer over the garbage (to winnow it), before brewing it.<br /><br />In my household, I generally buy loose tea in bulk, de-dust it, then repackage it in one or more 40 fl oz glass jars using a univeral vaccum sealing lid (see Tilia Food Saver), and then I use those to periodically refill a smaller 16-24 oz convenience container that I keep near my stove, for whenever I want to brew a fresh pot of tea.<br /><br />I've found that 1/4 cup of loose tea is sufficient for a 6 cup pot, and 1/4 - 1/3 cup is sufficient for 8 cups.  After brewing is done (3-5 mins), I pour the brewed tea through a fine tea strainer into serving cups, and the surplus goes into a lidded glass carafe that gets stored in the fridge (after it cools) for subsequent reheating by the cup (re: microwave), or for use in iced tea by the jug (just add some simple syrup and fresh lemon juice to taste, and some optional bruised mint leaves, and you're good to go).<br /><br />Bottom line - for an inexpensive loose bulk tea, this brand is very decent all purpose choice, suitable for both hot and iced tea.  Recommended.

review/summary: Quest for Great Coconut Water
review/text: Recently I've taken to trying out different brands of coconut water whenever I get a chance. Been through Goya, Taste Nirvana, Zico, and One, then I found Mira Azul which is my favorite. It is the perfect level of sweetness that the others didn't have. I would say De Mi Pais, an obscure brand I found in a latino grocery store in Brooklyn, is close, but borders on too sweet.<br /><br />I found Azul at my supermarket in a glass bottle (like Orangina) and was addicted. It should be known that the water in this can tastes not as good as in the glass.. less sweet.. but it's still a great enough taste that I don't mind it.

review/text: I have found my self really liking this drink too!:)  I can let everyone in on a little secret on where to get it at a cheaper price than Amazon.com?  It's priced at $1.00 for a 17.5 fluid oz. can available at the Dollar Tree stores in the US!  So would you rather buy 24 cans for $36.00 on Amazon or 24 cans for $24.00 at the Dollar Tree store?  I think I would rather buy the later.  Plus you have to pay for shipping which is $5.99 added if you order online.  Just a little helpful info for anyone wanting to save money. Also, I don't work or am I affiliated with Dollar Tree stores. Cheers!<br /><br />Link:<br /><br />[...]

review/text: Neither my wife nor I were really fans of coconut water, until we tried Azul.  Now I crave it !!  I don't know what they put in that stuff, but it's awesome.  I am active in sports and work out a lot and drinking water alone does not provide enough electrolytes to prevent cramping and dehydration.  I starting drinking Azul in place of Gatorade because of the high potassium content and I've found it works better than the other crap.  If anyone is into sports and looking for a good Gatorade alternative I highly recommend Azul...plus it tastes great.

review/text: This is surprisingly good, especially considering it is sugar-free. The gingerbread flavor is very palatable and is not overly sweet. I must admit the ginger flavor is a bit peppery at first, but was more enjoyable with each sip. This flavor is not my favorite (hence the four stars), but it tastes just like gingerbread (you won't even notice that it's sugar free). Zero calories, zero fat, zero carbs and zero sugar... and it's delicious! I think the pumps are overpriced, so I use a cocktail jigger to ensure I put the same amount of syrup each time. I was worried this product would taste "fake", but it doesn't... RECOMMENDED.

Can't really justify the price for Da Vinci. Torani was strong enough to provide flavor and go a long way before needing to be restocked. I am sorry I bought three bottles of Da Vinci. But I am certain now, after my taste testing, that no matter what the flavor, Torani has a satisfactory rating with me, and Da Vinci has an unsatisfactory rating.

review/summary: Great alternative to caffeinated Ice Tea
review/text: We drink a lot of ice tea.  Offering this decaf ice tea to the family with some spenda as the sweetener is so much better for us than colas.  I like that I can have a nice big drink of ice tea in the evening and not worry about staying awake all night.

review/summary: Tastes Great!
review/text: When summer comes I am constantly drinking ice tea.  Last summer I was told to stay away from caffeinated beverages.  What was I going to do without my ice tea?  I looked in Amazon.com and WOW!  Amazon had Lipton Tea Bags and they were DECAFFEINATED!  I was saved!!!!  I ordered some and I have been enjoying my ice tea ever since.

review/summary: Love the Tea and Subscribe & Save is fabulous!
review/text: All I drink is iced tea and water. I make a gallon of iced tea every other day. As such, I signed-up for the 'Subscribe & Save' program and it's just wonderful. I never run-out of tea bags anymore.<br /><br />I use 4 of these Family-size tea bags for every gallon-pitcher of tea I make. I like the flavour alright. Of course, it's not like a higher-end tea, but for the amount of tea I constantly drink, it's just fine.<br /><br />As well, it's Decaffinated and, for me, that's just what I need. Did I mention how much tea I drink? *lol*. Caffeine makes me nuts, so this tea is the perfect solution.<br /><br />All-in-All, this Lipton Family-size Decaffeinated Tea is a good solid tea for everyday consumption.

review/summary: Lipton makes great tea, even the decaf version
review/text: We enjoy iced tea, and I often make decaf so we can drink it until bedtime without lying awake.  We've used all the brands out there, but Lipton's tea stands out among the top brands.<br /><br />Lipton's decaffeinated family size teabags are handy for making large pitchers of tea.  I boil a quart of water, add the teabags (3 for a gallon pitcher), turn off the fire and let it steep for 10-15 minutes.  I partially fill the pitcher with ice, then pour the hot, steeped tea over the ice (squeeze and discard the teabags).  Finish filling the pitcher with cold water and you have tasty, fresh tasting iced tea.<br /><br />I like that Lipton's bags are made of strong enough material that you don't find tea leaves floating around in the tea.  The strings are also firmly attached so you don't have to go fishing for the bags.  The tea itself is strong and a beautiful dark amber color, and it has a fresh tea scent.

review/summary: My Famous Ice Tea
review/text: I've been making and having rave reviews for my Ice Tea for 35+ years and here it is:<br />To a One Gallon Container place 3 family sized tea bags<br />Gently add the hottest tap water into the container 3/4 full, so as not to break the bags<br />Let steep on countertop for at least 20 minutes or until desired strength<br />Remove tea bags and add enough ice cubes to fill container to top<br />Refrigerate<br />When serving, add sweetener to tall glass (sweet'n'low', splenda, etc...), cubes, tea, lemon or lime<br />Deelish<br />It's a staple in our fridge all year long<br />Enjoy!<br /><br />P.S. I would make this exact recipe called Sweet Tea when my kids went to school in South Carolina and were living at home<br />To this same recipe, first add 1 cup of sugar to the container, then hot water, stir to dissolve and then add tea bags.  Proceed as above.

review/summary: Excellent taste.  Just like I grew up with.
review/text: Great taste and love the fact it's decaffeinated.  I do wish they made even larger tea bags than these "Family" sized bags but that's minor.<br />I've now been able to give up sodas and have been drinking this tea with just a bit of Stevia sweetener, and I'm good to go!  Much healthier and easier on the wallet than sodas.

review/summary: Best Tea!
review/text: These size tea bags are not sold locally in my stores so I buy via Amazon. I like the decaffeinated bags because they are less bitter than regular tea. Very clean taste, much cheaper than other beverages.

review/summary: not as yummy as luzianne
review/text: We did a rather unscientific blind taste test and we like Luzianne better. Luzianne tea has a more "tea" flavor if you know what I mean. Also, Lipton tea bags come in little paper packets which I think is not useful and wasteful. Lots of my tags were not stapled which was annoying too. Overall, it is okay tea just don't drink Luzianne and then Lipton or you will notice a difference. I bought a lot (since I bought it on Amazon) and it is in no way bad tea, just not as good as Luzianne.

review/summary: I never realized what a great iced tea this makes
review/text: After trying, unsuccessfully, to make iced tea at home I figured I would give it one more try with Lipton.<br />Wow, I made it the way my mom did it years ago, boil a few cups of water steep the tea add some sugar, add more cold water, refrigerate, and when it was ready to drink add the ice and enjoy.<br />I cannot have lemon so I add a nice sprig of mint and it is heaven.  Finally a great iced tea that I will enjoy all year round.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I've always been a fan of Lipton's caffeinated tea.  However, I was very disappointed by the decaf version.  Something in the decaf process strips the tea of all its character, leaving only the bitterness behind.  The same thing is true for the Twinings Decaffeinated English Breakfast Tea.  Since I only drink iced tea, I can't say how this tea is when prepared hot.  Buy this tea only as a last resort.

review/summary: Love these, but I drink diet beverages
review/text: If you're a sugar drinker, you may not be happy with these mixes. But I am accustomed to diet sodas, sugar free drinks, and don't mind the flavor of artificial sweeteners. So these were great - I don't know that they taste like cosmos, but they are fruity and easy to drink.<br /><br />The packets are very slim, easy to carry.
