review/summary: Good idea, yet overpriced
review/text: For the price, these things are overpriced I think.  Sure they are healthy and look cool, but that comes at a price.  The soup is actually decent, and I like sipping the broth after I eat soup so this was why I tried this.  Only takes about 1 minute in the microwave and your good to go.  The only downfall to these cups is that even though I mixed it up good after microwaving, the noodles stay on the bottom once you are done sipping it.  But if I can save these cups and put regular soup in for the future, I guess that would be cool.  But I don't think you can dishwasher these cups.  2 stars for the taste and nothing else.  3 stars less because of price, noodles, and size.

review/summary: TERRIBLE!  Spills in microwave
review/text: Almost every time I heat these, they spill (sometimes flat out fall over) in the microwave.  Even when I'm following the directions exactly.  When they survive the microwave, they are hard to drink. Drinking leaves a pile of noodles at the bottom, as you mostly sip the broth.  This is so even when I stir the soup up.<br /><br />Not worth it.  Too bad, because these would be super handy if they worked!  The soup tastes good.  Campbell's needs to go back to the drawing board...

review/summary: OOPS - EMPTY Olive Alert
review/text: I must have made a mistake in thinking these were stuffed with piemento - or perhaps when I bought them, the image on this was showing the wrong product. In any case - got them for a party, and was surprised to see they were totally empty of any stuffing. Taste quite good, actually, but if you are looking for a stuffed traditional olive, this is not it. If you however hate piemento, or want an empty olive, this is the right product.<br /><br />Recommend updating the product description to state this product is not stuffed. It is quite confusing the way it states now that the actual product may be different than the image shown. In fact, it is the product shown - empty headed brined olives.

review/text: This barbecue sauce has a very good balance of flavors, including among others hickory smoke, molasses, Jack Daniel's whiskey (non-alcoholic), and brown sugar. This sauce is comparatively sweet. It is especially good with chicken and pork. It isn't available where I live but I found it in stock at Amazon, as has been the situation with other food products which I have tried and liked but couldn't find locally or even within striking distance. The two packs I ordered arrived reasonably quickly using Amazon's free shipping. As usual, Amazon's price and service were first rate for this order.

review/summary: Soy milk for about $0.20 for a half gallon
review/text: I'd like to say this product is amazing! I calculated the prices of soy milk in the store, about $4 per half gallon.  I usually drink 2 a week. That gets super expensive!  I also didn't appreciate all the additional chemicals and garbage produced with the containers (since soy milk containers AREN'T recyclable).  I estimate that a cup of organic soybeans is about $0.10 and then I use my ZeroWater filtered water to soak and to make the soy milk, about $0.10 so I am saving about $3.80 per every half gallon.  I also use this wonderful machine to make the milk for my soy yogurt.  So that's another 2 half gallons I make just for that per week.  I'm saving almost $10 just on the milk. (not to mention the cost of soy yogurt at about $2 per small container, and I eat 2 per day!) This machine has saved me a TON of money!<br /><br />As for the use of the machine. Some have complained about the basket that the soy beans go in. I have tried both methods of loading the basket: pouring them through the small hole on the top of the machine with the empty basket attached (which in my mind is harder because the beans go all over) and just filling the basket and shaking the beans to be able to put the blades in and lock the basket in place.  I prefer filling the basket. It may take a little time to fit the blades in around the beans, but I think it's actually faster than collecting the beans from all over that have spilled with the other way.<br /><br />Others have also said it's noisy.  Well, most grinders are noisy because they are pulverizing the beans, and it's only for a few moments. But I can still have the thing going in the kitchen and watching TV or listening to music quietly in the next room.  It's NOT that loud.<br /><br />One thing I will say for sweeter milk, make sure you get as many of the casings off the beans. Just mix up the beans in the water after soaking or even while soaking, and pick out the casings.  Also rinse the beans until the water is clean. I always use my filtered water, not from the tap, I think it makes it better and without any added chemicals from the water it makes it healthier.<br /><br />I am so thankful for this machine! I bought a secondhand machine because I wanted to first try it out, and I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />I haven't tried to do anything with the Okra that is made from grinding the beans. I am trying to find recipes that I can make and I'm wondering if this stuff can be frozen so I can use it later, since I make so much, I don't think I can make things with it all the time.  But if you don't want to use it, just dump it down the garbage disposal, it nearly melts when water is added.

review/summary: If you want to be like the Energizer Bunny
review/text: I work 12 hour night shifts and on a typical work day I only get to sleep between 4 to 6 hours. Usually 2 nights of work is all I can take and it takes me at least 2 days of sleep ( 16 hours) to recover. But with just 1/2 a sachet of this coffee mix a day right before I go to work. It makes me feel like I've had at least 8 hours of sleep. I worked 4 nights last week and on my first day off, I was surprised to find that I had the energy level and alertnees to do my house chores, energy level that I would only feel on my 3rd day of rest on the circumstances when I'm not taking this coffee.<br /><br />This is not a health drink, but to me it is a 'survival' drink that gives the stamina when you have a lot to do and very little time to recover and work with; And it does not make me jittery like regular coffee does. Regular coffee makes you alert but you will still feel the fatigue and the heaviness in your chest, if you are already overworked. But with this coffee, you will feel well rested with only 4 to 6 hours of sleep.

review/summary: NOT HEALTHY - MIXTURE OF HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS
review/text: I purchased 2 packages this coffee and was shocked when it arrived after I read the ingredients. Tongkat Ali is touted for its many health benefits. But this coffee has creamer made with glucose solids and a "mixture HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS". How could they put this terrible Trans fat oil in what is supposed to be a healthy product? Do not buy this product if you are looking for health benefits. I also purchased from the same vendor 2 packages of their "CNI Tongkat Ali with Ginseng Coffee" and it does not look any healthier with "Hardened Vegetable FAT (coconut, palm kernel Oil). Why couldn't they let us put our own creamer in? Why did they have to ruin this coffee with terrible HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS?<br /><br />Also, I purchased several packs at one time because of the expensive shipping charges it made sense to get more packages and pay a little extra shipping. However, now I have to pay return shipping and an 18% restocking fee!<br /><br />I will remember this next time I am buying something that is supposed to be healthy yet they do not list the ingredients. They listed the good ingredients but failed to mention the BAD ones!

We use tall cups with 1.5 or 2 packs per cup but that may be a bit much.  I love this coffee.  It is worth a try!

review/summary: Another reason to love Amazon.
review/text: I love these glazed nuts added to cookies or bars.  They have enough glaze to make them crunchy and sweet and really make a chocolate chip cookie pop or a brownie even yummier than usual.  I don't advise snacking on them, however, unless you've got more self control than I.  They're worse than potato chips for me; once I get started it's hard to stop.<br /><br />The reason I am so glad to find these nuts available on Amazon is that I can no longer get them at Target or Walmart, the stores that always had them on their shelves until maybe 6 months ago.  And the price here is even better than what I paid when I could find them at the stores.  So this pack of six 7-ounce pouches is a real winner!

Not only were the walnuts stale, but what little walnut was there was thick COATED with a carmel sugar coating. I was expecting "glazed" lightly with sweetness, like other glazed items are.  But the coating was very thick and brown.  If you like sugar coating, it's great.  Otherwise give it a pass.  Very little stale walnut and too much brown gunk.

review/text: I bought this on a whim one day as I was craving nuts and well first of all, I found out six packages was a bit too much for one person. lol.<br /><br />Secondly, I thought I would get a walnut that was you know, the traditional picture of a walnut, kinda looks like a H and roughly 2/3 an inch long about 1/2 inch wide. Well what I got was a round ball that kinda resembled a walnut when you bit into it. It appears they crushed the walnut, dropped it into some sugary coating and cooked them. The result is not the traditional appearance, but still tastes alright. A bit too sweet though.<br /><br />So go ahead and order it but just be aware. Oh and you might have to share. lol

review/text: These are soooo good.  To date I've used them in salads, cookie batter (along with dried cranberries...awesome) and as an occasional snack.  They are very good...but be careful.  There are quite a few servings per pack.  It's hard to stop eating them.

review/summary: Very tasty pickled sausages!
review/text: These are great tasting pickled sausages!  I like the ones you can buy individually wrapped at the convenience stores, but I love these even more.  They have a nice snap to them, and they're well portioned.  Not too spicy either (they use spiced vinegar for their polish sausages), which might be a good thing for some folks.  I ordered and very quickly received the two 28 ounce plastic jars (each jar is 1 lb 12 ounces and is well packaged) in one week from the U.S. to my location overseas and contains about 10 four-inch sausages links each, if that info helps anyone.  I highly recommend these!

review/summary: Germany launches Pringles Hoarding Investigation on US Army base
review/text: Sources have revealed that the German government has been conducting a massive undercover operation regarding the smuggling and hoarding of hundreds and hundreds of cases of Pringles potato chips into the country through American Army bases. Apparantly the investigation focuses on a retired Army officer, known as code name "U", aka "Mikey". A recent raid on a US Army base located in Germany revealed a fat balding retired US Army officer sitting in his basement, nude, amidst thousands of cans of Pringles potato chips strewn all over the house and thousands of empty Diet Rite cola cans. When asked what he was doing, "Mikey" said he was "eatin' chips, drinkin Cola and fantasizing about June Cleaver". The government reported that Germany is facing a serious shortage of Pringle's Potato chips and is trying to get to the bottom of why a retired Army officer would be singlehandedly trying to hoard the canned chips, and why he eats them whilst being completely naked.

review/summary: Better than the "salmon chowder" they sell, but not by much
review/text: I purchased this variety and the salmon chowder variety this company sells, to send as Christmas gifts.  I decided to sample both varieties prior to mailing and since I love all of the stated ingredients, I had high expectations of the taste and quality of these soups.  I was wrong, and was very disappointed.  This soup (bean) tastes far, far better than the Salmon Chowder variety, but was also disappointing, mainly because the hotness of the soup overpowers any other flavors!  It was hard to taste the "smoked salmon" at all because of this.  The texture of this soup is good and the beans were flavorful, when I could taste them over the overwhelming "spice" of the soup.  If they would cut the heat of this soup in half, they may have a much better product.  As is, I'm unable to send this variety, nor the awful salmon chowder variety, to my dad after all.  More gift hunting for me....darn.

review/summary: Delectable
review/text: These little treats, the size and shape of regular M&M's from arch-rival candymaker Mars, have been going in and out of style since their introduction over thirty years ago.  A visual "product placement" in the 1982 movie E.T. gave them quite a boost, but several years ago I couldn't find any at my usual big box.  Pity.  But they are back, and they are still one-of-a-kind.  The taste is similar but not identical to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (a little sweeter and more 'buttery' to indulge a metaphor, but less peanut-y or salty).  Like M&M's, the candy is encased in hard shells; unlike M&M's they come in only three colors, orange, yellow and dark brown. I was stunned to see that the independent vendor from whom they are currently available wants the product price just to ship them (so my five stars are NOT for the current online price!).  But it should be fairly easy to price-compare.

review/summary: The Best Ready to Eat Palak Paneer I've tried
review/text: Between MTR, TastyBite, Kitchen of India, and Tandoor Chef, MTR's Palak Paneer was the best of the bunch.  The spinach and sauce was beautifully blended and thick and creamy/saucy.  The flavor was mild enough for my spice-adverse siblings, but had enough kick to please us who enough that lovely heat.  The sauce was neither watery or did it separate over time.  There was no visible layer of butter/grease in the palak paneer.  The paneer (cheese) was chunky and visible and firm.  All in all, it was the closest I could find to the delicious palak paneer.

review/summary: Pretty Good For Out of A Foil Bag!
review/text: MTR's Palak Paneer is pretty good.  In comparison to other shelf-stable varieties it is very good.  The taste and texture can't match a fresh or frozen variety, BUT this palak paneer has HALF THE FAT AND SATURATED FAT of the frozen box variety from a retailer that I've been eating for years.  This is a healthier choice.  The paneer is in better shape and firmer than another shelf-stable palak paneer that I got on amazon.com.  AND, the five boxes I got have an expiration in 18 months, so there is plenty of time to enjoy.  Just tear open the foil pouch and pour into a bowl (be SURE TO COVER) and microwave for 90 seconds and enjoy!  It has the oil and spinach and spice balance that satisfies my tastes for a quick Indian meal out of a pouch.  Tasty and enjoyable.

review/summary: Best value Palak Paneer on Amazon
review/text: I love boxed Palak Paneer. I've had it in restaurants before, but it's just not as good. But these boxes are perfect for two people on a day when you just don't want to make anything complicated.<br /><br />For flavor and taste, the best boxed meals are Trader Joe's (they have these Thai ones with green or panang curry with tuna that are just delicious). But lacking the ability to buy those on the internets, these are the next best thing.<br /><br />I've had a couple brands on Amazon, and the main thing I like about this one as compared to other Palak Paneers is that this one has smaller chunks of paneer, but more of them (and they're still big enough that I prefer to slice them in half with a fork). Some brands have like 5 pieces of cheese in there, and that's just not as good. Plus, this paneer squeaks when you eat it, indicating a freshness and quality that is superior to other brands.<br /><br />It's also much cheaper than other brands... staying fairly close to $2 a box when you buy 5, which is a very reasonable price (considering rice is practically free, you can have a good meal for like $1 or $1.50 a serving).<br /><br />It has good flavor, and a tiny bit of spice, but is overall fairly mild. Delicious!

It's nice and spicy and there's a goodly amount of the "cheese" cubes. I can't compare it to homemade, so for me, it's a great quick meal with eggs. (I'm sure that's NOT how it's eaten in the native cuisine)  :)

It is a good deal for the price, but there was a somewhat off putting smell when I first started eating it.  I guess I got used to it after a couple bites, but the initial bites were not that pleasant.  After getting used to the smell, the palak paneer was tasty, but a little too watery for my taste.  Overall, it was a good purchase for the price, but I am not sure if I would buy it again.

review/summary: Great value for me...
review/text: ...especially as a subscription here.<br /><br />Yes, a cut below really good restaurants (or accurate home cooking), but equal to many restaurants - especially lunch buffets that might charge $10 or more per person and leave you the spinach in the steamer with no paneer (panir) at all when you go to serve yourself. When there as been any cheese in this dish on most buffets, its texture has not at its best been much better than this (make your own paneer if you are picky and *have the time* - not difficult, just takes some time and effort).<br /><br />I don't consider it very spicy myself, but I can easily make it that way. Spice it a bit and serve it up with some basmati, dal, & naan. Serve dinner for 2 for less than the price of buffet for one at lunch.

The imported version is dark brown and has no corn syrup, ascorbic acid or salt.  The imported version had a "Best Used By" date, but the US version did not.  We bought both and after tasting, used only the UK/imported one.  See attached photos.

review/text: Robertson products are usually quite good, but this was disappointing.  Baked as is from the jar, there was little flavor other than orange peel.  There seems to be a lot of mashed up fig (or something seeded which resembles fig).  The product is overpoweringly sweet. Sugar is the first ingredient on the label - should have checked before buying!<br /><br />However, it makes a decent base.  Add two cups of diced tart apples, some brandy and a bit more cinnamon/nutmeg and it isn't bad for a quick mincemeat filling.

They're amazing!  Here's why:<br /><br />1  Yes, as everyone says, these Walker cookies are exceptional.  You may think it's all just buzz, but if you haven't tried them, don't judge us as silly until you do (!).<br /><br />2  But what happens if you open a box -- you finish it, right!  BAD.  These little suckers aren't the greatest thing for you, to put it mildly.<br /><br />3  Answer:  single serving packaging!!  It really works.  My husband is addicted to these cookies.  I'd always have a box on hand in case of unexpected guests -- at least, I'd think I had one, but the box would usually have disappeared unexpectedly whenever I went to look for it.  True confessions:  I love them too and was occasionally looking to sneak some for myself!  So having them around just in case was a bad, BAD idea.  But a case of 24 packs of 2 cookies per package is ideal.  Two seems to satisfy my husband's craving -- he almost never takes more than one packet.  And I open a packet occasionally and make 2 cookies last 2 days, instead of a whole box lasting almost forever and my worrying that they'd go stale or attract ants.<br /><br />Bonus:  they're easily packable!  When my husband's expecting an exceptionally tough day at work, I'll usually sneak a pack into his lunch if he hasn't already appropriated one for himself.<br /><br />And when he's especially wiped out at the end of an unusually demanding day, a pack of these really seems to perk him up and help him muster strength for tomorrow.  He brings it upstairs while he's watching TV and waits a while before opening the bag and savoring his treasure.  Whether for lunch or after dinner, the gleam in his eye as he talks about how wonderful it is to have a treat when he's so stressed means a lot to me, especially when I know he's only eating in moderation instead of wolfing down ten or twenty servings at a time.  The case of 24 has lasted us 3 months already -- a pleasant surprise, given that there are 2 addicts in the house.  :  So our portion-control strategy is working!!!<br /><br />And yes, when we had guests who chose after-dinner tea, these were just the right thing to bring out with it, and I didn't mind opening multiple packs at once and putting the cookies together on 1 plate for serving, knowing that I wasn't either spoiling an entire box, or promoting too rapid consumption of it, just by providing our guests with a few.<br /><br />I wish two other treasures came in single-serving packets:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK58S">LU Herbes De Provence Flatbread Crackers, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8WI1Q">Mary's Gone Crackers, Caraway, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>!!<br /><br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.

review/summary: I roast them
review/text: I was disappointed in the taste of these because I like bitter chocolate and these are not at all bitter.  Also did not care for the texture.  It finally dawned on me that what was missing in the nibs was the richness that comes from roasting.  So now I roast them - in my oven at 325 it takes 20 minutes.  I don't think I'm destroying much of the nutrients in the nibs but even if I am the flavor and texture after roasting is so much improved I don't really care.  I make a combination of toasted sesame seeds and roasted nibs mixed into melted unsweetened bakers chocolate, spread out on a pan and put in the freezer until hardened.  Then I pop it off the pan, break it into pieces, and store in the 'fridge.  The taste is downright addicting.  The nibs, after roasting, add a true chocolate flavor to everything (try adding to a can of mixed nuts).  After roasting they have a pleasing tender crunch to them instead of the very hard waxy texture in the raw state.

review/summary: The Ultimate in Healthy Chocolate
review/text: Healthy chocolate is becoming a hot topic these days. Dark chocolate is being noted for its high anti-oxidant value, as well as other potential health benefits. These benefits come from the cacao bean from which chocolate is made.<br /><br />Eating the cacao bean raw, however, will give you more health benefits than dark chocolate, which has been processed and has had sugar and other ingredients added. This product is not only raw cacao, but it's organic as well. There are no other ingredients.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong -- the taste is bitter. That's why many people will go for the processed chocolate. You can get used to this taste, though. I eat them straight without a problem, but others don't like the idea.<br /><br />You can get this in powder form as well, to sprinkle on other foods and not have such a strong flavor from it.<br /><br />The 5-star rating isn't for the taste, but for the quality -- it's organic, it's raw, it's simple. If you're looking for the best that cacao has to offer, this is a great way to go.

review/text: I started eating fibre one bars when I began Weight Watchers. I found it to be a tasty filling snack. Oats and chocolate is my favorite flavour. I don't really care for the caramel or the peanut butter ones. But the oats and chocolate ones are delicious.<br /><br />It's hard to find them in large packs where I am but whenever I do, I scoop them up. I find them filling either for breakfast or as a mid-day snack. I used to hide them from my kids, as I do with all my Weight Watchers stuff, but finally realized that I should be happy they were eating them too (albeit frustrated that I would be met with an empty box when I went to pack my lunch).<br /><br />These taste so good that it's hard to believe they are healthy.

A natural sweet safe healthy herb with no calories! i dont understand who or what in american society is so powerful enough to prevent stevia from being used- are the sugar and artifical sweetener conglamorates really conspiring to control everything and prevent additional competition?

review/text: I bought five of these fruitcakes to last me two holiday seasons.  I heard that fruitcake tends not to go bad, so I figured with the great price here on Amazon, it was worth stocking up.<br /><br />The cakes I ate in December were FLAWLESS--absolutely a delight to eat, particularly for Yuletide.  However, I found that my "stock up" idea back fired and I ended up throwing away three of my remaining fruitcakes away in June.<br /><br />I am not sure why it was...but as they just sat on the shelf, I became more afraid of them--until I finally threw them out.  That thin plastic covering just doesn't say "fresh" to me as well as a metal tin does.<br /><br />So buy these when you are ready to eat them...you will really enjoy the taste.  But saving them on the shelf for a year?  No.  If you want to save one or more for later, I really suggest freezing, just to be safe!<br /><br />Very good fruitcake!

review/summary: So Far So Good
review/text: I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.
