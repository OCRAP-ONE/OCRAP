review/summary: Phenomenal flavoring
review/text: When I try to describe the taste and sensation to friends, the best I can come up with is that it tastes like lime and molasses. Wonderful flavoring agent for broths, and I also use it quite a bit with sweet potatoes, tomato dishes and anything with chicken. I use it in much higher concentrations than what they suggest. There are some instant soup mixes using tamarind, and if you are new to the condiment, you may want to try them to experiment with how best to use it. I also looked to Madhur Jaffrey's excellent "World of the East Vegetarian Cooking" for inspiration.

review/text: I like this because I can add some sour without adding a lemon or lime flavor.<br /><br />If you can imagine tasting something which has the tart flavor of lime juice without any citrus flavor (to me anyway) this is what you get.<br /><br />Also has a natural sugar cane kind of sweetness to it.<br /><br />hint: i sometimes put a dab on my finger and taste it just for fun.. it's a nice candied flavor!

review/summary: Ethnic foods for all!
review/text: This paste was an item I needed to make chili sauce. I cannot comment on the quality of the paste, I have not tasted it any where else.  It was perfect for my recipe and provided a unique tartness I expected from the tamarind.  It is thick, quite thick, as I would think a paste should be.  I will always keep it on hand, now that I found it.  I can think of several uses for it.  Thanks for the product and for the large list of specialty ingredients available on Amazon.com.  Tamarind is not to be found in my small town in any medium.  Rather than travel to the nearest city and find an ethnic grocer, I chose to buy it here.  Shipping costs are always a concern, so I looked for the item with Super Saver Shipping and grouped this item with others.  Free shipping makes ordering grocery items on-line a pleasant experience.

I always get tremendous raves at the table, so  much so, that after numerous requests and years of begging ... what is the secret ...

This is one of the best, most used product in my kitchen... I use about 2-3 tins of Nantucket Offshore Turkey Rub, per year and so do my friends.<br />One of my friends just moved to PA, so I ordered a couple of tins and sent it to her and she called me and said, "You saved our Thanksgiving!..."

review/text: Let me start by saying that I love Skittles and Starburst. I love to sprinkle Skittles in my pop-corn to get that sweet/salty/fruity/crunchy combination. And Starburst? Well, who needs to do anything but eat them! That being said, I think this particular assortment is a waste of my money because half the box is SOUR editions of both these candies. I do NOT enjoy sour ANYTHING and especially NOT my candy! Candies should be SWEET. Hence the saying; sweet as candy... I WON'T buy this again! I guess I should have read the description better, if it even says so...<br /><br />Okay, so went I back to check, and it DOES NOT state that this variety box contains half the contents in "SOUR". So I came back to edit my review and let others know that fact.

review/text: I love split pea soup and these peas are so fresh and cook up so well.  Can you buy cheaper split peas?  Of course you can but they likely weren't grown in the US and are probably a couple of years old.  These peas are far superior to the bag of peas in the grocery store.  These are grown in Washington, packaged in Washington and shipped from Washington.  It is worth it to spend a little more for a far superior product!

review/text: I have made homemade split pea soup for many years.  I recently resumed doing so after not for about a decade.  I bought organic split peas at my local market, they were tasteless.  Chicken broth was used to make that soup, too.  But these split peas were much more flavorful.  They cooked up much better as well, meaning that the first brand's peas must have been old, bcs after an hour or more they were still tough.  So, that tells me these are fresh, and superior.

review/text: These are delicious peas. I made about 6 crock pots of pea soup before the bag was finished. I hardly had to add any spices for it to taste delicious. Just some natural sea salt and a little brags amino acids. Plus I put in a few garlic cloves and it was so heart warming soup. Usually, with ordinary peas, you have to put bacon and other spices in to make it good. Not with these peas. They were delicious on their own. Also delivered timely. Thanks again.

The final result is mouthwatering. I made a big pot, threw in some vegetables, and can barely keep myself away from having too much now and not enough left for another day.<br /><br />And, being organic and GMO free, wrapped very carefully in gunny sack material inside a plastic bag, it is a healthful contributory to the diner, not a questionable one.<br /><br />I'm really glad I discovered these split peas. I can't imagine anything better.

review/text: These are the best-tasting green splits I've ever had.  I love creamy soups, split pea being one of my favorites, but it's not usually easy to make a delicious creamy soup without adding some sort of meat flavoring (I don't eat anything that used to have a face). These peas are delicious without having been cooked with any sort of meat/chicken-based flavorings.  Nice and fresh-no more of those gray colored little things sold in plastic bags at the grocery store. These peas even smell fresh in the bag (which is a nice drawstring muslin).

review/text: My husband and I drink about 3 pots of coffee per day and we both have a liking for French Vanilla Creamer.  I used to buy it in the powdered, but then the liquid came out and we used that.  Then now they have this concentrated creamer which is the best yet, we beleive it tastes better than the liquid and the powdered.  Also, it gives you more for your dollar.  The only downside is the pump.  Really cool idea if you could only remove it after putting it on.  I could understand at a business where you wouldn't want people tampering with it, but the pump leaves a  lot of creamer left in the bottom yet.  We leave it off and just pour it into the coffee, and when there is only a little left, we pour some coffee in it and get the rest out.  Also another plus, the container is recyclable in a lot of areas.  Go CoffeeMate!

review/summary: A disappointment!
review/text: For the price I expected much, much better.  It says it should be used within a month but (unless it's used by one person/one cup per day) this wont last anymore than a couple of weeks.  It is not as concentrated (I had to pump 3-4 times), and the past reviewer is right it is not as rich as the refrigerated kind.  We have three people who drink coffee here, it was gone in 2 weeks.<br /><br />I was upset about it gone so soon, but felt some liquid left behind in the bottle; unfortunately the nozzle can't be removed due to a lock system it has; once it's on, its on for good!  I took a butter knife to open the cap and to my surprise there was enough liquid there for at least 5 more cups of coffee!<br /><br />On top of that the second bottle kept clogging even with twice daily use.  And now Amazon had raised the price!  I decided to go with the plain creamer this time, much more economical.  I will test and review it as soon as I finish the first bottle I hope it works better for us.<br /><br />It very pricey, sure no mess, no hassle if you've got loads of money there's really nothing to worry about.  But for someone in a budget, I honestly believe it doesn't amount to the value of the one from the dairy/coffee section.  Save your bucks, this is not worth it.

We used powered French Vanilla creamer and had to be make special trips to the store because we were always running out.  A bottle of the concentrated creamer lasts longer and tastes better.  The flavor reminds you of sweet condensed milk.  Someone in a previous review said you cannot take the pump off once it is put on. The manufacturer must have changed this because it now just unscrews so you can clean the pump if necessary and also get the last drops that won't pump out.  Even though the 2 bottles seem costly it has definitely saved us money.  Amazon is the only place I have been able to find this creamer.  It now a staple in our pantry.

review/summary: Not as good as the refrigerated product.
review/text: I so wanted to like this product as we drink alot of coffee, and the French Vanilla is our favorite. Despite this being a huge bottle, and thinking it would last a long time, and being that it had less calories, I wasn't impressed.  You had to use 3-4 pumps to get the creamy texture, and that old vibrant French Vanilla flavor the refrigerated kind has, so you end up getting more calories and the product is used up faster, making this not a good value.  Still, this shelf stable product is a quick fix for those that have never tried the refrigerated kind. Give it a try, you might like it.  It's not bad, it's just not the refrigerated kind, which in my opinion is the best!

review/summary: Makes the Coffee at Work Drinkable!
review/text: The coffee at my office is so bad - I didn't know a coffeemaker could output such disgusting sludge.  2 pumps of the Coffee-Mate concentrate and it is a totally different story.  I was initially skeptical about the no refrigeration, but it stayed fresh through the 6 weeks it took me to go through one bottle (although what that means for the additives in it I don't want to think).  I'm able to lock this away from my thieving co-workers and look like the hero when I do share.  With the 2 pack it takes a while to run out, so sharing and keeping my hero status is easy.<br /><br />A word of warning - it does not travel well once you insert the pump.  We moved offices mid-bottle and I could not get the pump to lock.  In the move some concentrate leaked out of the pump, but not a big deal if you're not planning on moving around a lot with the bottle.

review/text: Works gr8. We use it in office and having milk, creamer (and taking care of the expiry dates) on top of the project schedule dates is a bit hassle! This product has a looooooooooong expiry date and that certainly helps. Coffee tastes better too, with this creamer!

review/summary: My family loves this
review/text: My family drinks a lot of coffee and they also love french vanilla creamer.  We were paying about $3 a bottle, and had to buy them every couple of days.  We tried the concentrated pump and it is a lot cheaper in the end.  We buy a pack of two every couple of weeks.  I don't drink coffee, but I have actually used it in baking, and it works great. The pump does leave some in the bottom, but my son just cuts it off, and uses what's left. I only wish that they had Amaretto flavor.

review/summary: Coffee-mate French Vanilla creamer-  Heaven
review/text: Love,love,love this creamer. It is so rich and creamy, was buying the smaller size but it is so much cheaper to buy the larger size just hated it on my counter, easy fix. I bought a 10 ounce bottle of water with the flip top lid poured the water in my coffee maker and then filled it with creamer, this is much easier to use than messing with the pump and large bottle just put the regular lid (not the pump) back on the bottle of creamer and store out of site. but if you want to use the the orginal bottle and pump you can remove the pump by pushing down hard and turning hard,just like childproof medicine bottles, must keep pushing down while turning.

review/summary: 25 calories per pump!
review/text: I found it difficult to get the pump nozzle UP after I'd screwed on the top - best you get the nozzle up before you screw it on.<br /><br />One of my bottles had a small crack at the bottom, the box was full of sticky goop...I washed both bottles to find out which one was leaking. Amazon was super fast to credit that amount back to me.  Amazing Customer service, thats why I buy so much from Amazon!!!<br /><br />I really would have liked to know the calorie count prior to buying, been watching what I eat for a good few months, so to let everyone else know - its 25 calories per pump, sadly I need 2-3 pumps to make my coffee sweet enough, I need to cut down and just get used to it.<br /><br />I love Coffee Mate, and normally buy from the grocery store, but its handy not having that extra space taken up in the fridge!

review/summary: Great for small dogs
review/text: These are great, long-lasting chews for small dogs.  Our Yorkie will spend a happy hour or two with a new chew, and then return to it later for more gnawing.  The chewing puts Samson (small dogs need big names) in a tranquil, my-brain-is-in-neutral state, and my wife and I feel good because we're not poisoning him with made-in-China junk.  Besides all that, the chews don't stink, as did some lower-quality brands we tried.

review/summary: My dog loves these
review/text: I have a picky middle-aged poodle who simply will not chew most chewy treats, no matter how high quality or palatable they apparently are. He is 18 lbs; these treats say "for dogs up to 20 lbs" on the package. The treats are rather thin, about as large around as a pencil. They look like they are perfectly appropriate for small/toy breed dogs. Prince consumes each chew in around 30 minutes. For value, you should probably buy a larger width stick. But since my dog will only chew thin bully sticks these are great for him! For heavy chewers, get the regular size.

review/text: I rarely review, but I had to extend kudos to Green Mountain for this wonderful hazelnut flavor.  I make mostly iced coffees, and wanted to stop spending so much money at Starbucks.  This coffee is better than Starbucks, Coffee Bean, or any other shop I've tried.  It is light, sweet, and you almost don't need any extra sugar if you add a little milk.  I should note that I like my coffee pretty light.  I also love that this is available in decaf.  I hope they make more decaf flavors available over time.  I adore my Breville single cup coffee maker as well!

I've done extensive comparison shopping, and this particular deal is the best I've found (in online or retail stores, and even different packs here on Amazon). There are not a lot of K-cup decaffeinated choices, but since I like hazelnut flavor, this is a good choice for me.<br /><br />This is a nice mild hazelnut decaf at a good price.

review/summary: Single cup coffee's
review/text: I liked this flavor and the whole single cup system. I am not a avid coffee drinker, but I do like an occasional couple of cups a day. However, I will go several days between drinking any coffee.The single cups last and store longer with no waste.The key to this and all single cup coffee's is the water level. Just a bit more or less water in the coffee blend is critical to the taste.I find that if I fill my coffee cup with too much water, the flavor is watery. I find that the best level is really too small a cup of coffee, however adding the flavored creames allow you to use more water making a larger cup without sacrificing taste.

review/text: I don't know... maybe I got a bad batch. The pastry was sandy in texture, broken in a million pieces by the time it got here. I reconstructed one to give it a try. The filling had a strange, bitter taste; the bad aftertaste was horrible. Such a shame, because I have enjoyed other Mr. Kipling products. Try Mr. Kipling's Cherry Bakewells (yum!) or Battenbergs. I wouldn't even give these a second try.

review/summary: The only rooibos I've ever bought
review/text: It's pretty remarkable that I'm writing a review for rooibos, because it's not a product that I go out of my way to buy or to drink.  But I received a sample of this in one of my Adagio orders, and I liked it.  I liked it enough to buy it.  This rooibos has a strong, true caramel flavor, which I loved.  This is the product that showed me I liked Caramel flavored teas.  Overall, this is a good beverage for the evenings, as it is caffeine free, and those who are fond of rooibos shous definitely give it a try.

review/summary: Crunchy Nuggets of Sweetness
review/text: I also purchased Belgian Pearl Sugar to make Belgian waffles.  My goal was to imitate the Belgian waffles by Julian's Recipe.  I experimented with different recipes and ingredients but nothing was quite right until I tried this pearl sugar.  It's the key ingredient not just for taste for for texture.  It caramelizes during the cooking process, resulting in crunchy nuggets of sweetness in my waffles.  Five pounds sounds like a lot of sugar, but if you calculate the price per pound, it's a more economical option compared to the smaller amounts.  At this price, it's best reserved for special recipes.  I'm sure I'll use it up making waffles or other baked treats, however I wouldn't use it for basic purposes, such was sweetening coffee. I could not find pearl sugar in any store, no matter how specialized it was so I decided to purchase here on Amazon.  The sugar came double bagged in plastic.  Also included was a tin of Penguin Mints.  Nice surprise! Overall, I very happy with my purchase.

review/summary: Doh! Belgium and Sweden are different countries.
review/text: I bought this sugar because I looking for Swedish pearl sugar, which is used in the baking of fine Swedish cookies. I thought this looked similar, but since there wasn't a reference to determine the scale or size of the sugar pearls, I didn't realize that Belgian pearl sugar is much larger than Swedish pearl sugar.<br /><br />That said, this product was great. I made some Belgian waffles for the kids using this and we all ate and smacked our lips. We'll be having them again soon since I bought a 5lb bag!<br /><br />If you're looking for Belgian pearl sugar, look no further. If you're looking for Swedish pearl sugar, look for the Lars brand (which I bought later).

review/summary: Great peanuts but not a good order
review/text: I have been a fan of Feridies Redskin Virginia Peanuts for many months. They are a staple in my pantry, and I have never had a single one that wasn't fresh and delicious. Until now. I was very surprised to find that the product I just received tasted stale. Upon reviewing my order, I see that I did not purchase the order direct from Feridies, but instead from an Amazon LLC. This may be the reason (older stock?). I will be certain to order only directly from the company itself from now on, as I have never been disappointed in doing so and I am drawing a conclusion. Unfortunately, this product is not eligible for return. PS: the star rating above applies to this product in general, which is superior, even if not to this particular order.

review/summary: Finally, an affordable, delicious green tea powder
review/text: I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly.

review/summary: great alternative to bottled green tea
review/text: The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something "healthlier." I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is.

review/summary: nice substitute for soda or sugary tea
review/text: I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Very Reasonably Priced and Delicious
review/text: If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for "White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream," "Green Tea Papaya Nectar" and "Green Tea Sugar Cookies." You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: No Flavor - Not Authentic
review/text: I have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it. I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!<br /><br />If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese brand that contains 100% tea ONLY.<br /><br />I tried to return it to Amazon, but they don't allow grocery items to be returned!

review/text: This is a quick & easy way to make green tea. It isn't sweet & only has the barest hint of blueberry, but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning. It does have more green tint to it than most teas- here's why: "Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally, the color of the tea is actually green, not yellow, like many Chinese varieties." Powdered tea is also good for cooking as well.

review/text: What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />unfortunately by doing that to this flavor, the ginger was out of control, and not in a good ginger tea sort of way.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.
