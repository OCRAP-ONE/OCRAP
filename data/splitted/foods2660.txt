review/summary: Tasty addictive, may or may not relax you
review/text: I love these so much! They are tasty and a lovely natural color unlike a diet coke or redbull. They didn't seem to do much to 'relax' me but they were definately tasty and great for a soda fix. I can't say they relax people though...

review/summary: Better than Soda
review/text: This one has blackberry, chamomile, passion-flower, hibiscus, jujube and lemon balm, plus sparkling water etc, it's supposed to be all natural, good ingredients... so it's like drinking tea that's also like a soda. It's good, I'd rather drink this than soda and with the herbs and fruit juices it contains, it makes it better than just sparkling water...

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: When I read Purple Antioxidants, I figured ok, it's still probably going to look like Green Tea when brewed.... WRONG!  It's got a DEEP, rich purple hue to it.  Tastes very good, mild but subtle sweetness from the elderberry, hibiscus, and blueberry.  I love the fact that it's decaffeinated using only effervescent water.  No chemicals, all natural.  You can taste the purity.  Although not organic, it still seems like a very healthy tea.<br /><br />I will be buying more of this in the future.

review/summary: So delicious!
review/text: What a delicious treat!  My husband and I both loved these.  They are sweet, but not too sweet.  Great cinnamon flavor.  Moist crust/dough.  These are great as a dessert, as a compliment to coffee/latte, or whatever.  They were delivered quickly and so far have stayed fresh for at least a week.  (Actually, we ate this bag within a couple days, but I still have some other items from this seller and they are still fresh after over a week.)  I'm not sure how long they stay fresh after delivery, but suspect they could also be frozen.  I'm going to order other flavors and try them, too.  We also had the vanilla ones and I loved them, though my husband still prefers the cinnamon.

review/text: The V8 5.5 cans are the perfect size as it is exactly 1 serving of 30 calories. Sure there is 290 mg of salt in a can, but after a night of drinking(hangover)  or just a lot of exercise, it helps with water retention. I also like the fact that I don't have to eat a bunch of vegetables every day. Alot of people don't realize that V8 is gluten free. Done right, with a few spices and some vodka, they make a wonderful Bloody Mary. Just the perfect amount of liquid.

review/summary: A good, not-too-sweet cookie to go with tea or coffee
review/text: We always had Stella D'Oro cookies at home throughout the years. They were the closest cookies to bakery cookies on the market. Sadly, the brand was sold several times, and they are not longer identical to the cookies we enjoyed years ago. However, they are still acceptable. The Marherites are a plain biscuit, in chocolate or vanilla. The chocolate has little cocoa and barely tastes of chocolate anymore. The texture seems heavier and doughier--less buttery. But they are not too sweet and make a good accompaniement to a cup of coffee or tea. Over time, it seems many things we had years ago have become cheapened and less tasty but these are a good, plain cookie and they look nice laid out on doilies if you are having people over for coffee.

review/summary: So Far So Good
review/text: I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.

review/summary: Best Cat Food
review/text: I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his "spunk" so I decided it was time to start buying him "real" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!

They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.

review/text: This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.

review/text: I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.

review/summary: Palatable and healthy
review/text: Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.

The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!

review/summary: Taste great and cheaper then in the store!
review/text: I have been buying these from my local grocery store for a while now and was VERY happy to see the Wisecrackers available on Amazon at about 40% below the grocery store prices (and with free delivery)! Cannot beat that! Aside from the price, why do I buy Wisecrackers:<br /><br />1) TEXTURE and CRUNCH: They are much tougher then regular crackers. They hold MUCH better when you need them for a dip, or a base for a topping. They allow you to "feel" the crunch and take a loooong time before getting soggy when covered with a topping.<br /><br />2) TASTE: They taste almost like bread crust, with ONLY 110 calories and 2g of fat for ten good sized crackers (each is about two inches by two inches).<br /><br />3) LIGHT SESAME FLAVOUR: I like the sesame variety the most, for their neutral aftertaste. They are versitile, and go with a variety of toppings (from ham, to salmon, to dips, etc.). They can be eaten alone as well, as a light in-between meal snack.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: My dogs recognize the package & the sound of the tear-off top. As soon as they get a whiff of that peanut-butter flavor, they start dancing & prancing around me!  I''ve gotten these before - the only negative part is the dogs snarf these up too fast!

review/summary: These are a MUST!!!
review/text: My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!

review/text: This cereal is still made and sold. I just saw it today at Publix for $5.99. You are paying for quality ingredients which are not only good for you, but taste amazing as well. I have been eating both Quaker Oat Bran and Quaker Oat Squares for 20 years. It is a great way to start the day. My grandfather introduced them to me when I was younger and my son now eats them and loves them as much as I do. I have never had a weight problem and I believe that having a healthy diet including these cereals every morning have helped me to maintain my high school weight even after having a child. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great tasting way to stay in shape on the outside and healthy on the inside! (and no I don't work for Quaker, I just love the cereal bc it's helped me stay fit and reminds me of Grampa!)

Through<br />AAmazon--I bought several coffee (over 20) brands and sipped up-down, and around the world--and what did I find but a small but well respected brand called Raven's Brew. Stranger names for coffee ( Dead-heads and/or metal-rockers) would you believeAlaskan waterways? Anyway, Tasted four (4) of these::  3 peckered billy goat--yes--like I said, strange but exciting brew-hints of dark chocolate- my TOP NOTCH find--Deadman's Reach--You just know those gold panners are a bit weird, but they DO know coffee! A bit pricy--but well worth  the price--can I even say better flavor than Kirkland Rawandan?

review/text: CAMP 100% PURE MAPLE SYRUP, 8.5 OUNCE BOTTLE, is a delicious maple syrup!  The last time I bought it, it was made in Canada, exclusively.  And I WAS looking ONLY for a CANDADIAN maple syrup.  Why?  Because I had read in a health book that, (at least at that time -- the mid 1970s), CANADIAN maple syrup was tapped from trees WITHOUT any extra ingredient to make the sap run faster.  Unlike American manufacturers of maple syrup, who DO, (or did?), add this extra ingredient.<br /><br />I don't know if this is still the case.  I DO know that most maple syrups made in the U.S.A. will ONLY say "Pure" Maple syrup on their labels -- and they are right, it IS pure maple syrup that is in their bottles.  But whether any extra ingredients to make the sap run faster were added during the tapping process, is not revealed.<br /><br />It bothers me a bit that this syrup is labeled "Grade B".  What does that mean, I wonder?  Until I find out differently, I will assume it means "the Best".  (I must admit to a bit of positive prejudice here, as my mom was born in Canada, and my dad spent his first nine years there.  However, I do try to be absolutely impartial in my reviews -- and opinions.  For instance, though I totally love Canada, the present policy of the Quebec government, mandating that ALL signs, be in French, with any other added languages being in only 1/4 the height, (even such signs as 'Beware of Dog') -- does not seem fair or right to me.  But, I could still easily live with that....  However, the fact remains that "Camp Maple Syrup"<br />did not, (and does not?) have the addition of an extra ingredient to make the sap run faster, seems eminently a fair and honest point in "Camp Maple Syrup", (and other Canadian Syrups), favour!<br /><br />For my money, I'd still rather buy a Canadian maple syrup -- just to be sure.  CAMP Maple Syrup is the only Canadian brand I have so far come across.  Of course, things may have changed -- in both countries -- in the intervening years.  But until I know for sure, I think that, if you want NATURAL, pure maple syrup, buying a Canadian maple syrup -- such as the "Camp" brand -- is a better choice.  (Now, if only they made it in larger, more economical sizes, and/or in a neater, powdered form!)

The 250 gram block is a bit larger than what would be typically be available in US retail stores, but it works.

review/text: Since we have been following the package directions that say to feed 10 treats at one time, our cat rarely throws up at all and her stools are plumper. She has always had tiny, hard stools until we started feeding her these treats. We can tell by her stool if she hasn't had a 10 treat dose in a couple of days. She eats these as readily as any other packaged treat we give her. A great find as cleaning up grassy vomit almost every day was getting quite tedious! The auto ship feature is also a big plus. We can't always get these treats here on our island when we need them. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Maybe too good, cats don't want anything else!
review/text: We occasionally feed a couple stray cats as they are good at keeping the mice and snakes away. Once in awhile we will give them some of these Temptations Cat Treats and they are crazy about them! They will only eat the regular cat food if their efforts at getting more of the Temptations Treats doesn't work. One of them will sit at the door and meow and meow but eventually goes and eats the regular food. We have tried all the different varieties of Temptations Treats and they don't have a preference, they like all of them. If you want something to really great to give your cat, try any variety of the Temptations Cat Treats but be prepared for your cat to start begging for these all the time. The one thing we cannot tell is how good nutritionally these are for cats, the package says 100% nutritionally complete but not sure what that means in this case. Even if you could feed a cat these alone, that would be way too expensive so for now I will balance a few treats with regular varieties of dry cat food.

review/summary: Buy At Your Own Risk; Cat Will Choose TREATS Over YOU : )
review/text: Well, here I am, buying my SECOND 12-pack of these treats.<br /><br />My Egyptian Mau is absolutely NUTS over these and has treat time pegged to two 5-minute windows of time each day.<br /><br />These are great hard-coated treats and my cat loves them like no other.  These packs are the same 3 ounce size I used to buy at the grocery store & every one has been fresh and in excellent condition.  Amazon's Subscribe & Save price is much lower than the local stores' prices.<br /><br />You know what they say:  "Dogs Have Owners.  Cats Have Staff."<br /><br />Maybe he needs his own Amazon account?  No, that would be too dangerous.  I can see a garage filled to the brim with cat toys and a house furnished with nothing but cat trees, live birds, and bowls of goldfish...<br /><br />Try these treats; you won't be disappointed (and neither will your cat, which may be most important)!

My white cat MAY eat a couple if I don't ask to much attention in the process, otherwise he doesn't bother.  I don't know what the difference is but I like them because they don't stink and are easy to regulate piece by piece.

review/summary: Excellent cat treats
review/text: I've been buying cat treats for many years. Of the brands and types that are still on the market, I find that Whiskas Temptations is the one treat that all cats love. They come in several flavors. My cats like the Hearty Beef and Turkey flavors best. Pricing can be an issue as I have noticed continual price increases in this product for the last few years. Shop around and get them where you find the best price. Currently, the best price is about $1.35 per 3 oz. bag. But I,ve seen them at prices up to around $2 per bag.

Even if you just say "yellow bag" the little ears perk up and they are ready to pounce.  Don't have any idea what makes them so irresistable but they obviously are.  I know other people who have had the same experience with their cats.  Too bad chocolate doesn't have 2 calories per piece like this does.

review/text: My cat gets one Whiskas Temptation treat whenever I do her nails. She's always been very compliant, but the treats have made her jello in my arms.

review/summary: Cat's are fickel
review/text: My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever.

review/text: We have two cats.  One is a large black Bombay 4 years old.  The other a Teal Tabby 2 years old.  We love our kitties.  They are our family.  We tried every cat treat we could find and many large animal supply (and small) chain stores and neither Chester or Pumpkin would have anything to do with them except turn up their nose and walk away.  Then we came on "Temptations".  Now, unfortunately, they whine for them all day.  But, loving parents as we are, they usually get them.  An inexpensive and tasty treat.  They get the best food, and now thanks to "Temptation" the best treats.  All they need to get now is a JOB!

review/text: My 4 month old kitten usually eats another variety of Whiskas Temptations (Chicken Flavor Dentabites, which he LOVES!), but he's gotten into the habit of eating my hair that I've shed and that's fallen on the floor(gross, I know), so I decided to get him this hairball control variety of Whiskas Temptations.  The fine print on the package says that it should not be used on kittens less than 6 months of age.  I didn't notice this until after I bought and opened the package.  Hopefully, they'll stay fresh for another 2 months.

review/text: So my cat loves these things. She practically hisses at me at random times and jumps on the counter throws the bag on the floor and starts swatting the bag all over the house. I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.

review/text: I found these in a local Petco and decided to try them with my friend's cat. The cat has gone crazy for these things! I've never seen this cat walk around on two legs, try to climb my arm to get to the treat in my hand, or reach into a bag to try to get to the contents before I gave her some of these. The name is very fitting, but the real temptation is for we humans to keep giving just *one* more treat to the cat over and over again to enjoy the fun reactions.

review/summary: My cat goes bananas for Temptations
review/text: I have a very tall, lean, long-legged male cat. He doesn't eat much. I put out the finest wet food and he shows barely any interest. I buy expensive dry food to supplement his main meals. Eh, he could take or leave it. I even tried giving him high-end tuna from a can--the kind people eat--and he hardly nibbled at it. He just doesn't have much of an appetite, or so I thought. When I sprinkle a handful of these treats on a napkin, he furiously eats them all up. When I open the cabinet where I keep them, he comes running from wherever he is in the house. He seems to like all the flavors equally (chicken, beef, salmon - doesn't matter). Temptations is the only food I can count on his eating on a consistent basis. I could never train him or manipulate him with food before because nothing ever motivated him. These treats motivate him. If I need to calm him down for a brushing or a nail trimming, Temptations will work the magic. Thank you, Temptations.
