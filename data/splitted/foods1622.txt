review/summary: THE BEST
review/text: I have spent soooo much money finding the "BEST" coffee.  This is it.  The best I have ever drank.  Everyone asks "What brand of coffee do you use".  Not strong and bitter, not weak with no taste, just the Best.  I use the Between Roast and you can make it strong or lighter and it is delicious!  G. Ozark, MO.

review/text: It came prompt and sort of alive.  The ceramic pot is definitely different than that in the picture AND the plant is MUCH smaller than in the picture.  I do need to re pot it, as two days after I received it I realized its planted VERY poorly. The roots are not even buried. I don't know if it got knocked around in shipping, or it was a rush job.  Because of the poor planting, it is in rough shape at this point.  Hopefully it will live.

Other containers require two hands or two steps to remove the lid and get at the salt.<br />This one has a convenient, attached cover that won't get lost or dropped and is easy to use one-handed.<br />The included 1/2 teaspoon spoon is not of much use, but is stored out of the way so it really doesn't matter.

I agree with the other reviewer...the top attracts a lot of dust and grime...I just make a point to wipe the silicone down with a sponge more often.<br />2.  The whole point of having a salt pig is the ability to grab a pinch of salt when you need it.  I had read reviews of men complaining the opening was too small...well I'm not a man I thought I was okay...I can BARELY get my fingers in there but it's not very easy and making the opening just a hair bigger would solve the issue.<br /><br />All in all I love it anyway!  Especially the spoon in the back.

review/text: The silicone top on the one I received was misshapen from being loose in the box. When you shut it, it did not close evenly, leaving gaps on either side. I ordered a second one before sending the first one back. The second one arrived anchored in its box properly and the top closed evenly. I have gotten this as a gift for a family member, a chef, who would have been driven to distraction by the first one. The little spoon is fairly useless but the little salt saver works nicely and keeps spatters from cooking out of the salt. Cute and handy.

review/text: I love this little, cool, green, modern-looking container. I use it on my counter for salt. It is the perfect size, and the little 1/2 tsp spoon is very handy. I use it all the time. However, there is one thing that bothers me about it: the silicone top doesn't close completely. There is a gap that is quite noticeable. I understand that it is not suppose to be air-tight, just serving as a cover. But the gap is very conspicuous and takes away from the appearance of the container. If it closed all the way, without the gap, I would have given this product 5 stars.

I changed my mind about buying this other coffee (Indonesian Sulawesi coffee) because amazon stopped selling and Taj 4 u was sellign the same product for much higher price.

review/summary: An above average, authentic, smooth, organic Oolong Tea.
review/text: This "Tao of Tea" Oolong tea is authentic Wuyi Oolong from Wuyishan, China, packaged in Portland, Oregon, and it is organic. Oolong tea leaves are midway between green tea and black tea in terms of processing because Oolong leaves are semi-oxidized, whereas black tea leaves are fully oxidized. The oxidation of the leaves affects the chemical properties as well as the taste of the tea. When brewed according to the directions on the container, this particular Oolong tea turns light amber in color and tastes very smooth and mild with hints of fruit flavor. It does not leave a "grassy" aftertaste the way some other Oolong teas do. Oolong in general does not taste as strong as most black teas. I usually get three infusions from this tea, starting with the original brewing, the third infusion tasting a bit weaker than the first. The flavor is better than some other Oolong tea brands, such as the Oolong variety sold under the Stash label and a few others commonly sold in grocery stores. It is mild, however, and does not have the robustness and richer flavor of "Da Hong Pao" (the most famous of all Wuyi varietals). What makes this Oolong tea stand out is the fact that it is authentic Wuyi tea and organic, in addition to tasting good.

review/text: I bought this because Amazon was out of the Two Leaves & a Bud Assam (which is my favorite).  This has a good clean flavor - slightly earthy, smokey, with some lighter notes (flowery?). Since it's whole leaf tea, I find it less bitter and has a fuller flavor than most bagged darjeeling tea. If you like a bold morning cup of black tea, this might not be the one for you.  However, it is lighter than the assam (or English/Irish breakfast types) and I prefer the darjeeling as an early afternoon tea.

review/text: I bought several varieties of these Crystal Noodle soups from my local grocery for about $1.25 each. The "Spicy Tofu" is very spicy--to the point I was coughing a bit much--and I love spicy Asian dishes like Mongolian beef and kimchee. The crystal noodles (aka, cellophane or bean thread noodles) are plentiful and good.<br /><br />I added some real tofu to the soup because the dried tofu is more like a garnish than an ingredient. I enjoyed eating these at home, but the deep red spices and spicy flavor may not be the lunch idea at an office. Nothing like red splashes of soup broth on your clothes and spicy breath! ;)<br /><br />I tried the same brand soup in the spicy sesame favor, and while spicy it's less so, with a nice sesame butter flavor that I would rate higher.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028PDER6">Crystal Noodle Spicy Sesame Paste, 2.47 Ounce Cardboard Cup (Pack of 6)</a>

I agree with the previous reviewer that they are salty, but I don't think the product was given enough time to reconstitute. My tofu was silky and soft--just like the kind I buy in the store. The cup wasn't overflowing with it, but there was a decent amount. Green onions and little nuggets of ground pork also put this way abover your average ramen. It's a great thing to keep in your desk for those unexpected late nights at work.

review/text: I'm a total noodle head and tried many different kinds of instant noodles out there and these are by far my favorite! I can eat these everyday and I'm far from being a starving student. The high sodium doesn't bother me as much since I usually add veggies and tofu into my container so it becomes less salty and a meal. I've also tried the mushroom flavor one and like that too but this is the one I get a craving for everyday.

review/summary: Easy meals!
review/text: I joke a lot about this stuff, and about the sheer number of people I've known personally who all came up with the "easiest recipe ever". That recipe being some sort of protein, some sort of vegetable, instant rice and this soup baked all together. But the truth is, it does make really easy meals, and I don't think I've ever eaten it as a soup. It's a mix in, to help keep food moist and add flavor.<br />It comes out of the can in a big gelatinous mess and glops over what you're cooking it with. You might need to add a half can or full can of hot water to help it break down a bit more. It's salty, but not too salty when you mix it into something else. Just make sure you taste before adding more salt.

review/summary: It's the red & white can we all know
review/text: Campbell's may not be a fancy gourmet brand, but everyone knows what they're getting when they buy it- no surprises.  Cream of Mushroom soup is a staple in alot of my recipes and I'm not willing to experiment with other brands.  Everyone is probably familiar with the contents of the can; I'll talk about the packaging.  The cans were delivered in a shrink-wrapped cube of two 24-can cardboard trays- inside an Amazon box, of course.  Your delivery man may not appreciate your order- it's not light.  This is the small can size- I wish they offered the family size cans or larger sizes.  If your recipe requires ALOT of cream of mushroom you will be opening alot of cans.  These are the pop-tops, but that is still alot of scraping.  Buying this on the subscription plan is a fantastic deal- if you need it I highly recommend it!

review/text: CAMPBELL'S RED AND WHITE MUSHROOM SOUP, 10.75-OUNCE CANS, (PACK OF 48), certainly<br />DOES have a lot of salt in it, (sigh!)  But somehow, the salt does NOT make this delicious soup taste too salty at all!<br /><br />It's true that CAMPBELL's Does make a less-salty variety, but -- having just had their "Healthy Choice" variety, I wonder if taking out the salt is all that Campbell's does with their less-salt variety.  The "Healthy Choice" Campbell's mushroom soup is far more watery than their regular variety, (does this mean more wheat flour?), and doesn't taste half as good.....<br /><br />I have decided to use this soup, (which I have bought in the supermarket before buying 48 cans all together on Amazon), as a substitute for the far more expensive, (per ounce), mayonnaise that I put in my tuna salad.  Yes, it gives a different taste -- but an altogether delicious one.  And mushrooms are certainly more healthful than oil!<br /><br />I may make my Campbell's Red and White Cream of Mushroom soup a bit healthier by adding a can of whole mushrooms, (pieces and stems is the least expensive), to the soup.  As a snack, as a substitute for mayonnaise, as a base for other recipes, Campbell's Red and White Mushroom Soup is a favourite -- and for good reason!<br /><br />But all that salt isn't really necessary, is it?  Vitamin E is a GREAT preservative, and I hope that Campbell's will soon make another variety -- with Vitamin E as at least half of the preservatives, with a few more mushrooms, less salt, and a little less wheat flower.<br /><br />One "Yummy", as it is now.  Ten million "Yummies" for the soup, if produced, as described in the last paragraph!

review/text: These pearls probably need to be cooked for about 30 minutes to reach the fullest size and chewiest consistency.  They're okay after about 10 minutes of boiling, but they don't expand much in that time.  After the five minutes' boiling directed by the package, they are definitely still hard and starchy in the middle.  The color is nice, but they're not worth the price.

review/text: I bought these colored Tapioca pearls to expand my newest craze - Bobba teas and drinks. The directions call for five minutes - and that's exactly what it took.  They plumped up after a minute and after five minutes they were the size and consistency of Tapioca pearls found in retail bobba shop drinks.  That being said - there are some funky chemical ingredients in these colored pearls. The darker ones seem to have less weird stuff. Regular tapioca pearls contain just tapioca. I'm no food scientist - but if I were thinking of serving this stuff to young kids I'd think twice.<br /><br />The ingredients in the colored pearls are:<br />Tapioca Starch, Acetylated Starch, DHA, Sodium Carboxy methlycellulose (CMC), Guar Gum, Sodium Hydrogen Diacetate (SDA), Water, FD&C Yellow #6,  FD&C Red #40, FD&C Yellow #5 & FD&C Blue #1

review/summary: If only it was true...
review/text: It may taste great, but Colavita's "White Balsamic Vinegar" isn't real balsamic vinegar. Neither is their regular. Check the ingredients. Both list first "wine vinegar." Balsamic vinegars are not made with wine vinegars. Real balsamic vinegar, and there is a white balsamic vinegar version, is made from white Trebbiano grapes in the Modena and Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Regular balsamic vinegar is cooked down 30%-50% and concentrated to produce a dark color and deep, rich flavor. Then it's aged in various wood barrels that are switched-out each year. White balsamic vinegar is cooked at high pressure to prevent caramelization, which gives the vinegar a golden color and gentler flavor. The white balsamic vinegar is then aged for one year; yielding the light color and flavor. I hope you find the real stuff - it's great!

review/summary: I'm not an expert on vinegar, but...
review/text: My favorite dressing is the Dole White Basalmic Vinaigrette that comes in the Cherry Almond Bleu salad mix. I found a copycat recipe I wanted to try but could never find a white basalmic vinegar in the local stores, hence my purchase on Amazon (they have everything!!!). I made the dressing and though it wasn't an exact match it was close, the main difference being my version wasn't as sweet and mild. I did add more sugar which helped but as I have made other dressings with the darker balsamic vinegar I know that the sugar I added was substantial. So my theory is this vinegar is a bit stronger and more bitter than I was led to believe and I would have to say that this product is just okay.

review/text: I starter drinking Milo since I was two years old. It is the first energy drink for kids here in the Philippines. I recall enjoying drinking it even without milk or just eating it raw without hot or cold water when I was a toddler and can't help but love its taste even now that I am an adult.<br /><br />I was very happy to know that in Malaysia they have learned to mix it with Nescafe because it is also a habit of mine, and a few Filipinos. We call it the cheaper version of Starbucks coffee! :)<br /><br />Anyway, I drink my cup of Milo in the morning and before I sleep together with my Gene Eden Vir 101 supplements so I can keep those Chronic Viruses away from my body. The weather in the Philippines is so unpredictable I will need to boost my immune system to the highest level. I suggest you do the same with your body. Milo and Gene Eden combination is a cheap price in comparison to the health benefits it will provide to your body.

review/text: I tried to offer it to some American friends before but somehow they all view it as some inferior product from another country that they refuse to taste, well it's their loss!<br /><br />This is one of the yummiest chocolate drink out there. To make it even tastier, try putting some thick cream with it (like the ones you use for baking, DO NOT use those soy based ones as they don't complement the taste). Then aerate it by using two cups, one empty and one with the drink mixed with water and milk, then you use gravity to spill it from one cup to the other. Repeat for further aeration, the higher you can do it the more aeration (hence more foam effect). If you have condensed milk, use that one as well for good taste.<br /><br />The drink goes great with butter/cream crackers. Enjoy!

The soup base is miso but with udon noodles. So.....yeah. The soup itself does a fairly good job of meeting my expectations in terms of flavor. It's actually slightly spicier than I expected, but not extremely so. The noodles are plain odd. They're too thin and don't have the best texture. They're more like hokkien noodles instead of udon. The solids pack is the most disappointing element though. It contains some of the smallest bits of tofu I've had- even in comparison to other microwavable asian meals! I would suggest the more successful Annie Chun microwavable meals that come in miso and udon variety. On a final note, this price for this pack is a little high. I've seen cheaper per bowl prices in retail stores.

review/text: These taste good in the fact there's no strange after taste that some sugar free products have and have a strong chocolate flavor.  But when it comes to raspberry, once in a while I smell it, but I never tasted it. I wouldn't order these again, but I'm willing to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Sugar free? No way! Really? Wow..
review/text: I was alerted to these by a friend who thought they sounded delicious. So I got them. Wow. They are SO yummy! Each chocolate is individually wrapped inside the bag. When you break open, you see a dark chocolate. When the chocolate touches the tongue, you get a creamy dark chocolate taste, no artificial taste or that unpleasant taste sugar free chocolate often have. And as you suck on this, you start tasting the raspberry. It's so rich and smooth, however, don't overdo it! If you eat more than recommended doses, it will give you an unpleasant taste. It may also act as a laxative...

review/summary: Mmmmmm....tasty!
review/text: My favorite Steaz teas keep changing as i try new ones. So of course, this is now my current flavor, and i must say it is definitely the most well balanced of all of them. The mint doesnt punch you in the face...it is just the right amount of refreshing, and as always, the sweetness is perfect as well. If you are a sugar addict, you may not appreciate this, but as you ween yourself from sugar dependency, you will find that this is, in my opinion anyway, the exact perfect proportion of sweetness to flavor. All the aside, the mint really is the star of this beverage. Really, really perfect. Enjoy a glass on ice anytime, and you will feel a little more refreshed for having done so. I know i do.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: looking for alternative because of can issue
review/text: This iced tea is very refreshing. This slightly minty smooth tea goes down very smoothly. It just hits the spot and usually only takes 2 long gulps, and I'm done. The problem is with the cans. The cans are extremely thin, and the box the cans come in is usually ripped. The biggest problem is that at least 1/3 of the cans I open, the poptab breaks, so I have to manually push the tab down. Although the broken tab stays in place, I'm always having thoughts of swallowing a piece of metal. I'd pay a dollar more if Steaz upgraded their cans and poptabs.

review/text: I was buying this Steaz tea at Wegmans. It's tasty--has a nice mint flavor that's not too little or too much. On our weekly shopping trip, I'd get a couple of cans. Then I found it on Amazon.<br /><br />Not only does Amazon sell it, you can subscribe! If you buy it by the 12-can case, there's a savings. And if you subscribe (I get a case evry month,) you save more. What's more, they even warn you in advance, so if you want to skip, or delay a shipment, no problem--just let 'em know. And finally, they let you know the estimated delivery date when it's shipped.

review/summary: Awesome tasty beverage!
review/text: Steaz Teas are great! Much better for you than other drinks and I can't get over how good they are taste-wise. Great summertime refreshment! Mild sweetness and low sugar - 20g in 2 servings (1 can). I particularly like the Steaz lime/pomegranate, the Steaz mint (this review), and the Steaz Zero Mango/Peach (zero calories and flavored with stevia).<br /><br />One complaint - I ordered in 12s form Amazon and most came bundled to hold the Steaz box together better (too thin Steaz packaging cardboard)- however, one or two 12-packs came unwrapped without the plastic and the box came open in shipping, denting a few of the cans. No harm, no foul I guess but it would be nice if Amazon required all of them to be wrapped. Note: Amazon is typically very good about packaging - so just a minor quam. Still 5 stars on the product.

review/summary: An all-time favorite.
review/text: I grew up in a family of tea drinkers; and although I now tend to have a lot of coffee while I'm at work, I still drink almost exclusively tea when I'm at home. I generally prefer loose leaf teas - that way I know I'll get "the real thing," whereas tea bags tend to contain merely the leftovers of a harvest; little crumbs too poor in aromatic and other content to otherwise pass quality control standards.<br /><br />The exception are Bigelow teas: and first and foremost among those their flagship, Ruth Bigelow's original "Constant Comment" with its recipe of black tea, orange grind and holiday spices (primarily cinnamon). Created by Mrs. Bigelow on the basis of an old colonial recipe over half a century ago, the blend soon became so popular among her friends that their "constant comments" of approval prompted Ruth and husband David Bigelow to found their own tea company. Since then, "Constant Comment" has long become a true classic ... and if you love tea, it is indeed the perfect refreshment; whether or not it's Christmas time. (E.g., it also makes for great iced tea in summer; particularly if you add a bit of lemon.)<br /><br />If you're making more than a single cup of tea, and unless you like your tea *very* weak, you may want to rethink the company's measuring directions - based on the the "one bag per cup" ratio, you'll likely need two or more bags for an entire pot (depending on size), even when steeping an extra minute or two. That said, though ... wanna come over for a cuppa?

review/text: This is the tea of my youth, Friday nights at my best friend's house, brewed up properly in a pot or even just by the mug with a little honey. I like tea that's been steeped a while, and letting this tea sit a bit does not ruin the flavour. The orange highlights are just right and compliment the tea nicely. I can be brought out of the foulest mood by just the scent of the tea brewing in my cup. An excellent tea to have on hand for when you are under the weather, or for those cold winter evenings in front of the fire.

I love it.<br /><br />But, like all people, I just Love a break from every day. When I want a break, I turn to Bigelow's Constant Comment Tea. It is just THE BEST when you want something very special and to break from your day (or evening).<br /><br />Constant Comment NEVER fails to make me go "Ahhhh", and also to make me smile (the truth). A secret here might just be home-made sugar cookies with it...(smile)! The orange/spice, combined with the flavor of the tea, and then the sweet richness of homemade sugar cookies are just "food for the gods", trust me. If you are familiar with Constant Comment, then you know what I am speaking of, if you are not....by all means, try some soon....You'll Just Love It!  ~operabruin

review/summary: Tastes different from usual Constant Comment
review/text: For those used to the 20-pack boxes of Constant Comment, these will be a big let down.<br /><br />Constant Comment is all I drink. I have bought countless 20-pack boxes from Walmart over the last couple years. So I decided I would save some money and buy this in bulk. The first thing I noticed is the packaging is different. In the 20-pack boxes, they're normal thick tea bags, all packed together sitting in the box. In the 40-pack box, the bags are different - cheaper, thinner slip bags, with 4 each in metal-lined paper wrappers that you have to rip open. (See the photo I have attached to this page by scrolling to the top of the product page and clicking on "See customer images")<br /><br />The next thing I noticed was the smell. Whereas the 20-pack bags have a deep and distinctive smell, the 40-pack bags had none of that. It reminded me of some cheap Lipton orange spice tea. Then the taste. I tried my usual 1 bag in a 12-ounce glass of hot water. The taste I have come to know quite well just wasn't there, at all. It tasted diluted - as if there's less tea in each bag - and less rich, again reminding me of Lipton orange spice.<br /><br />So, 239 more bags to go, and I'll be switching back to the Walmart 20-pack boxes I'm used to. This was a big let down, but I'm still a fan of (the Real) Constant Comment.<br /><br />Update: I've tried doing two bags in a 12-ounce glass as well, and it's simply brought out the worst parts even more. There is a weird aftertaste that just ruins it. If I hadn't already given it two stars, I would drop it down to one now.

Having moved to Canada, I have been unable to find it in stores, so I was delighted to find I could order it here.<br /><br />For tea lovers, definitely one to try!  It's black tea with an assertive but not overpowering citrus and spice flavor, equally delicious hot or iced.  The tea can also be used in baking; excellent recipes featuring Constant Comment and other Bigelow teas are available at [...].  I recommend the Constant Comment shortbread!  Easy to make, and delicious, especially with a nice hot cup of tea.

review/summary: Wonderful tea!  We've brewed and drunk this for over 40 years!
review/text: Ruth Bigelow created this tea about 1945.  By about 1960, Constant Comment was sold as bulk tea, in a tea tin, at Jitney Jungle at I-44 & Peoria in Tulsa.  I've still got one of the tins!  My mother used to send me to the store.  She'd brew the bulk tea in a tea caddie and have a glass of iced tea at hand all day long.  I'd come in from playing and drink about half of her glass.  (Half was the most I could get away with without scolding.)  So I grew up drinking this.  (Never learned to like American coffee.)  We've traveled all over and have tried many fine teas, but this is our all-time favorite.  Both Bigelow and Twinnings have many good teas, but nothing is quite as good as Constant Comment!  ;^)<br /><br />Now Constant Comment comes in bags in individual foil pouches.  This has at least two advantages:  the foil preserves freshness and allows one to carry his tea with him to work or school to brew fresh!  The best way to brew Constant Comment is in an Iced Tea Pot.  We have two Iced Tea Pots from about 1998.  Just put two teabags in the holder at the top of the pot, fill with water and turn on.  When the first container of water is done, refill and you'll have two quarts of strong tea from two bags!  When brewed this way, the tea has no bitterness at all, so you don't even need lemon to adjust the bitterness!<br /><br />The best way to sweeten tea is with local honey.  Local honey will also tend to prevent allergic reactions to the local pollen and allieviate any hay fever that you may be experiencing.  But be sure to get at least a quart of honey and put about 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls in a quart of tea!  Enjoy!

review/summary: Competing flavors seem to clash
review/text: This is one of the few Bigelow tea varieties that I actually dislike.  Right out of the foil pouch, when I give the tea bag a deep sniff test (usually my favorite moment with tea), this tea variety has too much going on for my preference.  The flavors added to the black tea (the pouch mentions only orange rind, sweet spice, and "natural flavor") seem to be in competition with one another.  The scent is sort of sour.  Once brewed, the added flavors overwhelm the black tea flavor, rather than contributing to it.  I think it must be primarily the spice in Constant Comment that I don't like, as I have enjoyed other black teas with orange rind.  As far as that goes, I've enjoyed several herbal teas with various spices, too (Bigelow Orange and Spice Tea is quite good), but for me, this flavor combination doesn't work with black tea.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.

review/text: I use this tea for making iced tea.  It is darn near perfect and you can't beat this bulk price at 11 cents a tea bag!  The bags come in a foil sealed pack with 4 bags per pack.  Plus the price is just over $25, so the shipping is free!

review/summary: Delicious flavor that never goes out of fashion
review/text: This aromatic, utterly delicious tea has been on sale in the U.S. for almost 70 years. Nowadays we have endless varieties of tea available, but this one remains one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />It is so flavorful that I make a whole half gallon of tea with one teabag employing the cold-diffusion method. It works like this: I fill a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">two-liter glass pitcher</a> with distilled water made with our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E4AO4O">coutertop distiller</a>. (You can also use tap water put through a carbon filter such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AP7NV">Brita pitcher</a>.) I remove the paper tag on the tea bag and place it in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SSYPKK">stainless steel mesh tea ball</a>. (The tea ball isn't absolutely necessary, but I've learned the hard way that any tea bag can break when tea is stirred briskly, which I always do.) I put the lid on the pitcher and set it in the refrigerator overnight. The next day the tea has completely defused, though there will naturally be more brown color in the bottom portion of the pitcher near the tea ball. To distribute the flavor/coloring evenly, I stir the tea well, and it is ready to serve immediately.<br /><br />If you make ice tea this way, you can sweeten it any way you choose. I personally use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGWIH0">NOW stevia</a>, but honey is an old standby that works really well, too.<br /><br />This tea comes in two sizes, 40 teabags per box, as for this product, and also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRHG">20 teabags per box</a>. It also comes in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BPM">decaffeinated version</a>.

review/text: This is great hot tea, but I use it half and half with regular tea to brew ice tea.  It gives it a whole new flavor.

review/summary: Like Christmas Every Day---or Halloween!
review/text: This is gorgeous tea. I didn't start drinking tea till this year and am almost 40. My mom had a sampler pack from Bigelow and this was among them. I love the story behind the name of the tea. I can just see her working in the kitchen like my Grandma used to do with her cinnamon rolls. Getting the recipe just perfect. Well it has stood the test of time. I love this tea. As soon as it started to turn into fall I had to buy a bunch of this stuff. It just smells like fall to me and for that matter Christmas. I usually drink Bigelow's French Vanilla and Caramel Vanilla as the FV was another in the sample pack. My mom made it for me when my beagle passed away this year. It was very comforting. Vanilla tea doesn't sound like it would be good---sounded like the last thing I would want to even try, but when she brought it in I was in love!!! So that i drink all year along with their soft mint in a green box (? tastes like the mint in Wrigleys Doublemint gum-real soft and mild) (they have many peppermints though!). BUT this is just perfect this time of year.

review/summary: Love Constant Comment Tea hot or cold
review/text: After trying the sugar free Jolly Ranchers I thought I'd check out the prices for Constant Comment Tea. I was down to my last few teabags. I knew Amazon would ship them quickly. I got my order before I needed it. Again, I bought these here at Amazon because this was the best deal I could find. I even saved more on auto-shipment. Cost-wise I saved about 50%. I love to save my hubby money so I can spend some more.

review/summary: SPLENDID, SPLENDID, and SPLENDID!
review/text: I love this tea - light and refreshing - soothing and energizing. Whenever I have a cup of Constant Comment, it seems it is just what I needed right at that moment. It doesn't compete with anything I'm munching on, but I usually just have the tea by itself.<br /><br />Ahhh... think I'll brew a cup now!
