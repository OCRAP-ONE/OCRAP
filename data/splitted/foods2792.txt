review/summary: Wow,  good flavor and texture- like 'regular' gummies :)
review/text: I'm always a bit skeptical about sugar-free candy, especially if they have artificial sweeteners (these have Splenda/sucralose).  I have some sensitivities to artificial sweeteners, and many just taste bad.  But leave it to Jelly Belly to get it done well.  The  only flavor I got that tasted 'artificial'- and had a significant unpleasant aftertaste- was the grape (also tasted a LOT like artificial flavoring- more like grape sports drink than grapes), but the others were good to very good.  The lemon was superior IMO, and I'm not a huge fan of lemon candy on its own.<br /><br />The texture is bonafide 'gummi' ..... Nothing leathery or 'dense' about these.<br /><br />Delivery was SUPER fast on these- I ordered them on a Wednesday, and by 3:15 p.m. the next day, they were at my doorstep.<br /><br />For those who need this information (per the label)<br />Serving size = 25 pieces<br />70 calories<br /> 25 gm TOTAL  carbs<br /> NINE (9) gms of fiber (WOW) and<br /> **** Alert ****  **** Alert ****  ***** ALERT *****<br /> 18 gms sugar alcohols - which can have a profound laxative effect if eaten in excess- or if someone iso sensitive to them. ****

review/text: I love gummies. Their my favorite candy! So I wanted to find a "healthy" alternative to accompany my new diet.<br />I am not one to nit pick about flavors, but this is bad. I (personally) only enjoyed the orange/pink/red flavors. Their very artificial tasting, in a horrible way. I figured the sugar-free digestive effects wouldn't be bad. But this was baaaad. It may vary from person to person, but these gave me a horrible stomach ache and even worse after effects. I would go to the store and buy an individual bag before buying in bulk to see how you react to the gummies.

review/summary: Ginger Spread pricing
review/text: Discovered this product about three years ago, received as a gift. It is a terrific product, useful as a spread or ingredient in sauces and such. However, puzzle me this...I purchased two six-packs of the spread in late October 2011, purchased through and shipped by Amazon. Order totaled $26.04, so shipping was free!<br />Now I see that the price is $32.36 per six-pack, a 248% increase in six months! This price is from Baker's Box, Inc. How is this price justified? Does Amazon itself still offer this product?<br />Please can someone answer this? Thanks.

The concoction looks yummy and actually is yummy.)  I'm now about to see if Amazon carries my other favorites:  Rose's Lime Marmalade and Red Pepper Jelly.  Will read the reviews to find a good brand of the latter.  I just joined Prime and am finding it an incredible boon.

review/summary: A great way to get your cookie fix.
review/text: A review for cookies?  Why not?<br /><br />My wife and I love Oreos.  Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of "snack packs" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie "fix" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off.

review/summary: The perfect format for a student like me, but be careful
review/text: Three important details about me:<br />1. I have a ridiculously fast metabolism so I always want snacks.<br />2. I'm a student often stuck in long, boring lectures or labs.<br />3. I'm cheap.<br /><br />That's why I was so elated when I found this deal.  I already love Oreos and I'm always searching for small snacks I can shove in my backpack when I'm running out the door.  I tend to buy boxes of snacks and just cycle through them: peanut butter crackers, Nutty bars, bags of M&Ms, Moon Pies, etc.  The 48 pack of Oreos was my most recent one and definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />They're packaged pretty lightly in little bags of 6 Oreos and I find it to be the perfect amount so that I'm satiated but not wasting any due to losing taste.  One pack of 48 will last me at least a month (sometimes I eat two or three packs in a sitting, okay?) so Subscribe & Save seemed to be my perfect snack solution.<br /><br />Of course I didn't realize how much Subscribe & Save sucks.  The price on these literally doubled after my first month and I had to cancel my subscription.  That said, the product is great but don't trust subscribing through Amazon.

review/summary: Still The Best.....
review/text: I have had an Oreo addiction since just about the time I knew what a cookie was.  Its funny how Oreos have managed to hang on and become such a family favorite despite all the competition of much fancier cookies that are available.  No nugets going on here, chocolate bits, caramel, icing, or peanuts either.  Just a tasty chocolate cookie shell with a delicious vanilla filling.  Keeping it simple has been the best policy for Oreo lovers for decades now. These little packages contain Oreos that are a smidgen' smaller than the regular box or bag sized variety.  What the cookie and candy industry refers to as the fun size.  That might explain some of the negative comments as to these Oreos being rather cheap with the filling.  In my opinion the ratio is the same, they are just smaller.<br /><br />This 12 pack is an excellent buy on Amazon.  Buy two of them and you get free shipping and for the majority of us, no sales tax.  A fine buy if you have a lots of Oreo fiends in your home that prefer a measured amount of these great cookies.  Like a lot of other reviewers here I tend to eat less of them when they come in the little packages as such.  Great classic Oreo cookies at a good price.  Highly recommended...

review/summary: Excellent sandwich cookie
review/text: Ok, for some of you (NAMELY Mr. A. H. of Detroit, Michigan), anything but a chocolate sandwich cookie, embossed with Nabisco symbols and filled with white creme is a travesty, but Golden Oreos are a worthy addition to the cookie line of Nabisco. These are vanilla cookies, slightly flavored with burnt sugar, filled with the familiar white creme.<br /><br />Unlike classic Oreos, the Golden version have not suffered much from having trans-fats removed. The cookie is still crisp enough and the flavor is the same. By contrast, original Oreos seem a bit softer due to the change in recipe.<br /><br />Another good feature is the fact that Golden Oreos don't leave a dark mess on your teeth. So you can eat one and not check yourself in a hand mirror afterwards if you are being in public. This is a very nice cookie with a cup of tea or coffee and a standard in our house for teatime or dessert.

review/text: Each pack contains 6 Oreos.  That's a tidy size for someone who wants a little snack but tends to overdo it with a big bag of Oreos!  However, having 48 of these in the house has led all of us to a bit of Oreo gluttony.  You know how easy it is..."Oh, there's only 6, I'll have another pack."  As a result our box of 48 has barely lasted a month for three people.  So, I will probably not get this anymore because it's too tempting!

review/summary: Chocolate Cream Oreo Cookies 101
review/text: This is less of a review of the actual cookies; though I rated them 5 stars.  The real merit of this "review" is to provide  information that may help others avoid the confusion that I experienced when I received my order.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the product page on Amazon for "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream."  The Amazon product image clearly said "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream" and I had never seen that product description or package previously.  I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say "Double Stuf" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf.

review/summary: not good
review/text: I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.  You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart.  Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us).

review/summary: keeps cookies tasting fresh and crunchy
review/text: These are always going to be more expensive than buying the single big pack - remember when oreos were packed into three plastic tubes in a plastic box.<br /><br />These oreos always come out crunchy with a very pliable filling that can be easily nudged-rolled off if you don't like the filling.  If Nabisco sold individually wrapped cookies, I'd pay the extra money as I usually only want one cookie.<br /><br />I will always choose to buy oreos packaged in as small a serving as possible despite the expense unless I get some kind of vacuum sealer.

review/text: Great item at $16 (on sale).  My problem with supermarket packaging is the problem that the cookies taste great but once you open the package for about a week the cookies gets moist and taste not nearly as delicious as when the bag was open.  So these small packages, I think 6 cookies each is the perfect size.  They will all taste great and crisp.

review/text: My review is for the product cookie itself, not what might happen if you buy food from Amazon. Oreo is a classic cookie, and while I can't say that I am a big fan of all their flavors, I really enjoy three flavors - original, Uh-Oh Oreos, and the top of the list, Mint Oreos. The flavor is strongly reminiscent of the Thin Mint cookies sold by the Girls Scouts. Unfortunately, they only sell their cookies once in a while, but I can head to my store any time I have a craving for the flavor of chocolate and mint in a cookie. I even like this better than original Oreo, and that's saying a lot. Nom nom.

review/summary: Chocolate covered Oreo recipe
review/text: Everyone loves Oreos. They're even better dipped in chocolate. I made a plate of them for my son's Cub Scout cookie auction and a plate of my cookies sold for $20. So yummy.<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />2 tablespoons shortening<br />1 package Oreos<br />*optional: 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening<br /><br />**Before you begin, make sure everything is absolutely dry. Even a drop of water will ruin your creation.**<br /><br />Melt the chocolate chips with the shortening in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir until melted. If needed, heat another 10 seconds at a time until melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.<br /><br />Place one cookie in the chocolate and coat. Use a fork to scoop it out, tapping against the bowl and scraping the bottom of the fork on the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on wax paper and let it set. Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate. Plate them together for an eye catching presentation.

review/text: I second Joanna Daneman's observation that these golden Oreos are preferable to the regular chocolate Oreos when you are in public.  Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.  They are addictive.<br /><br />If you like vanilla sandwich cookies, try the Golden Oreos!

review/text: It is hard to imagine something as good as the original chocolate oreo.  That was in the days when Oreo only meant one thing:  Two chocolate wafers and vanilla cream.  The best way to eat those was to soak them until they were soft in ice cold milk (only could get whole milk back then).  Now there are how many things with the oreo name? TOO many.<br /><br />But this! The Golden Oreo.  Truly wonderful.  Totally different than the original oreo.  But wonderful. It is also BETTER than the current chocolate Oreo.  I wish I could taste-test the original oreo for comparison, but cannot be done...

review/text: I noticed when I went to Einstein's that Oregon Chai concentrate is what they use to make my chai latte, so I decided to purchase my own concentrate to make my own chai lattes at home and at a better price.  I found the "Slightly Sweet" version on Amazon and happily purchased it.  This chai has all the right spices (cardamom, black pepper, cinnamon, etc.) and (I think) a much better level of sweetness (especially when mixing with vanilla soy milk) for a tasty mid-afternoon drink. It is delicious. Buying it in a six pack from Amazon was convenient and economical.

review/summary: Much better than I'd expected!
review/text: I love the liquid chai that most coffee places use in their drinks. (Which almost always ends up being Oregon Chai.) Love it. Unfortunately I'm on a diet where I'm counting carbs, so I've been avoiding it due to the amount of sugar in the drinks because I just can't bring myself to use up that many of my daily carbs on a beverage. I know that I'm not alone when I say this.<br /><br />The carbs in this are far lower than the regular chai, which is awesome. It's about 5 carbs for a half cup, which is great! The best thing about this though, is the taste. It's obviously less sweet than the regular chai mix (which can be fixed with a no-calorie sweetener with no problems if you do like it sweet), but more than that... it's tasty. It's not one of those diet type drinks where you grit your teeth and just try to adapt to the taste.<br /><br />This is delicious and to be honest, I like that it has less sugar/sweetener in it. I'm a pretty big fan of Splenda and other non-sugar sweeteners, so I like being able to use those in it and I also like being able to control the level of sweet. For those who don't like overly sweet things, you're in luck here because while this is sweet enough that you don't have to add anything (I just had a mega sweet craving this morning, which is why I added splenda), it's not overwhelmingly so.<br /><br />Absolutely something I'm going to buy from my grocer again.

review/text: The product description claims "It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors." This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether "diet" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the "Dr. Pepper": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind.

review/text: I like the taste of coke and pepsi, if I had to choose between both of them I would choose Pepsi.  The soda stream cola is awful.  I can normally drink any soda, but this one is almost undrinkable.  I gave it two stars because it is better for the environment.

review/summary: I won't buy it again
review/text: The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.  The Cola has a chemical taste which I think is coming from the acesulfame potassium.  I'm not a health food nut but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  The sample pack had some good tasting flavors such as Orange, Dr. Pepper, and Root Bear which all tasted as good as anything you buy in the store.  However I'm a cola drinker and the regular cola won't cut it for me.  The Diet Cola is even worse.  I'd like to try the Tonic but the reviews are terrible.  I'm planning on trying the All Natural Cola.  If the Natural Cola does not work I will be selling the Sodastream.  Sodastream is a ingenious idea, but unless they can come up with better cola's I think it will be a passing fad.

review/summary: SULFITES!!!! NOT MENTIONED BUT INCLUDED!!!!
review/text: I have worked for a major retailer for the past 20 years, we sell Soda Stream and all its accessories.  I even performed ALL the product samplings this past 4th quarter.  I bought one for myself.  I like it okay but slowly came to realize that every time I drank the diet cola my face would erupt with cysts that were huge and raw.  I thought it was stress or something else.  I went to an allergist and tested with very strong reaction to "sulfites".  everyone, I mean EVERYONE look at your bottles of syrup and despite all the "healthy" mumbo jumbo find the small print "contains sulfites".  My Dr. told me to stop drinking the soda stream diet cola (I believe all the flavors have sulfites, but I could be wrong) for several weeks.  I complied and stuck with good old Diet Coke.  My face cleared up within a few days and was cyst free.  Them my Dr. instructed me to make a batch of the diet cola in the 1 liter bottle and drink it throughout 1 day.  The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.  Little did I know I was selling something tainted with sulfites.  If you have noticed any strange blisters, cysts or acne do as I did with my Dr.s instructions and see for yourself.  I am male so don't insinuate it was a "monthly menstrual cycle".  BEWARE.

review/summary: SodaStream Jet
review/text: My family LOVES the sodaStream fizzy water,  and HATES the flavors SodaStream makes-  there is a definite aftertaste of Not-Sugar (sucralose) in the concentrates,  which can trigger migraines in sensitive people (like us).  However,  we have found that mixing the fizzy water with half juice (real cranberry is a favorite, and even the V8 V-Fusion juice blends)  gets us drinking more water and less juice without sacrificing taste. For lightly-flavored waters we do use a small amount of natural flavor extracts (we like McNess- no propylene glycol)  rather than the fruit flavors offered by SodaStream.  Definitely get an extra 2-pack of bottles,  though,  to keep chilled water ready for fizzing in the fridge. The gas cartridge refills  are quite easily found, as well.

review/text: Even though I opted out of recieving "email reminders" to leave feedback/reviews I just received one from this company, so here's my review:<br /><br />I've already left a review for the SodaStream machine, and it is not complimentary due to the monopoly on the CO2.  Had this firm read my recent reviews they would have seen that I dislike being asked to leave feedback and reviews.  It is unprofessional.<br /><br />The product is just ok, but being hounded to leave reviews/feedback prevents even a three star review.  If I were to buy this product again, and that is very doubtful, I'd go back to buying from a brick and mortar retail store, pay a higher price and sales tax.

review/summary: The taste isn't quite right...
review/text: I love the product so far - I think it's a great idea, saves money and saves me from carrying heavy bottles up 3 flights of stairs... but the syrup tastes "off". I would compare the regular flavors to off-brand, diet soda, and I haven't tried the diet flavors yet because I can't imagine that they would taste any better. I can tell that they use Splenda (or something other than real sugar) because the "sweet" taste that's found in most sodas is just not there.<br /><br />All of that aside, most of the flavors DO taste similar their counterparts (Fountain Mist = Mountain Dew, Lemon Lime = Sprite, etc.) I would recommend getting the Variety Pack to find which things you like before you buy a bottle that makes 12 liters.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I purchased the Soda Stream (Starter Kit)  as a Father's Day gift for my husband. We both enjoy soda water, but there are only a few brands we've found which do not taste "soapy."<br /><br />We've only had it for a week, but this little gadget works as advertised. It is easy and quick  and effective to use, and we all like that we can control the level of "fizz."  I like more, the kids like less. I bought extra bottles and flavorings (for the kids) so everyone could do their own. We use it mostly with filtered water, although the tap water works perfectly well too, as long as you have good tap water.<br /><br />The flavorings will be used  not as much around here, although they seem good and the kids like them.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product. The only caveat I would give at this point, is make sure you want more "gas" in your life.  My entire family is doing a lot more belching and burping than we ever have before, but we like this machine!

review/text: They advertise that they contain 'no aspartame in diet flavors' and boldly state 'no high fructose corn syrup', but the regular flavors contain sucralose artificial sweetners making it taste awful. No disclaimer on the front of the bottle. How can they legally NOT call it DIET if it has artificial sweetners? Anyway, unless you like and can drink diet drinks you will not like 'regular' flavors either.

Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving.

review/summary: What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical
review/text: The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

I may be on either side of the trade by the time you read this -- I am not very sentimental.

review/summary: Warning, non-diet syrup contains Sucralose (Splenda)
review/text: This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a "half diet" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.

review/summary: Sodastream
review/text: After years of dealing with increasing price of soda, finding place to store it and returning  empty bottles decided to give this a try. We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost.

review/text: I drink energy drinks maybe once or twice per week.  I usually stick to red bull or rock star as those cans don't overdo the caffeine and have a decent flavor.  The soda stream mix tastes very similar to rock star and costs a lot less money.  Just watch your serving size when you use the soda stream.  All canned energy drinks have a limit whereas you could drink the whole bottle of soda stream if you don't watch your serving size.

We love this one.<br /><br />Cola<br />This cola flavoring is ok. It's not great. You can easily make simple syrups that will not be a cola flavor but will taste much better than this flavor. This is the equivalent of RC Cola. Ok but it's not near as good as other name brand colas.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: The Soda Club machine is great.  We enjoy all the flavors (excluding the mango one).  I read the other reviews, my family doesn't understand what after taste they are refering too.  I have been drinking Pepsi all my life.  It is finally great to have soda without aspartame and corn syrup!  Plus, I am saving lugging 2-liter jugs from the grocery store and have cut down on the amount of garbage I throw out.  There are a lot of flavors at [...].  Yeah for Soda Club!!

review/summary: Nasty-Tasting Stuff
review/text: This is the worst tasting cola I've ever tried. It has a horrible after-taste that is completly unacceptable. I'm now stuck with a very exspensive machine, that I can make carbonated water with, and replacing the carbonator is around $80.00. Bad purchase.

review/summary: Good idea, needs some tweaks...
review/text: I love the Soda Stream unit, but the syrups need some tweaks.  It is too sweet, so I use half the amount required; this is good if you want the product to last longer; this is bad because they use Splenda added to all their recipes, not just the diet.  If they would just use plain old sugar, I'd be much happier with this product.

review/summary: Splenda in every flavor...tastes horrible
review/text: Wanted the Sodastream for my birthday.  Got it, made up the first cola.  It was horrid.  Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Decent Set of Flavors But
review/text: You have to sample them all to find the ones you like.  You'll miss out if you judge them all after tasting one or two.  My favorites are Diet Orange, Diet Raspberry/Cranberry, and Diet Energy. Diet Dr. Pete and Diet Root Beer aren't bad either.  They mix well with alcoholic beverages as well.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />I encourage everyone to visit the SodaStream webstore BEFORE purchasing any of products here. There are many flavors at the SodaStream webstore not offered here like DIET Energy and DIET Orange.  Also, as of 2/15/2012, they charge 40-50% less at the SodaStream webstore but you may have to pay for shipping.  However, if you buy 10 bottles at Sodastream, you'll get 1 bottle free.  I'm not slamming the Amazon merchants but I think consumers should be aware of the significant price mark-up.<br /><br />(With this exception, I've found Amazon prices to be competitive with other stores so I continue to be an Amazon Prime Member.)<br /><br />If you only want one bottle, it may make sense to pay twice as much with free Amazon Prime shipping.

review/summary: It's ok, but it's no "Diet Coke"
review/text: As other reviews have mentioned, this pice is ridiculous.  However the product itself is decent.  I purchased this elsewhere because I love the taste of Diet Coke and read some reviews that  tastes just lke Diet Coke.  (My parents have had a soda fountain in their house since I was 2, I'm 31 now) ...  This tastes alot like Coke but no like Diet Coke(which makes sense, it doesn't use aspartame, it uses the sugar free sugar stuff)<br /><br />It is nice being able to make soda on demand though ...  I'm going to siphon some syrup from my parents and try that (if it works, you can get 5 gallon "bags" of Diet Coke from SAMs club, makes 35 gallons of soda)

review/text: Either I'm missing something and this is a double pack, which the description does not seem to support, or these people are insane.  There are loads of places to get this same product for $3.99, $4.99, even as high as $5.99.  What are they thinking?

review/summary: brings back memories
review/text: Over 70 years ago my Grampa took me to the beach almost every day., To me, highlight of the outing was when he bought us "Orange Crush" in the heavy dark brown bottle, from the vendor boy.  Back then the juice was unfiltered and there was even small bit of orange in it.  For many years I hve tried to find something to drink like the ORIGINAL OC.(to no avail)  I use my seltzer siphon and if I tinker with the amount of syrup I can get really close to perfect.  I am so glad I bought this, just great.,

review/summary: Pretty good taste; goes a long way
review/text: Contains both sugar and sucralose (Splenda), which leaves me a bit of an aftertaste. (Your mileage may vary.) Everyone else in the family likes it -- pretty good root beer taste. We don't have a "SodaStream" carbonator, but just use plain old carbonated or sparkling water to mix it. A little goes a long way, making it cheaper than most alternatives.

review/summary: Energy Drink vs Red Bull
review/text: I love this product.  I've heard alot about the Sodastream and finally decided to purchase one, and as I drink a lot of Red Bull (mainly as a cocktail mixer), I gave this mix a try.  Quite impressed on just how I can't really tell the difference between this Energy Drink Sodamix and Red Bull, other than the price.  On average I spend about $2.25 per can of Red Bull, and this Sodamix will yield 50 8oz servings, so easy math says $112 for 50 cans of Red Bull or $6.99 for the Sodastream Energy Drink Sodamix 16.9 Fl oz bottle and 50 8oz servings.  And as not to be biased, I have a few friends who also drink Red Bull who all agreed that it was a toss up on tasting the difference between the two products, and how much money could be saved.

review/summary: Energy Drink Flavor is Spot On!
review/text: I have to say that if you are a fan of the energy drink with the initials R B (moo) then you will be a HUGE fan of this. The flavor is a perfect match. I am so hooked that I will never spend a dime in the store for the name brand again.
