review/summary: My dog went wild for this food.~But not quite so good for him.
review/text: I have a 7 yr old Pom who has been on Rachel Ray's Weight Control food and green beans for 4 months and he lost his 2 extra pounds and is very healthy. The bag weighs more than he does. He knew it was his right off. I gave him a little handful while I read about the ingredients and how much to feed him. I was a bit shocked when I read the label of ingredients..the highest amount is always listed first. I expected beef or carrots no it is ground yellow corn meal, chicken by product meal, corn glutton, whole wheat flour animal fat, rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol meat and bone meal.Then tons of chemical additives, some dried corn and carrots. This is a semi soft food dogs love, no wonder just like people what tastes so good is usually bad for us. When I adopted the dog he was on another semi-soft that really is not to healthy so I switched him to Iam's Proactive. He did well on that but started to gain some weight.<br /><br />I'm sorry I didn't check the ingredients before orderings. The picture looks so healthy great balanced nutrition. Think we will stay with Rachel Ray's healthy weight food, it doesn't have all these additives. Just meat and veggies. Beneful is a misleading name.<br /><br />It can be given in small amounts I think as a treat.

review/summary: Not so healthy
review/text: I'm gonna confess. I'm trying to find a different alternative to feeding my dog Blue Buffalo dog food. I should really give up the hunt because really Blue is one of the best quality foods around.<br /><br />I thought this maybe a healthy choice for my dog but I was wrong.  When I looked at the back of the package it had the following ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, water, meat and bone meal, propylene glycol, sugar, tricalcium phosphate.....  Just to name a few. I dunno, but that doesnt exactly strike  confidence in me as a buyer.  And as others have said some of their dogs are getting sick, there have been recalls etc with this product.<br /><br />Now, dont get me wrong, my dog loves it. But then again if I feed kids french fries every day they'd love it too.  So that isn't a good measure.<br /><br />I think what put me over the edge is when I opened the container(where I put my dog food) and it smelled processed  and made me gag. The food smelled fake. The same effect does not happen when I buy Blue.<br /><br />It's true you get what you pay for. I'll be sticking to a higher quality prodcut.

review/summary: Mystery Manufacturer
review/text: My Dobie is 5 years old and has been eating dry dog food twice a day. Most of the time he will not eat the dry food unlesss I enhance it with some canned dog food or some table scraps or sprinkle some cheddar on top. I have been buying the top of the line (expensive) dry food that is made in the USA. My previous Dobie died of food poisoning from food made in China so I am very careful about what I feed my current pet.<br /><br />I opted for this Beneful because I have not seen any articles lately about a Purina recall due to adverse results from using their products. When the product arrived I set the box on a coffee table and opened it to remove the bag of food. My Dobie, Max, was standing near me and when I opened the lid of the box he reached in and started to sniff the bag. This was strange behavior for him. I took  out the bag of food and opened it. I would like to point out that the bag opens by using a zipper. I had not seen this on bags of food before and should be a requirement for all dog food producers. Anyway, when the bag was opened Max went nuts and hopped around excitedly. I reached in and got a handful of the food and held it out to him and he inhaled it. I did this a couple of more times and he continued his inhalation. He has never done this before with any dry dog food.<br /><br />The next morning I mixed a cup of his regular food and a cup of Beneful and he immediately downed the entire serving. I cannot explain what it is in the Beneful that turns him on. I am not an expert dog food nutritionist so I don't know if it is a non-nutritional ingredient that tickles his fancy or something actually healthy.<br /><br />I searched the web, including the Purina site, for any information regarding the source of Purina dog food. I could find nothing. I also thoroughly scanned the Beneful bag to locate the name of the manufacturer but no such information is provided. This really bothers me that Purina is ashamed to reveal the source of its products. I have given this Beneful 3 stars because although Max loves the food I don't know if it is healthy. I will keep a very close eye on Max and if I see any change in his behavior as far as droopiness or inactivity or whatever then I will discontinue with the Beneful. I deducted two stars for the gutless lack of forthcoming information by Purina.  I will not buy any Purina products because of their secrecy of manufacture policy.

review/summary: Nice Treat for the Dog - But Not Good for Everyday Consumption
review/text: Purina Beneful must be one yummy dog food - my papillon loves the stuff.  There are crunchy bits in there, there are chewy bits in there, there's a fun mix of red, green, yellow, and brown bits in there, and all in all, the stuff doesn't stink too badly (well, human standpoint).  However, if you read the label, this stuff is like feeding your family tv dinners or powerbars all the time.  Nutritionally, it's lacking.<br /><br />First off, the first few ingredients are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, and beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols.  So you have ground corn, reject chicken bits (head, feet, entrails, lungs, spleen, bones, possibly feathers), corn gluten meal (a natural herbicide...edible, but not particularly palatable), wheat flour, and rendered beef fat.  Now, the "great tasting protein from real beef and highly digestible egg" don't really show up until 7 ingredients down...and call me crazy, but I don't see a form of egg in the ingredients.  I see lots of preservatives, and peas and corn near the end, but not so much in the egg department.<br /><br />That said, the food is kinda equivalent to fast food or junk food to humans.  Tastes good, looks okay, but if you eat it everyday, you might end up like that guy from Super Size Me.  Would I feed this to my dog every day?  No, unless I'm feeding my dog this with a can of high quality dog food.  Will this hurt my dog to eat this every day?  Probably not, although he does poop a lot more, have stinkier poops, and has to eat a lot more of this stuff in order to meet his dietary needs.  He also gained a little weight because of this stuff, but not a big deal since he's super active.<br /><br />There are a lot better foods out there for your dogs, if you're willing to spend a little more, however this is a nice treat mix.

review/summary: Sticking with Pedigree
review/text: My beagle is a pretty picky eater (weird for a beagle, but she's kind of a diva!).  Anyway, I normally feed her Pedigree, but thought I would give Purina's Beneful a try since it claims to be healthier.  I did mix this in with her Pedigree at first just to avoid her getting sick from an immediate switch and would recommend doing that no matter what food you're switching to/from! She seems to like the taste and the texture is pretty much the same as the Pedigree Adult dog food.<br /><br />So since the texture and taste (I assume from observing her eat it) seem to be comparable to what she was already eating, I decided to look and see if the ingredients really are better in the Beneful.  I found that the main ingredient is yellow ground corn, with other key ingredients being chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal and whole wheat flour (and the list goes on and on, but those are the main ones). I have no problem with those ingredients, but they are pretty much the same as the ingredients in the Pedigree I'm already feeding my dog and the Pedigree is a better price.  Overall, I don't think this food is any healthier/better for your dog than the other large brands out there, so I personally am not willing to pay more for Beneful since it's the same.

review/summary: Not Great, But Serves As A Snack
review/text: The nutrition quality on this food isn't good enough that I would be happy actually feeding it to my dog as her primary food source. She does seem to like it, though, so I've been giving it to her a little at a time as a snack when I need her to eat just a little bit of something. Since it's different from what she usually gets, she seems to think of it more as a treat and she'll munch on it when she might ignore her regular food.<br /><br />The way it's packaged is nice, particularly due to the resealable zipper.<br /><br />In short, if I were actually treating this as a primary part of a dog's diet, it would be two stars at most. As an addition to my dog's diet in small quantities, she's willing to eat it in spite of being very very picky, so I'll bump it up to three.<br /><br />If you're actually looking for a primary food for your dog, on the other hand, I would definitely suggest looking for something that doesn't have corn as its first ingredient, doubly so if there's any sign your dog might have an allergy (skin irritations, frequent ear infections, that kind of thing).

review/summary: Not the best nutrition, but the dogs love it
review/text: The first thing I have to say is my dogs love this.  It's what my dad feeds his dogs, and my dogs always raid their food dishes when I take them to his house.<br /><br />And, when I set this food out next to their regular food, my dogs will always eat the Beneful first.  But then, if I set out Twinkies for my kids next to vegetables and chicken strips, I can pretty much guarantee the kids would reach for the Twinkies first.<br /><br />I'm not saying Beneful is the same thing as Twinkies, but it's pretty obvious that it's got more flavor than what my dogs are used to. So I suppose if you have a finicky dog then Beneful might be something to consider.<br /><br />But if you're concerned about nutritional intake, here is a review of Beneful's ingredients (in order):<br /><br />Ground yellow corn<br />Chicken by-product meal<br />Corn gluten meal<br />Whole wheat flour<br />Animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E)<br />Rice flour<br />Beef<br />Soy flour<br />Sugar<br />Propylene glycol<br />Meat and bone meal<br />Etc etc etc with several dozen "ides" and "ates"<br /><br />Essentially, it's not that much different from the other dog foods sold in grocery stores.  That said, I do like the fact that the bag is a sturdy plastic and the top has a sliding "seal" that keeps the food secure and fresh.<br /><br />So here's how I use this food:<br />For years my dogs have been eating kibble-style food from a local pet store. Even though it's very healthy for them (chicken and lamb are the primary ingredients), I could tell they were a bit bored with it after five years.  But now, with Beneful around, my dogs "wait" for me to toss in a few Beneful kibbles before they start eating.  It's obvious they love the flavor, so in a way it's probably like giving them dessert (a doggie version of Twinkies?) with their dinner.<br /><br />Overall, it doesn't provide the best nutritional value, but the dogs love it. So, like I said, it might be something to consider if you have a finicky dog.  Or, you might consider it as a supplemental food if you want to provide your pups with more flavor in their meals. Personally, I wouldn't make it their main food source, but as a supplemental (and flavorful) extra I think it works just fine.

review/summary: MY FEELINGS ARE MIXED ON THIS ONE!
review/text: After having my vet look at the ingredients list on this and telling me his opinion of it, I was skeptical to feed it my dogs. Sounds healthy and it is to an extent. But it's got too much filler and fat in it to be really healthy. It must not be that great because my dogs will literally eat just about anything, including cat turds(gross!) and they snubbed there nose up at this stuff. My vet recommended I stay away from Purina brand because there is much controversy surrounding them with all the recalls they've had in recent years on pet feed. I normally feed my pets Science Diet, but thought, since this was free, I would give them something different to try or something to snack on as a treat. Price isn't that bad, but it just doesn't seem that healthy for your pups. After what my vet told I wasn't going to feed it to my dogs but was curious to see if they would eat it. Pass on this. There are a number of other dry dog foods that are much healthier than this stuff.

review/summary: Packaging implies greater nutritional value than the product delivers
review/text: We have two medium sized dogs, and like most canines they eat whatever they can as quickly as they can. So it can be a challenge to assess how much a dog likes any particular food. Nevertheless, our dogs went nuts for Purina Beneful - so that question is answered.<br /><br />The larger question for any dog owner, however, is what goes into their processed chow. Looking at the packaging for Beneful, one gets the impression a serving of this stuff is the equivalent of a nice, fresh salad. That might be true if your idea of a salad is ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols, rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitol, tricalcium phosphate, water, animal digest, salt, phosphoric acid, potassium chloride, dicalcium phosphate, sorbic acid, and l-lysine monohydrochloride. After those 19 primary ingredients are thrown into the hopper, dried peas and carrots appear on the list. Hmmm.<br /><br />Packaged dog food is what it is - a cheap way to give your pets a reasonably well-balanced diet at a low cost in a convenient form. Purina knows this, too, but by showing a cornucopia of fresh veggies on their packaging, they imply that this product is made with something that it is not.<br /><br />That's a little crass, and it certainly doesn't convince me to keep buying this product.

review/summary: The Right Choice for My Dog at This Time in Her Life
review/text: My canine soul mate is a wonderful 13 year old female Black Lab named Jessie.  We've been constant companions since she picked me to be "her human" at the age of 6 weeks.  I've always fed her very conscientiously, augmenting her balanced dog food with select raw vegetables, including carrots and peas, and never allowing her to eat table scraps or high fat treats.  Over the years, she has maintained her target weight and has always had good teeth, gleaming soft fur, and lots of energy.<br /><br />About six months ago, Jessie started refusing her regular food, and had to be coaxed to eat.  My vet told me that despite her good physical condition, her age is beginning to tell.  He recommended that I try out different brands of dry dog food, and at this point in her life, feed her something she enjoys eating.  I tried a couple of new brands, but she wasn't interested.  Then I received a sample bag of Beneful through the Amazon Vine Program.  Bingo!  Jessie loves it and is now eating again ... and with a gusto that she hasn't displayed in months.  She is also noticeably more energetic than she has been in the past year or so.  And Beneful appears to be very easy on her digestive system.<br /><br />When she was younger, I would have been more concerned about Beneful's list of ingredients, which is a little light on protein.  However, I'm so happy that she's eating, I'm sticking with Beneful.  She's just finished the bag of Original Formula that I received from Amazon, and now I'm transitioning her to the Healthy Weight Formula, which she also seems to enjoy.  Individual dogs have special needs that vary according to their breed, their level of activity, and where they are in their life cycle, and I feel it's up to us as responsible caregivers to make the right choices that will benefit our beloved companions.  Personally, I'm very pleased to have found in Beneful a food source that seems to have restored my dog's quality of life during her old age.  I hope that my experience, taken in context, will help you make the best choice for your pet.

review/summary: Dog loves it, but nutritionally it's basically candy
review/text: OK, the dog scarfs this down. But put a bowl of M&M's and a bowl of Broccoli in front of a child, and guess which bowl will be empty? It's the same with this.  I mix this with healthier food as filler. My dog is not that active, and all these carbs and fat would make for one fat puppy.  If, on the other hand, he was active and outside all the time, running around, etc. the carbs would burn off (same as for people!)  Fat is supposedly good for the dog's coat and skin.  So, if your dog is a finicky eater, fido will inhale this.  If you have an active dog, this is probably fine. If it's an indoor pet, this is better off as a mix-in, but not as a staple.<br /><br />There's no smell, and the food does not clump or stick. The bag is really sturdy - it's made of the same stuff as those blue tarps, so won't tear, and any opening you make won't spread.

review/summary: doggy like it a lot
review/text: The ingredients on this dog food say it all - corn and chicken by-product are the first ingredients. This is not what dogs were meant to eat, and I ordered this through Vine before reading the ingredient list. I like to have backup dog food in case we run out, and suprisingly my dog loved this.<br /><br />Many people say you shouldn't switch a dog's food quickly because their stomach won't adjust. I tend to feed my dog a combniation of a raw diet (raw meat, chicken, vegetables) and all natural dog foods from bags or cans.<br /><br />I did notice that my dog tended to have very runny poop after eating this, so I've stopped giving it to her more than one meal per week, and use it as emergency backup only.<br /><br />Dogs, like people, were meant to eat real food, mainly plants and meat...not this stuff. I gave it 3 stars because she liked it and ate it in its entirety, and I think it's like most conventional dog food available.

review/text: I confess that I did not read the ingredients in this dog food before I hit the order button.  MY BAD!<br />I would NEVER give this to my dog after reading the ingredients.  It turns out many others have repeated the ingredient list (and the major flaws those ingredients pose for the health and longevity of your beloved pet) so I'm not going to repeat that info.<br />I really struggled with what to do with this new, unopened bag of dog food.  Our local shelter is desperate for funds and food, but even with that fact I felt terrible that some poor dog who was already abandoned and in poor condition would be fed this junk.  I wound up bringing the food to the shelter and told them about my misgivings about giving any animal this food and told them I would respect their decision to use it or not.<br />It turns out their policy is to ONLY give "junk food" if there is absolutely nothing else to give the pets because it is better than starvation.<br />I do not eat processed foods, junk food or factory food and I don't feed them to anyone I love--including my beloved and beautiful four-legged best friend.

If dogs were out in the wild, they sure wouldn't walk up to a cornfield and think, yum! corn.  They would chase down the mice first!<br /><br />The dogs did eat it but they weren't excited about it.

review/summary: Corn Is The #1 Ingredient . . .  .
review/text: Purina Beneful has not been out for long, but it has become hugely popular!  My sister just switched her dog to it this summer, because he was having some stomach issues; she thought a new dog food might be a good idea.  (His stomach issues quit right before she switched, though.)  She was feeding <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDEI6W">Purina One Chicken & Rice Dog Food, 4-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, which is an excellent dog food, with meat as the first ingredient.  Corn is the first ingredient in Beneful.  Corn is a filler food, and not really good for dogs, cats, ferrets, etc.  Yet, so many animal feeds have it, including many of the outrageously expensive Science Diets.  And so many pets have eaten corn based food their entire lives, and lived a long,long time.  You could go nuts figuring out what to feed your pets!  (Oh, and don't feed your ferrets nuts!)  Personally, I think Purina One is a far superior feed over Beneful.  That's what I feed my cats--<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AH3RN">Purina One Cat Smartblend Chicken and Rice Cat Food, 16-Pound</a>.  (Oh, and my ferrets, too--<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AH3RP">Purina One Kitten Growth & Dev, 7-Pounds</a>.)  But my sister's dog loves Beneful, is doing fine on it, and she's sticking with it right now.  She says her dog needed more vegetables. :)

review/summary: NOT a premium dog food!
review/text: Got this to try not realizing that the misleading photo on the package (vegetables, meats, grains) would NOT be used to make a premium dog food.  Reading the label, the first five ingredients disqualify it as any kind of premium anything!  They are: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E).  Um, where is the meat?  And ground yellow corn should NOT be the most plentiful ingredient.<br /><br />Giving this to a dog insures that not only will you be feeding the dog twice as much, but that he will poop an incredible amount.  The premium dog food that my dog now enjoys (Orijen Six Fish and Seafood) costs more, but I use half as much and he poops 1-2 times a day instead of every walk.<br /><br />Buy the better brands and be sure to check out the first five ingredients on any dog food before purchase.

review/summary: Poor Quality Dog Food!
review/text: I was excited about feeding my Golden Retriever and Bichon this food since it is touted as being so healthy, but after reading the ingredients I realize that it is NOT so healthy.  Ground yellow corn is the first ingredient!  What about all the veggies on the front?  I prefer to feed my dogs food that has  meat as the first ingredient...real meat!  Dogs are carnivores and need some meat in their diet and not just ground corn , chicken by-product meal (whatever that is) and corn gluten meal.  Not for my dogs!  A very poor quality dog food.

review/summary: It's dog food.
review/text: I'm not exactly sure how to review this product... i mean... it's DOG FOOD. It's not like I ate any of it myself. My dogs ate it. They seemed to like it. But they also eat their own vomit, cat poop, and anything plastic that sits in the yard for longer than 30 minutes. Their tastes aren't very discriminating. According to the bag it's supposed to be a pretty healthy dog food for them. Of course, they eat a lot of grass and wild jack rabbits in addition to the other delectable treats previously mentioned, so I'm not too concerned about the balance of their diet.

review/text: Always looking for a few alternatives for dry food. I don't like feeding the same brand constantly and this has become a great alternate with the other quality dry foods we give our big pups. Quality ingredients are important. As long as your dog doesn't need to be on a special diet, you can alternate quality foods for them. They like this one. Would definitely recommend it.

review/summary: My Two Dogs Love It
review/text: I have been purchasing my dog's food at Costco. I have been mixing the chicken and lamb Kirkland brand with the more expensive Organic Kirkland mix. My two dog's (Akita and Black Lab) have been eating their food for a couple of years now and seemed to be enjoying it enough. However when I added the Beneful to the mix of the other two foods they absolutely loved it. They ate it in record time. Wow what enthusiasm. I have since run out of this 15.5 lb bag and purchased some more from Costco. Now they hardly eat the Kirkland brand. I had to go and purchase a 50 lb bag of Beneful and mix it in again to get them to eat their food.<br /><br />I don't know how it tastes but I can say that my dogs both love it. I have been adding diatomaceous earth powder to their bowls mixed with one raw egg lately and they are really liking it. They seem to have more energy too. I am trying to rid them of any internal parasites. I am also rubbing it into their coats to control fleas and ticks.

review/summary: One of my pickier dogs won't eat it
review/text: I have two dogs.  I like their food to have good wholesome ingredients, but heck, I'll settle for food they both will eat.  My wowser is terribly picky from treats to food he picks and chooses and even if really hungry, will go hungry rather then eat.  Well, Jack wouldn't eat the Beneful unless I ground up nature choice duck meat over the top of it.  So for me, it was one more step I had to take to get him to eat.  My other dog ate without hesitation or reservation.  The food seemed midland for healthful ingredients.

review/summary: Good choice for my dogs...
review/text: I like this dog food for my 2 chihuahuas.  There are many foods out there that make my dogs "go" way too often.  And many that make their stool was too runny.  There's also many foods out there that my dogs turn their noses up to or ones that are very enticing to them that make them overeat.  My dogs free feed so that can be a big problem.<br /><br />My dogs have no digestive/stool problems with this food.  They don't turn their noses up to it and they don't overeat.  The variety in the bag is a nice assortment.  This food seems to be a very good option for my dogs and I'd recommend it.

He favors chicken, and normally has a bit of a digestive problem and lots of gas.  Have not noticed any problem with this food, and that's a definite plus.  Not to mention the fact that it is nutritious, healthy and less expensive than the other one he eats.  Another plus, I can mix the two together or alternate them without that dreaded gas!  So happy to have an alternative food for my favorite little boy!

review/text: Purina Beneful Original Dog Food was a success with two of our dogs, but the third (who won't eat dry food)wasn't interested. She also doesn't eat vegetables (the other two do), so she wasn't tempted at all.<br /><br />I don't know what the health benefits of feeding whole grains to dogs are (since some experts are promoting grain-free dog diets), but I base my opinion on the reaction of the dogs. They ate it, they didn't get sick, and they weren't hungry an hour later. If all three would have liked it, I would have given it five stars.

review/summary: The dog seems to enjoy it
review/text: My dog is a bit of a jerk. She won't eat a lot of foods, and we've narrowed it down to basically Purnia products. But as she ages, we had to switch to a bit of a healthier choice for food. All of them she turned her head down at. Except for Beneful. I obviously cannot speak to how it takes, but the texture and variety of shapes looks as appealing as dog food can. My dog seems to enjoy it, whereas before she required gravy or some wet food to get her meal down, she can eat this without it. She seems to go to do her business more regularly, and her movements are more solid and seem healthier.

review/summary: Food dogs seem to love, maybe not the healthiest, but keeps them happy!
review/text: I'm not sure kibble foods are the best, and they do vary in ingredients. I'd call this "junk food" food dogs, as they seem to love it, even though some of the ingredients are arguably not the best for dogs. There are added vitamins & healthy stuff in there too.<br /><br />I know a number of dogs that eat this exclusively & some have problems with it, others are just fine on this food & not on the "healthier" dog foods. I think, as with human foods, you have to find what works for your dog.<br /><br />Some of the so-called "healthier foods" dogs may not like, thus eating less or not at all,or get sick from ultra-high protein diets.<br /><br />I think you have to find what works best for your dog. I wouldn't use this as an every day food for a dog, but once in a while I think it's OK to give a dog that corn, which is number 1 ingredient, as some argue that they don't digest it, but if your dog likes it & does well on it, then they may need some indigestible fiber, in which case, this makes sense - especially if it helps a dog that is otherwise constipated.<br /><br />I think you have to work with your dog & make that decision for yourself, your vet & your dog.<br /><br />If you dog is getting ear infections, candida infections, hot spots, etc. you need to obviously change their diet & this is likely not a good food for that dog, as the fillers are clearly not something they are tolerating, nor do they need.<br /><br />I'm all for a mid-range food, as some of the very expensive foods may be too high in protein without the enzymes to break it down. I'd suggest reading the labels, look up the needs for your breed of dog & any special needs they may have, your dog's activity level, any special needs, such as a hunting dog, a high performance agility dog, or is your dog a lap or yard dog that isn't every active, just a daily walk.<br /><br />Is your dog a high energy dog? They might really like this & benefit from it occasionally.<br /><br />It's difficult to say weather any dog food is "good" or "bad" when there are SO many breeds, cross-breeds & great animals of unknown breeds that you may guess right or may not. As long as your dog is & stays healthy & active & is eating "right" (depending on their constitution), then you're probably OK.<br /><br />I'd consult a vet or animal nutritionist to find what is best for you dog. If your dog has certain health problems, or is a breed susceptible to certain problems, I think you have to adjust their diet accordingly in order to keep them healthy.<br /><br />Dogs & humans have very different needs, so again, read up, contact your vet & find out what is best for your dog!

review/summary: OK I guess, but seems costly.
review/text: I'm a bit skeptical of the claims made by some, that major pet food manufacturers are routinely selling food that is harmful to our pets and contrary to their nutritional needs, and national consumer groups are not doing anything to pressure the companies to reform. I guess Bush blew up the World Trade Center on purpose, too, to get people to buy more guard dogs and buy more dog food. While dogs certainly do like meat best, I have personally seen well-fed dogs pick raw corn off the stalk, and blueberries off the bush, and eat those things. I suspect dogs are omnivores, like bears. And if this food contains chicken feet or chicken brains, well, I've seen my dogs eat deer poop and months-old dead fish too. Just because my dog eats it doesn't mean I need to.<br /><br />Anyway, my dog ate this food but was not crazy about it. It is accepted if mixed with a small amount of canned food or table scraps. I could say the same thing about the "Meaty Meal" food I usually buy for 1/3rd the price of this stuff. I have just as much idea of the nutritional value of Meaty Meal as I do this stuff, so no, I'm not planning to buy any more of this stuff.

review/text: I don't suppose peas, carrots, wheat and corn are part of a dog's natural diet, but this is dried dog food and I guess we can't complain about fillers otherwise we'd be feeding them meat from the butchers or canned dog food. Having said that, my dog chows (pun intended) this down just like any other and has no complaints. The bag has a zip lock to it, which is good, otherwise I have to fold the edges and use a large clip to close it and this is more airtight. I try to vary my dog's diet so he doesn't keep eating the same thing so this can just one of the variations. Overall, I have no complaints.

My two oldest dogs LOVE this and my two youngest dogs seemed to not really care either way. My two oldest dogs also seemed more energized and happier. Will have to probably keep this on hand for those two. Overall not a bad change and glad to find something my two eldest babies enjoy, that makes it worth it in the end.

review/text: My favorite feature about this dog food is the packaging! There's a "ziploc" zipper at the top, which is just awesome. The dog food we typically buy does not have this feature, so we have to use storage containers with lids to keep the food fresh(and the rats away). The zipper makes things much easier, to me.<br /><br />My dogs aren't picky eaters! There's only been one brand that they didn't eat, and this isn't it. My indoor dog still prefers his long-time favorite, though. Despite the fact that they eat it fine, I don't like that the main ingredient is corn. Looking at the front of the bag, though, I guess that's to be expected. The ear of corn seems to be the most noticeable ingredient.<br /><br />Overall, the packaging is great, but the food is just okay.

review/summary: Good Filler Food
review/text: The dogs benefiting from my sack of Beneful live on a small rural place with various forms of other livestock and enjoy a wide variety of the taboo-in-some-circles dog food known as table scraps. Because of this, a more filler variety of dog food such as Beneful works out well as a way to throw in a little extra nutrition without breaking the bank.<br /><br />The picture advertisement of the product has a large picture of an ear of corn alongside other veggies and protein sources, and that is an apt illustration since corn filler is the main ingredient in this food. If you are not getting your puppies plenty of protein from other sources, this mix is not for you but it should work out for the rest of the dog-loving public.<br /><br />None of the animals had an aversion to eating this product, so I will presume it tasted okay and got a "paws up" in addition to four stars.

review/summary: Decent Budget Option for Dog Food
review/text: I know that the trend is to feed dogs increasingly sophisticated and expensive foods, including home cooked options and raw, but for some of us the budget is still not there to "go organic" for ourselves, let alone for the household mutt. For us, Purina Beneful is a decent option. It's not optimal nutrition or high tech, but your dog will probably eat it and be just fine. Our dog is small (about 9 lbs) and has no trouble with the size of the kibble in this variety. And a bag this size lasts quite a while. Ideally we could all eat like kings, even dogs, but until then, this is a reasonable, practical solution to "what to feed the dog?"

review/summary: beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols
review/text: I have 4 dogs and am grateful to Purina Beneful for the chance to have them review this food. They go through bags and bags of food and usually I have to buy the real cheap stuff. My dogs loved this stuff, though I still had to mix it with half a can of wet dog food to get them to eat it. They are kind of picky eaters, but then again, they would eat just about anything if it was soaked in enough lard. The main reason I don't buy this stuff is because I can't afford it, but if I could afford it, I would get it for them.<br /><br />Reading the ingredients, I see that it contains real beef and highly digestible egg, but it also includes crunchy corn, tomatoes, spinich, and oatmeal. There are omega fatty acids, along with antioxidants like Vitamin E and selenium. I have been trying to find out just exactly what antioxidants are, and why we need them. My dogs could care less, but I am sure they appreciate things like linoleic acid if it results in a shiny coat. How about that beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols? What is that all about?<br /><br />Anyway, thanks Purina Beneful, for providing my 4 K-9s with an excellent bag of dog food that provided them endless hours of dining pleasure.

review/summary: Good dog food, but you certainly pay for it!
review/text: Our dog has a sensitive stomach. So, we are relatively picky about the food we give him. We have had more than one day of scrubbing out vomit from the carpet all over the house. So, we decided to try this new style of dog food, and see how our dog Jake would respond to it. Truth is, he loves it...and it agrees with him. It is a great dog food!<br /><br />Furthermore, this dog food has a zipper on the top of the bag. This helps keep the food fresh, and makes it much easier to handle.<br /><br />The problem we have with this food is simply the price, which is over 2x what we pay for the other dog food that agrees with our puppies sensitive tummy.<br /><br />So, if you can afford this, get it. If not, find something more comparable in your price range.

review/summary: My dog likes it!!
review/text: The PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food was delivered and my Dog saw the big bag of food he was so excited. Our dog Champ has a hearty appetite so we just knew he would love this, but it took him awhile to actually like it because he would only eat a little and then walk away but eventually he would return to finish eating. The next time I fed it to him I opened up a can of his other dog food and spruced it up just a little for him. My experiment of mixing in one of his favorite canned food and I put most of the canned food in the middle and on the bottom of his bowl and this got him a little bit more excited about Purina Beneful. I think that Beneful will take maybe a few tries before your dog will start to really enjoy it but I think that the ingredients are healthy enough for Champ and I want him to receive all of the benefits that Purina Beneful has to offer.<br /><br />He does appear to be a little more lively than usual and I want to attribute that to the change in his diet, but I'm not entirely sure. I love that my dog is happy and has an extra spring in his step, so I'll keep feeding him this until he isn't interested anymore or if there is a negative change in behavior. I like this food for my dog,but it needs a little more oomph to get dogs immediately excited.

review/summary: Average, affordable dog food
review/text: I have two dogs - a large lab mix and a small dachshund mix. I am currently feeding them Flint River dog food, which is very high quality and expensive. (I have no affiliation to Flint River products and there are a few other, equally good dog foods available commercially. Flint River is just the one I can easily get from Amazon.) My lab will eat anything, but my dachshund is very picky about food, preferring human food to dog food. He is not especially thrilled about the Flint River, although he eventually eats it.<br /><br />Purina Beneful Original has small, colorful chunks - some of which are moist and chewy. I was surprised to see that my dachshund actually likes the Beneful, eating it fairly enthusiastically. My lab gobbled it right down, although she gobbles everything right down. I am going to keep some Beneful on hand and add a few chunks to my dachshund's Flint River dog food every night to encourage him to eat promptly, rather than wander around for a while looking for something tastier.<br /><br />Beneful is NOT a premium grade dog food, so I will be keeping my dogs on Flint River (at about four times the price). The ingredients tell the story, which I have listed below. However, Beneful is affordable and my dogs definitely seemed to like it. I would say this is average, adequate nutrition for a dog, but could be a problem for dogs with health issues like diabetes, etc.<br /><br />Nutritional information:<br />Crude Protein (Min) 25.0%, Crude Fat (Min) 10.0%, Crude Fiber (Max) 4.0%, Moisture (Max) 14.0%, Linoleic Acid (Min) 1.5%, Calcium (Min) 1.1%, Iron (Min) 175 mg/kg, Selinium (Min) 0.2 mg/kg, Vitamin A (Min) 10,000 IU/kg, Vitamin E (Min) 100 IU/kg<br /><br />Ingredients: Ground yellow corn, Chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, water, meat and bone meal, propylene glycol, sugar, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, animal digest, potassium chloride, sorbic acid (a preservative), dried peas, dried carrots, calcium propionate (a preservative), choline chloride, L-lysine, monohydrochloride, Vitamin E supplement, zinc sulfate, red 40, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, yellow 6, yellow 5, Vitamin A supplement, blue 2, calcium carbonate, copper sulfate, Vitamin B-12 supplement, brewer's dried yeast, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, menadione, sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.

review/summary: My Dog Loves This Stuff
review/text: My pit bull has an easily upset stomach, and it took a lot of trial and error to find dry foods he could eat without vomiting them back up. What I settled on was Purina Beneful dry dog food. He can eat it without any stomach upset, and seems to like the flavor. With Purina Beneful dog food, he has been able to maintain what the vetrenarian calls a perfect weight, while having plenty of energy for his daily activities. So with the veteranarian giving my dog excellent marks for overall health and weight, I feel Purina Beneful seems to be just the right thing for him, without the need to turn to those overpriced boutique dog foods.

review/summary: pretty ok dog food
review/text: Seems there are four types of dog food.  The first is the bargain brand wal-mart variety.  Benefit-lots of food for less money.  The second type is the garden variety mass produced dog foods.  Brands such as Purina fill this market.  The third is the pseudo-gourmet market again dominated by the major brands with weird names to try to make folks think they are part of group 4 which is gourmet/specialty dog food, those that specialize in high protein, low grain and filler foods.<br /><br />Beneful is IMHO as good as it gets in general market dog food. My dog likes it, though he will sometimes let it sit for extended periods if he can find anything else.  As an overweight do, he seems to gain weight on Beneful which is probably an indicator that it has more filler than would be best for him.<br /><br />Given all that, I recommend Beneful if you're looking for a quality mass market dog food.

review/summary: My Dog Loves This!
review/text: Purina has to be one of the better brands of dog food out there other than a few of the low fat high priced high protein ones.  I usually use Purina One but got a bag of this to try out and am mixing the two together with great results.  Max loves the flavor and believe me she's picky.  The little crunchy veggies are the first things she eats and then on to the other food.<br /><br />It does have a crude fat ratio that I would like to lower but since Max likes this and the Vet says it's okay considering she only gets 1/3 of a cup twice a day I'm not going to worry.  She's actually lost a few ounces since I started giving this to her which is all the better since she has bad back legs.<br /><br />I totally trust Purina and have for many, many years for their quality products and attention to the proper nutrition for animals.  Nicely packaged so to keep it's freshness is a plus.<br /><br />I don't give my dog any wet food at all cause it upsets her tummy.  This is no  problem.  It's crunchy without being to brittle like some and I really can't complaign.  Will be using this for a long time to come for sure.

review/summary: My two mutts approve...
review/text: My two mutts prefer Beneful over the big box store bulk food bag that I usually buy to save some money.  I am pleased that the pickier dog of the pair gobbles his bowl right up.  To be perfectly honest I have been most concerned with dog food price after rescuing these dogs.  I have had to contend with the initial costs of fencing and vet bills as one dog had a broken foot.  Since these are my first dogs I have had a bit of a learning curve and now I am trying to research dog food brands.  This brand does not have as much protein as others on the market but it does have corn.  I did not realize when I first started purchasing dog food how much "filler" is used and corn seems to fall into this category.  So, even though I love the convenience of being able to have it delivered to my door and my dogs like it I would like to find a more nutritious option.

review/text: Out of three dogs, all three dogs do eat this brand of dog food.  That is definitely a plus.  However, as otherwise  noted, Beneful could be a bit more on the nutritious side (I'd much rather prefer less ingredients and meat as the prime ingredients, but that's me, as a human, talking).  The main thing is that the dogs (who can be picky) are willing to eat the food and they appear to be thriving on it.

A rescue, my parents introduced her to wet food and she hasn't been the same since.  In order to keep her stools of a certain consistency and her weight down, I like to also feed her dry food.  This is the only one she'll eat...seems to keep her bowels regular, and certainly she's healthy, and I continue to be impressed by the ingredients.  I will continue to purchase.<br /><br />-DYB

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: My dog had been eating Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish dog food. It's all the same sized, crunchy bits of food and he liked it very much. He really chows down on this Beneful dog food though. It had different sized and different shaped pieces, some soft and some crunchy. However, I don't think he noticed the various textures at all. He's a big dog and eats a couple scoops a day. We didn't do a subtle switch by mixing more and more of the new food in with his old, we just started feeding him the new food in his usual portion. He did not have any dietary problems with the straight switch. Everything was normal.<br /><br />What I really like about this dog food is the packaging. With other dog foods, we have to tear apart the bag and poor the food into another container with a lid. Beneful has a Ziploc-type closure. I don't have to transfer the food and I can squeeze the extra air out of the bag as it empties so that the food will stay fresher. Beneful is a win-win; my dog and I both like it.

review/text: My two pups were both very excited when the UPS man brought a box full of Beneful to our door, dancing and prancing around like I was going to just spill open the bag and let them dive in that very second. Sadly for them, they'd already had dinner and had to wait until the next morning to taste the goods. But when those colorful nuggets of kibble spilled into their respective dog dishes, they were in doggie heaven, snarfing down the food like they hadn't been fed in ages. My little foodies loved the original flavor of Beneful. One minor issue--it makes my bigger guy a bit gassier than usual. Oh, well.

The 15.5 pound bag comes with a handy zip lock so no more mess, and it's easy to store as well. The pieces are big and meaty and impossible for any dog to resist! Purina Beneful is 100% complete and balanced nutrition with wholesome grains and real beef, accented with vitamin-rich vegetables, and besides their original flavor it also comes in a variety of other formula's specifically for your special pup.

I DON'T LIKE TO WASTE MONEY ON DOG FOOD THAT THEY WILL NOT EAT.  so since this was free, why not try it  my dogs are also picky in what they choose to eat.  they themself's have elected NOT to eat sweets, even though i have offered it to them.  they don't eat crap like chips and popcorn.  so when i offered beneful to them they sniffed it, then took only "1" kibble.  they rolled it around in their mouth and then finally chewed it.  yes my dogs do this with new food introduced to them.  they then preceeded to SCARF this dog food up and even wanted more.  even though my dogs eat their vegetables,( they prefer baked califlower) i will now on add a cup of beneful to their dry food.  reading the label, this food is a good additive to a high protein diet for your dog.  hey 2 champion hunter/tracker/service dogs can't be wrong---WOOF

review/text: Nothing makes a human feel as wonderful as a dog eating his or her food with vigor and enjoying every morsel of it.  When you have two dogs such as we it is PleasantVille.  Beneful is one of their favorites and it shows.  The male Yorky goes after the big, red ones as if each was his and his only while the female Yorky settles for the smaller and easier to eat pieces.  When mealtime is over so is the Beneful.  They are proud members of the clean plate society and eagerly enjoy their menue.  These old dogs are just as peculiar as many old critters we know.  Present company included.  So for them to honestly enjoy their meals is something of an anomaly and we appreciate the Purina company for helping with us with a few moments of peace and quiet.

It seems to be a run of the mill offering, similar to all of the mass produced brands.  This Nestle/Purina offering doesn't seems to be any better or worse than similar products from the other huge dog food producers.

I would pour a bowl out for her then when I came back it would be gone except for a circle of green bits around the bowl.<br /><br />However, my current dogs have no objection to the green bits and seem to thrive on having this added to their diet.  (If you are going to change from one dogfood to another it's better on their stomach to ease them in by adding a small amount to their regular dog food.)

review/summary: Dog Loves It
review/text: What does dog food need to do to be good?  The dog needs to like it and it needs to keep the dog healthy.  I'm very pleased with this dog food on those premises.  My dog (who likes table scraps way more than she likes dry dog food...we usually use Purina Dog Chow)...she loves this food.  It is hard to get her to eat more than one bowl a day...she ate two bowls of this immediately when she first tried it and when I add an egg to this dry food she eats the egg...and continues on to eat the dry food too so I don't have to mix the egg in.<br /><br />I'm not too impressed with either the ingredients or the price (more for a 15.5lb bag than for 44lbs of PURINA Dog Chow...with no real improvement in ingredients).  Regarding another review of Beneful discussing the ingredients (yes it is probably healthier to feed raw meat etc) I do need to state that in spite of all the grains and meals in PURINA's dry foods, my dogs have all been very healthy eating this brand...several large breeds over many years, including a wolf dog whose digestive system was very sensitive to grains and leftovers.  He did fine on Purina as did his parents who were mid-content wolf.  The breeder actually recommended PURINA for her low and mid-content wolf dogs after researching the company and their meat sources.  I think it says a lot that so many dogs of different breeds (German Shepherds, Pyrenees, Malamutes, Huskies, Wolf mix, Retriever, Lab) activity level and ages have stayed very healthy on this brand of dry food for many years.  It is very consistent and if based strictly on results (and ignore the ingredients) I have been very pleased.<br /><br />The 15.5 lb bag lasted about 2 weeks for my 80 lb Great Pyrenees eating her fill.  She loves it, so eats enough of it to keep weight on, which is quite an accomplishment with this particular dog.  Her coat looks good, her eyes look good, and she has a lot of energy.  I may just switch to Beneful for this dog if I can find it a little cheaper.

Since it has vegetables in it then it should be healthier than some of the other regular dog food on the market.

review/text: I've fed our dogs and cats Purina products (Dog Chow, Puppy Chow, Cat Chow, and Kitten Chow) for years--and believe me, that is a lot of dogs and cats!  And they've thrived on it; however, our dogs love Beneful.  They dance around and poke me whenever they want to be fed.  Okay, they're dogs, and they'd probably do that anyway, but they don't dawdle as much as they did sometimes.<br /><br />The picture on the bag is certainly colorful, and I like the way it looks in the bowl, even though I know it's designed to entice humans 'cause they're the buyers--and I do not like dyes in human or animals' food.  Lots of other additives, of course, including dried carrots and peas and bone meal.  (I remember mixing bone meal with kibble and meat scraps before balanced dog foods hit the market; I'm still grateful for that, btw.)  But I was happy to see an additive I recognized.  I know the expensive dog foods brag about not using grains/corn, but I also know that dogs are omnivores--not carnivores like cats.<br /><br />And I appreciate the zipper bag; the food is fresher and not as likely to spill or attract bugs.  I appreciate Beneful--and so do our dogs.  Note: The dogs' stools are firm and the same color as usual--brown.  Btw, I've seen a lot of stools in my day and always keep an eye on them; and I also try to avoid making a complete change when feeding a new food.

review/summary: A long time staple in our house
review/text: We have been through just about every brand of dog food offered by our local market and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a> is a brand we keep coming back to.  It is nutritionally balanced and made from natural, quality ingredients.  In addition, our dog seems to like it better than most, and it is packaged in bags which keep spoilage down in our humid environment.  This line is heavier on the grains than some in the Purina line, listing corn as the first ingredient, so I rotate and give him some which is higher in protein (like their Chef Michael's line) too.  This provides everything he needs, is reasonably priced (about par with other quality brands) and we know we can trust Purina when it comes to pet food. It is a staple in our house, and our dog is healthy and fit (the proper weight). Until now my only issue has been getting the bags home. (We have a big dog and go through a lot of dog food, and consequently buy the larger bags) which entailed my dragging my teen to the market to help carry them.  I Love that Amazon is delivering it now and I can eliminate that ordeal ;) (and, I suspect my son will like it even more).<br />  I can say that Beneful is recommended by my dog, which means more than my recommendation.  He likes the taste.  I like the price, quality, and now, the convenience.  Thanks to Amazon for eliminating a (small) ordeal from my week :)

review/summary: Probably the best of the grocery store dog food
review/text: I think if you are buying random dog food at the grocery store the Purina Beneful is probably one of the best available. If you're truly looking to buy the BEST dog food, then you're not shopping at the grocery store in the first place. For the average dog the Beneful offers the basic nutritional requirements of course and it goes a little farther than the generics out there. The three dogs in our house that tried it (mixed with their normal far more expensive organic food) ate with no hesitation. They seemed to like the flavor and only one of them had any digestive upset and that was very mild.<br /><br /> I could not give the Beneful to the other three dogs though and this is the reason for the one star deduction....it contains corn. If you have a dog with skin allergies then you know you have to avoid corn, wheat and soy in their food and treats. Bottom line... if you're feeding a regular dog and your dogs has NO allergy issues, then Beneful is a decent choice. Just beware.. contains corn and that could be a big problem.

The neighbors pooch is a Golden, and my Mom had a Lhasa Apso...I've had the chance to try this food out on both the mutts and the results have been very much appreciated.  They both scoffed it up enthusiastically, and both the dogs owners had heard of, and in the past have used Beneful before.  The other reviews here seem to be about equally divided as to it either not being as nutritionally balanced as promised, or, have some serious questions or comments about some of the other things in it.  I'm afraid I can't be much help as to much of that.  But what I will say it seems to have a whole lot more going for it than a lot of the store brands that are popular with folks nowadays. In fact its loaded compared to some of those. The dog people I know all seem to like Beneful.  It's more of a question of its cost more than its nutritional concerns it appears.  My recommendation comes from the dogs point of view of it being very tasty and appreciated.  And my suggestion as to its nutrition and by products is to compare this with the big box store brands that many are used to, read the other reviews here, and then decide if the extra cost is worth it.  It's a crowd pleaser in my house for sure..: )

I think it is a good option to have free delivery from Amazon and not to have to lug big bags of dog food from supermarket to car to home, especially with a bad back.<br /><br />As far as nutrition goes I had hoped for more from Purina. It seems to contain a lot of corn filler. Read the ingredients in the product description to see if it is what you desire, or you think your breed would like. Otherwise, ordering from Amazon seems like a good thing.

review/summary: Dog Likes It...
review/text: The only thing I can honestly say that I like about the dog food is the convenient, reseal able bag.  We had a stray appear in our neighborhood and although I'm not an avid animal lover, I also don't like to see animals suffer so we began feeding him.  When offered this to try and review I had hoped it would be a chance to try a nutritious, wholesome food without wasting money on something he wouldn't eat.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  This food contains a lot of corn and corn is just not that good for dogs.<br />As far as taste, our adopted dog loves it.  When placed side by side with his current food he immediately went to and wolfed this down.  But dogs are like children in that when offered candy, ice cream, cookies or healthy nutritious food you know which one the child will almost always pick.  That is why it's up to the owners/dog lovers to look closely at ingredients and fillers and pick the food that is good for our animals to eat.<br />In looking at the package you would think that all the pictures of vegetables and meats would represent what is actually being served.  In this case looks are deceiving.  Is it better than some? Yes.  Are there better foods available? YES!

review/summary: Resealable top and moist kibble, but too much corn
review/text: I'm pleased on behalf of my dog with this Beneful dog kibble product.<br /><br />The bag arrived in a large cardboard box so that the bag would stay intact in transit. The cardboard and packing materials are recyclable.<br /><br />The 15.5 pound bag is made of small woven plastic strips, which makes the bag reusable (as a second trash bag when emptied of dog food) and recyclable where all plastics are accepted.<br /><br />I was surprised and happy to see the new enclosure for Beneful - it has a very solid plastic 'zip' top. I'm actually thrilled about this, and wonder why all dry cat and dog food don't come with a reclosable, sealable top. I've noticed over the years that my pets prefer their kibble when fresh, so this will help the taste and texture stay palatable for far longer than the usual fold down method.<br /><br />The second very nice thing I noticed was that the kibble was moist. I think of pet kibble as hard, crunchy food, and moist kibble as gourmet specialty items that come in tiny, expensive packets. Here, there is a whole lot of nice, fresh meaty-type kibble at an economy price. The food is soft and smells good.<br /><br />Where Beneful loses a point is in the ingredients. The first item listed is ground yellow corn meal. The next ingredient is chicken by-product meal, and then there is more corn (corn gluten meal). Sugar is also highly placed in the ingredients list, but thankfully, that follows after healthy items like beef, wheat meal, animal fats, and rice and soy flours.<br /><br />A lot of dogs' digestive systems don't process corn very easily; the best dog foods place meat or wheat first in the menu, and eliminate the 'filler' corn meal entirely. Since Beneful is positioning themselves as a 'healthy choice' kibble, it's important to be aware of pet issues with corn.<br /><br />I don't see why dog food needs bright dyes either. The only possible reason is to make it 'prettier' for people to look at. I would ask Purina to reconsider that aspect, as well as removing the corn.<br /><br />In spite of the corn meal and unnecessary food dyes, my dog LOVED this new chewy kibble. She actually made happy little grunty noises while eating it, noises I'd never heard from her before.<br /><br />Dog approved, and person-approved, with the understanding that this is a mid-line pet food. :)

review/text: My dogs ate very picky, so that makes me hesitant to try other dog foods. They usually like Kibbles and Bits the off brand with white pieces. Those are gobbled down quick.<br /><br />So, I was surprised that they so easily ate this brand of dog food. The bag it comes in is very sturdy. There is no way it will accidentally rip and spill on you. The dog food is also very healthy for dogs when compared to other dog foods available.

review/summary: Lily, the furry garbage disposal likes it, but...
review/text: I have to say she hasn't met with too many brands of food she hasn't liked. While my cats do not hesitate to turn up little noses at any food not meeting their taste standards, my Great Pyrenees mix isn't the fussy type so because it works for her doesn't mean that it will suit a picky eater.<br /><br />Though this appears to be a reasonably priced product (and with the current economic situation the price of what both I and my critters eat is a major consideration) the value of what is actually in the product does concern me. The chief ingredient is corn, not the most natural source of protein for canines and not always easy on their digestion either. The food is very colorful but this is to appeal to the human purchasers of the food. Dogs are red/green colorblind, so the addition of the bright dyes is really unnecessary for their benefit.<br /><br />Perhaps the best feature of the product is the resealable bag. As for the food itself, Lily thoroughly approves but I'm not sure I'd purchase this for her as a dietary staple.

review/summary: Good food, nice smell, dogs like it
review/text: Our two dogs like this food for its variety. My little dog pulls out the chewy meaty bits first and our big dog wolf down the crunchy chunks. Both eventually eat all of them, but they have their favorite pieces- just like my kids. This food smells good (not fake and smelly) and has a nice color to it. I would recommend this a as a nice upgrade from basic dog food and as a healthier alternative to the basic dog chow. Neither one of our dogs had digestive problems in switching to this food.

It held it's shape and the texture and mouth feel are much closer to traditional pastas than the rice varieties we've tried. There is no strong "corny" flavor. I am glad to be able to order by the case because it costs about half what we paid in a health food store.

review/text: I thought this was the same stuff I had purchased before, but actually, I had been buying Mrs Leeper's Corn Pasta. The De Boles stuff is okay, but not great. My wife and I find that Mrs Leepers is easier to cook, has a nicer texture (less likely to come out pasty) and a stronger corn taste (which I like, but others may not). In the future, we'll go back to ordering Mrs Leeper's, but I would say it's a matter of taste, not an inferior product per se (it's not like we'll be throwing this away, we just won't reorder).

review/summary: Lose Weight with Corn Pasta
review/text: We do not have the enzyme to digest corn.  Using corn pasta, instead of any other pasta, helps me lose weight.  At first the taste seems a little weird, after having eaten regular flour pasta for your whole life, but add some spagetti sauce, or cheese, etc. and it does taste just like regular pasta.  Just make sure you rinse it well after cooking, as you should any pasta, but rinsing this helps make it taste more like regular pasta.  Also try corn tortillas, and corn pita, and other corn pasta's like elbow macaroni, fetticini etc. I have lost over 40 pounds, and it is great for diabetics who have to watch their carb intake.  This doesn't make you blood sugar jump up.  I would have given it 5 stars, but like I said the taste takes some time getting use to, but it is not bad. Also, when cooking it leaves a little frothy paste like film on the outside that must be washed offed. Otherwise I give it a 5. Try using corn torilla's instead of bread and you will loose more weight, and keep you blood sugar more even.  Plus being gluten free has it's many advantages too.

This stuff is nasty. Much better pasta is available from Mrs. Leepers and Tinkyada. Mrs. Leepers is more like what you'd expect for taste and texture from a wheat pasta, but it's so thin, it can fall apart easily, too. Tinkyada holds up well, cooks up al dente every time, and doesn't have any funny taste. Tinkyada is the favorite for our family and friends who don't have to avoid gluten.

review/text: I've been using Xylitol, specifically Emerald Forest's product, for a few years now.  It looks and tastes like sugar and can be used for baking too.  There have been a few occasions when it didn't quite substitute right, but those are few and far between.  Coffee, tea, hot chocolate, macaroons, chocolate chip cookies, brownies...all turn out great.  I'm on a no sugar diet (along with no grains) to combat a possible candida problem.  Xylitol has been my savior.  I still get my little sweet kick now and then without any of the damaging health effects of sugar.  And, xylitol is also anti-fungal, so it even helps with things like candida.  High recommended!  And this price is a total steal too!  One 32 ounce can costs nearly $30 at my local health food store.  This price can't be beat!

review/summary: Poor customer service
review/text: I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. Kinda like mothballs. They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before. (Note: I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question. I did not ask to return anything else in the order.)<br /><br />I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.<br /><br />I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective. I have learned that some products are made in the US, but when I called I only inquired about the erythritol, which they themselves confirmed was made in China.<br /><br />NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Amazon.com.<br />Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />-I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item: erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc. It included this item and a lot of other things.<br />-I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened.<br />-I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted.  This was as a result of a legitimate concern.<br />-I did not know at the time that only some products came from China -- the customer service rep did not make that distinction when I asked. I was therefore worried about all of them.<br />-My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general.<br /><br />Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site. She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing. How was I to know the substance would smell so badly? She said I should have just ordered one. What difference does it make since I had only opened one? The others were perfectly sealed. She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me. (Like I would anyway after that).<br /><br />This company should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it.

review/summary: xylitol tastes great
review/text: I bought enough of these so I got free shipping, which made the price even more excellent compared to the grocery store where the same brand was selling  in one pound sacks for $6-7 / lb.  So this is  a great deal.  It looks and tastes just like sugar (I am not exaggerating!) though it is not actually sugar but a sugar alcohol.  It is perhaps slightly sweeter, tends to lump up a little more, but the lumps break up easily with stirring.  Though it is not lower calorie, it is low glycemic index which means that it is converted to sugars more slowly and therefore does not cause insulin levels to spike (a factor in fatty weight gain), and actually protects against tooth decay!  Your recipies convert spoon per spoon of sugar or cup per cup so it's easy to use.  It cooks up like sugar too.<br /><br />We really love this product.  Buy enough to get free shipping and really save!

After a couple years of prompting by my doctor I decided to try Xylitol and I must say that I am impressed.<br /><br />On the plus side this is not a sugar substitute, it is just a different type of sugar so you don't have to worry about chemicals, etc.  There are other brands of Xylitol that are sold on Amazon that contain other things like Sucralose (aka Splenda), which I would avoid because I believe the jury is still out on how safe it is (Sucralose is made by exchanging three Chlorine atoms for OH groups on sucrose molecules).<br /><br />The only way I have used this Xylitol is in my coffee, and I give it two big thumbs up!  And being a supertaster, I require A LOT of sugar (and milk) in my coffee to make it palatable, and even with a lot of Xylitol, my coffee still tastes great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, I just wish it wasn't so expensive!

review/summary: A good xylitol sweetner.
review/text: I purchased the package of two from Amazon, and found that the two containers were shrink-wrapped together in a way that made it unlikely that they would pick-up any odors or tastes from the warehouse or while in transit.<br /><br />I had purchased a different brand from a local health food store, and found that the taste of the two products is the same.  Very good taste, with no sort of aftertaste or significant difference from table sugar.<br /><br />The Emerald Forest Xylitol has large crystals compared to the other brand I'd purchased, which was pretty-much a powder.  It dissolves well in liquids, so it's better as larger crystals.  Xylitol dust is bad for your lungs when inhaled.<br /><br />Texture of what you bake with xylitol may differ from sugar, though you probably wouldn't notice any difference in drinks.  It cannot be used in baking products that use yeast to raise the dough.<br /><br />Xylitol is toxic to dogs, and it's probably best not to give it to any animal; though I did read there were studies as to whether it could be used to improve the health of cats and chickens by adding it to their water.  To learn more about Xylitol scan the web for "Xylitol MSDS" or "Xylitol Safety"

review/summary: Splenda Alternative
review/text: I am on a sugar free diet and this stuff tastes great.  It reminds me of splenda with no bitter aftertaste like other natural sweeteners like stevia.  Splenda taste great but very unhealthy and this stuff is just as good.  I love it.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I bought a small bag of this brand from a local health co-op and really liked it, and it tasted like sugar to me.  So I was excited to get this same brand in bulk at a much lower price online.  What a disappointment to find it did not taste the same as the bag I purchased at the store.  The Emerald Forest product I received online has a strong aftertaste that stays in my mouth long after drinking my tea.  I don't know if this company sells an inferior quality in their bulk packages, but I don't like it.  I am going back to Stevia, which I find more palatable and without aftertaste.

review/summary: Good Product!
review/text: This product delivers what the others promise.  Good taste, very few calories and doesn't spike your blood sugar.  Best of all, it is natural and free from the inherent risks of many of the other sweeteners.  I like to use it in coffee or tea and on fruit.

review/summary: excellent sugar substitute
review/text: Xylitol looks and acts so much more like real sugar than other<br />alternative sweeteners. It doesn't have an aftertaste, it dissolves<br />completely, and it measures like sugar. I also like the fact<br />that a sweetener can be good for your dental health. I chose Emerald<br />Forest because it is made in America (not China) and it is<br />natural. I will definitely continue to buy this product.

review/summary: Sugar substitute
review/text: I love this product and the Emerald Forest brand.  I bought from other manufacturers, but I didn't quite care for the taste or texture. I've always bought the individual packets, but the composite container is so much better for home use.  I cut sugar out of my diet more than 8 months ago, and this product tastes and looks just like sugar, so I don't feel like I'm depriving myself of sweetners and my health is all the better for it! Yay!  Of all the other sugar alcohols out there, this one is by far the best!

review/summary: great substitue
review/text: I bought this because I have a child with canidida issues, and am trying to cut back on sugars for all my children. It worked wonderfully to make hot chocolate, muffins, and homemade vanilla yogurt. We had no digestive problems with it. The only trouble was making sure to keep all the crumbs from our dog.

review/summary: Xylitol is toxic to dogs.
review/text: Just three grams of Xylitol can kill a 65lb dog in just 30 minutes. I gave it just one star because I'm outraged there was no warning on the product.<br /><br />Shame on you Xyla!

review/summary: Finally, a good tasting sugar substitute...
review/text: I've tried every sugar alternative available for decades now and couldn't stand any of them - stayed the longest with Equal but still eventually came back to the real thing - it just tastes better. Well, this Xylitol stuff is as close as you're going to get to real sugar. It looks like real sugar, crunches like real sugar, measures like real sugar and tastes - almost - like real sugar. There is a little bit of "tree" taste hanging around in the back there but not really objectionable (it's made out of birch trees!). I gave a spoon to a friend to taste without telling him what it was and his comment was "Tastes like sugar - but a little different."<br />What there definitely is not - no bitter aftertaste, no chemical taste. Oh, and a friend said that cookies made with it don't turn out as crispy.<br />It's available in 15 pound bags here on Amazon at a better price - but the stuff is still expensive!<br />Also, the gum and mints are all delicious!

review/summary: Good Alternate to Sugar for Coffee
review/text: I want to cut back on sugar and carbs.  I don't like fake sugar which is full of chemicals.  Stevia tastes awful in coffee.  Although the Xylitol is expensive, it works in coffee without leaving a bad after taste.  These 2 lb. packs were the best price I could find.

review/summary: Sweetener with no aftertaste
review/text: This sweetener was purchased for use while on a sugar free diet.  I found it to be as claimed in the descriptions: a direct substitute for white sugar with similar potency.<br />I find that it just tastes sweet without any other flavor of its own.  That said, it does have kind of a "cool" taste on the tongue, but I didn't find that to be a detractor, and neither did the many people that I have let try it.<br />I use it in tea, but not coffee.  Having recently reverted to cane sugar, I realized I preferred the xylitol because it leaves no aftertaste, nor does it add other flavors to the tea.<br />By comparison, I cannot tolerate other sugar substitutes since they taste terrible to me, although I have not tried stevia.

review/summary: IT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO
review/text: I can't really say anything bad about this product. It is a very good sweetener, but be forewarned that it has a different texture/consistency than sugar or other artificial sweeteners, and it might take some getting used to. I find myself still reaching for my old favorite, Splenda, because it looks, feels, and tastes like sugar. For those who have no problem with the difference in texture and appearance, I highly recommend Xylitol for its sweetness and health benefits.

review/summary: Tastes and smells great to us.  No problem at all.
review/text: I have purchased Emerald Forest Xylitol Sweetener from the 2 lb. cans from Amazon for six months and it tastes and smells just fine to me. No "foul smell" whatsoever--in fact, it smells sweet to my proboscis. I have purchased other brands in the past and this product is identical as far as we are concerned.
