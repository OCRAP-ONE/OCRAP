review/summary: My dog Sashie loves this supplement w/ her dry food!
review/text: I have to say its a bit pricey but at the end I actually saved alot because you only need to give a couple of spoonful along with the dry food. My dog loves it! You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.

review/summary: My fussy eater loves this
review/text: My geriatric dog has been an extremely fussy eater ever since I brought her home at 14 weeks.  I recently tried Wellness kibble and wet foods and she likes them all, but she particularly LOVES the 95-Percent canned toppers and WOLFS her kibble down with this product mixed in.  Wish I had tried Wellness foods before but better late than never.

review/summary: Good value and fast shipping
review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

Our family really believes that high quality food is important for a long and healthy life; we try to avoid all fillers and by-products. Our dog loves this formula, which we use one spoon of along with his dry food at each meal.<br /><br />For his size and diet I find that the small cans are more convenient since they last him so long.

review/text: It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner, so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food. What I liked about it was the lack of by-products and cereals. Our dogs love the taste of this food and there is never any left in their bowls. It is a well baqlanced food that good for them also and having it shipped directly to my door saves us a trip to the pet stores. I count on Amazon for the best products.

review/text: This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!

I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.

review/text: Peanut Matcha.  I was a little hesitant.  I don't know what it is about the idea of peanut flavoring in a tea ... it just doesn't sound right to me.  I am all for just about any other type of nut (yeah, I know that peanuts aren't technically nuts), but, peanuts just sounded too weird to me.  Then I tried Peanut Taffy and this changed my whole idea of how good peanut flavor can taste.<br /><br />So, I got the courage and I ordered this Matcha, and I'm pleasantly surprised.  It's really quite good.  Much better than I expected it to be.  It is good prepared traditionally, with water and whisked well, but then after taking my first sip, I decided I wanted to find out what a pinch of salt might add to the flavor.  And so I added a tiny pinch of sea salt and I LOVE this.  It is really yummy!<br /><br />Smooth, rich and creamy.  Nice peanut flavor, balanced well with the fresh, leafy green taste of the Matcha.  Really tasty - much tastier than I expected!

review/summary: The best Kona yet
review/text: There are many claimants to the title of Best Kona Coffee. Like Lancelot searching for a king worthy enough to serve I have tried many Kona brands and found most to be wanting. When Starbucks was worth their reputation good Kona was available from them by phone order only. That was 15 years ago. It's been pretty disappointing but the good news is that Blue Horse Kona Coffee is making up for lost time. With a little imagination you can actually taste the black soil of Hawaii and feel the Trade Winds in this coffee. There is no other way to describe the smooth, delicious flavor and aroma that seems simple but has the complexity of a good wine wih several flavors one experiences during the beginning, middle and the wonderful finish.

review/summary: Simply the best flavor possible
review/text: A few friends of mine from work ordered a couple of pounds of Blue Horse Kona Coffee last year and we were all amazed at the exceptional flavor, no less the wonderful smell which filled the office as the coffee was brewing. We are now on our third order and we have five people from my office ordering, as they too have become addicted to this special coffee. We share the cost of 5 pound orders (free shipping from Blue Horse directly), with our most resent order intended as an after dinner Thanksgiving treat for our family and friends. Then if the coffee wasn't good enough, I must add that the service from the folks at Blue Horse is fantastic, every order arrived with in days of its placement and each time the coffee was a fresh as it gets or at least tastes and smells that way. To say the least, IF you are truly a coffee frantic like I am, please do yourself and/or your family a favor and order some, you will not be disappointed and you will experience some of the best tasting coffee in the world. Then even if you don't like coffee, this would make an exceptional gift for someone who does. The medium roast is what we've ordered on our two prior orders but this time we've order 5 pounds of the dark roast, so we can compare and say we've had the best of both worlds. Once I've brewed a few pots of the dark, I will come back and update my posting, so everyone will have a review of both but as an FYI, you can order a pound of each and you do get free shipping with multi-pound orders. They also have a website and you can order directly from them, saving a little money over the Amazon price, plus the pictures and stories/history of the coffee alone is worth the visit to their site.

review/summary: Great. Medium and dark roasts.
review/text: My husband loves medium blends. I love dark roast, I heard that this was the "best". So I bought it or him this past Christmas. Husband thought it was fantastic, I was expecting the "best" and was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this is great, I just like a darker roast.<br /> It's incredibly smooth, rich, very few coffees (IMO)taste good black, some need cream/sugar. This doesn't.  Anything bitter is  bad coffee.<br /><br />His birthday is tomorrow and I had to get him another pound, but I also added the dark roast. WOW. I am in love!<br /><br />It's the best. Now that I understand how subjective coffee is, we all like diffrent flavors, some in my family like added flavors (shudder), i think good coffee has enough flavor by itself and only inferior needs additives.<br /><br />I love darker roasts, creamy, chocolately, luscious. there dark last is all you'd expect.<br /><br />If you love medium roasts, this is fantastic, i don't get what others call the "toasty" flavors. It just rich, smooth, aromatic, creamy.<br /><br />The price can't be beat and they don't charge you high S&H rates, that's a nice feature.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/summary: Simply the BEST!
review/text: I had requested my wife look into getting me some Kona Coffee for Father's Day this year.<br /><br />First off I am an avid coffee drinker that can take down anywhere from 2-4 cups a day on average. While we have plenty of great coffee options in my area, I do enjoy making a delicious pot of coffee in the morning as it just seems to start the day off right.<br /><br />Secondly I drink my coffee black. I do not add milk, cream, sugar, Splenda, or any other crap into my cup of natures perfect beverage. As such, there is nothing to mask the taste of bad coffee.  If you have never tried enjoying coffee w/o turning it into a glorified milkshake, this is the coffee to try it with.<br /><br />Blue Horse Kona coffee is my dream come true. It makes me feel like I am relaxing on a resort in Maui. My wonderful wife gave me both the Medium and Dark Roasts and they are both perfect in their own ways.<br /><br />The moment you package arrives you will smell the quality and amazingness I am attempting to describe to you.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to anyone who appreciates the taste and freshness of their coffee and wants to feel like they are on vacation everyday while they drink it.<br /><br />Pros<br />+Awesome Packaging<br />+Wonderful Aroma<br />+Taste, Taste, Taste<br />+Resealable package w/ air lock<br /><br />Cons<br />-None

review/summary: Milder Than Most Medium Roasts
review/text: I have ordered Kona coffee from Amazon multiple times over the past year. I used to order Hawaii Roasters Kona Coffee (Medium Roast), but wanted to try something different, so I ordered the Medium Roast from Blue Horse. As compared to Hawaii Roasters medium roast, Blue Horse's medium roast was milder (too weak for my taste). The flavor is awesome, but I needed to use a lot more beans per pot of coffee to compensate for the mild flavor. Because Kona coffee is already expensive, using more beans per pot of coffee makes Blue Horse's medium roast too expensive for mu budget.<br /><br />When the Blue Horse medium roast ran out, I decided to try Blue Horse's dark roast. The dark roast is perfect for me! I don't like bold coffee (e.g. Starbucks), so I was worried that the Blue Horse dark roast would be too bold, but it isn't. It has the same smooth taste as Hawaii Roasters medium roast.<br /><br />Because the flavor of Blue Horse coffee is excellent, I can't justify reducing the number of stars in my rating. Just because the medium roast was too weak for my taste, doesn't mean it won't be perfect for someone else.

review/summary: Amazing company!
review/text: I ordered the medium roast because I was used to strong coffee (French to Expresso) and I was trying to tone it down a notch. I thought the medium Kona would be a tad less strong. I was wrong. It was a lot less strong. Initially, I reviewed this coffee based on my method of judging the strength of coffees.  It appears that I have done the company an injustice.  I received a phone call from the owner who was very concerned that I didn't like it. I explained that the taste was wonderful, but I had to use double the amount of beans to get it to the strength that I like.  He suggested their dark roast and said he would send me a sample to try.  I haven't received it yet, but I got an email that it was on the way.  In this day and age when companies can't even be bothered to answer emails, I find it refreshing when, not just a company employee calls, but the head of the company.  It shows a rare integrity that I will reward by being a loyal customer.  Thank you Amazon for selling this vendor's coffees and thank you Blue Horse for caring.<br />Here's a Post Script..  The sample arrived and the coffee is WONDERFUL! I highly recommend it!

review/text: Received my Blue Horse Kona Coffee Medium Roast Coffee Beans, ground some up for my first taste of this product and found it to be delicious. Blue Horse Kona is obviously 100 perccent Kona as the label states and oh, what a wonderful aroma.  I do not like a bitter after taste and this coffee fits the bill.  On another note, the family who owns Blue Horse coffee are very customer friendly which for me, is definitely another plus!

review/summary: EXCELLENT Kona Coffee!!!!!!
review/text: The first thing I noticed upon opening my bag was the incredible smell of the coffee beans.  The smell was rich and earthy, the kind of smell I associate with well prepared coffee beans.  The taste was exceptional.  I favor Kona coffee and was not disappointed by this bag.  I have now had the opportunity to have ordered several more bags.  My enthusiasm gets stronger with every sip!  While I savor this cup of coffee - I can't help but smile about the Aloha spirit that goes into the beans that created it.<br /><br />I was taken aback by the personalization I received.  On one order, the owner emailed me to make sure I was receiving *exactly* what I wanted.  Inside my order was a hand written "Aloha" and happy face - AH!  Coffee is not just a drink - it is an experience.  Thank you BLUE HORSE for the Aloha Experience.  I will be ordering more and also ordering bags for gifts so that my friends can also participate in this marvelous experience.<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee.

review/text: I got a $50 gift card from my work and I didn't know what I wanted to order. Then I thought about the fact that I've recently started grinding and making my own coffee so I figured I'd try out some more expensive stuff than what I find at my local grocery store. This coffee did not disappoint. I love the smell of the beans when I open up their air-tight container in the mornings and the smell of the coffee brewing fills the house. The bean is not what you expect; it is lighter in color and not dark and oily like what you usually see with a darker blend. The flavor is full and nutty and definitely has some chocolate notes. I'm using much less sugar in my coffee in order to get more of the flavor of the bean. I have a feeling I'll be buying this for a while into the future :)

review/text: The coffee is mild and fresh tasting.<br /><br />I get subtle and mellow notes of netmeg, tamarind, and a banana-fruit finish.<br /><br />This medium roast is very mellow and nutty. Low acidity, barely any bitterness.<br /><br />I think this is a great deal, and I'm just as impressed by the fact that I actually know where my coffee is being planted, grown, raised, picked, and shipped from. I'm also very pleased that they roast to order, as the coffee comes to me fresh roasted and I get them in the 1st sniff as I opened the bag. Coffee arrived within a week of ordering, and I'm pleased with it.<br /><br />I will continue ordering from this operation. My next order will probably be to try the dark roast and the peaberry Kona.

review/summary: A Decent Kona with unique "notes"
review/text: Blue Horse medium roast is a five-star coffee if you compare it to the premium coffee beans you buy at the supermarket, but compared to its true peers the pricey Konas - it's a solid average in a world-class competition and would have gotten four stars from me.  The price is reasonable and customer service is excellent:  I raised my rating from four to five stars for that reason.<br /><br />I just finished my first pound of this medium roast whole bean purchase.  I found the aftertaste quite pleasing, much sweeter than bitter, and pleasantly unique.  The balance for me was light and spirited and not overpowering. You do taste the coffee's unique flavors in a lighter roast like this so you need to enjoy that in your coffee - otherwise even a mellow coffee like this could seem a bit bitter due to unfamiliar tastes which are deliciously rich after you get used to them.  If not, you always have the option of a darker roast since more roasting breaks down the unique coffee flavors gives it more of a Charbucks flavor...  I believe "Blue Horse" has a dark roast also available if you want to try that instead.<br /><br />For $25/pound Blue Horse medium roast is about the going rate for 100% Kona.  I will be a repeat buyer because getting a dependable Kona at a reasonable price is not always as easy as it seems when dealing directly with small estates.  And I like dealing directly with an estate coffee farm rather than a larger farm or coop since I know the exact origin of the coffee and it is more personal since most of the Kona farms are small and family run and in a tough economy with a premium product have their share of woes to deal with.<br /><br />I have tasted better 100% Kona medium roasts, but usually they are $10 more per pound so I was pleased with my purchase.  Being a dependable, decent quality Kona for the price is great, and the pesticide-free promise was worth something to me.  The beans were nice, I didn't have a single broken one in the bag.<br /><br />The claim that they roast basically weekly and immediately ship priority mail to get it to you fresh without jumping through hoops as I've had to do with others left me with a good impression overall.  Mine was very fresh, definitely less than a week since roasting so I believe the claim.  I put the half pound I was using in another one-way valve bag I reused from another quality coffee.  To keep the rest fresh, I squeezed out all the air I could and then taped over the valve and put it in a second outer ziplock bag.  The idea is to keep out water condensation which is how the flavor gets less than perfect.  When I used the second half, I took it out of the freezer three weeks later, I let it come to room temperature before opening either bag.  It isn't recommended to freeze coffee a second time so I didn't push it.  The coffee I froze tasted almost as fresh as the first day though I actually could taste a minor difference.  But I looked forward to this coffee right up to the last bean - was still great when using a coffee grinder each time just before making it.<br /><br />I used 12.5 grams per cup to get the strength of the drip most to my liking (slightly under a half ounce).  That makes 36 cups per pound, so it was currently generally between $0.70 to $0.86 per cup including shipping which is well worth it to me considering how much I'd pay at a place like Starbucks to get a cup in which the coffee was overroasted for my tastes and lucky to be as fresh on a good day for them.

review/summary: It Pains Me to Write This Review
review/text: I held off writing this review until after I contacted Blue Horse and complained about these beans. I agree with the other one-star person that they are bland and rather tasteless beans. I contacted the farm and they replied immediately and they were very concerned. After answering a few questions they had about how I had prepared the coffee, etc., it became clear that there wasn't much they could do. They offered to send me a bag of the dark roast instead, but only if I returned the medium roast beans I had left.<br /><br />I declined to do so--it isn't worth the trouble for me--but I will assume they simply wanted to check the beans to see if something was wrong.<br /><br />As I told Blue Horse, coffee taste is subjective. So this review should be taken in that spirit. But I've had another brand of 100% Kona that I found to be the smoothest, toastiest, finest cup of coffee I've ever had. It's a shame that the label "100% Kona" coffee is not a guarantee that I'll be able to repeat that experience. I was truly looking forward to these beans.

It had that papery, weak taste associated with under-roasted beans. I have experienced this phenomenon with other coffee beans as well.  I am disappointed in this product. Based on the high ratings given by other reviewers I must have received a bad batch, which doesn't speak well for such an expensive product. Packaging on the other hand was excellent.

review/summary: totally bland, no aroma, should not have trusted high ratings
review/text: My wife and I are Kona coffee lovers, Kona coffee with no cream no sugar, just that strong morning fresh coffee aroma and taste. I read some of the high ratings and ordered this coffee instead of Hawaii Roasters 100% Kona coffee, our normal Kona coffee. Did Blue Horse employees rate this coffee? My wife opened the new bag this morning and she said, unlike Hawaii Roasters, she could not smell that fresh smell of Kona cofee and worried it was not going to be very good. With Hawaii Roasters, whole house is filled with freshly brewed smell. Nontheless, I told her it received pretty good review in Amazon. She was right and I was wrong to order this product. First brew was so bland with no taste, pretty much like boiled water, no aroma of freshly brewed Kona coffee. I should have dismissed ratings and stayed with proven. I ordered Hawaii Roasters right away. I will have to throw away the rest of this 1 lb bag. Or maybe use as horse feedstock.

I had bought two similar looking dishers elsewhere for making Grand Marnier truffle, but on both of those the sweeps broke the first time I tried to scoop the cooled chocolate to form the cores.  No such problems with this disher--I've done many batches of chocolates, and it keeps chugging along.<br /><br />I own this model and the Vollrath #30.  The size #50 is perfect for nice, big chocolates.  I am sold on Vollrath durability.  Many other brands look almost the same, but they are absolute junk.  If you will be scooping something that is rough on the sweep of the disher, please try this brand.

review/summary: My Favorite (not sure what can the other reviewers opened...)
review/text: I'm a foodie and love this soup!  I avoid gluten, and had missed the comfort and taste of chicken noodle soup for years.  This is a real 'adult' chicken soup with nice-sized chunks of chicken, carrots and celery.  The picture on the label doesn't do justice to the rice -- the rice inside is a nice, textured, wild rice.  Sorry to see that the other reviewers had a bad experience, but I wonder if the cans they received were handled improperly because my experience doesn't resemble theirs at all.  I've eaten about 6 cans of this soup so far, and am now buying it by the case.

review/summary: DO NOT PURCHASE with a dairy allergy!
review/text: I bought this ONLY because my grand daughter can not have any dairy at all and they said "no dairy" however, the can clearly says it uses dairy. I am ashamed that Amazon is allowing this to be sold and then refuses to accept a return.<br /><br />Now I am stuck with 32.00 plus shipping for soup I could have bought at my local store, you have the chance to save yourself, so I suggest you do not buy this.....

review/text: This is just awful soup with so much black pepper, I nearly choked on it.  It had a burnt taste.  Very poor quality control on this item.  I was shocked because this brand's chicken broth is very good.

review/summary: Dog food smells better!  YUUUUUCCCCKKKK!
review/text: This is my first time trying Pacific Foods soups and maybe my last time.  I could not believe somebody would make this soup, package it and then sell it.  This soup is not consumable, and what makes it worse, it smells bad.  Honestly, I think dog food smells better.  I really do not think a dog would eat it either.  I put it in the fridge thinking I could come back to it and try it again - I could not do it.  I think the garbage disposer chocked on it also!  If I could give this soup a zero, I surely would.  Keep your money in your pocket.  Wolfgang Puck has much better organic soups.  I should have read the one review before I wasted [...] on this crap!  I am going to stick with their line of broths.

review/summary: Matt the cat likes it
review/text: Matthew is a foodie; he is now 11 years old and has always been this way.  He would eat 24/7 if we let him, so we have to measure all his food.  As it is, he is pushing 20 pounds, although he is 19 inches from head to toe.  Purina is one of the brands I trust for food, having heard of no scandals like with some other brands.  The package says this food is good for the heart and immune system.  We feed Matt about half dry and half wet food because of concerns about male cats possibly having urinary tract problems if fed only dry food.  Matt will eat just about anything, so this chow is no exception.  I was surprised by how good this food smells, sort of like fresh wheat bread (okay, I am on a diet).  The price is good at $7.47 for a 7-pound bag with super saver shipping.  The expiration date is into 2013, but it will not last that long.

review/summary: Quality Cat chow
review/text: As well as most commercial dry cat food products, this is well tolerated by my 9 cats. (No, not 1 cat with 9 lives). This; however, contains grain products, so I also give them grain and gluten free dry and wet food, as well.  Cats are "Carnivores" and do not, to my knowledge and experience, tolerate excessive amounts of grain.<br />There are more 'natural' products available, which are more costly, but you tend to get that, for which you have paid.

review/summary: Great lunch on the go
review/text: A few years ago I made a huge lifestyle change. I used to eat everything in sight, loved processed food, never ate any fruits and few vegetables, was overweight and sluggish.<br />I started exercising and learned how to eat right, lost 90 lbs and never felt better in my entire life. I haven't had a single headache in the past 4 years, so I know how eating right is important.<br />So what does eating right mean? I don't eat red meat; use organic food whenever available; and stay away from processed foods.<br />Also, I have five meals a day (3 small main meals and 2 snacks), and I bag my lunch, usually a salad with a half chicken breast or fish, which I prepare the evening before.<br />Okay, sorry for the long intro, now I'm getting to the review of the product... sometimes I can't prepare my lunch, I don't have time or I don't have salad; so it's nice to have an alternative.<br />The gopicnic lunches are very convenient for that. Organic, calorie controlled, healthy, no trans fats, satisfying so they won't send you to the evil snack machine at the end of the hall.<br /><br />Each package contains a little tub of salmon spread (quite tasty, a little sweet to my taste), Ritz-like crackers, a bag of dry-roasted edamame, a bag of trail-mix style fruit and nut mix, and a square of dark chocolate. There is also a plastic fork and even a puzzle at the bottom of the box, to keep you entertained after lunch!<br /><br />Tastewise, it's not bad, although I wouldn't eat it too often; but I like keeping a few on the shelf as backup for the days when I don't have time to make lunch. Make sure to complement it with a piece of fruit though!

review/summary: Easy nutritious meal for on the go
review/text: Eating nutritious meals on the go is difficult; eating "tasty" nutritious meals is even harder.<br />When I saw this product I was skeptical as to whether it would really taste good or be filling.<br />My thoughts about the product claims:<br />1) A balanced meal featuring chili lime salmon spread, organic crackers, fruit and nut mix etc - I really enjoy the different flavors and textures of the meal - no boring taste here!<br />2) All-natural; 22g protein, 11g fiber and only 410 calories - a good balance of nutrition and calories (much better than fast food!)<br />3) No trans fats; No artificial colors - I appreciate that it is all natural<br />4) Perfect for school lunch, field trips, sports games, road trips, lunch at work or after school - the Go Picnic is easy to tote along to anything you are doing away from home. It is shelf stable and does not need refrigeration which is a big plus!<br /><br />Over all a great product with great taste that is good for you!

I would not call this a healthy snack or meal by any stretch of<br /><br />the imagination. The taste of the salmon mixture is okay, the crackers taste good.<br /><br />The snack mix and the little chocolate bar are the best of the lot here. Would I buy<br /><br />this in a store? No I think not. First it is not really healthy, second it is too<br /><br />expensive for what you get.

review/summary: Not my kind of snack...
review/text: I do a lot of hiking and am preparing to walk in the 3-Day for the Cure so I thought I would give this product a try, besides, I like the turkey pepperoni GoPicnic product. Wow, was I disappointed in the salmon portion of the package. The salmon spread comes in a little carton like dipping sauces from a fast food restaurant - a plastic fork is provided to "spread" the product on to the crackers. The first thing I noticed was the strange color, sort of faded orange and unappealing looking. The next thing that surprised me was the consisteny - pretty much the same as cocktail sauce with tiny random flakes of salmon the were reminiscent of the horseradish in cocktail sauce. With so little actual salmon it seemed odd since the first ingredient listed is indeed "salmon." On to the flavor...if you LOVE Asian Fish Sauce you'll love this product as that is all I can taste. It feels "gummy" in the mouth and is all around unpleasant. Because everyone is mostly familiar with the other products in the box I won't comment on them but suffice it to say I won't be ordering this product again even though it arrived in a timely and pristine fashion. Pity.

review/summary: Just okay for the price
review/text: This is another in a line of upscale on the go / "gourmet" box lunch.  But there is really nothing too upscale or gourmet about this.<br /><br />First you get a package of chili lime salmon spread.  But it is not well mixed because you either get a bit of fishy salmon or the taste of chili lime sauce.  Whatever they were trying, it did not work.<br /><br />With the salmon spread, you get a package of six LAte July Organic Classic Rich Crackers.  The crackers are fine but any health benefit from the organic is lost in the fat calories.<br /><br />Next you have a package of Sweet Perry Orchards Ginger Zip & Nut Mix.  This is a very standard dried fruit and nut mix.<br /><br />You get a package of Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame.  I know a lot of people who love edamame but I am not one of them and having dry roasted edamame is even worse.  It tastes like dry soy beans without the flavour.<br /><br />For desert you get Terra Nostra Organic Robust Dark Chocolate Square.  This is the one thing that not only tasted good but had a great texture.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a good meal replacement as the total calories of 410 and 16 grams of fat will not fill you up.  All it will do is maybe be a sort of mid afternoon snack.<br /><br />My advice is just to get a real meal.

review/text: The crackers, fruit and nut mix, the dry roasted edamame and the dark chocolate were OK. The salmon was oily yet it did not taste natural. It was also a relative small share of the entire box package. This is definitely a small snack even for one person. Like other reviewers, I would compare it to airline food.

Some portions of the meal work better than others -the crackers, trail mix, and desert were all good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the salmon spread.  It is nice to have the flexibility of not needing to refrigerate the meal, and it comes in a nice small box.

review/summary: I really didn't like this at all
review/text: Do you remember when you were a child and you ate something that you instantly had to wipe off your tongue???? Well that's how I felt when I ate this GoPicnic meal. I had great hopes it was going to satisfy me. I was sadly mistaken. I am constantly on the go with dropping and picking up kids to and from school, practice, and whatever meeting either of us may have. I have been trying to avoid the drive thru and this was one attempt at that. Um, yeah. I won't be attempting this again. I will typically eat anything and when hungry will muscle on through even those meals most won't. So this was truly a disappointment for me.<br /><br />Let's begin with the salmon spread. It was mushy, tasted fishy, and weird. This is when I was looking for an immediate tongue amputation. Now don't get me wrong I love fish. We eat it at least once a week either raw or cooked. This stuff however was awful! I couldn't get it out of my mouth fast enough and I only had the once cracker topped salmon deal. The crackers on the other hand were pretty good.<br /><br />Next up the Edamame. I've had dry edamame before and I'll be honest I prefer the fresh version. I found what was included in the lunch to be too dry for my liking. Luckily I didn't feel like a tongue-ectomy was in order but I didn't finish the package either. On a positive side I did drink more water.<br /><br />More for the positive, the dark chocolate piece and trail mix were a happy eat for me. I wanted to break up the chocolate and add it to the trail mix but for this review I decided to eat everything as it's individual  intention. They didn't quite make up for the need to remove my tongue but they did their best so I will give honorable mention here.<br /><br />So, yeah, this is a bad review. I definitely will not be eating one of these GoPicnics again. But if they do sell the trail mix or chocolate I would consider.

review/text: I received this product through the Amazon Vine program and had occasion to try it on my recent trip to San Diego from Seattle (1300 mile drive).  I thought that this would be a great time to try it as there are long stretchs of I-5 that do not have places to eat.  Crossing from Oregon into California, I stopped at a very scenic reststop and decided to try the Gopicnic meal that I had brought with me.<br /><br />Here are the plus items:<br /><br />Nothing needed refrigeration<br />The box is well designed so that you can close it back up easily<br />Every item is individually wrapped so that you can eat only a portion of it if you want without risking spoiling the remaining items.<br />There is no chemistry list in the food listings<br />There is trivia written in the box to help keep you amused as you eat.<br />The chocolate piece is dark chocolate and is very good.<br /><br />Here is what I found a bit lacking:<br /><br />The six Ritz like crackers are not very filling<br />The salmon spread was fishy tasting, smelling, and also had a very runny texture.  The lime flavoring that it was supposed to have did not come through the fishy taste.<br />The salted edame were very bland and are apparently an acquired taste.  I have had them before with spicy flavorings and there were fine.  Just salt though does not do much for me.<br />The trail mix was supposed to be ginger flavored, but I could not really taste it.<br /><br />Perhaps the other varieties of this product might be better, but I would not recommend this one.

review/summary: I liked it
review/text: Although I thought it was a somewhat odd combination of food, I actually enjoyed every part of the meal.  There were parts (like the edamame) that I thought I would not like but everything was tasty.  The fruit and nut mix was a little bit sweeter than I expected, which probably contributed to the rather high 21g sugar content.  The fat content (16g,5g saturated) is also rather high.  I found the chocolate a little bit bland but it was ok.  I thought the salmon spread was quite good.  I could taste the lime and the slightest hint of spiciness but it was fairly mild.  It didn't look like a whole lot of food but it was reasonably filling.  I like the convenience of a "meal in a box" that doesn't require refrigeration or heating.  It's a good option for a hike or anywhere that you just need to eat on-the-go.

review/summary: Healthy, handy and tasty. Lunch for those on the go.
review/text: At 410 calories with no trans fat and 22 grams of protein you can feel better eating this than anything you'll eat from a drive-thru.<br /><br />Chili Lime Salmon Spread:  It smells a little fishy at first but the flavor is nicely balanced with lime juice and spices (onion, cumin, ginger, turmeric) against the red pepper paste. If the spices concern you, sweeten it up with some pieces of Romaine lettuce.<br /><br />Organic Crackers: Dry and not as buttery as Ritz crackers (but much healthier), these crackers don't interfere with the spread.<br /><br />Fruit & Nut Mix: The cranberries provide a pleasant tang between the peanuts and banana chips. Eat this mix along with the dark chocolate square for a sweet and savory experience.<br /><br />Dry Roasted Edamame: The soybeans were roasted so much that they reminded me of Setsubun (the Japanese bean-throwing festival). That's not to say the edamame are too dry because they bring plenty of flavor to the lunch, however this treat can be overlooked next to the chocolate and fruit mix. I'd recommend saving the one ounce packet for an afternoon snack so you can appreciate the dark roasted flavor on its own.<br /><br />Organic Dark Chocolate Square: Dark chocolate fans will rejoice, milk chocolate fans will find this too bitter by itself. If you fall into the latter category, try eating the square with the fruit and nut mix (my preference).<br /><br />In summary, this is a handy and tasty lunch. You can store it in your desk drawer instead of the company refrigerator, which guarantees it will be waiting for you when lunchtime rolls around. GoPicnic even added a Sudoku puzzle in the bottom of the box!<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of a "ready to eat" meal, but this GoPicnic combination was a pleasant surprise. There was enough stuff to actually fill me up for a quick lunch (though I have to admit, I added some carrot sticks and a nonfat 6 oz. yogurt) -- and I'm a 200+ pound male.<br /><br />The salmon dip and Ritz-like crackers are the main course. The chili lime flavoring is mild at first, but builds on you. The edamame are crispy and salty and aren't objectionable at all, while the fruit and nut mix and (dark!) chocolate square round out the mix. Very pleasant.<br /><br />For around $4 per meal, these aren't cheap, but aren't outrageous for quality, all-natural foods without trans fats or high fructose corn syrup. While the package itself is only 4.4 oz. (compared, to say, a Lean Cuisine at around 9 oz.) it still may be worth it for you especially if you don't want to have to worry about refrigeration or microwaving. I wouldn't hesitate to buy one again so I'm not stuck going out to eat at work and consuming more calories than I really need. But it's definitely not an every week thing, and don't expect anything real filling.

review/summary: Convenient, tasty
review/text: The essential attribute of GoPicnic's products is that they're self-contained meals. No refrigeration needed, no heating needed, all utensils included, and enough variety that it feels like you're having a little meal, rather than, say, just a bag of peanuts. They're also generally pretty healthy, though that will vary depending on the variety.<br /><br />This salmon+crackers box is on the healthier side. 410 calories, 22g protein, 11g fiber, 16g fat, and 48g carbohydrates.<br /><br />So how does it taste? It's not bad. The edamame are just roasted, salted soybeans, which are never very exciting, but they provide a lot of the nutritive value of this meal. The crackers are flaky, buttery, and quite nice. The salmon spread is a little surprising. It's whole-salmon, not salmon filet, so it doesn't look as tidy as something like canned tuna. Think of old-fashioned canned salmon, and you're closer. It's in a lightly spicy, glaze-like chili sauce. It smells pretty strongly of fish -- you might annoy people depending on where you're eating. Or attract cats. ;)  I liked it, but I would not expect children to regard it with anything but suspicion. The fruit and nut mix was sweet and crunchy and very yummy. Good thing it's a small package. The dark chocolate was kind of meh, but hey, chocolate! Something minty or citrusy would have been better. I think.<br /><br />The GoPicnic meals are a good choice (if you don't mind the high price) for car trips or long walks or other kinds of travel when you won't have access to refrigeration and microwave ovens. I enjoyed these.

review/summary: Picnic Lunch
review/text: This is a picnic lunch with 4 courses, including dessert, and even a sudoku puzzle to play while you digest.  It seems like everything is very small and wouldn't be filling, but it truly filled me up!  I was still hungry right after eating it, but just a few minutes later, I felt satisfied.  (It's possible I eat too fast.)  I stayed satisfied for several hours after, too.<br /><br />As for taste - I really liked it.  The salmon and crackers were good.  The salmon was seasoned well, and the cracker flavor complimented it.  I was worried that the ginger part of the "ginger zip fruit & nut mix" would be too strong, but it was subtle.  I haven't actually tried the edamame yet.  I did (of course) eat the dark chocolate square and loved it.  It was small, but very good.  I prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate, and this was good.<br /><br />As far as nutrition goes, it's not bad.  At 410, the calories are in the OK range for lunch.  Sodium is 660mg (28%), which isn't horrible, especially since there's 22g of protein and 11g of fiber, which keeps you full enough to not get another snack full of salt.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, this is $30 for a package of 6.  That makes these $5 each.  That's a little pricey for something you take to work for lunch every day.  But as far as a treat once in a while, it's a pretty good value.<br /><br />I did really like this.  It's tasty and filling, and won't bust your diet as long as you don't add too many snacks.  I'd like the sodium to be a little less, but it's not really bad for what you get.  I might have to get this again.

review/summary: Not as good as some of their other options
review/text: I've tried GoPicnic brand snacks before, and found them fairly decent for a healthier option.  This one was not as good as others we've had.  My 4 year old son and I sat down to try this, and we both LOVE salmon.  We eat it canned, baked, in dips, smoked, etc.  Living in Alaska, we eat a lot of salmon.  We both took a couple of bites of this dip, and didn't finish.  It's okay in a pinch, but a little too hot (spicy) with an odd flavor that covers up the salmon.  It's also a very strange almost gel-like consistency that we didn't like, most likely from the corn starch.<br /><br />The crackers were good, although they are white flour instead of whole grain, and we very rarely eat white flour, even though they were organic.<br /><br />We don't eat a lot of soy due to the health issues, especially GMO soy which this probably is, but we did taste the edamame for this review.  They were dry without much flavor.<br /><br />The Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix was a little odd.  It tasted okay, but was an odd combination of dried banana chips, ginger peanuts, and dried cranberries.  Not our favorite fruit & nut combo.<br /><br />The chocolate was decent, although not as good as Endangered Species dark chocolate.  It was organic, which is a plus.<br /><br />The container & packaging was nice and included a fork and napkin, so you can take it with you on the run.  There's even a Sudoku puzzle on the inside of the box for some post-picnic fun :-)<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I'd rather eat this than fast food or Snackables, but this wasn't my favorite flavor combination.  Also if you are looking for organic snacks, the only organic items in this box are the crackers and the chocolate.  Also, if you are allergic to corn, there's corn starch & maltodextrin in the salmon spread.  Obviously this also contains soy, fish, wheat, and peanuts for allergy information.

review/summary: An expensive snack for 4.48oz of food.
review/text: The box says this is a meal and @ $5.00 and 400 calories it should be a meal, it's not. Inside the box there are packages of crackers, a nut fruit mix, chili lime salmon, edamame and a square of chocolate. When I opened the box I was a little disappointed at the serving size of the chili lime salmon compared to the size of the edamame.  For the price I would expect more salmon and less edamame to make up the 22gms of protein, my mistake. The salmon looks like baby food but it is tasty. There is a fork and not a knife in the box which makes it hard to get all of the salmon from the little container. The edamame is over dried with not much taste. It gets kind of powdery when you chew it and it made me cough from the texture getting caught in the back of my throat. You'll need a lot of water to wash them down with. I had to give up eating them because they kept choking me. I did enjoy the fruit and nut mix and the chocolate was really good so it wasn't a total loss.<br />I consider the the price to be the biggest negative in this review. At almost $5.00 a box this is an expensive snack. I won't be buying this.

review/summary: Now you can have an airline meal at home
review/text: The GoPicnic ready-to-eat meal is pretty much the same thing you get in coach when the airline gives you a snack or meal. it contains some crackers, a chili lime salmon spread, some dry-roasted Edamame (a crunchy salty snack), some nuts, and a dark chocolate square. The salmon spread is very um...salmony. Not that good as far as my taste goes. The other stuff is typical dry snack food. Not bad. Not good.<br /><br />I am surprised that this product is indistinguishable from one of my least favorite things: airline food. Flying coach is bad enough, but those boxed snacks, well if you have eaten them you know. According to the label, the product uses mostly organic, high quality ingredients. The nut mix does contain peanuts. If you have an allergy to them, stay away.

I asked my 8-year-old one to take one to school for lunch once because she doesn't really enjoy eating whatever is on her school's lunch menu. She liked the crackers and the salmon paste, but not everything else, it was obvious too little food for her, she ended up coming home eating double the amount of snacks she usually eats. Also, $4 per pack is a little price too me.

review/summary: Not so tasty
review/text: My honest opinion of this snack box is that the items in the pack were not good picks to fulfill a meal. I understand the intention of GoPicnic putting the pack together to offer a variety of interesting and nutritious snacks; however, as a meal, I do not rate this snack pack as great. Individual items in the box were great, such as two pieces of dark chocolate, crackers, and nut and dry fruit mix (which is a bit too sweet for my overall taste although the ginger made up for it), but altogether, each item is a snack, and essentially you are eating a meal consisting of snacks, which I do not feel is an ideal meal (maybe as a last resort meal, but not as a take-to-work meal). The least likeable item was the salmon spread. Perhaps others rated this spread as favorable, but in my opinion, the spread is a tad salty, and it did not leave a  complimentary taste in my mouth. Overall, the pack is convenient, but I recommend a consumer eat each snack individually and not as a meal. Of course, if you generally eat snacks as a meal, then this pack is for you.<br />On a positive note, the snack pack is cute, includes a plenty of tasty healthful snacks, and is not too pricy, but I would not pay $4 for the pack. I might go for a wholesale buy if offered, but not as a single-time purchase. Therefore, the pack isn't too bad, but I wouldn't recommend it as a meal to anyone; I'd simply recommend it for what it is: a combination of decent snacks.

review/text: The salmon was a little spicy, which was okay. It tasted pretty good. The chocolate was good as well.<br /><br />It's wonderful that they're using organic, and so if you're looking for a packaged snack that's organic and has a variety of good nutrients, this could be a great little snack/picnic to take with you.<br /><br />I like that the ingredients are listed on the product page so you can see what's in it before buying.<br /><br />The drawback for me was the trailmix and dry roasted edamame, just didn't taste all that great.<br /><br />I like that the salmon used is Alaskan salmon which is supposed to be fresher, cleaner, and better for you.<br /><br />So, other than the drawbacks mentioned, it was an okay snack.

review/summary: Won't be trying that again
review/text: I tried the Salmon and crackers meal and I'm not impressed. I normally love fish and am a sushi lover, but the entire time I was eating the salmon I felt like I was eating cat food. It smelled. Really bad. The texture of it was also reminiscent of cat food which made it go down all the worse. The salmon had a hint of spice which I generally like but the whole salmon + crackers bit did not work for me.<br /><br />I did however enjoy the nuts. Those were yummy and gone in a flash. Without a doubt, that was the best part of the meal.<br /><br />The roasted Edamame? I thought I would like them since I love boiled and salted Edamame, however these made me gag. They were so dry and the taste was bland. The chocolate, while good, also left a horrible after taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />It was not a good lunch. And it's a whopping 410 calories. That's more than the typical Lean Cuisine meals; even more than many of the Marie Callander meals! And it just wasn't satisfying. Even though I ate lots of calories I still didn't feel like I had a proper lunch, just a snack.<br /><br />I won't be getting this again anytime soon.

review/summary: Overpriced indeed
review/text: As some others have noted, the GoPicnic salmon is like overpriced catfood.  Heck, I've seen Fancy Feast cat food appetizers provide a higher quality of flaky salmon than you'll find in this GoPicnic snackbox.<br /><br />First, the good.  The edamame dried soybeans provide 30% of your daily protein intake, which was quite surprising to me.  They were slightly on the bland side however, but I felt very nutritious when consuming then.  The chocolate square and trail mix were ok (not great, but passable), and tasted fine.  Also, the Sudoku game on the bottom of the packaging was a thoughtful touch, although I don't play Sudoku.  Also, the crackers were pretty tasty; reminded me of a healthier version of Ritz crackers.<br /><br />Now, the bad.  The salmon, which is supposed to be the centerpiece of the meal, was nasty.  Didn't taste like salmon at all, since it was overpowered by other spices, but it did have a slightly fishy odor.  Had an odd consistency, probably better suited to coming out of a bottle of toothpaste.<br /><br />I guess the GoPicnic isn't a terrible choice if you were starving and it were given to you for free.  But even if I were starving, I probably wouldn't eat the salmon.

review/summary: I think somethings missing....
review/text: Okay, I like where they are going with this idea - prepackaging a healthy snack of unusual dishes for people with little time.  Here is where it went wrong.<br /><br />1) I read the box, and it tells me how healthy the meal is, including lots of fiber<br />2) I open the box<br />3) I notice that there are no utensils, and that the chocolate is missing.<br />4) I find a knife for spreading and open the salmon<br />5) I gag from the overwhelming odor of the fish and dispose of the salmon after a quick taste (not to my liking)<br />6) I discover peanuts in the granola mix - I like peanuts but didn't remember seeing any warnings on the box about peanuts<br />7) I liked the edemame but the bag was too small<br />8) I realized how much garbage was created from a little midget snack and feel bad for my planet.  For real everything was individually wrapped in plastic and the portions were so small that odds are people will STILL go find more to eat.<br /><br />In the end, my box was missing things, there didn't seem to be any way to spread the salmon included, I wouldn't advise eating this at your desk because of the pungent odor and there are better packaging choices for the environment.<br /><br />Now if I could find a big bag of that edemame I would buy THAT, but there was too much trash for too little reward in this "snack" for me.

review/summary: a pleasant fiber-filled afternoon snack
review/text: The first thing I want to mention is that this package - consisting of a chili-lime-salmon spread, organic crackers (think Ritz-type crackers), dry-roasted and salted edamame, an organic dark chocolate square, and a fruit-nut mix - comes with a plastic fork, but no knife.  Struck me as kind of weird - spreading the salmon mixture with a fork?  One doesn't really need either utensil for the rest of it, unless one puts it all together in a bowl or something.  One could also carp with GoPicnic's use of the word "meal" in the name - this is definitely a snack, not a meal, though it's a decent-sized snack.<br /><br />Secondly, the fruit-nut mixture contains peanuts, as well as dried bananas and cranberries, with ginger flavoring.  I am allergic to peanuts, so I didn't try this part of the product.  While the fine print on the bottom of the box and the side (under the nutrition info) mentions this clearly, it's not stated on the front or back of the box.  Just a minor caveat - it does say "nuts" and anyone with nut allergies of any kind will know to read the fine print.<br /><br />That said, the rest of the product is quite nice.  The salmon spread is quite salmon-y, and one can detect some hints of both the chili and lime, though I wouldn't say it's strongly spicy by any means.  It's got a nice texture, not grainy but not too mushy either, and tastes fresh enough, and the crackers are light, buttery and crisp.  The edamame are fine, also fresh and crunchy, and it's nice that they use sea salt instead of table salt.  The chocolate is strong - maybe not intense enough for hardcore chocolate nuts, but it was fine for this chocolate liker (not lover).<br /><br />The nutritional info on the package as a whole claims that it provides 44% of daily fiber, and 28% sodium, with 410 calories - so it's a good energy source without having a huge amount of salt, despite all the nuts and fish and crackers.  The package is supposed to be shelf-safe for several months; I just got it so I can't vouch for that but I'll probably save one of the six boxes for a few months and update then, if there's any deterioration in quality before the expiration date.<br /><br />This isn't typically the sort of product I buy; had I not gotten it through Vine I don't know that I would have ever tasted it.  But it's a nice snack overall, and apart from not being able to eat the fruit/nut mixture I have no significant issues.  I would definitely consider other products in this line, particularly if I can eat all the elements in the box!

I find it a little tastier then the typical airline offerings - but it would be a great option to take along and avoid the risk of what they might feed you (at a considerably better price).<br /><br />For me - it provided the perfect gourmet fishing lunch.  Paired with a nice Pinot Noir I felt like I was fly fishing in France.  It is reasonably tasty and very convenient.

review/summary: Interesting Mix
review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBLF2E">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers,</a> box contains an interesting collection of individual snacks.  Almost all of them were good by themselves. with the exception perhaps of the edamame (soy beans) which I thought was too dry and without taste. The main course, the salmon spread was good, although it should have come with a better spreader than a fork.  As soon as I opened the salmon, the cat became very interested.  I gave her a bite.  She liked it too.<br /><br />The collection reminded me of the snack meals provided by airlines just before they stopped providing meals at all.  To their credit, GoPicnic has worked to avoid including artificial colors and flavors. I think that this would be a good choice to bring with you on a flight. However, in the end, you are left with a very large pile of wrappers.  This is probably not a good lesson in the use of resources.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, the box was an interesting idea, and would work well if the fork is replaced with a better spreader.

review/summary: Good for a quick bite or to keep at the office....
review/text: I usually try to keep a "ready to go" meal at work in case I forget my lunch and thought this item looked interesting.  I was pretty happy with it....here are the pros/cons:<br /><br />I like that it packs 11 grams of fiber (44% of your daily intake), 22 grams of protein, 10% iron and 10% vitamin c. The salmon spread is pretty tasty with a little bit of spice to it, but not too much, crackers, a generous serving of dry roasted edamame, Fruit & Nut mix and an organic dark chocolate square.  I really liked the fruit/nut mix and the ginger was not overpowering.  It was a tasty mix of dried fruit, bananas and ginger peanuts....very tasty.<br /><br />The couple things we would like to change: you need more crackers-I think about 8 would be just about right, as you seem to have salmon spread left over unless you heap it on.  Also, a knife would be helpful to spread it, along with the fork that is included OR ditch the round crackers and use square crackers that would be easier to just dip into the spread.<br /><br />Overall, not a gigantic amount of food, it seemed to have proper food proportions and is perfect for one person who eats sensibly.  As it has a lot of fiber I would keep in mind that drinking enough fluids would be important with a to-go meal like this one.<br />As far as the food, it was a nice little meal that I would keep for the office or in a backpack when I hike.<br /><br />I would consider buying a couple of these to have on hand and would recommend them for those that need a quick meal.

review/summary: Good for a Layover in an Airport
review/text: I wish I'd had this the last time I was stuck walking around an airport looking for something nutritious and tasty to eat.  Seriously, this is a good alternative to Cinnabons' or Applebee's To Go.  The elements in the package were tasty on their own, and, together, made up a healthy little meal with a long shelf-life.  The salmon was a touch runny, but nicely flavored with lime and chili, not a whole lot of sodium.  Crackers were whole and tasty.  Edamame were dry-roasted and lightly salted:  the first time I ever actually enjoyed edamame.  The ginger-touched dried fruit and nut mix was WONDERFUL, and I will look for it separately in the future.  The little bite of chocolate was a touch too cacao-y and not very silky chocolate-y, but it was a nice sweet ending, none-the-less.  The packaging is nice, like a teeny-tiny picnic basket, and it had a little "keep you occupied" pencil puzzle printed on the inside.  I will look for these again.  Thanks for a great alternative to the nutritional bombs available in an airport.

review/summary: GoPicnic meals come in handy...
review/text: I like the concept of the GoPicnic ready-to-eat meals. They're a more healthy alternative compared to some ready-to-eat meals I see in the grocery store; another plus is they don't need refrigeration. I've purchased their SunnyBreak & ExploreMunch: Turkey Stick & Cheese 6-Pack for long car trips. We never eat them as a whole meal but pass around the box & pick what we want to snack on.<br /><br />GoPicnic meals are put together with a lot of thought, quality ingredients & quality products.  The salmon & crackers balanced meal contains 410 calories and 11 gr. of fiber, 22gr of protein; sodium content is 660mg or 28% of your daily requirement.<br /><br />Flavor & other info:<br />Chili Lime Salmon Spread: The taste of the salmon is not overpowered by the mild, spicy chili/lime spread. So, if you don't like the taste of fish, you won't want to purchase this. Getting back to the spicy flavor: it's not very spicy at all, which I prefer. If your taste buds prefer the 'crazy hot' spicy food that's so popular today, this will probably seem bland to you. Some of the ingredients in this spread: pink Alaskan salmon, red pepper paste, sugar, lime juice, vinegar, garlic powder & spices.<br /><br />Dry Roasted Edamame: These lightly salted, dry roasted green soybeans are crunchy with good flavor. Containing 130 calories, 8gr fiber, 14gr protein & 150mg/6% sodium it's a healthy addition to this meal.<br /><br />Late July Organic Classic Rich Crackers: These are very good, with a light, buttery taste. At 90 calories, 210mg/9% sodium they're on par with the average cracker...but these are organic and prepared with healthier ingredients & taste better than many other crackers.<br /><br />Ginger Zip: Contains ginger peanuts, cranberries & banana chips; similar to a trail mix, it's good, fresh & crispy.<br /><br />Terra Nostra Organic Robust Dark 60% Cacao: This dark chocolate doesn't taste as bitter to me as others. I'm not a fan of dark chocolate, but it's good for you...and this tastes better than some & it's organic.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great meal to take with you on a long car trip, an outdoor outing or even something quick to pack for your lunch.  It also has a fork and a Sudoku puzzle...so don't forget to bring a drink with you and a pencil with an eraser for the puzzle.
