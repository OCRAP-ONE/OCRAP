review/summary: Too expensive on Amazon!
review/text: This is my favorite K-cup and one my husband and I can agree on (I prefer darker roast, he likes a lighter roast coffee).  It holds up well to the cream and Splenda I add.<br /><br />However, this price is outrageous.  Far more than I pay at the grocery store.

review/text: My wife and oldest son don't like a strong coffee, so the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend works great for them. While I myself prefer the Coffee People's Organic, which is darker and more robust - similar to some of the blends found at Starbucks (not their regular blend). The Organic is strong enough for them to re-use once, after I've had the first brew.<br /><br />I also love that we can get the double pack of the Breakfast Blend 24 K-Cups inexpensively from Amazon. We purchase the Coffee People Organic in the 50-K-cup boxes.

review/summary: Lets rate the flavor shall we. The price will always fluctuate.
review/text: The price of this has been fluctuating forever on amazon. This listing is the same one that different sellers will use. Some are better than others but the reviews stay with the product regardless of who is selling it at the moment. Until it becomes available as a frustration free 50 count box from amazon this is what we will have to deal with. There is another seller that offers free shipping on the 108 count box every once and a while and its free shipping for everyone not only amazon prime members. when you see it available do not hesitate on getting it. It goes fast because of the free shipping. It is still a little high at about 57 cents per cup but 43 is the lowest I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is our favorite everyday coffee. It is what we call "normal" coffee. It's not mild or bold or flavored its just a great medium body cup of joe.<br /><br />When you register your brewer with Keurig. You will be offered some free coffee. I would suggest you get this as your free coffee. You will also be offered free shipping with that order. So buy a lot of the 5 pack samplers and get the most out of the free shipping.

review/summary: Good flavor - a little too weak for me
review/text: Seems like the Keurig systems lend themselves to dark roasts - however, the near burnt flavor element never worked for me. I was excited to try out this light roast (enough for 48 packs of 'trial') - and indeed I loved the flavor if you stick to the small 6 oz cup size. The coffee gets too weak and watery at any of my regular sizes (middle or right-but-one button on the B70) - this is a coffee that could do with an 'extra bold' rating to up the quantity of coffee in the cup.<br />My current alternative for this is Green Mountain's 'Our Blend' - which does seem to have got it right!

review/text: I got the Keurig as a present recently and have been trying all the samples that came with the unit. I like a smooth tasting coffee with lots of flavor, especially for breakfast. Unfortunately, the Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend left me flat.<br />All of the Keurig K-Cups lack the wonderful aroma that makes coffee drinking so enjoyable, but this breakfast blend is even less aromatic than others.<br />Flavors are, of course, a personal preference, and I can see the appeal of this coffee for some. It doesn't bite you, like many coffees, so if you're looking for a mellow flavor in the morning, this may be for you. Otherwise, steer clear of this one.

review/summary: Poor Labeling makes for a rip-off!
review/text: I have used this before, and like the coffee. But was not aware of the different strengths. Saw a statement about them as I reviewed today (in "product features" it says, "Please note: 'regular', 'bold' and 'extra bold' refer to the amount of coffee in the K-Cup"). There is no way to make any choice during Amazon Prime buying (one click), or any other way i can find. So I am consuming this expensive stuff twice as fast to get the strength I want. Are you listening, Amazon? This proves to me that the arguments some make that buying in the store is better may have merit. if this were not a food item, already opened, I would return.<br /><br />So: WARNING: don't buy unless you are satisfied with any strength (Ironic a product this expensive would not pay more attention).<br /><br />Very, very disappointed!<br /><br />PS, the box labeling did not match the warning anyway, what I got was "Light Roast". The other choice was "Regular". Leads one to wonder if they are clearing off old, outdated product.

The worst part is that you don't know it's instant until you taste it, look carefully at the package, and see that it's "water soluble"-- code words for instant.  Open one up, and you'll see!

review/summary: Just Right for Me
review/text: I recently found this blend available at my local Walmart (sorry Amazon, but it had a great price). It is a light blend such as I prefer, and tastes wonderful.  I could not detect any aftertaste as you get with medium or dark coffee blends. I previously wrote a review for Green Mountain's Nantucket Blend which I recommended to those that prefer medium blends.  However, this particular blend is just right for me.  I highly recommend this blend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer light blends.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: I had received a Keurig coffee maker for the holidays and have been hooked since. I am not a real strong coffee person so this morning blend is perfect. Consistant in flavor. The only reason I gave it a four is once you buy the machine you are basically locked into buying the cups.. It does have the reusable pod tho. I believe the prices could come down. In the store the prices are outrageous, but on Amazom they are reasonable somewhat..

review/summary: Good everyday coffee
review/text: I have usually ordered my K-Cups direct from Green Mountain, but thought I'd try Amazon's larger package and subscribe/save. The box of 50 works out to about a month's supply of coffee for me, with drinking a couple of cups a day.<br /><br />The taste is good--it's not a strong coffee, for that you need something like Green Mountain Coffee's Extra Bold.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA30ZU">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold) K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers, 50-count</a><br /><br />It's not too heavy of a coffee, but none of the cups I have brewed have been the weak water that a few other reviews suffered from. Bad batches and bad quality control may be the issue.<br /><br />If you double-check the prices and get a good batch, it's a better than average cup of coffee.

review/text: I love this coffee.  I'm a fan of lighter roasts.  I like the lack of bitterness and higher caffeine that comes with them.  This one is my favorite.  For most K-Cups, even lighter roasts, I have to run the machine twice through one K-Cup to get a decent, not overly-strong, cup of coffee.  These come out perfect for me with one run.  I do tend to go through them more quickly because of that, but that's okay. The great coffee is worth it!

review/text: I knew there was something wrong when I opened the outer packaging from Amazon an it contained loose coffee grounds.  I found the Breakfast Blend box to be leaking the grounds.  When I opened it I found several of the K-cups had lids that were applied off-center, thus not sealing the K-cups and the grounds were spilling out.  I have used LOTS of K-cups and have NEVER seen this before.  Poor quality control by Green Mountain with this batch.  Shame on the folks at Amazon for packaging up a box that was obviously leaking it's goods.

review/summary: Love Green Mountain Breakfast Blend -- Great Coffee!!!!!
review/text: I just recently got my Keurig, and I've been trying the sample pack of coffee that came with it.  So far this is by far my favorite.  I nice mild coffee taste to enjoy in the morning or anytime.  I actually wish they made this coffee in a decaf version also so I could enjoy the great flavor of this one anytime!  I think this will be the main coffee in this house; I've tried some of the others and liked some of them more than others, but this is the runaway favorite.  I tend to put a good bit of cream and sugar in my coffee (can't stand it black!) but the nice flavor of this one comes through the cream and sugar.  (I've found that cream and sugar can't cover up the taste of coffee I don't like!)  I don't care for the bolder coffees at all (I don't feel like getting slapped in the face by my coffee in the morning!)<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to give this a try if you like a light roast coffee with a mild, pleasant taste in the morning -- you won't be disappointed!!!

review/text: What I received today in shipment is a joke! I have the product on the desk in front of me. I see 4 packages of Green Mountain Coffee..Breakfast Blend. The 4 packages arrived NOT in an outer box! The packages are held together with yellow strapping tape. ALL 4 packages are ripped open in one way or another. One package has the bottom ripped off almost entirely and several coffee pods are missing. This disaster of shipping  was sitting out on my front porch in 95+ heat on a very humid Texas day. Mice, giant tree cockroaches, or kitties could have been prowling around inside the boxes. I can't believe UPS even accepted such a crappy packaging attempt. PLUS...I tried to find this Mike's Grocer online. The address on the return slip is 7 Prospect ST APT #4....an APARTMENT???? How do I even know where in the heck these pods originated? I LOVE Amazon and buy almost everything from them. This is my first REALLY horrible experience. Amazon....please get rid of this retailer!!!!!! Brenda Spurlin

review/summary: Not the best, but CERTAINLY, not the worst!
review/text: This is a breakfast blend coffee and, for many coffee producers, a breakfast blend also means "the strongest daggone brew we can make" mentality.  Well, caffeine is caffeine and this guy is a bit strong for me.  I prefer Caribou's breakfast blend over this Green Mountain version. It's just entirely more smooth, no bitterness at all, and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I think this one tastes a bit burnt, like Starbuck's, not at all as nice as some of their other blends (especially the pumpkin spice - awesome!).  Try it to see if it suits your taste but get the 12-pack first.  Otherwise, if you think the way I do, 24 of these guys is a LOT of coffee to wash down!

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: When I bought my coffeemaker, tried out several different brands and types of coffee but this one has become a stable.  I can count on it for a great cup of coffee - not too strong or too mild, just the way I like it.  Unfortuantely, I now drink more coffee than I probably should because of the taste but that's the only downside.

review/summary: Brown Water
review/text: I have this coffee in the past and really enjoyed it. However this one I received was so weak that neither my sister-in-law or I could drink it. It was left for my mother who likes weak coffee. It feels like it's only half full so it may have been a bad box. Like I said I've really enjoyed it the past when I've purchased it at the grocery store.

review/summary: Smaller than expected, but still good
review/text: Purchased this because of the special offer from Amazon (4-for-3.)  When I received them in the mail, I was surprised at how small they were.  Each sliver seems to be about 1/3 the size of the pig ears I used to buy.  But each bag weighs a bit over 16 oz / 1 lb (bag included, I'm guessing about 14-15 oz of actual ears.)  So compared to what I used to buy at Wal-Mart, this is a pretty good discount.<br /><br />Oh, and the dog (terrier) seems to like them alright - and I'm pretty sure that's what actually matters.
