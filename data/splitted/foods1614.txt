review/summary: AWESOME
review/text: Earthborn makes an AWESOME dog food.  I started my black lab on Primitive Naturals by Earthborn.  It was great for a year or so, but he needed additional fiber for the ideal stools...They came out w/ the Great Plains formula recently and I did the math finding that it has slightly higher fiber.  Now he's on a grain free, highly rated food that I can by locally for about $50!  I'm thrilled and will stick w/ this food for as long as he does well on it and it's avail.  Compare the ingredients to Taste Of The Wild but remember you'll get higher calories in the Earthborn which means feeding less volume.  Hope this helps!!

review/summary: Best Instant Iced Tea Ever!
review/text: I don't know when I first tried this powdered iced tea mix.  I have never liked iced tea, and I never expected AriZona brand to change my opinion.  I was pleasantly surprised and happy to be wrong!  This tea really wowed me, and I have been drinking it for years now.  It hasn't been available locally for several years, and I have been buying it directly from the AriZona web site until I saw it on Amazon.  Amazon has a much better price, and with PRIME shipping I have it in two days, so I'll never run out!  If you love iced tea (and even if you don't) I highly recommend giving this a try.

review/summary: I LOVE THIS!!!!
review/text: Oh Arizona ... I used to weigh 315 pounds, wore a size 48 waist, 3XL shirt, had diabetes, slept with a sleep apnea machine, took diabetic medicine (metformin and glucofage), took trazadone to help me sleep, gabapentin (pain medication for my knees) had high blood pressure and took medicine for it. I drank nothing but sodas and ate crap all my life. At age 39 I decided I wanted to be "Fit by 40." I started May 13, 2010 and my goal was to be healthy by the time I reached 40 on March 14, 2011. I stopped drinking soda and eating crap. I started exercising and drinking water, but plain water wasn't doing it for me. I tried all sorts of different drinks until I found Arizona Sugar Free Lemon Iced Tea. One sip and I honestly fell in love with it. I started buying it at my local Publix and Kroger, but couldn't get anymore as they said it was discontinued! I cringed at the thought of drinking other stuff. Blech. I finally contacted the Arizona company and they told me about Amazon's service. I quickly signed up for it and every month, I get a 4 pack (24 tubs) of this yumminess! OMG. I love Arizona and Amazon.<br /><br />One taste and you will love this stuff. And if not, email me and I will buy the rest from you! :)<br /><br />BTW - today is April 20, 2010 ... My 40th birthday was 5 weeks ago. I now weigh in at 186 pounds, wear a size 32 pants and medium/large shirt, sold my sleep apnea machine, dumped all my other meds and I only take vitamins in the morning! ! I feel healthy as a horse!

review/text: I used to drink Crystal Light teas, but started to do extensive research on Aspartame. I can always tell when I have consumed anything with aspartame in it. My diabetic neuropathy worsens, and my hands actually fall asleep on me! Look up aspartame poisoning if you don't believe me. There are only 2 brands of tea out there without it... 4C and Arizona. My local Publix (South Florida - Hollywood/Ft. Laud area) sometimes carries it and sometimes does not! Amazon is my answer - I order cases at a time!

One day I had a brainstorm and checked out Amazon.com and there it was, and even cheaper than what we'd been paying for it in the store!

review/text: The tea mix was first given to me by my daughter.  It was easy to mix and most enjoyable to drink.  I gave half of my order to my Pastor for his enjoyment.  Heretofore, I bought the large one gallon containers at the grocery Store.  this meant loading them in the car, carrying them home, storing them for use between trips to the store.  These mix tubs are so convenient for both home and to carry to family gatherings and picnics.  The taste is just the right mixture of tea and lemon. It is most appreciated.

review/summary: Too sweet!!
review/text: I just made my first pitcher of this sugar-free mix and was very disappointed, especially after reading all the rave reviews.  I suppose the tea part of this mix is fine, but to me, it is overwhelmed by the cloying sweetness of the Splenda artificial sweetener. There is a faint lemon taste too, but not enough tartness to compensate for all the sweetness.  So, if you love VERY sweet iced tea and want to avoid the calories of sugar, then you'll probably like this tea mix. The taste of Splenda (Sucralose) is better than that of NutraSweet (aspartame), but avoiding both of them is probably healthier. So, I think I'll now try the Twinings English Classic Cold-brewed Tea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028GWGYW">Twinings English Classic Cold Brewed Tea, 20-Count Packages (Pack of 6)</a> and just add my own lemon and a dash of sugar.

review/summary: There Must Be Some Secret Ingredient....
review/text: These are far and away my cats favorite treats.  I don't get it.  Supposedly, it's 100% freeze dried chicken and nothing more.  Explain to me then.... why do my cats prefer to eat these rather than a can of wet cat food made up of pretty much just shredded chicken?  These things smell pretty good (if you like the smell of chicken, that is), but that look about as fun to eat as cardboard.  I don't get it.<br /><br />Don't bother with any of the other flavors besides the chicken -- my cats think the shrimp and the liver pieces are toys to bat around until they end up under the refrigerator.  But they go absolutely bonkers for the chicken.<br /><br />Oh, and buy a bigger size if you can.  .60 ounces goes pretty fast.

review/text: Gave my 1 year old cat a small piece from the bag.  She smelled it for about 2 seconds and proceeded to wolf it down and quickly ask for seconds.  After obliging that request with a large piece, she went nuts. Aggressively licked my fingers of any and all residue, and is currently alternating between meowing, jumping all over me and sniffing the bag.  Was almost startling how she instantly took to the stuff.  Kitty crack for sure.  Picked up the small bag from Petco, but will definitely order a decent amount from Amazon.

She LOVES them and no throw up either.  I giver her about 3-4 little peices at a time and she gobbles them up.  All it takes is a shake of the bag to get her out from the corner or under the bed/couch!  Gotta buy more while it's still 2 bucks....

One of them had one kind of treat she liked, but it was really hard to find- this was yet another attempt to get her interested in an easier find.  Oh, how she loves them- and now my male cat is all over them too, in fact they know they are only going to get it at bedtime, and they stalk me all evening trying to figure out how to get me to go up to bed so they can get their stupid treat!  The whole time I am getting ready for bed, they are staring at me with unblinking eyes, trying to telepathically command me to the treat box... as though I didn't already know what they wanted.  It's almost scary, but once they have it they are all love and purrs.  Until it's gone... then they hang around just in case I am taken with a sudden desire to jump out of bed and give them seconds.  Because you just never know.

review/summary: Pretty Lame Chewing Gum
review/text: Eclipse is a rather lame sugarless gum and has a rather rubbery consistency.  I have chewed through several packs of different Eclipse flavors and this gum just doesn't do it for me.  The pieces are kind of small so I chew two at a time and the flavor lasts all of  five seconds leaving you with just this rubbery, not very fun to chew gum in your mouth.<br /><br />The Peppermint flavor is pretty tasty at first but the flavor disappears pretty fast.  The only very, very minor advantage to this flavor of Eclipse over others is that the hint (very, very minor hint) of Peppermint stays with the gum for awhile.<br /><br />I probably will try other brands of sugarless gum.  Eclipse just doesn't do it for me.

review/summary: If you must drink bottled tea...
review/text: ...then you could do A LOT worse than Ito En's Golden Oolong tea. Most of the sugary, over processed stuff out there is awful, and not all that good for you. I usually drink self-brewed, loose-leaf teas, but I gave this a shot when I encountered it by chanced in a grocery store. Unsweetened is a big plus, and I am a fan oolong teas. To my surprise it's quite good for what it is.<br /><br />I lived on Okinawa as a teenager, and bottled oolong tea I purchased on the local economy was what started my appreciation of various kinds of tea. I'm willing to wager that Ito En's Oolong was the one that began it all. It has a mellow ta flavor with subtle hints of fruit and honey. Very soothing and refreshing. It will not replace fresh brewed tea as my daily drink, but in a pinch and for convenience, I will certainly be getting more of this.

review/summary: Ito En Golden Oolong Tea is phenomenal!
review/text: My husband discovered Ito En Golden Oolong Tea at our favorite Sushi bar, and no other tea can match it's wonderful subtle flavors.  This tea is a faboulous blended tea that is refreshing and great with meals or just to drink.  I enjoy  sweetening it with a packet of Truvia, chilling it, and having it as a snack in the afternoons.  I highly reccommend this product.  Golden Oolong takes tea to new level of smoothness and is unique ~ green tea lovers will really appreciate this tea.

review/text: Oolong tea contains polyphenol which suppresses the absorption of fat and promotes breaking down the fat.  Because of the function, the drink is welcomed for a slimming diet. Keeping cold, this unsweetened drink is very refreshing on a very hot day to quench your thirst.  It is also delicious to drink with room temperature to quench thirsts on any weather.

review/summary: Not as good as expected, but not bad
review/text: I had read someone else raving about this tea so I thought I would give it a shot. It's not quite what I expected: I thought it might be similar to a good Thai Tea in terms of quality, but with a different taste. Instead, it tastes more like a higher quality Lipton tea. Not bad, it would probably make some great iced tea, but just not the top-quality that I usually prefer; I guess I will stick to Hibiscus for the flavor of the region for now.

review/summary: INEXPENSIVE NYLON GROCERY BAGS
review/text: Waste-Less bags are very fashionable and useful.  They are also at least 2x bigger than the other nylon bags I have tried, including Chicobags.  You can fit so much stuff in one Waste-Less bag!  At $20 for 6 bags, these are the least expensive foldable nylon bags on the market, but they are not as durable as Baggu or Envirosax bags.  The ones I have been using for about 6 months show signs of wear including ripped seams.  If you plan to use these bags every week for groceries, I recommend Envirosax instead.<br /><br />Waste-Less vs. Baggu vs. Envirosax<br /><br />Price:  Waste-Less<br />Size (open): All about the same<br />Size (closed): Waste-Less (thinnest)<br />Durability:  Baggu and Envirosax<br />Shoulder:  Waste-Less and Envirosax<br />Stacking Containers: Baggu<br />Print selection: Envirosax<br />My Favorite:  Envirosax

review/summary: LOVE THESE -- my favorite reusables so far.
review/text: Bought these to supplement my growing supply of reusables....I have many of the freebie, typical fold-up, boxy, grocery bags from various stores, but they aren't washable, so I have been looking for alternatives.  These Waste-less bags are, so far, my favorite.  I also have some flip and tumble reusable bags, which are also GREAT, but don't hold quite as much as these -- though I prefer the longer handles on the Flip and Tumble bags, the handles on the Waste-less Bags are sufficient to sling over my shoulder as long as they aren't filled to capacity.  The fabric is light-weight but strong, and they conveniently fold up, literally, to pocket size with a nice little velcro strap to secure them.  I keep a couple in my purse and also in my diaper bag...wouldn't leave home without them.  For an idea of size and capacity -- I fit 5 boxes of frozen waffles and a 3 lb. bag of fruit in a single bag today.  LOVE these.  The price is right, so why not?<br /><br />Update, post washing (2/15/11):<br />OK, what started off as a 5 star review has to drop to a 4.  I just washed one of the black and one of the magenta bags for the first time after they fell in a puddle of mud in my garage.  They washed completely clean and remain as functional as ever, but the green design on the black bag COMPLETELY disappeared in the wash.  Well, to say it "disappeared" is not entirely correct.  It showed up on the rest of my laundry as little green flecks and pieces.  Shoot.  Ah well, nothing's perfect...and like I said, I still love these for the functionality. It's the cheap decorating that loses them a star.

review/text: I've purchased reusable bags in the past but would inevitably leave them at home when I went grocery shopping. These bags roll up to a very small size and can be kept in my purse all the time. As far as unrolled size goes, they're roughly twice the size of a regular plastic bag you get at the grocery store. They're durable, colorful, and definitely get the job done.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: These are great bags. I've owned them since March 2010 and have used them every week since then on my grocery shopping trips.<br />  They are surprisingly sturdy and hold a LOT. I can fit 3 or 4 large bottles of juice in one bag (3 is about all I can lift though!) The straps are long enough that you can put them over your shoulder to carry them. I've gotten so many compliments on the capacity and strength of these bags from various checkout clerks, and I imagine they see a lot of different bags!<br />  I do not bother to squish them all up as that is a little time consuming. I just hang them on a hook in my closet. I own six bags (one six pack), and this is usually the perfect amount for my family of 2, sometimes 3 people.<br />  The only thing I do not recommend these for is raw meat as you could have a leak and spread bacteria if not washed correctly. I use one of the store bags for any raw meat products.<br />  I highly recommend these wonderfully sturdy, not too expensive bags.

review/summary: great for grocery shopping
review/text: These bags are perfect for shopping - partly because they fold up so small for storage. They are easy to keep in the car and toss in your purse or pocket on the way into the grocery. Then you just put them on the grocery belt for the bagger to use as your groceries are packed. In the past, I had a hard time remembering to take my cloth bags into the store with me. These bags are so small when folded that you take them in the store - and if you don't use them all, they can be put into the bags with the rest of the groceries. And they are sturdy enough to carry in the groceries once you get home. These are the best and most convenient bags I've found to help eliminate all the plastic bag waste.

I haven't been using them long so I can't attest to long term durability, but they have held a lot with heavy things in them just fine. They have also been comfortable to carry while carrying heavy loads. My son also likes to run around the house like a made man shaking them violently.

I can usually fit a gallon of milk, some canned goods and veggies in just one bag. They appear to be durable, but I've only had them about a week. If they break easily, I'll come back and edit the review.<br />*ONE TIP<br />DON'T buy them using the "subscription" service. I did, to save a few dollars, and it took 3 weeks to get them! (not exaggerating). I usually have amazon prime shipping, so 3 weeks seemed ridiculously long. If I had known, I would have spend the extra dollars and gotten them much sooner.

review/summary: Designs peeled off -- looked horrid
review/text: When I got the bags, I threw them in the washer for an initial wash, since I plan to use them for groceries. When they came out of the wash, 3 of the 6 bags had their designs peeling off. They looked horrid. Kind of like they were leprous or something. The other 3 bags were still fine, so I hung those out to dry while trying to figure out what to do with the 3 bags that were failing.<br /><br />I tried just peeling the rest of the design off by hand, but that was just making a mess and was taking forever. Plus, a couple areas of the design were still stuck on.  Eventually, I came up with the brilliant idea of tossing the bags back in the washer to see if a second washing, this time with hot water, would remove the rest of the design.<br /><br />Well, after trying a few different things, I ended up just tossing the 3 bags with peeling designs. They were making a mess and looked absolutely awful, so there was no way I was going to use them.<br /><br />Very disappointed with the product. I'm afraid to use the other 3 bags, because I'm guessing they'll end up the same way soon. Poor quality. I'd rather not have any design than have one that peels...

review/summary: Fantastic product but make some new designs already
review/text: These are the best bags ever but the company needs to seriously get to work on adding some neutral colors and designs. I'd buy them for everyone I know, but not pink with gold peace signs.<br /><br />I've had a set of these bags I got from Amazon a long while ago when the maker was still producing other designs -- mine are black with green leaves on them. They are the best reusable bags out there. They hold a ton of stuff. They'll easily hold more than a dozen large dog food cans or three 2-liter soda bottles. You can tie and untie the straps together very easily. The straps are long enough to comfortably carry the bags on your shoulder. There's a little loop on them so they'll hook to the plastic bag rack at the grocery store so they can be filled easily.<br /><br />The sewn-on Velcro straps are fantastic -- way, way better than dealing with fussy little pouches the alternatives come in. They roll back up in seconds and the Velcro straps hold them into tiny little bundles. They're lightweight. I carry them with me everywhere I go and use them for all of my shopping. They hold up really well and are easy to clean in the washer and dryer -- I just toss them in with everything else. I've washed them over and over and over and they're still strong and in great shape.<br /><br />Every time I pull them out of my purse, everyone comments on them and asks where I got them. I always say, "I got them at Amazon, but there's something wrong with the manufacturer because they've only had these funky pink peace sign designs available for a really long time."<br /><br />If you're not bothered by pink peace signs, you'll love these bags.<br /><br />I also got the little white mesh, draw-string bags Amazon features as the "buy together" and they're great too. I use them for produce and lunch bags.

I've used it a number of time and it seemed to be holding up fine. I haven't used it for very heavy things yet though. I would buy them again, but would be a little cautious about the quality. Though for the price and style it is worth it.

review/text: I received these as a gift last Christmas so I've been using them often for the past year. They have held up well and can hold a lot. I use these for mall and department store sort of shopping and get compliments often as I pull them out of my purse. I have not used them for groceries as I choose to use the flat-bottom ones instead...just a personal choice. They do roll up small, though it took me a little bit to figure out how to roll them up again. I fold 2/5, then 1/5 the other way, then in 1/2 to get the velcro tab to line up. But you'll get the hang of it quickly! If you've looked at other brands, you'll see these are a good deal for 6 bags. I'd buy them again and acutally plan on buying more for gifts this year.

review/text: Very happy with these bags!  I went with these because I wanted a bag I could put on my shoulder, and I am very happy with the quality of construction, the size (you really can stuff these) and the light weight of the material (they are so easy to stuff in your purse or glove box that you actually don't forget to use them).  I highly recommend these!

review/summary: Excellent Alternative To Milk - Vaniilla Nice Change From Plain...But The Shipping Charge - YIKES!
review/text: Westsoy brand soy milk(in choices of Plain and Vanilla) is one of the only brands so far,that I have found that has an unsweetened choice in other flavors than plain - they even have a chocolate unsweetened but it's hard to find.If you have a Trader Joe's market near you, you may also find their own brand in the unsweetened variety.I try to stay away from sugar and dairy products is a thing of the past for me.I started using this several years ago. I have found that almost anything I used with milk, I can use this instead. The only time I prefer milk is in my coffee, and even then I use "Lactaid", which is a lactose free milk. Coffee-wise, I just like the creamier consistency better and also the soy milk seems to break up in hot coffee.<br /><br />I use Soymilk in my cereal, both hot and cold, and it's a wonderful replacement for milk or ice cream when used in a smoothie, with some ice and fruit(or any flavor you want to add.) Works great as a glass of soy with any meal.A refreshing taste, that, after a while you may even think is better than milk. The Vanilla, which is naturally flavored, gives just a hint of flavor to make it a little different then the plain for a little variety. But the Plain is good too.<br /><br />It's a a great source of Protein, with 9 grm. per 8 oz. serving,and 46 mg isoflavones, it also supplies 4% calcium and 10% iron in each serving. Ingredients are Organic Soymilk(filtered water, whole Organic Soybeans),Natural Vanilla Flavor With Other Natural Flavors. Per serving it supplies 100 calories, 4.5g Fat, 0.5saturated fat, 0 g of trans, 2.5 polyunsat fat,1g monosat fat. NO cholesterol(this is always a big plus for me),30mg sodium 300 mg potassium, 4 gr dietary fiber and 1g sugars (not added but coming from the ingredients). The only thing it lacks is the Vit D that is added to milk, so you may have to check around and find another source for that of something you like.<br /><br />Packaged in a slim 32 0z. box, with an easy pour recloseable spout, it has a long shelf life, and should be refrigerated once it's open, at which point it is usually good for about a week to 10 days. The price is about the same, give a take a few cents, as it is at my neighborhood grocery store...BUT-The shipping is so high, this is one product I would not recommend to buy on line. Maybe Amazon will eventually have a multi-pack site with the free shipping option. If anyone has come across such a site please leave a comment on my review - or if I come across one I will edit with the info-thanks!<br /><br />For dairy free diets, Westsoy is a good, healthy choice.<br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy....Laurie

review/summary: Wonderful chocolate!
review/text: I usually am a dark chocolate fan, but while in France a couple of years ago I said I wanted to make sure we had some good chocolate while we were there. We went into a small grocery store and bought bars and bars of Milka chocolate and brought them home. I went to Walgreens a week or so later at home and there on the shelves? Milka! So happy! Then, I found it at Target. Yay! I told my sister about it and let her try it. She found it at Walmart in a small town in Nebraska! You can't go wrong with this chocolate. Really, it is so much better than most chocolates you can buy in the states. Although I do like the plain Milka, the hazelnut is oh-so-wonderful and a bit addictive. It has made a self-proclaimed dark chocolate lover into a milk chocolate lover.

review/summary: Hazelnut Milka is Tasty
review/text: Milka and its famous purple cow, recently purchased by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries. With hazelnut, the crunch and flavor has a pleasant exotic texture.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is not subtle. For me, this is a good thing, and, as a result, I can devour two bars faster than I should.<br /><br />Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate, although they also make varieties which include yogurt, nuts and a version with Oreo Cookies. Buy a case of the hazelnut Milka and enjoy!<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, http://HungarianBookstore.com

review/summary: I was impressed
review/text: I tried this on a recommendation of a friend from work.  Well, I can honestly say that I am so happy I took her advice.  While I guess I knew people could have parasites I just never thought about the fact that I might have them.<br /><br />Well after taking this for two cleansing periods (each ten days) I can tell you that I have much more energy than before and I just plain feel better.  In the past I would frequently have stomach pain and sometimes diarrhea.  In my mind I always thought this was because of my diet or stress levels at work.  Right after I finished the first bottle I realized that this was not happening near as often as before.<br /><br />I would also get a small cold sore in the corner of my mouth at times.  It happened so frequently that I would keep a tube of Abreva at work and at home.  The cold sore has not come back since I finished the first bottle.  People have also commented that my skin looks healthier.  One of the younger women in my office even asked me if I had changed my face cream or been to the spa for a facial.  That really blew me away.  I would never have thought that a parasite could cause a cold sore or make you skin look more aged, but I guess it can.<br /><br />When I was taking the pills I did have times when I would have bad smelling gas and a somewhat uncomfortable feeling before having a bowel movement, but neither problem was very bad.  A couple of times I felt nauseous too.  Maybe this was when the parasites, worms or whatever dying in my system?  But none of the problems were very bad and definitely not bad enough to make me sorry I took the cleanse.  I am really impressed and happy my friend recommended this to me.

review/summary: Bloated Feeling Is Gone
review/text: I have been having stomach problems for the last six months.  Not the kind of problems that would send you the doctor just alot of feeling bloated and uncomfortable.  After taking this for just the first five days I felt like a fog had lifted from around my body.  I feel more alert, the bloated feeling is gone, and my energy level is noticeably increased.  Towards the end of the ten days I did appear to pass something that looked like worms.  I know its gross to talk about looking at that, but it is even more gross thinking about worms living and feeding inside your body.  I have since learned that even though the worms seemed to pass when I went to the bathroom, there may still be eggs in my digestive system waiting to hatch.  Like others I plan on doing this again just to make sure.

Not only do I have much more physical engery I am also more alert.  I guess when you think about it it really makes sense.  Over time our bodies must get exposed to more parasites than we can imagine.  I really feel like this has given them a knock out punch.  It also helped that there was a list of which foods to eat and which to avoid while doing the cleanse.

review/summary: A robust flavor that satisfies in winter (skip the store-bought tomatoes)
review/text: We live in a climate that produces mouth-watering tomatoes only in summer. Tired of buying store-bought tomatoes that (barely) ripen en route to our state, we decided to give dried tomatoes a try.<br /><br />The intense flavor takes some practice. A little goes a long way. We learned that it takes approximately 20 pounds of fresh tomatoes to make one pound of sun-dried tomatoes.<br /><br />Here is a recipe (I can't post direct links) using sun-dried tomatoes:<br /><br />Baked Salmon Fillets<br /><br />Cooking time: 20 minutes; Serves: 4<br /><br />4 - 6 oz.-each salmon fillets<br />14 oz. tin artichoke hearts, drained and quartered<br />1/2 cup whole black olives<br />1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes<br />3-4 garlic cloves, sliced<br />2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil<br />splash of lemon juice and white wine<br />salt and pepper<br />2 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley<br /><br />Preheat oven to 425F. Arrange salmon in a baking dish. Surround with artichokes, olives, tomatoes and garlic. Drizzle with olive oil, lemon juice and wine, and then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake 15-20 minutes or until fish is cooked through. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.<br /><br />Before our Amazon purchase, we weren't familiar with the Roland brand. We purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7JAU">Roland Sun-Ripened Dried Tomatoes, 2-pound bags (2)</a> along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V1Z29C">Roland Premium Modena Balsamic Vinegar, 5-Liter Pouch</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7IRO">Roland Flat Seasoned Cuttlefish</a> to take advantage of an Amazon sale of Roland products.<br /><br />In summary, while nothing beats vine-ripened fresh tomatoes in the summer, Roland Sun-Ripened Dried Tomatoes bring a robust flavor that satisfies in winter. Additionally, sun-dried tomatoes are a good source of vitamin C, lycopene and antioxidants.

review/text: I highly recommend that you do not purchase these sun dried tomatoes. I had previously only tried sun dried tomatoes that were packed in oil and I love those. I thought this seemed like a great deal since you get so many tomatoes for such a low price. Too good to be true. I knew these were going to be bad as soon as I opened the box. All the tomatoes are brown and black and obviously burned beyond recognition (I'll post a photo). They are so dry and tough that they are impossible to eat. I tried soaking them in oil and in hot water, but no luck. Still as tough as ever. Even if you can manage to eat it, all you get is the burned taste. Doesn't taste like tomatoes at all. I don't know what I'll be doing with my remaining 3.9 lbs of these, but I certainly won't be eating them.

review/summary: May be extracted with hexane
review/text: As a note to anyone buying this product - I emailed Watkins to ask about how the product is processed and received the following reply: "Watkins Original Grapeseed Oil 12.7 Fl. Oz is processed with hexane." After researching hexane extraction, there may still be slight traces of hexane in this product (as in any hexane processed product). Hexane is banned or restricted in the European Union for Cosmetics and the Deep Skin Cosmetics Database states research shows there may be toxicity problems. Just a note to those looking to buy that this may not be all natural (common problem for most grapeseed oils).

review/summary: Wonderful tea! Tasty, many health benefits and naturally caffeine free.
review/text: I l0ve Tulsi tea! This is the very same brand I used when we lived in India, which is where it is imported from. I am SO happy to find it here in the States!! Tulsi, also known as "holy basil" is a delicious herb, related to the basil plant, but tastes more along the lines of mint. It is an antioxidant, and a powerful tea to detox, or just to relax. Plus it tastes great. No caffeine, so drink it day or night.

review/summary: Delicious Organic Tea!
review/text: I tried this tea for the first time three days ago and have used 2/3 of the box already.  It is a delicious tea to drink any time of the day.  My daughter and I are very pleased we discovered this product and will be drinking it regularly from now on.  It has a very pleasant taste with a very subtle hint of mint.  I do not care for mint tea; however, I love this tea!  This tea is great for reducing stress and energizing.  I wish Amazon sold it with free shipping.  5+ stars!

review/summary: one of the best - from a tea connoisseur
review/text: I'm an avid tea fan, and I like a good solid black tea.  I'll drink an occasional herb tea, and I'm aware of all the healthy reasons why one should drink herbal tissanes, but I still enjoy my black tea.  That's where this tea comes in.  It's a nice hearty breakfast black, but as is their signature, it also contains holy basil, with all it's wonderful health benefits.  Now it doesn't taste overly herbal at all.  It's a nice blend, and it handles sweetener (honey is my choice) and milk or creamer well (I use a good soy creamer...).  And it's organic!  I'll take that everywhere I can.  And the tea is harvested consciously! YAY!  This is a feel good all around tea!
