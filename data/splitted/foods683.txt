review/text: I ordered this product for my daughter who LOVES it! We had bought this product at Sam's Club in the past in a larger can, but they have not had it since. So when I found out I could order it online I bought several cans. My daughter drinks at least 1 cup a day of Chai, usually at night after a long day at school or when it is chilly. It is especially nice on rainy days, that chill to the bone, it really warms you up!<br /><br />She always drinks it warm but I have heard it was good over ice as well.

review/summary: Tastes good, but.....
review/text: The reason I gave this only 2 stars is not because of the taste. It tastes great! I actually had this at a restaurant for the first time, which is what prompted me to find it online and buy it.<br /><br />But, almost every ingredient is artificial. Hardly anything about this product is something I would willingly put into my body on a regular basis. It's a powdery mix when you open it and pour one scoup into a cup of hot water. It makes you wonder where the tea actually is.<br /><br />I don't recommend this highly processed, chemically manufactured, mostly artificial ingredients, product to anyone. Unless you just don't care what you put into your bodies and just want it for the taste.

review/summary: Starbucks vs Mocafe
review/text: I love the Chai latte @ Starbucks.  Since I couldn't find that at a reasonable price in Amazon, I chose to try Mocafe Divinity Spice Chai mix.  To my surprise, it came out really very well.  The Starbucks chai and this one are totally different things.  Both taste good in their own fashion.  Starbucks chai seems watery but this one is the thickest you will ever get.  Mocafe is highly creamy all the way down but Starbucks is not.  This is a powdery product, Starbucks is liquid product.<br />Again, I seem to love Mocafe even though I am a big fan of Starbucks Chai.  I highly recommend this to all the Chai lovers out there.<br />Note: This had a price advantage over starbucks chai when I initially bought.  But I later found that Costco is selling Starbucks chai at a very cheaper price.

review/text: Paid over $4.00 for a cup of this at a coffee shop in town.  After raving about how delicious it was (and thinking of how I was going to need to come back...soon...for another cup) the owner told me it was MOCAFE.  She mixes equal parts of the spice and the vanilla chi tea mix and wow--it is amazing.  I was so happy to see Amazon has both flavors!  I buy them both, dump them together in a container and mix well.  Then I spoon back into the tin (I also put into jars and gave as Christmas gifts...well received!) and enjoy!  The only thing I add is a puff of whipped cream on the top of the mug.  Now if only they made a sugar free version....

review/summary: Tea-licious!
review/text: I enjoy drinking all types of tea, in loose and bagged forms, but this tea is a delight to drink.  It is a chai tea mix with the spice, sugar and milk already added so all you have to do is add hot water.  It tastes great cold as well and though it already has the added milk, I sometimes add a touch of coconut milk to it to give the 'spice' of it a little more exotic taste. Yet no matter how you may want to serve it, this all-in-one drink is a taste-tea, tea-licious treat!

A great beverage for coffee drinkers and non-coffee drinkers like myself.

review/text: I am not a big coffee drinker, but several years ago someone turned me on to the chai tea latte at Starbucks.  During the winter, I tend to treat myself to a tall chai a couple days a week, which can really add up!  My sister bought me a tin of the Precious Divinity Spiced Chai Mix for my Christmas stocking this year and I LOVE IT!  It has a nice, mild, sweet flavor.  I just ordered a four pack of the tins for myself, and I keep one at work so I can enjoy a hot, caffienated drink in the morning.  Each serving is fairly small, but even if you make a double, you're still paying a lot less than you would at Starbucks. Very good stuff!

review/text: I originally purchased this Chai tea at Sam's and fell in love with it however, Sam's quit selling it at their stores.  I got online and found that Amazon.com sold it.  I was in love all over again!  I serve it with milk instead of water and put a little hazelnut syrup in it as well.  To top it off, I put whipped cream on top with a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar.  By this point, the tea has now become a decadent dessert instead of a hot tea.  Thanks to Amazon.com I received my tea in record time and the product was in perfect condition!  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the containers held a little more product.  Other than that, I love, love, love it!

review/summary: Deboles is good pasta
review/text: Just because of the bad review based on packaging above let me say Deboles makes top of the line pasta and we are extremely lucky to get the deals we do from amazon. You can pay double or triple the price in any store that sells this pasta. The recipe for their Jerusalem Artichoke pasta is the same for all types afaik so I would direct you to reviews of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0JOSO">De Boles Pasta Organic Artichoke Fettuccine, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. To that I can only add that with regular semolina pasta it took about double the amount to fill me up as the Deboles Jerusalem Artichoke which stands to reason because it's got 2x the protein. Just be advised with this deal (2.40/lb is a great deal) you'll want a tub or some kind of jar (2 gallons will do) to hold 10lbs of pasta.

review/text: I took an oath, no more kettle chips...rice chips are good, not great. These pretzel chips are super crunchy but not hard on your teeth like some fancy brands I cant name that make their pretzels more like something the dog would love to chomp on. Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps are crunchy from being well toasted and thin, then sprinkled with caraway, sesame, poppy and salt; I think there's a pinch of other spices, but its so mild we used them for dipping.<br />They are darn delicious.

review/summary: Good pu-erh, worth trying
review/text: I discovered and got hooked onto pu-erh during a recent trip to China and have only had the teabag variety thus far. Among the 3 brands I have tried thus far, one store bought, one an international brand, this is the best tasting pu-erh in a bag I have found.  I intend to try couple other brands available on Amazon.com or if I see in any of the local Asian grocery stores.<br />One thing that could be better about this brand is the bag around the tea bag, which is a bit hard to open (even though it has the guide slit). On the brigther side, each tea bag is individually wrapped in a 'plastic like' silver cover, which helps seal in the flavor very well.<br />Characteristics of this tea:<br />- 'fishy' like smell when you first dunk into hot water (not overpowering or nasty by any means)<br />- steeps fully in about 4-5 minutes<br />- neither bitter like the stronger black teas nor mild like the greens.  perfectly balanced somewhere in-between.<br />- satisfying flavor, makes me feel good about drinking a cup of tea.<br />If you have not tried this brand, worth giving it a shot.  I typically drink 4-5 cups every week and will likely get a refill ordered soon, unless I find an even better pu-erh out there.  Giving it a 4 star rating since this is a good buy, and my reference point is limited at present.

review/summary: Dinner for Every Month
review/text: I got this Dinner of the Month Club pasta meal as a gift from a very special person back in CT where I used to live--I believe they are one of the leading gourmet presents companies nationwide.<br />The pasta is ready literally within 15 minutes--a quick meal is a good thing, especially for a single guy like me who doesn't have the time of day to cook complicated stuff--and not only that, it tastes excellent! (I added some parmesan cheese to the sauces that I got in my fridge and it made it even better). Honestly I wasn't expecting it to taste this good. As an Italian food fan, I was pretty satisfied with this gift. If you don't want to leave the house or what to stay home to watch the game, it's a perfect gift. Do I recommend their food and services? Absolutely! Giving gifts like these are a good idea for single people like me, so I am thinking returning the favor and sending these to some people I know for the upcoming holidays.

review/text: I recently joined the dinner of the month club and I am so glad I did! It may be the best gift I've ever given myself:) My entire family reaps the benefits because it is a treat for everyone, no matter age or gender. We always look forward to the arrival of a new and exciting pasta in the mail every month. We even have a tradition now in our house that we all cook dinner together on "pasta night" and enjoy a savory dish provided by the dinner club.<br />It is so easy to make an impressive dinner with dinner club because they even send recipes to go along with their noodles and sauces! I recently received the Vegan Pumpkin pasta fettuccine paired with the Butternut Squash with Parmesan Cheese. I also got the Italian Spice Linguini with the Organic Roasted Garlic sauce. Even just boiling the noodles warms your home with a delicious fragrance. Everything I have ever received from Flying Noodle has always been of the highest quality. I have friends over to play dominoes every Tuesday night and I always brag about my Flying Noodle packages. They have tried most of my dishes and always want to know where they can get the noodles and sauces at our local grocery store. There is just nothing like it that you can buy from the store, I have since gotten all of my domino friends on Flying Noodle- dinner of the month club.<br />I definitely know where to go to do my Christmas shopping this year! There is something for everyone and I know I can trust Flying Noodle to deliver the best quality of products to my loved ones.

I placed an order for it, and had the order randomly canceled by the company.  The seller was listed as ABC Wholesale, and it is now listed as RED TAG sale, even though it's the exact same item.  Buy it from another source, it's a great tea.  I personally think it works great in combination with other teas, my favorite is a combination of four bags of this tea and one bag of plum black tea to make a gallon pitcher, which tastes great both hot or cold.

That's not a bad thing; it's just not as sweet as I anticipated.  The bars looked a little small, but they're dense.  The density makes up for the size of the bars as far as being an effective snack, but I found them kind of hard to chew.  I might try other flavors by this brand, but I probably won't buy the wildberry flavor again.

She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.

review/summary: Safer than rawhide, don't last as long but also cleans teeth
review/text: I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.<br /><br />Over all I am quite satisfied with these "bones." They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had "doggy breath." I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath "fresh" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them.

review/summary: An easy addition to raw diets
review/text: Preference is an incomplete dog diet that is made complete by adding meat.  Preference is added with equal parts water and allowed to rehydrate for 5 to ten minutes.  Then you mix in meat an whatever else you feed your dog.  I usually mix it with a ground dog food from the butcher that contains ground beef, liver and heart.  I also throw in a couple of raw eggs and fish oil.  The dogs absolutely love it!  I've been feeding a raw diet for several years, and this product is a great supplement.  The chelated nutrients in Preference are more readily available for absorption in the digestive system, something that is hard to find in the vast majority of dog diets.  I don't feed Preference every day.  I make large batches, freeze in single serving sizes, and thaw them out for two meals per week.<br /><br />I also use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZG2J40">Urban Wolf Dog Food Mixer 3 lb Bag</a>, which is also an excellent product.  But what I love about Honest Kitchen is that they make their foods from human grade ingredients, most of which are sourced in the US.  After the scare with Chinese gluten poisoning so many pets a few years ago, I am careful about where my dogs' food comes from.  Note that many of the chicken/duck jerky treats are from China!<br /><br />Please note that this stuff STINKS while it's rehydrating -- I think it's the kelp or the alfalfa.  Once I add the meat, and it smells fine -- unless I add sardines!  I highly recommend using this product or a product like it if you're feeding a raw or otherwise grain-free diet.  Your dogs will thank you.

It really comes in handy when I am low on fresh produce or am running late and don't have time to wash and chop. I add it to her raw in the morning and with her grain free kibble or canned at dinner.

review/summary: Superb addition to a dog's daily diet
review/text: This Preference veggie mix has been an important addition to our dogs' daily meals for the past 2 years.  I first began using one of Honest Kitchen's other products, Thrive, when our youngest dog (still a pup) was diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia.  I chose to use a bunch of natural supplements/herbs to deal with his joint mobility/pain rather than twice-daily strong prescription meds that would destroy his liver.  It put him off his food though since he didn't care for the taste of some of the supplements; so I tried to add plenty of good-tasting, healthy additions to his kibble (Pure Vita) to encourage him to eat.  The "Thrive" dehydrated mix was convenient...meat and veggies together...and I still occasionally use it for that convenience when the dogs are being kenneled or kept by others.  For regular daily use though, I use the Preference veggie base and add my own chicken, turkey, salmon, or bison.  I find it a bit more economical to just add my own protein source since I go through quite a bit (2 dogs, and 1 is huge).  Another thing that I like about the Preference mix is that one of the first two ingredients is alfalfa which has been shown to help with joint inflammation...just what my big guy needs.<br /><br />I usually mix up enough for a couple days worth of meals and just keep it in the fridge.  I just scoop the appropriate amount into each dog's bowl and then mix in the supplements for each pooch.  I then stir in the meat and kibble along with salmon oil.  They love it and they're both doing great on it!

review/summary: Excellent mixer for anybody feeding a raw diet
review/text: Having recently moved here from Germany I was concerned to find a good mixer for the otherwise home prepared, raw food that I have been feeding since 2001. A Breeder friend of mine suggested the honest kitchen preference and I certainly did not look back. My dogs do very well on it and even tough the price appears high at first, buying all the ingredients seperately would be far more costly. Well done to the company for creating an excellent product that makes feeding a balanced raw diet much less complicated. I am very comfortable in advising my puppy buyers to use this product.

review/summary: Honey, yum....
review/text: Crunchy is the key word here.<br /><br />I purchased these snack bars because they don't contain the usual bugaboos: high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners, etc. However, they're mighty hard to chew. And that's *probably* a good thing.<br /><br />I'm a hardcore fan of Quaker Oats granola bars, because they're a quick snack and they're heavy-laden with sugar, but they also have the HFCS (bad, bad) and hydrogenated oils (bad, bad, BAD). However, they are easy to chew (probably because of the nice, soft plastics they contain). I am striving to slowly back away from the QO granola bars because of their unhealthy and lengthy ingredient list.<br /><br />The Kashi brand snacks are agreeable to the palate and they do have enough sugar for my personal tastes, but I have a couple crowns and I wonder if my over-priced prosthetic teeth can survive this healthy eating experience.<br /><br />That being said, these are the snacks of choice for long car trips. For one, I'll never pig out on them and two, they're good for the tummy. They provide a little energy boost and they're high octane fuel for this four-layer bio-suit we call a human body.<br /><br />I'm working my way through the different flavors. My favorites are the pumpkin spice and peanut butter, yet honestly, I can't discern an enormous difference between these three (pumpkin, PB and honey toasted).

review/text: I usually grab granola bars to keep me feeling "full" between meals, and today I decided to try Kashi's Honey Toasted 7 Grain.<br /><br />They are very crunchy. I prefer crunchy bars over the soft and gooey stuff, though. I really hate the soft chocolate drizzled bars from fiber one / fiber plus that taste excessively artificial.<br /><br />These bars taste absolutely fantastic. This probably won't be a bar that I buy to eat in between meals, as I ended up eating them INSTEAD of dinner. They're sweet, but not too sweet.<br /><br />To me, they are my second favorite granola bar, just under kashi's fruit and nut pumpkin bar.

review/text: My whole family likes these crunchy snacks.  They are good in the car, at work or wherever when rushing from school to sports practice.  They do tend to spill crumbs easily.  Of course after I bought a case of them, my daughter decided she liked chewy ones better, but she still eats them.  I was a bit disappointing at the price - once I did the math I realized that these can be gotten cheaper from the local supermarket.

review/summary: My favorite spicy Korean "instant" noodles
review/text: I quote the word "instant" because, to the uninitiated, it might come as a shock that you actually have to boil the noodles rather than simply soak them in boiling hot water.  The preparation time is still very quick, and it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />These noodles are far thicker and chewier than your standard supermarket Top Ramen noodles.  They also come with a spice package and a dry ingredients packet that contains bits of seaweed, mushrooms, and carrots.<br /><br />I usually only put in about 3/4 of the spice package and add extra ingredients like nappa cabbage, shrimp, scallops, green onions, mung bean sprouts, and/or an egg.  Kimchi also goes really well with these noodles.<br /><br />The bulk price that Amazon offers is an excellent deal, especially for people who don't have access to Asian supermarkets.  It's the perfect food to have for when you want a quick and flavorful meal.

review/summary: This food item fills a void inside me.
review/text: First of all, I must state that this is the tastiest pre-packaged soup known to mankind. The spice mixture is a delight to my taste buds. The noodles are better quality than most pre-packaged Ramyuns. The ease of cooking this is just what you would expect. It's simple and that is why I'm often inclined to make this a meal when I know that I shouldn't. I opt to live a little in these situations.<br /><br />Preparation is key. The soup by itself is probably a health hazard if you eat it each and every day. As others have mentioned, it has little to no nutrients of particular value for any diet, and high sodium content. However, when one adds a variety of meats and veggies, it could possibly be gourmet caliber soup.<br /><br />I particularly enjoy cubed pork tenderloin or shrimp, mixing that with the soup. Poaching an egg or two in this soup will make it better as well. As for veggies, green onion is a definite must have, along with shitake/portobello mushrooms (I like both), and I like to add broccoli. Many times, I'll add bean sprouts and cilantro, but those are truly optional in my opinion. However, a personal favorite of mine to add to this soup is fishcake. If you don't know what that is, don't let the name fool you. Go to your local Korean market and pick some up. It's sensational in this soup.<br /><br />As for the unhealthy aspect, simply use less of the packaged spice and you'll probably feel better about yourself. I use the whole thing myself, but I really don't eat these as much as I used to. Lastly, the soup without all the additional meats and veggies is still tasty, so it's not a necessity to add the extras - only recommended. I still must suggest that one poached egg be the bare minimum. Enjoy!

review/summary: One of my favorite ramen noodles I have tried to date
review/text: I don't claim to be a noodle connoisseur and you shouldn't read it as such.  I have tried a limited number of ramen noodles, and most of them don't taste that great to me.  Something about plain chicken flavor ramen noodles leaves me dead inside.  There is a long laundry list of foods I rather each than that dreadful Maruchan Chicken Noodle flavored soup that I grew up eating.  Which explains why I hate that brand so much.  Enter Shin Ramyun noodles.  My mother bought this years ago through her Korean co-workers.  Initially I hated it.  Then some time passed and I learned that you can modify the ramen noodles to your hearts desire.  Well that was a game changer for me.  I started off with a egg and some frozen vegetables and haven't looked back.  Nowadays when I am looking for something cheap and quick (But not necessarily healthy because honestly when has anything cheap and quick wins up healthy and taste good?  Yeah I though so) I use Shin Ramyun noodles as a base.  What I would do is this: boil the water till hot, add my protein (be it egg, shrimp, fish, etc), then add the freeze-dried vegetables, then add a small amount of the seasoning packet (or usually none at all), keep boiling till soft/cooked.  Then I would add my vegetables (frozen or fresh), let it cook for a while, then I would add my noodles last and turn off the stove and let it sit in the soup mixture for about two to five minutes.  I like my noodles firm so I always add my noodles last.  The worst thing in the world is mushy noodles.  Then I would add my hot sauce (either the Sriracha[sic] sauce or the Korean hot pepper paste) and if I am feeling fancy, I would add some radish top kimchi and I am in heaven.  Basically I learn to experiment to see what I liked.  You don't have to use the seasoning packet.  Heck I learned that folks add butter to the noodles and eat like that, which is different (read strange as h*ll) to me but as long as they are eating it, who cares.

If you want to avoid some of the sodium & fat don't eat all of the broth - focus on the noodles!  Add veg for more nutritional content ;)  Ramen is supposed to be quick and easy and cheap and filling, not a "superfood" - all ramen are really bad for you.  This one is one of the better ones taste-wise.  And no I'm not Korean - I'm actually Eastern European!

review/text: Nong Shim makes great ramen noodles.  This one has great flavor and the noodle is fairly thick and tasty.  However you need to add more water than the package suggested or it's going to be salty.  It's best to cook it in the pot with boiling water for 4 minutes and the noodle texture tastes different than my lazy ramen noodle mode (soak it in boiling water for 4 minutes).  Give it a try and their rest of the lineup (especially the udon bowl)!

review/summary: spicy udon nooodles
review/text: When I bought this, I didn't realize the noodles are different from Ramyun spicy picante.  Ramyun is the thinner yellow noodle and neoguri is the thicker white japanese udon noodle.  Unlike the kimchi flavor, this has enough spices to satisfy your craving and since I do not dislike udon noodles, I give it 4 stars.  But it is not as good as Ramyun picante and I give ramyun 5 stars.  My boyfriend is german / irish American and he loves these noodles...even this spicy neoguri.  I believe the fishy smell would be for the seafood flavoring.  This is for a 30 pack/case and there is a 20 pack/case which may be cheaper.  So if you still aren't sure, try a pack before you buy a case.

review/summary: Unpleasant aroma and taste. As another reviewer said "I just couldn't get past the smell". Salt & an odd SeaWeed flavor dominant
review/text: I'm a bit surprised how foul this soup smells and tastes. I doubt that many, unless their ethnic roots are Korean or similar, will find this soup pleasing. The taste is a bit odd, to say the very least. The actual taste is hard to describe but "seafood" is certainly not the word I'd use to describe this product. Seafood implies to me - either fish or shellfish. The closest I can come to an adequate description of this soup is it has the smell of drying seaweed and/or the aroma of fish food.<br /><br />As someone said in the comments section of this review: "I just couldn't get past the smell."<br /><br />Beyond the unusual seaweed flavor (which I obviously didn't like) --- there are only three other dominant tastes - a VERY heavy dose of salt, the bitterness of MSG and a lot of cayenne pepper. The noodles are essentially tasteless yet ladened with 500 calories of saturated fats. The MSG just adds to the unpleasant flavor notes. To be clear - this is a highly processed "food". In fact, very few of the soup's many ingredients are even recognizable as any type of food.<br /><br />HEALTH WATCH: While I'm not a health nut - this soup crosses even my very low bar for products that are better off avoided. One packet of this soup provides almost 90% of an individual's daily allowance of salt and 40% of the allowed Saturated Fats (thanks to the palm oil used to fry the noodles). While many of us think of soup as a reasonably healthy product - that is simply not the case with this soup. Each packet of this soup has about 500 calories.<br /><br />HEADS UP - some of the reviews on Amazon strike me as a bit suspect: There are a number of 5 star reviews generated by One Time ONLY Amazon reviewers. Once these "reviewers" have promoted this company's product - they never publish another review. I've seen this same pattern, time after time, for all the other soups made by this particular company.<br /><br />Even if you have no concern about salt, calories or saturated fats - the smell and taste I doubt will appeal to many.

I, too, came to the conclusion that it smelled like fish-food the second I got a waft of it, and my friend agreed.<br /><br />The noodles are good as they're much thicker/chewier. The taste of the broth, though, was just down-right disgusting. To me, it just tasted like spoiled fish. One bite and it was in the trash. Ran back to the store and bought a package of Spicey Picante.

review/text: Greenies tries to position itself as a healthy treat, but I'm not so sure.<br /><br />My dogs love them, but buyers should be aware that one of the main ingredients in Greenies is wheat, which, according to my vet, sticks to teeth like glue. In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.<br /><br />Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy. You're better off giving them a cheaper rawhide stick, which does a much better job of cleaning teeth.

There are not that many chews in the box and I thought I was getting a steal on them when I did. No one in their right mind would pay $130 for this container, I think even $35 is a ripoff.

review/text: Our 3 dogs love these. They actually do a little dance before settling down to eat it.<br />So way only three stars?<br />Well, there is way too much packaging, and emails to CS at Natro and a letter to the CEO have all gone unanswered.

review/summary: My dog loves these!
review/text: My Cavalier is the best dog ever!  Whenever I went to the pet store I would look at these and want to buy a big box.  Due to the price I usually just picked up one or two singles for a nice treat.  He loved them!  I saw them on Amazon and decided to be a kind pet owner and get him a box.  Everyday about noon he gets one.  I know when it's noon because he walks up to me and puts his paws on my legs and then turns circles.  When I say, "Do you want a Greenie"?  he goes nuts and runs to the cabinet where I keep them.<br />Happy dog<br />Happy owner

review/text: Our poodle gets one every evening as a special treat. He loves them. I always keep a good supply on hand. It is not only a treat, but it helps clean their teeth.
