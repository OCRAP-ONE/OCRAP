review/summary: OK - But I would Not Go Out Of My Way For It
review/text: Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix is convenient and refreshing. One "stick" makes 16 oz of iced tea when mixed with water. (Note, the nutrition information shown on the package is for 8 oz, so you need to double the nutritional values if you consume the whole beverage.)<br />The tea crystals do not dissolve easily, it will take some time to do it right. The flavor is variable, from sweet to sour to bitter at times.<br />The sweeteners include honey, sugar and suclarose (Splenda.) Blackberry and pomegranate is an odd combination,  but is not too bad. The packets are small and easy to carry around with you. If you like, you can just dissolve a packet into a 16 oz container of bottled water on the go. It is an ok drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.

review/summary: Sucralose AKA Nutra-sweet and maltodextrin CHEM Tea
review/text: Tea&Honey hmmm sounds like it might be all natural but it's NOT. Before I even opened this box, the smell of it turned me off. I poured this into 20 ounces of water which was even more then the 16 oz it called for and then tasted it, GACK, this is clearly not honey!  One swallow and I tasted this in my throat and mouth for an hour and the after taste is horrible. Even the glass I poured it out of, I couldn't get the smell out of even after washing it. This is so putridly sweet I could barely swallow it. I assumed this was as the front of the box said in BIG letters Tea&Honey, well it's not just sweetened with honey. The misleading product labeling did not clearly state that this is full of Sucralose (Nutrasweet by another name) and Maltodextrin two products I would NEVER put in my body knowingly. Both make me sick and give me migraines. Question is WHY? Why would you put artificial garbage, chemical sweetener in green tea that was already sweetened with sugar and honey?<br /><br />Lipton, this product is very misleading. You should Clearly state "Artificial Sweetener" and or "Diet" on the FRONT of the package so people who care what they put in their bodies won't buy this by mistake. Can't you just keep it all natural?

review/summary: I've been duped!
review/text: So, I thought I was getting a great deal on this product. My fault I guess for not reading the reviews and just going by the Lipton description: "sweetened with honey". Sucralose ... "Splenda" is the actual sweetener NOT honey. The sickening artificial taste ruins what could have been a lovely product. Splenda is not a natural product, has no relation to honey and along with other reviews - also gives me fierce migraines. For an added kick, these are not available for returns. Shame on Lipton! Last Lipton product I will ever buy!

review/text: To be fair, I think I'd give any of these miniature packets of "healthy" "water boosters" a two-star review. They're just not all that tasty, and all have a nasty aftertaste from the artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />This product almost earned itself a one-star review because in addition to the aftertaste, there are little crumbly bits in it that just aren't a pleasant thing to encounter in a beverage. It was a rather nasty experience overall, really, but it saved itself from one star because the actual fruit and green tea flavours were really quite nice.

review/summary: Can't find the Tea
review/text: This doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste like tea, either. This tastes like Kool-Aid, the sugar free kind. The immediate smell when I first opened the package brought me back to sitting on the counter as a kid while my filled that huge green pitcher, right before we dumped that magical powder turning water into the sweet taste of my childhood.<br /><br />It may very well be sweetened with honey, but it still has a very slight saccharine taste. An odd thing about this drink mix is the variation in flavor depending on how much water you add to the mix. You have to go pretty light on the water if you want it to taste at all like tea, but that makes the saccharine taste a little too strong. Heavier on the water makes it taste like Kool-Aid. That's fine with me, because I like Kool-Aid. This may, however, be an expensive way to go about a glass.

review/summary: Finally, I can drink Lipton tea again!
review/text: I need a low-calorie drink, I have no problems with the Sucralose. I love, love, love the taste and yes it is strong, I generally make it with 24 to 32 ounces of water, after ice has been added. It tastes just like the original Lipton tea stix before they changed to "aspartame," a sweetener I have to avoid at all costs. If you'd had a migraine for 2 solid weeks with no relief, you would understand my joy.<br /><br />I will be buying this, this coming October and from then on, as I usually drink at least 2-3 glasses a day of this minimum. Thank you Lipton for listening to the needs of the many.

review/summary: Fun Beverage but Takes Time to Dissolve
review/text: This was my first drink mix and since then I've tried others to get a better sense if what I observed and tasted was present in all mixes or unique to Lipton's To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Honey, and Pomegranate. Overall, I immensely enjoyed the honey and pomegranate flavoring. It can be a tad sweet but you can always add water or use less mix to compensate. The only concern is the time it takes for the mix to dissolve. Many other mixes are able to dissolve almost instantly; however, with Lipton's, you've got to shake the drink for at least a good five minutes before the mix clumps completely breakdown otherwise you'll be feeling granules of mix grating in your mouth. Other than this, I think it's refreshing and tasty drink mix.

review/text: as a tea, this stuff is terrible!<br /><br />However, you can use it to sweeten tea made from a tea bag & it is useful.<br />I wish I had not bought so much.  The Sucralose level is so high, that the artificial sweetning level is off the charts - in a bad way.  The tea flavor is not very good, but OK.  I tried diluting it more, but the tea becomes diluted & it just tast like weaker YUCK.  The lemon flavor is not mild either.  Needless to say, I'm not a fan of this product at all.

review/summary: Ok as a drink mix, but not great as actual green tea...
review/text: The Lipton To Go Stix Decaf iced tea mix is a convenient way to get your green tea mix in a hurry, but to be honest, you might want to go another route if you're really looking for green tea. There really wasn't all that much of a green tea flavor, although the strawberry acai is there and quite noticeable (I'm assuming these are artificial flavors). It tastes decent, but to be honest, this strikes me as being something closer to Kool Aid than "tea." It just doesn't taste all the natural to me, and if I'm drinking green tea, that's something I expect. It's not awful, and depending on the choices available, I'd probably drink it again.<br /><br />For those complaining about this having artificial, chemical sweeteners and that Lipton is falsely advertising this as being sweetened with honey, use some common sense. Honey has 22 calories per teaspoon and you'd need a whole lot more than one of them to sweeten a 16 ounce beverage. More or less all of the "Stix" type drink mixes have to use artificial sweeteners...the packaging is too small for a sugar or honey-sweetened mix.

review/summary: Delicious & Refreshing Tea
review/text: Green tea is by far my favorite type of tea.  This is the first Tea I have purchased from Boston Tea, and so far it's probably one of my favorite teas.  The taste is smooth, clean, and slightly sweet with a mild Pineapple flavor.  Comparitively to say Davidson's it is more expensive, but a seems like a better quality tea.  However, compared to something like Teavana it's significantly less expensive, but not as tasty.  Though I'm probably going to be tired of this tea by the time I finish the half pound of it, I am happy with my purchase.  I will definitely buy more Boston Teas, and I may eventually pick up another bag of the Pineapple Paradise Green Tea some day.

review/summary: Rich, full-bodied tea - and I'm a loose leaf snob!
review/text: I don't take tea lightly, so I was not prepared to be impressed by pod tea that I couldn't look at before it was brewed. Thankfully, I was wrong! We have a big honking cabinet stuffed to the rafters with loose leaf tea, and are known to wax political on the stuff and nonsense dust they pass off as 'tea bags'. Just shaking the K-cup I knew the tea inside was powdery, not whole leaf, so I had my criticism all lined up.<br /><br />But wow - it really does brew a nice cup. It's a great choice if you don't want to fuss with filling your own tea bags, loading a steeper, timing the steep, etc. Just pop in the pod and you have a surprisingly full of character cup of perfect breakfast tea. It doesn't have the cheap taste of diner lipton or red rose bagged tea, it's a fine cup that I'd be proud to serve to company. It brews up at just the right darkish-brown shade in our B50 unit, not too watery and not too strong.

review/summary: minerals in a snack!
review/text: There are over 2,000 types of trace minerals and natural minerals and even iodine in this power packed seaweed!  Especially if we do not eat much iodized salt anymore.  The sodium tastes like it is so high, but only 122 per serving (1;3 cup)!  I do not sell this, nor make a profit, I grew up on this stuff in Nova Scotia.  I can no longer get it at local health food stores, so I order it from Amazon.<br /><br />I eat it as a snack (with a tall glass of water to drink) and I have put it in hot frying pan to make it crispy (changes color a bit) great for tossing into popcorn or in salads.  I get the seaweed in pieces, it comes also in flakes which you can use to spread (pieces to large to use in salt shaker) but you can get a shaker with larger holes.  Then, you use as if it were salt on foods.<br /><br />The taste is aquired, and different than sushi type Nori or green kelp seaweed, but if it is for you, you have an electrolyte packed source for life! Affects thyroid (iodine) so check with your doctor if you have an issue, but, if not, is a great weight loss healthy aide.  Take apple cider vinegar (can be taken in pill form, it is only food, not medication) can be taken with the seaweed as an old-time diet aide.<br /><br />I guess you can figure out that I LOVE this stuff!  I used to eat it all the time, but now I eat it in moderation as it is such a powerful food, then my body does not have ups and down in nutrition and iodine.<br /><br />This is the ONLY brand I am aware of for Dulse.

review/summary: Delicious Dulse!
review/text: This dulse is fantastic, sundried deliciousness! My household goes through at least 24 of these biodegradable pouches a year on account of my tsunami popcorn (airpopped corn, dulse, nutritional yeast, occasionally rice crackers -- Hawaiian style) habit; don't forget salt & vinegar dip. We used to buy them from a health food supermarket, but you can't beat the quantity here. I think the price is about the same.<br /><br />Also try this dulse (or the less savory flakes) in vegan baked beans, black eyed peas, adzukis, etc. Great substitute for bacon in beans, soups, or salads. Really wonderful stuff, though it may take getting used to. I've always been a sucker for a good seaweed salad! Will stink up cabinets or anywhere else that you store these bags and flavor other items over time, so store carefully (it can also get really dry if left (or forgotten) for months).

And they were $2.50 EACH. Knowing how long they last (good for saving money and calories), and knowing how they keep my recurrent cough at bay, and how much fun they are, I purchased this 40-pack. I brought them to a concert where all my friends loved them. A great old-school candy at a great price. My one complaint is that the selection did not match what was advertised in the photo, although, in their defense, there is a legal disclaimer. And any Ring Pop is a good Ring Pop.

review/summary: Easily the best low cal no sugar mix I've had
review/text: I was looking for something without sugar/carbs as far as a mix and I finally found it.  Scales Margarita Mix is by far the best I've tasted.  We've tried multiple others (including the horrible Skinny Girl drinks) and this is the only one that doesn't taste like it's low cal or leave a bad after taste.<br /><br />My only complaint is the shipping price from most of the sellers.  It may be worth buying if you buy multiple bottles but otherwise I'm going to try and find this locally.

review/summary: faster and easier
review/text: Not only does it take less time, but you don't have the problem of the crushed pearls you often find in the standard packages. (When they dry out, some crackle and fall apart, which means you end up cooking not only the intact ones, but also the powdery stuff that ends up forming a goo in your hot water; also, some break in the process of cooking with the normal kind.) Less delicate, easy to make, and just as tasty in the end, I would suggest buying the minute kind.

review/summary: Best Taste
review/text: I love these Pearls. I was very skeptical at first, not sure what effects the minute ones vs. the regular ones had on the taste. I'm happy to say that it had none. They taste the same as far as I can tell, and I have had these drinks for years, these stores are everywhere here in Irvine - California. If you like that more tender leave them in the boiling water for 9 minutes instead of 5.<br />Side note; when you drain them, make sure you put some honey on top and stir it in, the better the honey the better the sweetness of the pearl.<br />The only thing I don't like is that the shipping os so expensive.

review/text: Not sayin anything new here, but the more positive reviews of this product the better.  I can't make the milk tea like the shops do back home but I can prepare the boba like they can thanks to this stuff.  I usually don't like buying things that are already done for me, or precooked, etc. but I'm glad these are out there for novice tea makers.  As far as them being chewy, I didn't know that they came any other way, so they are exactly as I expected boba pearls to be.

review/summary: Perfect Boba tapioca pearls in about 10 min
review/text: We've been ordering this for years after discovering them on Amazon.  We then switched to buying from the vendor directly since it's a good deal cheaper, but it also takes a few weeks to receive it.  We wanted it right away so ordered via Amazon and got it with super quick and prime shipping.  We're not disappointed and find it's worth the extra cost when the craving hits...<br /><br />2 shrink-wrapped packages come with the order.  We always place them in tight-fitting tupperware and only open one package at a time.  It lasts us a few months with no problem.  If it's not closed tightly enough, some of the "pearls" become so hard that they won't get chewy no matter how long they're boiled.<br /><br />We've found the following to be the perfect way to make boba minute  "pearls":<br /><br />In a small saucepan, add minute pearls to roiling boiling water;<br />let boil on high for 5 min longer -- they should all be floating at the top (check for chewiness / consistency);<br />remove / strain boba from hot water AND rinse off with cool water;<br />use in hot or cold tea immediately;<br />once boiled, cooked boba can store for about an hour after that the consistency just isn't right by our taste...<br /><br />Others tips -- we stir in some sugar on cooked bob a which for some reason seems to keep it longer and prevents it from sticking to each other into one big glob. Also, if you leave it in the hot water or over boil, it will melt and be a gooey / sticky mess ... Otherwise, it's just a perfect treat at a fraction of the time of regular Boba!

review/text: I'm a bubble tea addict and have been trying to perfect an at home recipe for a while now.<br /><br />These pearls aren't quite as good as the Bubble Tea Houses, but they are a good at home substitute.  Even though they're marked as a "minute pearls", I've found that it's best to let them soak for at least an extra 30-50 minutes.  The taste and consistency is better that way.<br /><br />Just don't let them soak for too long, they'll end up expanding too much and won't fit through a bubble tea straw.

review/summary: Best Boba ever!
review/text: I usually don't write product reviews but I felt compelled this time because these are probably the best tapioca pearls I've ever had. They are extremely simple to make (simply add desired amount to boiling water and cook for 5 mins) and the texture is spot on: soft but nice and chewy. I have tried the WuFuYuan brand of tapioca, but I wasn't sure how long to cook them and they weren't as flavorful or as black as these pearls. I was also satisfied with the size of the bag since the WuFuYuan bags only come in 8.8 oz. I highly recommend you try these if you like making bubble tea at home or just want something slightly sweet and chewy to snack on!

review/text: I got a variety bag of hard candies for Halloween this year, and it had Apple & Watermelon Stix. I agree with Cola 1000, no matter how I tried to unwrap them: cold from the fridge, room temperature, slightly warm from pant pocket .. I always had bits of wrapper plastic stuck to the candy.  I do not think it is because of 'old stock', it is just how they are.  I am thinking of emailing Hershey and suggesting they very lightly spray the inside of the wrapper with food grade mineral oil so the candy does not stick.

review/text: I hate the other jolly fancher flavors so this seemed like the best way to get all cherry flavor. I like the sticks better as you can actually chew on them without breaking your teeth off. They are just as hard as the regular square ranchers, but the stick form allows them to be more brittle for biting and crunching. Yummmy!

Each pouch has roughly 12gms of carbohydrates (as per nutrition information the mfgr sent me) and is usually enough to do the trick for me without "over-treating". Doesn't need refrigeration, no mess in your purse or gym bag and yummy, too.

review/summary: Not just for kids, but diabetics too
review/text: When these got big and hit the shelves, my 2 girls had both grown out of baby food so I didn't notice these.  Not Until my father had handed it to my hungry daughter one day.  It came out of no where so I had no idea why a grown man would have what I thought was baby food in his car.  You see he had got a sample in a food market one day so he had the sample handy in his car one day when his sugar levels dropped.  Being diabetic he needed something fast.  He liked the convenience of these so much he now keeps them handy all the time. My father is a boss to a lot of people and I worry that with the hours he must spend managing so many people, it is a struggle for him to balance ones blood sugar level right once work projects reach their 11th hour.  When he had first figured out he was diabetic, he would occational need to go to the ER because he could get it under control.  Usualy due to working too much combined with not eating enough.  So these things don't just keep the grandkids happy, but help keep him out of the hospital.  For people as busy as my father with diabetes, products as convenet like these are true life savers.

It's only the plain apple flavor though which is why I am online searching for other flavors.  My kids are fine with the plain apple though.

review/summary: check package for sharp jagged corner!
review/text: The product itself is yummy and my 14 month old seems to enjoy it but I sliced my finger when I reached into the box to grab one. The corner was not rounded properly and is pretty sharp. Make sure you check yours before giving it to the kid. I rounded all of mine with a pair of scissors. I'll post a picture.

I keep several of these in the car/diaper bag for when we're out and about. I was buying the Mott's version of these, but couldn't find them for order on Amazon, so I tried these. They must taste great because my son can't get enough of them. They are a bit smaller than the comparable Plum organics pouches, but at this price, they are a great addition to our toddler's snack cabinet.

review/text: While the packaging is nifty the taste is what I buy these for. Sometimes from France, but now from USA, these snacks do not need refrigeration. They are great in the car or pack. My only complaints are the small volumes which means lots of package for the amount of food. Rather wasteful and not for recycling.  WARNING I have repeated my order and this time the product arriving was out of date. If you purchase this food product, check the date before consuming.

review/summary: baby food texture, not too sweet, otherwise okay
review/text: EU standards for Natural Applesauce in France are on par with US Organic standards according to what I've read.  However, my 4 year old son doesn't like this, mainly because it's the consistency of baby food, and is more creamy than American brands of apple sauce. I should note, my kid LOVES apple sauce, but not this brand.  The product has a whipped consistency that your kid may not like if he's used to chunky or other brands of 'homemade' style apple sauce.  The cheapest place I've seen this for sale is at CostCo.

review/summary: Wish these weren't so hard to find....glad they're here
review/text: My son prefers these apple sauce packs to any of the alternatives we've tried. They are all at about the same price-point (except Trader Joes) so I generally pop for the GoGo's.<br /><br />However, it's hard as heck to find just plan old apple on a regular basis. Or any flavor for that matter...they have them with banana, strawberry, and cinnamon...and I BELIEVE I saw a blueberry and/or peach combo once.<br /><br />But when four packs of applesauce run me about $1 a pack, I have a hard time choking back my cheapness.<br /><br />So I turned to Amazon for Subscribe and Save. This has brought down the cost to a little over $0.60/pack. Having the larger boxes come ever two months works out perfectly.<br /><br />Back to the pack itself, I love how confidently my little man enjoys eating his snack from this pouch and really that's almost worth the cost in unto itself.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.

My only complaint is they eat them sooo fast, but with Amazon's autoship program Shop and Save, I save 15% on a case of these every month.  It works out great!  I'd rather have them eat a lot of applesauce and stay away from the other easy snacks.

review/summary: Great on the go snack
review/text: The kids are back to school, and I've been searching for good snacks to go in their lunchboxes.  GoGo Squeez provides about 1/3 cup of fruit in a unique pouch.  The kids love it, it's easy and not at all messy, and I know they're getting at least one serving of fruit in their lunch that they will actually eat before running off to the playground.<br />The price on Amazon is comparable to my local store, and with subscribe and save it works out to be a few cents cheaper per pouch.<br />My only dislike has been the amount of packaging involved - you get four squeezes to a box, and a whole lot of little boxes inside a bigger box.  Also, each squeeze has a fair amount of plastic packaging.  I know the applesauce cups do as well, but this just seems a bit wasteful to be carting around that much material for a 1/3 cup of applesauce.<br />Apart from the above, I love these pouches and so do my kids, and I'll most likely order them again.

review/text: Tried these after getting frustrated with the similar product at Trader Joe's. My 3 year old can go through a 4 pack in a day if she is on an applesauce kick. These packs are a perfect size, the product is DELICIOUS and it is all natural - apples and apple juice are the only ingredients. It is a very smooth, almost creamy, sauce which is more appealing to my toddler who hates feeling little bits in things she eats and drinks. It can be sucked or squeezed from the pack, and we have found them to be awesome road trip snacks! I love the quantity that comes in one shipment - more is more with these! Everyone who sees us with them asks where we got them, and even my adult coworkers want to order them for themselves. Highly recommend this product!

I can squeeze out just enough for a spoonful, put his medicine in it, and reclose the pouch for use a couple of hours later. I wish I'd discovered these months ago.

These are truly not recommended for toddlers his age because of the the tiny lid which is a terrible choking hazard so obviously use the the utmost caution and never allow your toddler to have the cap!

review/summary: Great for kids traveling
review/text: I am very happy with this product because it is healthy and keeps my kids happy.  The advertising that I found has  the following brief description of the product GoGo squeeZ is the first squeezable, re-sealable, no-mess, all fruit, no sugar added applesauce snack for kids on the go in the US.She loves the taste, and we appreciate that there is no sugar added. The no mess pouch is just a nice bonus. My daughter loves this applesauce. We originally found it at Whole Foods but have since switched to Amazon as the price is slightly better and we love being able to buy it by the case. The product description doesn't state that it's Organic, but this is a product from France and is labeled as being All Natural. The EU actually has higher food safety standards than the US and this meets or exceeds our Organic labeling requirements.
