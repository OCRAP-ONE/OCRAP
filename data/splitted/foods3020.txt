review/text: I am so grateful Starbucks started making ready brew. It tastes amazing and I carry them everywhere. VIA is perfect for morning classes when I oversleep and don't have time to make myself a cup. I just ask my campus coffee cart for a cup of hot water on my way to class and voila instant hot, fresh brewed coffee. I can't understand why anyone would give this product a poor review, compared to other instants it is a rockstar.

review/summary: Best price I've been able to find
review/text: Starbuck's VIA is a known quantity (well, for me, anyway, and probably for you as well) -- without question the best instant coffee product you'll find.  But it's very difficult to find anyone who'll sell at a significant discount off the roughly $0.85 per cup Starbucks charges in their retail shops.  I like to keep a good supply around, and typically go through on average about a cup a day.  So far this has been the best volume deal I've been able to find, with 50 packet quantities at around $30 or so coming to about $0.60/cup.  Still not cheap compared to run-of-the-mill Nescafe, but if you go through this stuff like I do, it's a good savings over typical retail.<br /><br />I didn't check the expiration dates on the boxes I received, but I've now been through two orders and noticed no quality problems of any kind with the product.  My only beef is that I really wish Amazon would put this product on their subscription plan . . . .

review/summary: Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee
review/text: I love these Starbuck's VIA packets. I'm one of those people who want a cup of coffee right after getting up and sometimes that's a problem when I travel. Even if there is a coffee maker in a motel room, the coffee provided is usually pretty marginal at best. The Starbucks instant packets make a very tasty cup of coffee with minimal fuss. It's the closest thing to well brewed coffee I've found and a far cry from the instant coffee available in stores.<br /><br />I use them for hiking and camping and always stash a few packets in my pack or suitcase just incase. They are an absolute necessity when traveling abroad, particularly in remote areas or in areas where coffee is not available or the alternative is Nescafe.<br /><br />The price is very good.

review/text: Ok that might be an extreme title, but it is sort of true.  I tried giving up caffeine many times before but never stuck with it, because most decaf coffee tasted like dirty dish water.  Since I am pretty much the only one that drinks (or tries to drink) decaf, I decided instant was more convenient.  Since purchasing Via Decaf Italian Roast, I don't have a need for the regular coffee anymore.  This is deep, rich coffee that tastes like the "real thing".  I am totally over caffeine withdrawal and I never feel deprived of a good solid cup of joe in the AM.

The starbuck via line has such an excellent flavor that you can not tell it is decaf! I also have the regular columbian via I keep on hand when I'm in a rush or when I just want a quick cup of coffee. It is much less hassle than brewing a cup in my coffee pot. If you haven't tried this coffee yet you really should. Its by far the best instant coffee I have ever had!

review/summary: Great tasting instant coffee
review/text: After doing some research, I've decided to try the Starbucks VIA Columbia instant coffee because of it's high reviews. Buying a pack of 50 was too much since I have no idea how it tastes like so I bought a 3 pack sample from my local Starbucks. I've got to say this is definitely one the better tasting instant coffee's I have tried. I haven't tried that many to be sure but with many of the other brands, you can definitely tell that you were drinking cheap instant coffee. Those definitely got the job done but it just wasn't very fun drinking them. With the VIA, the coffee actually tastes fresh and lively. I'm not really a coffee snob and so there's not much bad to say in the taste department.<br /><br />Because I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, it can be a hassle sometimes to grind the beans and use my french press. For those times when I'm feeling especially lazy, I can now count on brewing a cup of this instant coffee. No mess to cleanup and it tastes great as well. What more can you ask for in a instant cup of coffee?!

review/text: I bought the 12 pack of Italian roast decaf at the nearby Starbucks store, which I love and go to frequently, for those rare occasions when I want a cup of decaf at night but don't want to brew it.  But this product is not SB's best effort.  First, the packaging isn't well designed.  Tearing the top off at the "tear here" line always leaves part of the top intact, making getting the coffee out a chore, and trying to tear off the rest of the sticky top is not worth the effort.  Next, the flavor.  I know Italian is supposed to be bold and bitter, but this stuff takes bitter to a whole new level.  Not good.  Then there's the expiration.  I didn't plan to use this very often, but I'd better, because it expires in less than a month.  What?  Finally, the cost.  At nearly a dollar a cup, this wouldn't be worth it even if it didn't suffer from its other inadequacies.  A definite DO NOT RECOMMEND.

review/summary: Fantastic Coffee, BUT...
review/text: BEST INSTANT, PERIOD! BUT... I can't drink VIA made according to it's instructions. It's just way, WAY, too strong. (I'm talking seriously stronger than what you get at a local Starbucks.) Let me explain. When I make brewed coffee, I freshly grind beans to a very fine texture, using two or three tablespoons of grounds per 6 ounces of water. So I'm used to a strong cup of coffee. Since one packet of VIA makes even a large mug of water into an un-drinkablly strong brew, I use only half a packet. The problem is, a couple hours later, the left-over half becomes an unusable blob that won't come out of the packet. No great loss... I've had a GREAT cup of coffee, and I can just toss the other half packet, right? Well, acutally, that's a problem for me. I'm of the 'clean your plate / starving kids in Biafra' generation. I would prefer a smaller packet at a smaller price. So one star off from someone who was taught 'waste not, want not' and is too old to change ;-)

review/summary: Pretty good for instant coffee
review/text: I am a serious coffee drinker, I grid my beans just before I brew the coffee, and yes, I taste the difference between burr grinder and blade grinder. Oh, yeah, I am that serious. So you probably can imagine why I have been against instant coffee for years. Becasue they normally taste aweful! Sour and chemical taste, no fragrance at all. So, when a friend told me about VIA, I giggled, called her "one of those" and joked about how she used coffee to flavor her milk. (I applogize! I do i do). Until one day, another friend ask me to buy instant coffee for him. I laughted at him too. But no request from a friend is too much. I bought the smallest VIA package possible, and tasted it. To my surprise, it doesn't have that sour taste, and the chemical taste was very low and can be ignored, especially if you drink your coffee with sugar (which I strongly against).<br /><br />I like the skinny long bag. when I was choosing between scissors and teeth to open the bag, the bag was teared open so easily from the top with just my fingers. Of course, that alerted me to hide it away from my toddlers. Next thing I did was no brainer, I dumped the powder into a coffee mug, and poured the hot water in it. I doubted if I really needed to stir it, but I did it anyway. The smell was not as strong as my fresh burr grinded cofee, but good enough to believe that it was coffee. I confess, I almost helded my breath when I had my first sip, ready for all sorts of aweful taste. But to my surprise, the taste was not sour at all. I had no trouble drinking the whole cup down and licked my lips and thinking "hmm, not bad". the second thought was "I am only hot water away from another cup".<br /><br />Now, here comes to final judgement:<br />For instant coffee, this is awesome! No grinder, no loud noise. You can carry it with you anywhere you go. no scissors needed. a good cup of coffee is just some hot water away. But, can it replace the old fashioned fresh grinded coffee? No, No No. Still not there yet. But I am keeping them around th house now for the time when the house needs to be dead quiet and I was craving for a cup of coffee.<br /><br />4 star because it is still not as good as fresh grinded coffee.

review/text: Unlike most people, I prefer not a weak coffee but a milder roast than the burnt stuff most coffee houses make that requires many accoutrements to mask like cream, sugar and artificial flavors. Therefore, I purposely only tried the Columbian.<br /><br />I work in a place that has poorly serviced coffee "dispensing machines." They are fun in that you never know what will come out in a day-to-day basis. Some time just your coins back. A few people have illicit electric coffee pots, others use a French press, and still others sneak out for the real thing.<br /><br />Now that I discovered the Columbian Via. I have to defend my cup from all those noses that circle my cup. I know there are directions on the pack; however, I now have my own ritual. Clean cup, fill 2/3rds filtered water. 90 seconds in the microwave. Shake contents to bottom of pack. Rip the whole top off the pack with teeth. Pour pack in coup and watch sizzle. Stir for a few seconds. Add a tad of ice. Hope I can make it back to my desk before the cup empties.<br /><br />I was never a fan of reconstituted coffee however I think it is the addition of the micro-ground coffee that adds the edge necessary.<br /><br />In any event you owe it to yourself to try it.

review/summary: Convenient and Great Value
review/text: I had to save money by breaking my $30-a-week Starbucks habit. These are great value - I bought the 50 pack for about $30 - so that's 60 cents a cup! This is by far the best-tasting instant coffee I have found, after trying lots of premium instants. I will probably buy a Keurig or Tassimo once they figure out how to produce K-cups that are recyclable. Until then, I'm very happy with my Vias.

review/summary: Great Starbucks Taste for a Quick Fix!
review/text: Starbucks has outdone themselves on their VIA line of products.  As a full-time medical student, I am definitely a caffeine addict.  Coffee is my drink of choice when I need to stay awake during long stretches in the semester, but I frequently study with classmates that don't drink coffee.  Starbucks VIA packets are the PERFECT solution for me.  I don't need to bring a coffee maker and coffee.  I just pack a few packets into my bag and go.  I must say that I was genuinely surprised at how fresh and full this coffee tastes.  Whenever I make a cup, I'm amazed because I never get that instant coffee bitterness/staleness found elsewhere.  If you like coffee, have an unpredictable schedule, or travel, I highly recommend picking up a pack of Starbucks VIA packets.  You won't be disappointed.

review/text: Once a diehard bean-grinder, I'm now a convert to Starbuck's instant Italian roast coffee; it makes a lovely dark, robust brew that tastes utterly real. It's also a great way to flavor homemade ice cream. I'm not so crazy about the milder flavor or their instant iced coffee, but this one's a winner.

review/summary: This is not your Dad's instant coffee
review/text: I lived on instant coffee all through college, and came to know its taste and texture all too well.  Because of that, I was skeptical about Starbucks "instant" coffee.  That skepticism was short lived though, after a friend gave me a small batch of Via packets as a gift.  You pour it in the cup and add hot water, give it a little stir, and presto, you have real coffee, not "instant."  I was very surprised.  It tastes good, smells good, and feels good.  It doesn't have that unpleasant, overly watery and grimy texture of the world's most famous instant coffee brand.  I would rate Via at about 94% of the quality of a cup of traditional brewed coffee. I don't use it as a replacement for my brewed coffee, but if the coffee pot at work is empty and I need a quick pick-me up, Via is just the ticket.  This could work just fine as a substitute for brewed coffee, but as long as I have a coffee pot, it is a bit cheaper than Via.

review/summary: Deep, Dark, and Delicious
review/text: This Starbucks instant coffee is delicious!  It really is deep, dark, and very flavorful.  I love the taste but if you ask my sister....she hates it.  So I guess it really is up to one's own taste buds as to whether it is as enjoyable for you as it is for me. I have noticed that the first package of this instant coffee seemed to have a richer odor than the one I am using now but the taste is the same.  It's expensive but I am worth it and I really love the flavor as my first cup of liquid in the morning.  I'd recommend you try it and decide for yourself!

review/summary: best instant decaf
review/text: This is probably the best instant decaf I've ever had. It has a rich flavor and doesn't taste like<br />instant. I gave it a 4 because of the cost and the packaging. It would be much more cost efficient if<br />it came in a jar, rather than individual packets. Also, each packet is too strong for one cup (for me)<br />so I use only 1/2 now and have to save the other half. Packets are great for traveling, but for home use<br />it's unnecessary.

review/text: I have been buying this product from Starbucks for the last couple of years.  A few years ago, my daughter bought me a Keurig Coffeemaker for a holiday gift.  I gave it back to her because the Starbucks coffee is so superior & so easy, not to mention inexpensive.  Actually, when you purchase the Starbucks VIA from the internet it costs about 53 cents for 1 cup of coffee.  Which is more than 30 cents less than buying it at Starbucks itself.  The coffee is AMAZINGLY delicious.  The delivery is outstanding as well.

review/summary: Yum, but packet difficult to use
review/text: Man is this instant coffee delicious.  I love a strong coffee taste and this is almost at my limit for too strong, but not quite.  It's wonderful as iced coffee.  I didn't have a problem with the expiration date.  First order was in March and expired in December; second order in May, expired end of November and anyway, how bad can coffee get in individual packets even 5 years after the expiration date really?<br /><br />My problem is that the description says 1. POUR IN PACKET 2. ADD HOT WATER 3. STIR AND ENJOY - which is fine if you use a tea kettle.  If you microwave water in the mug first and try to use the pencil-sized opening at the top of the packet as indicated (which isn't super easy to use anyway), it steams up the opening and the coffee gets stuck.  It's messy to work around it by prying open the rest of the packet so the opening is larger, or cutting diagonally with scissors.  Even heating the water in a separate container the packet gets five out of ten for ease of use as the video demonstrates.<br /><br />Starbucks - this could easily be resolved by adding another quarter inch at the top and engineering a wider opening at the top.

review/summary: I wasn't a big coffee drinker until I tried this. Now I'm hooked
review/text: I wasn't much of a coffee drinker before. Once in awhile I'd go to Starbucks to get an iced coffee but that was probably once a month and for awhile not having any coffee at all for a year. So it's not something I drank much.<br /><br />I have tried some other instant coffees from my girlfriend but didn't like them so much.<br /><br />Then we tried the Starbucks VIA. The flavor of it is perfect for what I like! It's so easy to make. The instant coffee tastes better than anything I can buy at Starbucks so I never go and buy a coffee. This saves me a lot of money.<br /><br />Since I don't drink much coffee, one cup of this has enough "kick" to keep me up all day long.<br /><br />Now I drink a cup of coffee but I go running and it makes me feel like I can run much longer.<br /><br />So I would highly recommend this. Again I wasn't a two cup of coffee per day person but now 2-3 times a week, I enjoy a cup of Starbucks VIA.

review/text: This product, Starbucks Via, is a Starbucks Product. It's good stuff.  I live in Seattle, the home of Starbucks.  This price was cheaper than anywhere I've found for this quantity so I ordered.  I thought it would take a few days to get here in a plastic envelope.  Nope, 12 (TWELVE) days later it arrived and was shipped from Tennessee with a packing slip with the official starbucks maiden on the invoice.  Come on, Starbucks, Does all of your roasted coffee ship to your coffee shops from the same location.....no distribution centers or anything that could mail a package a little more efficiently.  12 days from time of order to receipt is a long time for a package.  I mail letters from Seattle to the Southeast every week that arrive in 3 days.  This was slower than media mail.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: I bought the Columbian and the Espresso 3-packs locally for travel because motel/hotel coffees are so bad as are fast-food chain coffees, but both versions of the Starbucks VIA instant coffees are absolutely disgusting. I am not a soda drinker, but when I travel I prefer a Coca Cola or Pepsi to this foul "coffee". It reminds me of the old Sanka instant coffee, but is much stronger and much more bitter. Totally disgusting! The only people who could drink this crap are those who use flavored creamers and/or loads of sugar so they don't taste any of this foul coffee.

review/text: It's true!  Starbucks VIA  is delicious!  I have it every morning, upstairs, by simply heating water.<br /><br />Everyone who tastes VIA says the same thing, "This is great coffee!"  I never drink instant coffee - would rather skip coffee than have instant,  but someone gave me a cup of Starbucks VIA at their home because their coffee pot was broken and I loved it.<br /><br />I have noticed if I just tell people to take a sip when I make the first cup  - they light up - they don't/won't give the cup back so I make the next cup for me.  I was never a Starbucks person before,  but VIA is great.<br /><br />Try it just once!  I put my coffee pot away downstairs - put in a hot water dispenser and always have really good coffee or tea.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Instant brew!
review/text: In my search for instant java fix, I have sampled French, German, Italian, US, Israeli, Turkish produced instant coffees and this is, by far, the best instant coffee I have tasted.  The reason? It does not taste "instant". Rather, it tastes like a freshly brewed, dark, strong, rich cup of real coffee. For a less "potent" taste, packets should be used in venti-sized cups or rationed for more than one regular cup. This is an excellent product.

review/summary: Still A Fan!
review/text: Strangely enough but this Starbucks' instant coffee tastes better than the instant coffee I purchase in the Starbucks coffee shops. I often worry that the coffee may be old and have a wierd taste -- which has occurred twice. So, of course I was nervous about ordering this large amount online but said what the heck. It was a good choice. I do wish they would instant package the Breakfast Blend. That is my very favorite. Pike's Place is my next fav -- but not to be had in the instant variety either. This Columbian, medium roast, is quite tasty though. I'm having a cup right now and really enjoying it. Oh by the way, for the person who said the coffee is too strong and uses only half the package and the remainder of the coffee turns to goo. Tip: Do not pour the coffee into a cup of hot water. The steam from the water instantly makes the coffee hard to pour from the package and indeed starts to dissolve the coffee. Pour the coffee into the empty cup and then seal the package. A small paper clip works well.

review/summary: I'm impressed. Tastes like real coffee. Still not better than brewed, but hey.
review/text: I have two positive reviews for this product -- me as a coffee drinker, and after polling a number of training participants at my work after switching 100% to via products.<br /><br />I drink very dark french press coffee at home, and often espresso. I am very picky about my coffee. So, for me to find this instant coffee very drinkable is quite impressive. I like the italian roast, and can't really drink the medium roast. I drink this at work when I have trainings, and think it's pretty close to the real thing, but still not the same as getting a fresh brewed cup. However, in a pinch, it's a great substitute. My husband likes the Via so that he doesn't have to make noise making coffee in the morning at home -- we have a 3 month old son -- and grinding and boiling water can get loud.<br /><br />I work in a business where we previously had a caterer bringing us coffee (very subpar) and it was costing us $20-50 per class. Now people are impressed that the Starbucks Via is out. They seem to like the coffee (all flavors) and say it's an improvement over the catering coffee. And, we are saving SO much money because people only consume what they need, rather than paying per person with a caterer. A win-win! Thanks for making it taste good, Starbucks!

review/text: 1. AMAZON MAKES THESE AFFORDABLE. I am so excited they started selling them and are PRIME items!!! I could make back the money on my Prime membership on these alone.  At the time of this writing 66 cents for one packet! A little bit more than a k-cup (.43) but i dont have to carry around a machine in my purse to enjoy it.<br /><br />2. They are super convenient for camping / backpacking.<br /><br />3. I throw some in the car - so if I am traveling, I can stop at a gas station with hot water, instead of plunking down $4 on crap coffee.<br /><br />4. They do NOT taste like instant coffee. They taste delicious! And strong!<br /><br />5. Easy to open.<br /><br />6. Throw them in your purse when you need a coffee fix and your clients, friends, family dont like strong or good coffee.<br /><br />7. You don't have to clean a coffeepot or throw away a more bulky kcup.

review/text: I'm a confessed coffee snob of 20 years or more and brew my own daily from beans.  I prefer the bold to extra-bold coffees, but enjoy most of Starbucks (non-flavored) varieties. I completely avoided instant coffee until I tried Starbucks Via. I was amazed! In the time it takes to boil water, I can have a full-flavored, aromatic cup of coffee. My office has a Bunn hot-water dispenser which cuts the time to seconds! Now I take the VIA packs camping, boating and always have a few in my brief case when traveling on business. They are pricey when bought at the local supermarket, but the Amazon price on the 50-pack brings the cost down to .65 per cup.

review/summary: Great for that extra cup of coffee !
review/text: I love this stuff!  Although we brew a big pot of coffee in the AM, shut the machine off, and use the microwave to heat cups later in the day, there are those days when we run out of coffee early, want another cup or two, and don't want to brew another whole pot.  These give us the additional cups of really good coffee we want - hate the usual instant stuff - and it's so quick and easy to make another cup this way.<br /><br />Great for camping too - and for making a cup of strong coffee when a recipe I'm using calls for one as an ingredient.  (I cook gluten-free - and can't make "rye" bread without a good strong cup of joe.)<br /><br />So glad I found it on Amazon.  They've gotten really expensive in the nearest Starbucks, and I'm already running out of the pack Santa put in my Christmas stocking.  Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Great value for awesome instant coffee
review/text: I love having Starbucks VIA around to supplement my brewed coffee.  Personally, I start out with a pot of fresh ground extra bold coffee in the morning.  It usually lasts me until around 3 in the afternoon, at which point I switch to using my VIAs.  They taste the most like fresh brewed coffee from any instant I've ever tried.  I also use the VIAs when I'm working late at night, heading out early for a meeting, or for Church on Sundays so I can avoid the "burner coffee".  ;)<br /><br />Being able to by them in bulk at $0.70 per packet makes this habit much more economical!  A big thanks to Starbucks for offering them through Amazon as well as their own store.  Finally, I received my pack of 50 on May 2nd, and it has an expiration date of October, if that helps any of you who are concerned about the expiration date problems described by others.  Perhaps it was just a backlog of product as people were discovering VIA available on Amazon?

review/summary: Heaven for decaf drinkers!
review/text: If you already know about VIA, let me just say that this is the decaf version, and it's fabulous -- 'nuff said!  :)<br /><br />If you don't know about VIA, boy, are you in for a treat.  VIA is Starbucks' trademark name for their new version of instant coffee.  Before you give up in disgust, stop and think:  would they really blow their name by bringing out something undrinkable like ordinary instant?  No, they're not that stupid, right?  So... there must be something unlike ordinary instant going on here.  Bingo!  Here's how I discovered it:<br /><br />My coffee maker (a Cuisinart GRIND-n-BREW, less than 2 weeks beyond the warranty period, naturally) gave up the ghost just before a big dinner party, and my husband and I aren't eager to make big purchases these days, to put it mildly.  At Sam's Club I ran across a large-sized pack of single-serving little tubes of Columbian VIA and thought, hey, why not -- gives us some more time to decide on our new coffeemaker.  Sam's doesn't sell any decaf VIA, so I had to admit to being out of decaf at the dinner (most of our guests gave up at that point, not wanting to caffeinate themselves so late in the evening), but the few who still wanted coffee were served VIA without knowing it.  All 3 praised our coffee, and I personally thought it was terrific!!  I 'fessed up to everyone's surprise and gave them each a single-serving packet to take home.<br /><br />Since then, I've had nothing but VIA.  Not only do I enjoy it as much as brewed fresh-ground Starbucks coffee, but I absolutely love the convenience of "brewing" a single serving whenever I want it, instead of waiting for a whole pot, throwing some of it out after it lingered for an hour or two, and then waiting for a whole new pot later if I want more.  Needless to say, we haven't replaced the Cuisinart, and that was months ago.  (Note:  a single serving is 8 oz., and our porcelain coffee mugs hold 10 oz., so it works beautifully for us, whether a single cup or a dozen:  just put a tube's worth into each mug and add steaming hot water to what you've predetermined is the 8 oz. point).  I also love not having to wonder whether my big bag of whole beans is still fresh or whether to throw out the rest and plunk down serious cash on the next one:  the VIA is fresh each time, so I'm actually spending less per cup than I had been before.  Not to mention the serious pain previously of cleaning the grinding mechanism on the GRIND-n-BREW for every new pot... :(<br /><br />The only problem I originally had was no decaf, so I was giving up drinking any coffee at all after 3 or 4 in the afternoon.  Then, naturally, I found the decaf on Amazon -- HOORAY!!!  I'm about to order my sixth case of this wonderful decaf, which tastes as good as any decaf I've ever had.  The only other place I've ever found the decaf is on Starbucks' own website, and it's cheaper from Amazon, especially if you're a Prime member.  Amazon scores again, and then some.<br /><br />The best part?  How portable it is!!  If you end up agreeing with me that it's as good as "brewed", then just imagine being able to take one of these little tubes with you anywhere you go, just add it to 8 oz. of steaming hot water, and then end up with a fresh cup of fabulous-tasting coffee?  Ymmmm...  (Especially nice to have some in my bag for "emergencies", such as when a restaurant tells us at the end of a nice dinner out that they don't have any more decaf...)<br /><br />Try both the caffeinated and the decaf -- I'll bet you end up being incredibly glad you did, and I'll bet the two combined save you a lot of time, money and inconvenience.  Go for it!  :)

I normally brew my own espresso every day, but I use the Via packs when I don't have time for that and need to hit the road with my caffeine fix.  I rated this product 1 star because like other reviewers, I too received a 50-ct box of nearly expired product.  When you buy this stuff in the store it has roughly a one year shelf life.  The box I was sent expires in two months.  A box of 50 is like a one year supply for me.  If I had known they are selling these boxes at such a good price because they are about to expire, I would have passed on this "bargain".  But if you plan to drink them all in a month or two, it is a good buy.

review/summary: Terrible customer service
review/text: I purchased this through Amazon and it was shipped from Starbucks.com.<br />I received the order promptly, however when I opened the shipping box, I found the product box with a round blue sticker over the broken seal that keep the product box sealed. Inside, there was coffee grounds all over the box and stuck to all the packets was this gritty stuff. There were 2 sleeves of VIA that were obviously opened and causing the mess in the box. Each of these packets also had a blue sticker! So it was pretty obvious that I was shipped a known defective product. When I called Starbucks, at first they wouldn't help me and treated me like they didn't ship this item (because I ordered thru Amazon) and would not replace this product. They said I would have to pay to ship it back to them and they would send a refund. I didn't want a refund, I just wanted the product replaced. They said that after I returned it, I would have to completely reorder and pay for the product. I called the customer service again and got the run-around. There customer service is awful. I guess they figure they can afford to lose a customer if they behave this way. That is why I am posting this review....<br />I would not recommend buying from Starbucks.

review/summary: YUM!!!  These are so handy and so tasty!
review/text: These are great for traveling, camping, those cold mornings when you've forgotten to get the coffee maker ready the night before or when your late and don't have time.  It's a very deep flavor which I think is great, especially with a little creamer...it really has that starbucks latte flavor.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  AND GREAT PRICE compared to the store!  We keep the decaf kind on hand too for evenings on the deck...can't say enough about it!  AWESOME!

review/summary: Not bad when I split the package into 2 portions
review/text: I decided to give Starbucks a try as I've been looking for a good instant decaf coffee. I poured the first pouch in its entirety into my cup and thought I was drinking tar. For the next one I only used half a pouch and got a much more mellow and enjoyable cup. Clearly, my palette is not well suited to overly strong coffee. I suppose I would buy this again, but not before shopping around and trying a different decaf.

review/summary: As good as instant coffee gets!
review/text: I've always been disappointed by instant coffee. But things have changed with VIA. I picked up a 3 pack from the grocery store to test it out, cost me like $3 which is insane for instant coffee. $1 per serving compared to 10 cents with other brands. But, when i tried the Starbucks Via Columbia I had no regrets. Far superior then any instant. I'm not big on Starbucks, i have never ordered coffee from Starbucks. In fact, i'm shocked they got this far with the prices and silly names for sizes, etc. The entire experience going into a Starbucks makes me roll my eyes and leave everytime. But anyway, this instant coffee has great roasted taste and aroma. I'll def buy this in bulk from amazon. The 50 count for $29 breaks down to about 60 cents per cup, which the best way to go. You'd have to grind and brew at home to get this quality/price.

review/summary: Awesome price!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I love the VIA instant coffees but at the store it is approximately $4.00 without tax for 3 individual packets, costing more than $1 a packet. However, I bought the 50 count item for $28.95 and it was eligible for the super saver free shipping. That put it at $.58 a packet! Such a steal! And this is the BEST instant coffee you will ever have!

review/summary: Just Like Brewed Starbucks Coffee
review/text: I am hooked on Starbucks VIAs for their convenience and taste.  Unlike many other instant coffees, VIAs taste just like brewed Starbucks coffee.  The only downside can be the cost, but when there is a deal on Amazon, I am quick to order them.

review/summary: Tasty and quick
review/text: I found Amazon to have the lowest prices on the large packs of the Starbucks VIA and am happy with the transaction.<br /><br />I first picked up a 5-pack of the VIA at a local grocery store at a cost of almost $8 to see if I liked them. The Amazon price is much better and lets me have a quick cup of coffee at work in the afternoon when I'm running a little low on energy.<br /><br />They make great coffee, quick.
