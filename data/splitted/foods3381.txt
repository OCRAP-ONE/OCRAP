review/summary: don't like taste at all
review/text: I've have never had a good tasting protein meal replacement shake and this one is no better.  I know taste preference is all subjective.  But if you don't like the sickening sweet flavor of artificial sweetners and that nasty after taste, then you won't like this. Please note I hate the taste of diet soda too, just to give you a reference point.  After forcing myself to drink it once a day for a week, I just couldn't do it anymore. The articial sweetening is too much for me and the thought of having to drink it everyday..well I just can't do it.  I will continue making my own meal replacement shakes with plain whey protein with no artificial sweeters.  I like to mix in a little fruit( blueberries, raspberries or strawberries) or yogurt or honey to keep carbs low.

review/summary: I love this product- though unhappy with the customer service from the Manufacturer
review/text: I purchased this product in the area where I live, and I happened to purchase the last bottle, and they are no longer carrying this size so I could not exchange it.<br />  When I opened the bottle it exploded out from the top of the bottle from pressure. I called the company -Goldmine 1(800)475-3663 begin_of_the_skype_highlighting  1(800)475-3663  end_of_the_skype_highlighting and spoke with Amber to see if I could ship the bottle to them and them send me a new bottle. (after explaining to her the product had an acid after taste) She (Amber) told me not to worry about that- that the product was a raw natural product so it should be fine to continue consuming it, I replied NO it really tastes WRONG/BAD and she put me on hold to speak to her supervisor, and again told me it would be fine to consume it, and that they would not take it back. I am in amazement that they would suggest you to continue to consume it. I DO like the product alot and explained that to Amber and that I have been purchasing this product for 5 years, and I know how it should taste. Amber then offered a $5 gift certificate towards another bottle, I told her I appreciate that but I have a whole bottle that is bad that I don not feel safe using. I did not accept the $5, though I still plan on buying their product because I like it better than any others I have tried, But the fact that they would not replace it and tell me to continue using a bad product does not leave me a good impression of there ethics. :( I am planning on purchasing not thru Goldmine but thru somewhere where if the product is bad they will replace it. Maybe I am wrong but I would think that at the very least the company would want to make it right. Consumers Do Not want to pay for bad product. This sometimes happens and gives a company a chance- an opportunity to show good ethics and make it right. To me $5 would not make it right.

review/summary: Great soy sauce, not so great packaging.
review/text: This is the best soy sauce, it's great whether cooking or using by itself.  However finding a seller who can get the bottles to my house without them leaking has proven impossible.  At least three different sellers (outside of amazon too) and with numerous orders these bottles leak around 2/3 of the time.  Every time the problem is the same - the cap isn't screwed on tight enough.  Giving it 4 stars because it's a great product, if the sellers would manually tighten them or the producer would go to a different style of lid - perhaps with a seal - it could be perfect.

review/summary: The ONLY REAL Soy sauce available!!!
review/text: This is the REAL Thing!  If you have read the book "Nourishing Traditions" by Sally Fallon, then you will know the importance of naturally fermented soy sauce.  This is what Sally Fallon shares about the difference between REAL soy sauce and cheaper varieties of soy sauce:  "Traditional soy sauce is made by a fermentation process that takes six to eight months to complete.  This long and careful procedure creates a mix of phenolic compounds, including a natural form of glutamic acid, that contributes to the unique taste and aroma of traditionally brewed soy sauce.  The modern bioreactor method produces a product by rapid hydrolysis, rather than by complete fermentation, in the space of two days and uses glutamase as a reactor, so that the final product contains large amounts of the UNNATURAL glutamic acid that is found in MSG. "<br /><br />I have been using this soy sauce for years - mainly because my local co - op carried it.  Recently we moved, and I wasn't able to find it.  I am SO glad that Amazon carries it!  Now I can continue to get the BEST soy sauce that is available!

review/text: We use this vinegar in salads & soup, on sandwhiches, with fish (replace the splash of wine with this), sauteed vegetables.  Its a perfect complement, not like regular vinegar which is tart and sour, this has a mild pleasant flavor, not sour, but not sweet either.  But it also makes a great condiment to sliced strawberries - a couple of tablespoons over a bowl of sliced strawberries, let sit for 15 min and serve.  Delicious!

review/text: This is the cinnamon that Mom used for everything that needed cinnamon, and that I used on my cinnamon toast as a kid, so it's what cinnamon is supposed to taste like to me. It has a warm, sweet flavor with just the right amount of heat. I use a lot of it in baking and in hot cereal mixes I make for my kids since it's a lot less expensive to mix up an instant cereal than it is to buy the little flavored packets. My daughter uses it generously in her hot chocolate and on cinnamon toast. Wonderful flavor. We keep a shaker that's half cinnamon, half sugar to use in coffee, cinnamon toast and on bagels with cream cheese.

The company (Barry Farms) does not provide proper packaging to assure this particular item arrives as it was packaged originally. While I ordered directly from the company I cannot speak for shipping from Amazon. But my guess is that the same thing would happen since Barry Farms supplies Amazon with the items to ship out to the customer.

review/summary: Unsatisfactory
review/text: I am extremely dissatisfied with the product and customer service from this company (Barry Farm). It says on the page for this product "Usually ships within 6 to 10 days". I ordered this product over three and a half weeks ago and just received it. I was still charged over $8.00 for shipping (more than the item was worth). I took precautions for the product not to sit in the sun and melt, ordering it so it would be delivered on a day I was home. This effort failed; the shipping and delivery dates changed...twice. I got an email from Amazon stating that they had not received notification of shipping from the seller (Barry Farm). I emailed the seller, received no response. I then got an email from Amazon a day later with a delivery time frame. The product did not arrive during the stated time frame (late). When it finally arrived, I received a bag of melted goo. But the interesting thing was, it was evident that the product had melted before, re-hardened, and then began to melt again in my mailbox. Due care was not taken to package the product in a manner that MAY have helped prevent such damage. I will not be ordering from this company again.

review/summary: Hill's Scient Diet Hairball Control Canned Cat Food (Seafood)
review/text: I have a one year old cat and a senior cat.  The senior cat--a fussy eater with no teeth--was eating another brand of canned cat food, but preferred to "gum" dry kibble most of the time.  When I bought the Science Diet, she enjoyed it right away and now prefers it exclusively.  In retrospect, I believe the other brand may have been upsetting her stomach; she slept all the time, had issues with hairballs and was not interested in play at all.  I had attributed this behavior to her age, but since I switched her to the Science Diet she has begun to play again and her coat is extremely soft and shining.  The hairballs have stopped entirely.  I'm very glad I bought it.  (All of that said, the young cat will not touch it.)  So you might test it out before buying in quantity.  Overall, I'm thrilled with what it has done for my senior cat.

review/summary: Incredible nut butter
review/text: This stuff is insanely good. I thought it was just going to be Nuttzo with cocoa thrown in as a gimmick, but boy was I wrong.<br /><br />CHOC seems to have a texture, taste, and consistency all its own. You still get the classic Nuttzo seven-nut butter blend in addition to huge chunks of each nut, but now there are dark chocolate bits and a deep cocoa swirl added to the mix. Really gives the whole thing a new and magical "kick" -- a bit like what a healthy Nutella-Reese's combo might be. Somehow the stuff manages to be even crunchier than original Nuttzo, too, which I assume has something to do with the slightly rearranged order of flax and sunflower seeds. The resulting mouthfeel is close to divine. This is the kind of spread that makes you pause to parse and savor each chew.<br /><br />The chocolate chips boast a refreshingly short ingredient list: organic cocoa liquor, organic cane sugar, organic cocoa butter, and organic cocoa powder. The cocoa delivers a deep, rich bite while still allowing all of the nuts and seeds to shine through. CHOC is not for fans of the super sweet goop you'll find with other popular PB blends, however; the chocolate here is fairly dark with a total sugar content only 1g higher than plain Nuttzo per serving. (Compare this to an equivalent serving of Dark Chocolate Dreams, which packs about 7g of sugar. Nutella contains over 20g!) CHOC will certainly satisfy those looking for a more subtle, refined, multi-layered taste experience. And did I mention the crunch? :-)<br /><br />Anyway, this is by far the tastiest thing I've tried in the realm of chocolate nut butters. I love to eat it with ice cream, oatmeal, yogurt, fruits, and of course straight from the jar, as recommended by the manufacturer. CHOC isn't exactly cheap, but considering all the potent and organic ingredients blended here in such perfect harmony, I'd say it's worth the premium.<br /><br />P.S. Hope to see it on shelves here in Seattle someday!

The perfect compliment to any Indian dish; or simply a cup of Tea on a cool evening. Also, it makes fantastic Iced Tea as well; the flavor is never stale, and holds it's own with the ice. I highly recommend all of the Brooke Bond Teas.

review/summary: Best Tzataki Mix Ever!
review/text: OK...I started going through an "obsessed with Greek food" phase after going to Mykonos (yum!!!)<br />So started looking everywhere for how to make Tzatzki sauce. You wouldn't believe the disgusting concoctions I have created and/or bought (already made)! Yeech!<br />But this was perfect!!! You can mix it with yogurt or sour cream (I prefer sour cream on chicken;yogurt on beef)and it really brings a meal together. You can also sprinkle mix on salads;eggs-- I would probably use plain Greek yogurt and omit this dip mix if you're using fruit -Yes, I've known people to use Tzatzki on fruit..But I think it's weird 'cuz it's spicy....Anyways!<br />It took awhile to arrive from Canada but that was fine:)<br />The owners are awesome especially Phyllis.(Thank you!) I would check out their site if you like hard to find seasonings and sauces, tea, etc.<br />So in conclusion, Great product!LOVE this use it everyday so far...Think I may make be coming up on an Asian food craving! I just love world foods! Enjoy,and don't be afraid to try something different:P

review/summary: Love this extract!
review/text: This extract is much better than any I've bought in stores. It's stronger, so a little goes a long way; it's less harsh and slightly sweeter too. I put two or three drops on the coffee grounds before I brew a "12-cup" pot and it's wonderful! I love cinnamon, so I put about 1/4 teaspoon of this in a sour cream coffee cake and it made the best cinnamon cake I've ever eaten. Just remember that you'd probably use less of this extract than a recipe would call for.

This one is by far the best I've tried over the years.  I even pack several bags when I travel so I always have it with me wherever I go.

review/text: I agree with C. Wright! This thing is all levels of nasty. I bought this thinking I'd get the flavor of regular green tea with added lemon and honey but nooooo doesn't taste anything like it. If you read the ingredients it doesn't even mention honey or lemon (lemon grass doesn't count). Not sure how to describe the taste but it's very strong and herby. Better stick to the regular green tea and just add lemon and honey yourself. I had to hold my nose drinking it cuz I didn't want to waste the cup of it I made. But in short, DON'T BUY IT!

review/summary: Hill's Scient Diet Hairball Control Canned Cat Food (Seafood)
review/text: I have a one year old cat and a senior cat.  The senior cat--a fussy eater with no teeth--was eating another brand of canned cat food, but preferred to "gum" dry kibble most of the time.  When I bought the Science Diet, she enjoyed it right away and now prefers it exclusively.  In retrospect, I believe the other brand may have been upsetting her stomach; she slept all the time, had issues with hairballs and was not interested in play at all.  I had attributed this behavior to her age, but since I switched her to the Science Diet she has begun to play again and her coat is extremely soft and shining.  The hairballs have stopped entirely.  I'm very glad I bought it.  (All of that said, the young cat will not touch it.)  So you might test it out before buying in quantity.  Overall, I'm thrilled with what it has done for my senior cat.

My wife doesn't go the heat level I prefer in foods, so I sprinkled a touch of cayenne hot pepper sauce to add zip after its served into bowls.  The spice level is just right for most folks as is.

review/summary: Good but ingredients are disappointing.
review/text: I strive to find the best chocolate for your money everyday.  I love chocolate, especially the premium brands that have the purest ingredients.  So I always though that Ghirardelli had the best ingredients.  NOT SO.  After looking at the ingredients of this product I noticed that they add HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP and CORN SYRUP to the mix of things.  How is that a premium blend. Nothing about that is premium.  I have noticed that they have been adding this to their chocolates more often now.  And honestly you can taste the difference.  I guess it is back to Lindt or Godiva.  Or I can always go with the Organic Chocolates which are not really any more money than these are.  So if you are looking for a more natural ingredient list do not look to Ghirardelli, it appears that they are adding cheaper inferior ingredients and yet still charging a premium price. NOT something I want to see with an American made product.Dan

review/summary: Hot-Cha-Cha-Cha
review/text: Sit down boys and girls and let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, actually it was a Wednesday; anyway, I decided to go on my lunch hour from work to the nearest Chinese buffet restaurant. I usually do not frequent the buffet lifestyle because I am afraid of what goes on behind closed doors, and the sneeze guard is just gross. I was happy to see that they had healthier fare to choose from, and sushi, so I filled my plate with steamed veggies, sushi and a dumpling or two. I sat down alone at my table, facing away from everyone because I just have this thing about people watching me eat, and something really brightly red caught my eye. It was in a Giant squeezy bottle, with a rooster on the front; I picked it up and read the label "Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce". Hmmm, a condiment that I haven't heard of, ME the so called Condiment Queen of Gainesville Florida. I squirted a bit on my plate, dipped my chopsticks in it and tasted it, GOOD LORD UP ABOVE, it was Huy Fong good, spicy garlicky vinegary so tasty, I then doused my entire meal with the HazMat red concoction and reveled in its goodness. I rushed out after work to the nearest Asian market, of which I frequent a lot, and there it was so many squeezy bottles how did I ever miss them before? I grabbed three, plus two of my regular Hoi sin bottles, a jar of pickled ginger and proceeded to grin like a Cheshire cat to the register. On the bottle it also says its good on pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, pasta and I have to admit the stuff is good on almost everything. I have used it on all of those things plus baked potatoes, in salad dressings, spaghetti sauce, barbecue, along side dips, its as if it mind melds with whatever it goes on to make a perfect accompaniment for your taste buds. Okay I am dorking out so that means this review is finished. BUY SOME NOW> you won't regret it.

review/summary: Unbelievable - you gotta try it!
review/text: I'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before, but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha. An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation.

review/summary: The Premier Hotsauce.
review/text: I first ran across Sriracha (and am still uncertain how to pronounce it) while eating at a Vietnamese restaurant in California. It was given to me with a seafood entr&eacute;e and I found that I kept squeezing the bottle and tasting the sauce separately with my fork. Its flavor is absolutely amazing. Yes, the other reviewers are quite correct, it is not a conveyer of great heat, but its texture and flavor are incomparable. I brought it back with me to Illinois and have about 6 of them in a cabinet--just in case I ever run short. I've turned at least 5 people onto it and now use it with chicken, pizza, and even eggs on a daily basis. It is exquisite and I've very glad to have made its acquaintance.

review/summary: A chili sauce worth crowing about
review/text: Sriracha's a great early morning pick-me-up on the ol omlet.  It's also great on pizza, stirfry, soups, panini sandwiches (spritz a little atop the cheese the next time you make one, and see for yourself), etc.  Great for livening up roasted red pepper hummus, tomato sauces, mayonnaise, you name it.  The uses are innumerable.<br /><br />I'm a self-avowed chili-head, and I've tried more chili sauces than I can easily count.  Everyone has their favorite styles and brands, and I'm no different, because this happens to be one of mine.<br /><br />The thing I like about Sriracha is how the flavor and texture of freshly ground sun-ripened red chilies shine through cleanly ... there are no gritty/bitter seeds, no oxidized flavors from using reconstituted dried chilies, no caramelized/overcooked flavors, no competing heavy mismatched flavors/spices, no mouth pucking wretched excesses from being pickled in cider vinegar and salt, no fatiguing smoke flavors, no fruit juices, no excessive heat, no thermonuclear oil essence extracts, etc.  Most of those things have their time, place and uses, and good examples of each abound ... but not here.<br /><br />No.  Sriracha is just plain, beautiful, de-seeded, unobstructed, sun-ripened fresh red chili flesh, with just barely enough garlic, salt, vinegar and sugar to round it out, plus a little gaur gum to thicken it slightly, and a little sorbate for extend it's freshness.  That's it.  It's pleasantly piquant, but not overly so.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />p.s. A convenient fallback for me, whenever Sriracha is unavailable, is Franks RedHot Original.

review/summary: A Potent Hot Sauce, similar to Tabasco, just Better. Buy the 28oz which costs only a few cents more
review/text: This hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a hot (cayenne?) pepper delivery device. A few drops add a considerable amount of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.<br /><br />While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a heavy dose of vinegar - this sauce has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle amount of sweetness to this sauce along with faint garlic notes. While Tabasco can taste quite harsh if you add too much to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato was simply the "sun ripened chilies" and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />While I really like this product and certainly recommend its purchase --------- I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem TRULY exceptional - only VERY GOOD.  There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic certainly beats (by a very wide margin) --- the heavy vinegar aftertaste as evidenced in Tabasco and many other hot sauces.<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to always have it on hand and it is a true staple.<br /><br />Amazon prices the 17oz at $5.19 and the 27oz at $5.89. It is a true no-brainer to purchase the 28oz size.<br /><br />As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably ONLY want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too "hot" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh and sweeter note

review/text: I first saw this hot sauce in the Asian food section of a local store.  Dating back over a decade, I've been interested in various forms of spicy foods, and this looked interesting.  So, I gave it a try, and it now holds a special place in my heart and kitchen.  As other reviewers have said, this isn't the hottest sauce on the market, with a heat level around that of Tabasco sauce.  However, the heat is where the similarities end.  This sauce has a wonderful, but not overpowering, garlicky element and a thicker consistency than Tabasco.  I use this hot sauce in anything that needs to be brightened up or anything that I would normally use a hot sauce.  This goes great in gumbos, stews, soul food, and of course, Asian cuisine.  I simply cannot say enough good things about this product.

review/text: Huy Fong band Sriracha Sauce is an outstanding hot sauce, and relatively inexpensive.  Plus it comes in a fun squeeze bottle!<br /><br />Its medium heat, slightly less hot than the original Tobasco Sauce.  There is a strong garlic flavor and a little sweetness.  Its called an Asian sauce and is wildly popular in the American-Asian community but it truly can go on anything.  Its strong flavor and heat tends to overcome other flavors in food but sometimes that is exactly what you want. College students love it to pep up the food they eat.  This brand contains preservatives so it doesnt need to be refrigerated.  If you like some heat in your food but am tired of Tobasco Sauce give this a try.  Highly reommended.

This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the boarder line for several of my friend.<br /><br />This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out doesn't have enough "zing". It is also great to spread on chicken when grilling but watch the smoke when opening the grill lid, it is like OC spray if it gets into your eyes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: THE KING OF HOTSAUCES **READ THIS NOW**
review/text: I have been eating this hotsauce since I was two years old (1991). I have used this sauce on COUNTLESS foods at late night: Hotdogs, chips, noodles, you name it.<br /><br />My mouth is watering just from thinking about it right now. This hot sauce has saved more craptastic foods than it should and it deserves to be named KING OF HOT SAUCES.<br /><br />This is one of the most highly successful hot sauces on the market and did you know that they do not even advertise? YOU HEARD ME. THEY. JUST. SELL. From word of mouth, this hotsauce dominates<br />Vietnamese, Thai, Japanese, and even western and other restaurants as well!<br /><br />Any respectable eatery knows to carry this hot sauce, either in the front and on the table or at least tucked away in the back.<br />THIS IS NO JOKE. I LIVE FOR SRIRACHA. I WANT IT IN MY VEINS.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />EVERYTHING<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />NOTHING.<br /><br />TASTE: 5/5<br />DESIGN AND BEAUTY: 5/5<br />PRICE: 5/5<br />NOT BEING ABLE TO LIVE WITHOUT THIS HOTSAUCE: 1000000000000000000000000/5

review/text: This is habit forming. I don't know what it is but I want to put it on everything. This morning I put it on scrambled eggs before I placed them in a tortilla. It is not "just spicy." It has a great flavor and I can see me using it on so many things--especially eggs that I used to put teriyaki sauce on. Unlike the garlic/chili sauce in the jar (which is also wonderful) this doesn't burn your tongue off.

review/summary: *Where've You Been All My Life??!!  Say YES! to the Sriracha*
review/text: Ok. I'm sort of a chili-head. Been one since a summer in Mexico about thirty years ago. There's never less than at least eight bottles of different hot sauces in my fridge door. Green, yellow, red; mild, hot, and death-wish. This has got to be one of the most versatile sauces I have. I've used it on shrimp instead of cocktail sauce, or added it to the cocktail sauce. On fries or onion-rings instead of ketchup. On sandwiches instead of mayonnaise. Spice up tomato soup. On hamburgers, hot dogs, eggs. It can be added to anything with a tomato-based sauce. Even on a tossed salad, straight or mixed with some kind of salad dressing. Etc etc etc. But not oatmeal...yet.<br /><br />Just for the record: SERVING SIZE = 1 tsp.(yeah right). 5-calories. 0-grams of fat. 100-mg of sodium - 4% Daily Value. 1-gram of sugar/carbohydrate. 0-grams of protein. No vitamins or minerals as such. BUT FLAVOR!!<br /><br />Personally, I think the heat's fairly mild. Since reaction to heat levels is so subjective and various (some find this mild, some think it's too hot) the following may serve as a comparative reference. I'm using the Scoville Heat Unit rating system. You can look it up online if you're unfamiliar with it. Briefly, it rates the "heat" level by determining how many parts of sugar-water must be added until the heat is no longer detectable, using a panel of around five "judges." So it's subjective, & not as scientific as, say, high-performance liquid chromatography.<br /><br />Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - 2,200 SHU (Scoville Heat Units) - that is, basically, 2,200 parts of sugar-water must be added to one part of this to reach the point that the heat is no longer noticeable. It has 44% of the heat of a regular jalapeno pepper.<br /><br />Classic Tabasco Hot Sauce: 2,500-5,000 SHU<br />Tabasco Green Pepper Hot Sauce: 600-1,200 SHU<br />Tabasco Habanero Pepper Sauce:7,000-8.000 SHU<br />Trappey's Hot Sauce: 1,200-1,600 SHU<br />Texas Pete: 747 SHU<br />Cholula Hot Sauce: 3,600 SHU<br />Dave's Insanity Hot Sauce: 51,000 SHU<br />Pure Capsicin: 16 million SHU<br /><br />Generally: 0-5,000 SHU is considered mild. 5,000-20,000 SHU is medium. 20,000-70,000 SHU is hot. And anything above that is extremely hot.<br /><br />***** Several excellent websites that have ratings for different hot peppers and sauces are: [...] for peppers<br />[...] for heat ratings of around 150 different commercial sauces.<br />I think the best is [...]. It has BOTH peppers and sauces, AND it has color pictures of the peppers and the sauce bottles.<br /><br />Most people have used Classic Tabasco, & it can serve as a baseline for heat comparison. So this Sriracha is just a little bit less hot than the Tabasco you'll generally find in a restaurant when you ask for "hot sauce.".<br /><br />It's not going to REPLACE other hot sauces. But it's become a staple. I'm going to start getting the 3-pack of 28-ounce bottles.<br /><br />CHILI-HEADS UNITE!!!

review/summary: Not as hot as I feared and quite tasty!
review/text: For years I'd seen what I jokingly called the "screaming chicken" hot sauce out at various restaurants, but I was always too intimidated to try it, even though I love hot sauce.  The mostly non-English labeling and contents made me think it was probably wicked hot. As with so many things I was put off by, I'm kicking myself now that I've tried it, as Sriracha sauce isn't that hot and in fact has a nice touch of sweetness to it that makes it a great addition to Thai and Chinese dishes.  Truthfully it's nowhere near as hot as Tabasco sauce and on the Scoville Scale of hotness it ranks only at the 1,000-2,5000 range making it medium (Tabasco is the next level up).  As a self-confessed hot-head hot sauce lover I have to admit Sriracha has a really unique consistency that is thicker than Tabasco, yet blends well in many Asian dishes.  I typically love northern Thai food and Sriracha works well with it and with Szechwan as well.  Sriracha gives a nice pop of hot without being overpowering like some hot sauces or the truly hot Thai chilies that rate up at 50,000-100,000 on the Scoville scale.  If something is a bit too bland for my taste usually a bit of Sriracha gets my mouth watering. As I've learned, if you like to spice things up ask your server about the sauces and chilies and try a small little sample, but don't live in fear of hot sauces.  Perhaps the best thing about Sriracha is it's a known quality and consistent, unlike the bowls of sauces and chilies in some Asian restaurants (believe me...I've had some that really took my breath away and I like it HOT).  And certainly don't be intimidated by the "screaming chicken"; it might well become your new friend!

review/summary: Sriracha me!
review/text: Popcorn? Done. Chicken noodle soup? Done. Pizza? Done. Noodles? Done. Burgers? Done. Spaghetti? Done. The bottle doesn't lie.<br /><br />As a college student there are a few worries that are constantly on my mind (besides school): food and money. I usually get my Sriracha from convenience stores (which is waaaay cheaper than it is here). I love hot sauce in general (Tabasco, Louisiana Hot Sauce, Valentina, etc.), but this is definitely my favorite because of the versatility-- I put a squirt of Sriracha on just about everything. Since the heat isn't overpowering and the flavor compliments and adds to the taste of many dishes, it's great for spicing up otherwise bland dining hall food or even cooking with. The thick consistency also allows it to be used as a dip.

This stuff is delicious and I eat it on everything. Yes, it's hot. Yes, too much will numb your tongue. But it's not just heat. It's flavour. The chilies are yummy and garlic is ALWAYS a good idea.<br /><br />This isn't watery light hot sauce. It's thicker, like mustard. The consistency makes it practical to put on on pizza, burgers, and anything else you can think of. I have yet to put sriracha on something and not like it. Save yourself some time and buy a 6-pack. One bottle doesn't last very long at all because you will use it all the time.

I grew up and lived in Hawaii for 25 years and surrounded by asian foods This was usually a staple in many resturaunts but I had never tried it because I will admit I was not a huge hot sauce fan. When I finally tried this i was putting it on everything and now living in Maine I was so excited to find it in the local stores! It doesnt just add heat to a meal but so much flavor! And the natural color of it is so vibrant! The only thing I like better than this is the garlic chili sauce made by the same company. a good spoonful of that in something like a breakfast burrito is pure heaven!

review/text: This has become a fave in my house. I usually despise hot sauce and opt for cooking with hot chiles and spices. This is different. It has none of that strange flavor of Tabasco and it really is hot unlike Frank's Red Hot. You can truly taste the peppers. My hubby puts it on almost everything from tacos to eggs to empanadas and on and on. I just recently purchased the Sriracha cookbook and love it even more when used in cooking. Deviled eggs, spicy shrimp, and the best .wings ever made are thanks to this sauce. Delicious. And definitely cheaper in your local market. My supermarket doesn't carry it but I can find it at my fruit store and at the Asian grocery for less than half of what it is priced here for. If you cant find it elsewhere it is definitely worth the extra cost because it is that good and because one bottle will last a long time.

review/summary: One of the Greatest Sauces Known to Man
review/text: I won't say it's the absolute best hot sauce, but if you're serious about hot sauces, and you haven't tried Sriracha, you need to add this sauce to your collection now.  What I like most about this sauce is it tastes like my homemade sauce.  I can tell just by the way it tastes and smells that they use the same high quality ingredients that I use when making my sauce.  One whiff takes me back to picking jalape&ntilde;os out of my garden.  It's delicious blend of peppers, garlic, salt, and just the right amount of vinegar.  This sauce is thick.  This is not some red, runny liquid that you add to your food for heat.  This sauce is more like a thin paste.  I add it to ramen noodles, sushi, and just about anything else you would add hot sauce to, but since it's more like a thin paste than a runny liquid, it really sticks to the food.  It's hard to explain just how good this sauce is.  You have to try it for yourself to see what all the fuss is about.

review/text: Huy Fong Sriracha chili sauce is made almost entirely of chili peppers.  There isa bit of salt, garlic, and vinegar that adjust the taste, but only in small amounts.  Huy Fong brand sauce is often referred to as the "rooster bottle" because of its trademark white rooster.  This stuff is good but be warned--it is very hot.<br /><br />The consistency of the sauce is thinner than tomato catchup.  Even though Sriracha is a Thai food, Huy Fong is not a traditional Thai Sriracha.  Traditionally, the sauce is much sweeter (almost like a catchup).  The Huy Fong is designed more for American palates.  It is flavorful and spicy, but it is not sweet.<br /><br />If you like spicy food, this sauce can be used on just about anything.  Rice, steamed vegetables, eggs, red meats, sausages, poultry, stir fry, fajitas, and french fries are just some of the foods that I eat with the chili sauce almost daily.  My best advice when you first try it is to use it sparingly.  It is easy to pour far more on your food than you realize, and to make your food much stronger than you intended.

review/text: Oh Mighty Apollo! I do protest that you have given us a gift that we are unworthy of! Certainly there is no doubt that Sriracha was made by the gods themselves. With such zest and flavor, how can one resist the temptation? Sriracha, you are the sweet fire nectar that makes my life whole and I take pity on those that have not sampled your perfection. Your heat keeps my soul warm in the coldest moments of my life. Should the sun come down upon the earth and scorch the land and oceans, I would take refuge in the knowledge that the gods are creating a fresh batch of Sriracha that will soon rest upon my plate. Sriracha has proven to be perfect in every bottle, and to never leave my side when I need it. Truly there is no pleasure greater in this world than a full bottle of Sriracha.<br /><br />As for storage you can keep it anyway you please for Sriracha is independent of space-time itself and thus unaffected by the physical environment.

review/text: This stuff was included in a product I bought at a local merchant; read the plastic packet and found it on Amazon; it is spicy-asian hot chili so it's very warm (hot) especially for me; I have an idiosyncrasy of my physiology: beads of perspiration fall from my head when I eat this spice, so I only eat it alone.<br />It's crazy-funny but it happens, and it's a great flavor enhancement (the spice); if you like this type of chili, you'll like this sauce.  Not for the palate that avoids spicy foods.

review/summary: Who doesn't like Sriracha sauce?
review/text: I ordered it and it came in perfect condition a day earlier then expected. Heres a couple things I've always noted about Sriracha Sauce<br /><br />- Keep it sealed until you use it, Sriacha sauce DOES have a shelf life and doesn't taste as good when its not fresh<br />- The brighter red it is the better it tastes<br />- I'm pretty sure even though its delicious too much can cause serious pain to your stomach<br />- Remember the sauce going in is not as pleasurable as going out.<br /><br />That being said, enjoy :-)!

review/text: Yum. What doesn't go well with Sriracha? Yeah, you can buy this pretty much anywhere nowadays, but I live up in the hills and I'd rather stuff come to me. If you're in a similar situation I can earnestly recommend Huy Fong Sriracha.

review/summary: The Ketchup of Hot Sauces
review/text: The only reason for it not getting 5 stars is that, among my hot sauce collection, there's other sauces that go better with specific foods. I like Cholula and Garlic Tabasco are better on pizza. I favor Amazon(the hot sauce brand) Sriracha on chili, for a sweet/hot kick.<br /><br />There is no sauce more versatile than this one, though. You can safely put it on ANYTHING and it won't disappoint. The squeezable, perfectly-sized big bottle, with the green cap acting as a hose nozzle is the perfect vessel for a sauce with which you will be painting any edible thing you can find.

review/summary: not a true Thai sriracha but SO GOOD
review/text: This isn't the traditional Thai sriracha that's more runny. But as far as bottled stuff this is what I grew up with. On Pho, stir fries, dipping sauces and so much more.<br />It's spicy but not overly spicy but I love things Thai hot. It is flavorful. My husband doesn't like vinegar and while this has vinegar it's not over powering.<br />we always have an extra bottle in the pantry and one in the fridge we're using

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: Had not heard about this. Read about this in the Chicago Sun Times and had to try it.<br />Had it on pizza last night. Yummy.<br />My son mixed it in with his tuna salad along with a squirt of spicy mustard and it really gave a lot of flavor to his tuna salad sandwich. He said he had it before while visiting his brother.<br />From what I understand, this has been gaining popularity for some time now and I may be late to the party, but if you haven't heard of or tried this and like things hot, give it a go.

review/summary: Huy Fong Sriracha
review/text: Here's a story: About 15 years ago, I was at an upscale grocery store in Lancaster, Pa. and in their Oriental section I came face to face with about 30-40 different types of sauces. What to buy? Well the Huy Fong Sriracha just kept calling my name, so I bought it and was hooked immediately. Well being from the western side of the state, a few months later made the trip back home, stopped at a favorite restaurant ( the food is great in J-town) and wow - what did they have on the tables but Sriracha! Seems that this sauce had taken the city by storm while I was away! And of course - most people up here say 'I use that on everything'. Just great stuff.

review/summary: love this stuff
review/text: This stuff is awesome.  Its greatest attribute is the flavor, followed closely by heat.  It's hot, too, but not as hot as my favorite habanero-based sauces.  Where it lacks in heat -- for me, anyway -- it makes up for in flavor ten fold.<br /><br />Also, if you like bloody marys, squeeze off a few globs of Sriracha into your drink.  I've used it to compliment my already-favorite Zing-Zang bloody mary mix and it really adds to the kick.<br /><br />It's a bit expensive on Amazon, though.  I've found that Amazon has a very hard time competing with grocery stores like Kroger, Sam's Club, and Wal-mart as I am able to get this stuff way cheaper per bottle than what's on here.

review/summary: It's All About the Flavor!
review/text: I was cruising the aisles of my local "largest retailer in the US" super store one day and spotted the rooster-adorned bottle with the green lid...I had never tasted, noticed, or even heard of this stuff before, but as a hot sauce enthusiast I decided to give it a shot.  Serendipity, baby!  Sriracha (hey Pat Sajak, can I buy another vowel?  how do you pronounce this anyway?!) is now my absolute favorite hot sauce, and I have about 20+ varieties on the shelf at this very moment.  One of the crucial elements to a good hot sauce is the right blend of heat and flavor, and it's a delicate balance.  Some get the flavor but not the heat (Frank's), while others get the heat right but lack flavor (yes I am talking to you, you plethora of generic Habanero-based hot sauces).  Sriracha, however, nails it both ways.  It packs some legitimate kick, but it isn't an endurance contest either.  When it's there, it wakes you up, kicks you in the pants, and you know your dish has been revved up a few notches.  But you wouldn't want to presume this stuff upon an unsuspecting novice lest they drink all of your beer, er I mean soda, in a desperate search for relief.  But right there with the just-right heat is the sumptuous flavor that goes so well with so many foods.  Unlike many of my other beloved hot sauces, Sriracha doesn't skew very heavily toward the vinegar end of the spectrum (vinegar is a listed ingredient but it's low on the flavor profile).  Instead, the sugar, garlic, salt, and chili pepper combination creates a sweet, salty, almost nutty flavor that enhances far more than it overwhelms.  I use it on nearly everything: pizza, soups, sandwiches, chips, eggs, baked beans, burgers, and the list goes on and on.  This is definitely the most versatile hot sauce I've found...<br />I feel somewhat ashamed for writing such a long, rambling review for a freaking hot sauce, but give it a shot and you'll understand - Sriracha isn't just a hot sauce, it's a way of life.

review/summary: Very good sauce...in it's proper place
review/text: In it's class (asian), Sriracha is without equal.  Most people not from Minnesota or Wisconsin should be able to eat this.  But I must disagree with most reviewers and warn you...it is not a sauce for all purposes.<br /><br />If you're looking for a general-purpose pepper sauce, then be aware that peppers are the third child in this mix, behind eldest sibling - garlic, and middle child - sugar.<br /><br />Because of that, it will compete with the flavor of most foods, not compliment them.  This sauce will not be a component of what you are eating, it will be THE flavor, dominating all else.  That's OK for bland dishes, but a disaster for others that have already complex flavors.<br /><br />If you like the classic asian combination of initially sweet, then lingering heat, you cannot go wrong with Sriracha.<br /><br />If yer from Minnesota or Wisconsin, stay away from 'dis an' stick with dat super-spicy tomato ketchup, ya betcha!

review/text: I bought a bottle of this at a local market, tried it on a sandwich and some boiled shrimp, then tossed it in the trash. Way too hot for me and it completely overwhelms the flavors of the other ingredients while adding only heat and a faint hint of garlic.<br /><br />If there is anything subtle or educated about your food preferences, don't buy this sauce.

review/summary: Well, this is me now.
review/text: Well, I'm now truly 'Ratch free.<br /><br />And all I have to say is, "Wow.  I never thought it would happen to me."  I can't believe what's all happened since I was found face-down in the grocery store aisle with a half-full bottle of Sriracha stuck up one nostril and and the other half the bottle dribbling out the other nostril.<br /><br />Worse, my mouth was stuffed full of sirloin tip samples that I - at least this is what I'm told - wrenched from the Sample Lady at the condiment end-cap.  Evidently, I saw how she dabbed her meat bites in a little plastic cup of house-brand barbeque sauce and the rest...is...my shame.<br /><br />The scene I made wasn't pretty. Suffice it to state, 22 people had Sriracha stains on their shirts and...that bottle stuck up my nose?  It was actually the third bottle I abused - the first one  used to drown the sample tray of steak tips and the second...well, I drank it like a little kid drinking Kool-aid on a hot day.<br /><br />My rage-filled rampage against the condiment companies and purveyors of flavorlessness saw no bounds.  I have a hazy memory of running stiff-armed, along an entire row of catsup bottles cascading them onto the linoleum.  The dull thuds of taught red plastic bouncing off the floor still haunts my dreams...<br /><br />Somewhere in the moments that followed, I found a frozen salmon and used it to knock out whole sections of Mexican, Italian, Chinese and fake Wasabi sauces into space - bang!  bang!  bang!  I laughed maniacally whenever the obscenely expensive jars of boutique blech cracked two, three, four aisles away.<br /><br />By then the local news had showed up - virtually none of my howl against the Jalepeno Junta was fit for broadcast.<br /><br />Anyway, I woke up at the Scandinavian Cuisine Sanitarium two days later knowing that I could never touch Sriracha Sauce again.  But the facts were much harsher - I didn't have a choice.  That day, the judge signed the orders authorizing involuntary tastebudechtomy.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, I won't be eating Sriracha any more.  I have a heck of a bill to work off at the Food Mart.<br /><br />Stick to Catsup.
