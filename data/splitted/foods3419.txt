review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I bought this through Amazon because the Keurig site didn't have any available.  The prices were about the same as if I bought it here or on the Keurig site but my wife has been waiting for some time for this product to come out again.  She's mentioned it's the closest thing to the Pumpkin Spice Latte that Starbucks gives but personally I don't like that type of stuff so I'll go on her word about it. :)  I'm truthfully happy that Amazon had this item.<br /><br />The only thing bad about this product was that I was expecting the the K-Cups to be organized in their smaller boxes and when I got it, they were flung every which way in the box.  I made sure the count was 50 and moved on, but to not really have much storage space (with the exception of the pull out storage drawer and a spindle, both already full of my favorites) I had to put this big box right beside my Keurig.... it truly takes up counter space but because my wife likes it alot, I don't think it will be a problem.

review/summary: Didn't Blow My Hair Back
review/text: We are huge Green Mountain fans and excitedly ordered this coffee earlier this month, but I must admit that it doesn't have a true, what I would call, "pumpkin spice" flavor.  It's more like nutmeg and cinnamon flavored water.  I tend to like bolder coffee (I'm a Double Black Diamond gal), and was thinking that this is why I was let down, but my husband (who is a Breakfast Blend guy) didn't like it either.  I compared the flavor of this coffee to some coffee that we purchased in a local store, which was also entitled, "Pumpkin Spice," and the other coffee was way more rich with pumpkiny flavor than this one.  I will most likely finish the box but I'm not clamoring for it every morning.  Hey maybe I'll offer it to unsuspecting guests!  If you're just looking for something seasonal, it might be a good buy.  But if you're a purist and expect the flavors to run deep, you might want to look elsewhere.

review/summary: Takes like hot water - no flavor
review/text: My wife recently purchased a pack of these K-Cups.  First my wife tried one on the normal cup setting (the one in the middle) and the cup that was produced tasted like hot water with just a hint that there might be some flavor.  So she turned it all the way down to the smallest cup with the same result.  My wife did try one more again a few days later and got a good cup so I went for it.  And again the same result, a regular size cup that was horrible, then another tiny cup that was horrible.  I won't be buying these again.  Perhaps Green Mountain doesn't care but $18.00 is a lot of money to literally poor down the drain, but I do.

review/text: I really like the Pumpkin spice K Cups. I think they are a great seasonal flavor. I bought the pack for fall and I have enjoyed them.<br /><br />The other day I went to a coffee house and got a cup of pumpkin spice coffee and the amount of spice in it was much more than the k cup. Since then, I the K cups just seem watered down.<br /><br />So it's a great product for at home, but doesn't compare with a coffee house pumpkin spice.

review/summary: Delicious Light Spicy Flavor
review/text: I came across this particular flavor at a local store quite by accident. If you are a bold/strong coffee person, it may be too light on "coffee" flavor as cited in some of the reviews, but if you accept it on its own merit instead of expecting a bold coffee flavor, it's a delicious light spicy flavor. I love it. I will definately stock up on a few boxes to hide in the pantry for the rest of the year since it is a limited edition. I brewed mine with 8 ounces of water and added a touch of milk. With every sip, I keep saying "mmmm delicious". This definately gave a good mood boost to my day.

The only downside is that the coffee itself is a light roast and I feel the spice flavor would go better with a medium roast.  However, you can't go wrong with this choice, it's a must have for the season!

I am very glad that Amazon offers such a large quantity so cheap! 50 count sounds like a lot, but if you love Pumpkin Spice then you will find them disappearing quite fast!

Pair it with some pumpkin spice creamer found at your local grocery store and you have a delicious drink! I don't care for these without creamer, but I love sugar so... super price and a great product!

review/summary: Good pumpkin spice flavor, but pretty weak
review/text: This coffee smells great and has a nice pumpkin flavor to it (as advertised), but it brews very weak in a Keurig.  I am not sure if it is just the roast of the bean or simply the pure quantity of grounds that were packaged in these specific k-cups, but I like my coffee stronger, with a bit more of a punch.  This would be perfect and a bit more flavorful if it didn't taste as weak/watered down. :(

review/summary: A Visit to the Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado. The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags. The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored. Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas. He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us. We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room. The smell of peppermint was overpowering. It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint. What a rush! The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry. For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea. Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder. The events of that day have changed my life forever. Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet. I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer. On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour. Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/summary: Truly Heavenly
review/text: While paying nearly $7 for a candy bar may seem overly indulgent, you'll get over it the moment you take your first bite! I used to treat myself with a "Kirsch" candy bar occasionally when I was stationed in Germany, 30 years ago.  I'm thrilled to see they are still around. Ah, I clearly recall savoring one of them on my way home from work on the "S-Bahn".  Sitting there in total luxury on the train after a long day at the hospital, I'd open the paper wrapper, and sloooowly pull back the foil to expose the first row of sections. Mmmm-gotta say, the flavor of the chocolate along with the cherry liquor made my day. And, during the winter time, I coincidentally found that by the time I'd finished the bar and got off the train, there was nothin' nippin' at my nose OR my toes on the walk home!  It didn't even concern me on one occasion when I got home to find my husband attempting to flush an entire German cheesecake down the toilet, rather than take it out to the trash. I simply pulled up the bathroom carpet and watched the fun.  It ends the way you think it would.  But I was in my Happy Place.

review/text: This is a refreshing well rounded tea.  I tried making it in a tea ball, but the leaves expand quite a bit, and I found the flavor to be better when made with the leaves loose in the teapot.  Let it steep a little bit longer than a regular tea bag.  Also, you can refresh the pot with more boiling water and get a second pot of tea and a weak third pot - this is because the leaves are large.

Here in the South, they look at you like you are crazy for wanting anchovies with your pizza.  Also, I love them on Greek Salads.<br /><br />I was very frustrated trying to buy anchovies in this part of the country until I realized I could buy them from [...] by the case.  Crown Prince Flat Anchovies are a first class product and I could not ask for better anchovies.  I happen to like them packed in Olive Oil as crown Prince packs them and their 2 ounce cans are a perfect size.  I just take one of the tins out of the pantry when I need anchovies.<br /><br />After ordering my first case of crown Prince Anchovies, they arrived in a timely fashion, free freight and the tins were in perfect condition.  From now on I will be a steady buyer of these great tasting and well packed anchovies. I could not ask for a better product.<br /><br />Lee<br />Houston, TX

Into the cart they went. This evening I had the can with some very excellent crispbreads. Well, these Crown Prince anchovies were excellent!

review/text: I switched to this because one of my 4 cats was having chronic diarrhea- he had eaten a chemical soaked sponge when he was younger, and it did permanent damage to his lower intestine. He was also going #2 outside the box, hence my noticing and isolating the problem. The vet advised some pro/pre-biotic dry foods, so I went right away to see if Natural Balance had one, and I found this. Cats took to it right away, and within 24 hours my problem cat had close to normal stools again, and this has been consistent for three months. Not completely normal, but way way better than the pile of sludge from before. He seems to be alot more active to me as well. Also, he used to have bad, and I mean DEADLY gas..appears to be gone.<br /><br />My cats did NOT like the seafood version of this food. Anyway, I use this dry exclusively now, and the cats gobble it up. No more stink bombs!

review/text: This is not a review of the chips themselves, they are really wonderful.<br /><br />This is a review of the seller, Liquid Nation, with whom I had a terrible experience when buying these chips through them.<br /><br />Although it appeared that they had the 9oz packages in stock, I got a message from them saying they had bigger bags in stock instead and I accepted.<br /><br />However, when I received the package, almost all the bags were expired, some for MONTHS!!!<br /><br />I have contacted the seller and they have ignored the issue and did not take care of it.<br /><br />BEWARE OF LIQUID NATION!

review/summary: Back to Nature 100% Natural Sunflower Basil Crackers 6.5 oz.
review/text: These crackers are 100% natural, contain no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors and they are hydrogenated oil free.  The flavor is mild and crunchy.<br /><br />The crackers are made with unbleached wheat flour and whole grain wheat flour.  These crackers are so mild in flavor and they won't take away from dips or other toppings.  They are very fresh and crunchy!<br /><br />The crackers also contain safflower oil, sunflower seeds, whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, sea salt, basil, parsley, black pepper, malted barley extract, baking soda, onion powder, garlic powder, soy lecithin, vitamin E, and soy.<br /><br />The box contains 6 servings (17 crackers).  Each serving is 140 cal., 5 g fat, 1.5 g polyunsaturated fat, 3 g monounsaturated fat, 220 mg sodium, 75 mg potassium, 20 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 2 g sugar, and 3 g protein.<br /><br />The crackers are made by Back to Nature Foods located in Madison, WI.  Made in the USA!  I give these crackers 3/5 for flavor, 5/5 for texture, and 5/5 for maintaining Earth conscious care.<br /><br />The carton is made of 100% recycled paperboard and the ink is derived from vegetables.  The company also supports the Nature Conservancy (Protecting nature, preserving life).

review/summary: Just Eat The Box
review/text: I was seriously disappointed in the lack of flavor in these crackers.<br />I give the company an "A" for effort in trying to give these crackers<br />some flavor by adding sunflower kernels and fragrant basil.  That addition<br />was what persuaded me to eat 3 of them.  But I couldn't go for a fourth.<br />Ugly is ugly no matter how much make-up you put on and the seasoning is just<br />make-up on an ugly cracker.<br />If you do manage to eat them all, just cut up the box and see if you can<br />taste the difference. They should be a Weight Watchers item.<br />I'm going to the store now to buy some Wheat Thins.....

review/summary: Great variety that will last for many seasons!
review/text: This is much bigger than what I expected which is great if you bake tons of cookies for Christmas. If not, you can save it for several years to come or try to "shake" them in for Valentine's (red), St Patrick (green), maybe Cinco de Mayo or Columbus Day? (mix). The openings on top are barely wide enough for a decent amount of sprinkles to pour out. They are not all that tastey but its just sprinkles for decorating so no problem. I was only able to use the colored sugar ones on my spritz. The other decorations won't stick well or will go everywhere but the cookie. I guess the big ones are better for cupcakes or a bigger cookie. Definitely something to have only if it's below 10 bucks.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This hot'n'spicy mix has some serious potential for addiction - crunchy, tangy, and more munchable than it has any right to be. The mix includes cashews, fried moong, and three or four other kinds of bits, each with their own texture. This bag won't last long.<br /><br />So why not the fifth star? Some of the little crunchy bits are tiny, hair-thin noodle-like things. They taste great, but they're so small and fragile that they're as likely to end up on the carpet as in your mouth. (A spoon makes sense for eating these.) And, as much as I like the taste, it comes up just a bit short of that indescribable something that turns a pleasant treat into a gotta-have.<br /><br />I'll enjoy the bag (not at one sitting, though it's tempting). Still, I'll try one of the other flavors next time.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

review/summary: The best food I've ever witnessed my dogs eat
review/text: We have an eight year old Pomeranian and an eight month old Papillon that refuse to not eat one another's food. Our dilemma was that we needed something easily digestible for our old-timer as well as a protein rich meal for our pup. We also caught wind of the dog food filler conspiracy and, reluctantly, switched from our supermarket bought, corn meal heavy brand to one of the higher quality names.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VIWOFM">Nature's Recipe Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Easy to Digest Chicken Rice and Barley Meal, 15 Pound Bag</a> was our first choice and it seemed to go well. Our Pom's bowels became a thing of regularity wonder and our Pap was growing big and strong...kind of. We began to notice some hotspots on our Pap and excessive scratching from both dogs. Our eyes were peeled for fleas and we treated the hotspots with topical ointment to no avail. I was making a return visit to the pet-meds section of our local pet superstore when I was cornered by a sales rep from Nutro. Before I could avoid him he had already asked me what dog food we currently used. I told him, and he immediately asked me if we were having any skin issues. I was sold before he told me what I needed to buy. He filled me in on the idea that the particular blend of Nature's Recipe that we were using lacked some essential nutrients key to healthy skin and coat.<br /><br />We have been using Nutro Ultra Small Breed for several weeks now and I could not be more pleased. Our Pom's insides are still working like a clock and, amazingly, our Pap's hotspots and itching spells have already been healed. I love this food...and I think my dogs like it too.<br /><br />Just one warning: when our older dog was eating the same quantity of Nutro as he was his previous foods, he began to put on weight fairly rapidly. In other words, one might want to monitor intake and the associated weight impact for a while and then adjust accordingly.

review/text: I have eaten these sardines since I was a little boy. They are by far my favorite and the best. I like the fact that they are small, oak-smoked and from the North Atlantic. I have tried other sardines in tomato sauce but they do not compare.<br /><br />I usually eat them on saltine crackers with sandwich spread (the mayonnaise with pickle relish stuff), a squeeze of lemon, a dash of tabasco, salt & pepper and voila. I have also had them on just crackers.<br /><br />I can't find them at any local supermarket anymore. Thank goodness for Amazon.

review/text: This coffee is infinitely better than the Douwe Egberts coffee that comes with the Senseo. I like my coffee black - no cream, sugar, or anything else, so I like to really taste my coffee and can spot bad coffee right away.<br /><br />No bitterness, much smoother, and stronger than Douwe Egberts coffee. Also, each pod makes an 8 ounce cup versus 4 ounce per Douwe Egberts pod. The pods are individually wrapped, and you can smell the freshness when you tear open a pod packet; when I opened a Douwe Egberts packet - there was only a faint smell versus the strong, fresh smell from these packets.<br /><br />I have even - accidently - made 2-8oz cups of coffee with ONE of these pods - and the second cup wasn't bad (a little weak, but not bad - some folks that prefer weaker coffee would have thought it was great).<br /><br />I have tried four of BetterPods' varieties, Kona, French Roast, Columbian, and Sumatra Mandheling - with the French Roast being my favorite due to my preference for a darker roasted coffee - but all being equally great otherwise. I think I am going to throw away the Douwe Egberts pods that came with my Senseo, or find some other non-beverage use for them.<br /><br />I have also made espresso using Ecopads and the Senseo's 1-cup mode with some Starbuck's Espresso Roast... not quite as strong as a true coffee house espresso, but very good nonetheless, and much easier to setup than my old home-brew espresso machine... Now if BetterPods would only come out with an espresso roast (hint-hint)!

Short of carrying a pair of scissors in my purse they are worthless.  They charged me $10.50 to ship them to me.  It cost me over $12.00 at the post office to ship them back and they only refunded the actual price of the defective product.  It cost me over $23.00 to deal with this company.  Beware!

review/text: Dulse is so well liked in my home that a small bag of it from the health food store is gone quickly.  It can be eaten straight from the bag, used in soups and run it under water and it becomes more pliable and less chewy which is how my son likes it.<br />I was very happy to find it in a 1 pound bag and that it is organic.  It isn't treated with any chemicals.  It is much more economical to buy it in this one pound bag than paying $6 to $7 dollars for a 2 oz bag.  It tastes similar to seaweed but not such a strong iodine taste like you swallowed sea water at the beach.  However it isn't suited for sushi because of the shape and texture, it is better eaten as a snack, used in salads or soup.

Scone should be dense and heavier almost like a biscuit, but this was lighter along line of a muffin.  I may just add Whyman frozen wild blueberries (get at most grocery stores) to a mix of Dassant Vanilla Scone mix (from amazon), which will give the amazing Blueberry taste I was looking for and the usual scone texture, which is what makes them so satisfying.

Or, in an orgy of extravagance,use with butter over waffles.  It's unique.  Reminds one of the scent of the air during a walk through a pine forest during a dry, warm day.<br />You can make a simple syrup to help stretch it out but thin it separately at each use, not all at once.

review/text: I bought some small jars of this on a trip to Beaune, and thought, enh, mustard souvenirs from Burgundy, they're a good local travel gift but probably just average mustard.<br /><br />Wrong! This is DELICIOUS. My husband and I ate some with a grilled steak one night, looked up at each other and said, "Wow, this is REALLY GOOD!"  I never conisdered myself a mustard fan, but this was so good I even ate a little straight out of the jar.  It's got a pleasant horseradish-like heat to it (that's not an ingredient though) and it isn't too vinegary like lots of other dijon mustards are.<br /><br />We looked for every opportunity to use this, polished off the little jar pretty quickly, and finally found this larger size from the Amazon seller Pastacheese.<br /><br />As soon as it arrived, I cleaned out the fridge and threw out three other types of Dijon mustard we had in there. This is off-the-charts good.

It's just mustard, no sugar or other stuff, so the ingredients have to be really good (not bitter needing sugar to conteract the bitterness)with a nice bite!  Friends love it too, so I give it as gifts.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I don't like to write one star reviews, but unfortunately, this product hardly deserves the one star.  The rice and the seasoning both ruin the soup.  The rice was still pretty hard after five hours and the seasoning seemed stale.  I found myself reaching for the Tapatio sauce to give the soup flavor.  Maybe I got a stale batch?  I don't know.  I had hoped this would be a good slow cooker soup for the upcoming winter months, but I am going to have to toss the rest of the packages because no one in my family will eat it.  Bummer.

review/summary: Mine came out great!
review/text: I was surprised to see a one star review for this product, so I had to add my own experience. Mine came out fantastic! I added some carrots and celery and put in lots of chicken (maybe twice as much as the recipe called for), since I like soup to be more "stew" and less "soup". I added some "Better than Bouillon" instead of salt. I suspect that the "low" setting might be an error. I had to increase the temp to high and add an hour to the cooking time for the rice to be done. Next time I'll just cook it on high instead of low. My family and friends loved it and I am ordering more!

review/summary: The best espresso money can buy!
review/text: Serious cuban coffee/espresso lovers, look no further!  This espresso is so rich.  Its smooth intense flavor with the right amount of earthiness that is deeply satisfying to drink and savor.  Pilon is perfect for your espresso machine, pot or drip coffee maker, if you prefer a strong, rich coffee.  You want to store this coffee in an air tight container at room temperature so the oils can stay consistent for that fresh, fabulous flavor everytime.  I'm not a local Floridian, but I love good espresso and with a good equipment like Gaggia or better, you want espresso that can take the heat and render its flavor and Pilon delivers wonderfully!

review/summary: GREAT espresso!
review/text: As an Italian grown up in Italy, I am used to a strong creamy espresso coffee first thing in the morning.<br />Living outside Italy it's a bit of a problem because the most available Italian brands of Espresso coffee are NOT the ones I like, like Lavazza, the superexpensive Illy, Kimbo or others.<br />I have tried before Cafe Pilon and I found it decent, but still not like what I REALLY like.<br /><br />Then few months ago I was working in Raleigh NC for a couple of weeks and I was staying in an apartment, and I bought "by accident" the Pilon Gourmet.<br />This coffee is what I REALLY like!<br /><br />Creamy, strong, without that bitter underflavour that sometimes accompany other strong coffees. To watch it coming out from the Italian espresso machine thick and creamy is an experience, and I LOVE the flavour.<br />Pilon Gourmet is MY morning coffee!

review/summary: Tasty and Convenient
review/text: I am a big fan of Cinnabon cinnamon rolls, so when I came across these bars I knew I had to try them out. Having a convenient Cinnabon snack whenever I feel like it is the ultimate in small everyday pleasure. The bars are fairly small and relatively low on calories (150 cal). They can be eaten either cold or heated up, and I definitely prefer the latter option. The microwaving instruction call for them to be microwaved for just 3 seconds, but I've found this to be too short. I recommend at least 12 seconds or maybe even more. The bars taste pretty authentic, but not quite as well as the actual Cinnabon buns (naturally). Nonetheless, they are tasty enough to satisfy your cravings. I highly recommend them.

review/text: I like how the chews taste faintly like the real fruit. However, only eat a few chews, because I accidentally ate ALL of them in the same day, and felt sick of them afterward. Now I really don't want to ever eat them again. The mango and melon smell a bit odd when you open them, but taste fairly good.<br /><br />I was bummed because I dislike artifical and real banana flavor, and the majority of the chews were banana! I still ate them, it's just that I wasn't a big fan of them.<br /><br />The chewiness was odd, kind of tough, yet kind of soft.<br /><br />If you like chewy fruits in exotic flavors, then buy them.

review/text: Have you ever had a popcorn snack and thought, "Was this popped a few years ago? The popcorn is stale and tough." Well, that's something that does not happen with Poppycock. Likewise, I've eaten popcorn with a glaze that is so thin you can't taste it. That's also something that never happens with Poppycock.<br /><br />Poppycock is so much better than other popcorn snacks that they shouldn't even be in the same category. Poppycock also doesn't use peanuts. Instead it has almonds, pecans, or cashews. To say it's the premium popcorn snack would be to damn with faint praise.<br /><br />Ok, it's more expensive than it's "competitors" but then nothing else is competitive with Poppycock. If you are worth a premium snack, the Poppycock is the one you want.

review/text: Amazon kindly refunded my purchase price of this item, as upon receipt it was rancid.  Also, all the bags were one hard "brick."  I had to pound it with a meat tenderizer to break it up (I was determined to try it, in spite of the rancid smell). I was disappointed, as I am always searching for a honey oat granola that does not contain raisins.  I was looking forward to a wonderful granola, and the packages I received were inedible.<br /><br />I even offered it to my horses and they curled their lip at the smell.  So again, I hope that I was just unfortunate in receiving an old batch of the product; but at that price, I won't try again.  Hopefully someone else will have had a better experience and will have a good review for what appears to be a great raisin-free granola.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing. Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

review/text: Perfect for kids who can't have a heavy breakfast in the morning before school. My daughter semi-suffered for a year and a half before I remembered this stuff. I had never had it as a child, but I have always remembered its jingle: "You're gonna love it in an instant!". Well, its true- you will. Flavors included are: dark chocolate, french vanilla, chocolate malt, strawberry, and milk chocolate. My daughter said that the dark and the milk chocolate tasted alike, and she was crazy about the malt-flavored packet. I tried the strawberry and vanilla, and was suprised that they were good as well (I was expecting a too sweet, artificial taste to them). I am not a vitamin freak, but I love the fact that anyone in my family can get some vitamins and protein in them from just gulping this enjoyable beverage down. Made on equipment that also processes soy. Delish (I had a friend that turned me on to this word back in '97, so beat it, Rach(a)el Ray!)!

review/summary: Mmmm, when chewing cereal is too much work...
review/text: These are pretty nutritious.  Certainly more so than a bowl of most cereals.  My kids are liking these primarily because it's different than usual eggs/toast or cold cereal, which are usually on the menu for breakfast.  Probably the same at your house, too.  And I imagine that these would be a time saver if we're running late.  The flavors are good.  The dark chocolate doesn't taste much different from the regular chocolate, unless you're trying them side-by-side, so I didn't even offer the difference to my kids.  They won't know.  Our overall favourites are the chocolate malt and vanilla, though.  I wish there wasn't quite so much chocolate (6 packets of the 10 are a chocolate based flavor.)<br /><br />To make these healthier, I plan to get some plain Greek yogurt and clear fiber powder and add a bit to each drink.  That ought to make these more filling also.  And, FYI, the flavor of the drinks should be sufficiently strong to overshadow any yogurty taste.

The carb control granola helps me control my glucose numbers and allows me something sweet to eat as a snack. This product is not chunky so you can add this to yogurt, cereal, or toppings to ice cream.<br /><br />I liked the sweetness level even though apple flavoring from the low glycemic fruit juice dominated the maple flavoring. I was expecting more finger food or larger chunks but the smaller size works well for adding to yogurt. I sometimes combine this with my morning bowl of fiber cereal to give it sweetness rather than using artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Price is comparable for the size package.

review/summary: My favorite hot sauce
review/text: I first tried this sauce at a California Tortilla and instantly had to have my own bottle.  It has a great smokey flavor and plenty of heat to go along with it.  What I like about this sauce is that the heat doesn't overwhelm the flavor, they combine to enhance whatever dish it is you add it to.

review/summary: Love this coffee flavor!!
review/text: I love the Da Vinci Hazelnut coffee syrup and it's so hard to find in local stores. You can order from Amazon in packs of three and it lasts a long time. I love it!!

review/summary: The Best K-cup maker
review/text: I have been a Keurig / K-cup user for about 3 years.  I have tried truck loads of different brands and flavors.  I like strong, robust coffee.  I do not like flavored or "weak" coffees.  If you have the same taste, then "Coffee People" make the best coffees for you.  They are all robust, taste great, have no bitterness, and if you want to make a larger than usual cup of coffee (if your machine can adjust the setting sizes), than these work great for that.  Any of there flavors are nice.

review/summary: Finally! A strong K-Cup.
review/text: I've tried a lot of k-cups that purport to be strong (Green Mountain Double Black Diamond, Coffee People Black Tiger, Newman's Organic), but this is the closest I've come to my own strong brew.
