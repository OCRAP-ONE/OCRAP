review/summary: This is hands-down, my favorite coffee on my Keurig coffee maker.
review/text: Hi!  I have that coffee maker at home - the Keurig thing.  I love it.  And I love coffee - I have some every single morning.  I can't live without it.  I love my coffee maker - and I tried many, many, MANY of the numerous types of coffee that are available for it via these "K-Cups".  Let me tell you, that as an avid coffee drinker, this is hands-down my #1 favorite brand to make at home. It's mild, it's not overly bold, it's nice and mellow, it's not bitter in the least, it's not watery, it's PERFECT.  I like my coffee with milk and sugar and this one is just the BEST.  I am sick of the "Extra Bold" coffees they make for this machine - they all taste the same and are just too harsh for me.  This one - this Caribou one - ROCKS.

review/summary: This is what coffee is supposed to taste like
review/text: Wonderful coffee. I have tried many different k-cups, and like Goldilocks, I found some to be to strong, some to be too weak, but this one is just right. No bitterness, no acidity, just pure coffee taste. I enjoy flavored coffees but sometimes just want a plain old coffee, and this is THE ONE for me. After having experimented with many others, I will stick with this one.

review/summary: Caribou Pulls a Fast One on Loyal Customers
review/text: I've been drinking Caribou Blend for years and it is just right for my taste... or at least it was. Got a new shipment in and I noticed a color change on the K-cup, orange to light green. Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers. If and when prices return to normal, watch the return to the old orange based on "we listen to our customers" and more corporate-speak BS.

review/summary: Caribou Wins Hands Down
review/text: After sampling about every K-Cup out there, I have to say the Caribou blend is the best one for daily, regular coffee drinkers. I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees, nor do I love the dark, bitter, bold types. I simply want a smooth cup of Joe I can drink daily and feel comforted it will be consistently the same tasting and awesome. Caribou's are the perfect fit for me. I would go as far as to say that brewing Caribou in K-Cups at home has kept me from going to Starbucks for over a month...it just tastes better!

review/summary: Amazing coffee!
review/text: I received a Keurig machine for Christmas and was eager to sample all of the coffees that were included.  Unfortunately the Caribou Blend was absent in my sampler.  Lucky for me I decided to pick up a box of this coffee once the sampler was depleted.  I can sum up my experience with one word... "WOW!"  This coffee is very smooth but loaded with flavor, even on the largest cup setting.  I was taken aback when I took my first sip; the subtle hint of berry and chocolate was so pleasant.  I would say this is one of the best, if not THE best, coffees I've ever tasted.

review/summary: What happened to my old Caribou Blend??
review/text: LOVED Caribou Blend.  Found a great price at Amazon, ordered enough to last 5 or 6 months.  K-Cups had a different logo than my previous purchases, and tasted sooooo bad I couldn't drink it.  After opening several boxes and brewing several cups from each box, each cup as bad as the last, I decided to return the unopened boxes.  BUYER BEWARE--I had no idea that the seller would refuse to take back or refund anything on "consumable" products.  I'm out a lot of money for really bad coffee and can't find another brand that is as good as my old Caribou Blend.  Any suggestions??

We like Green Mountain's Breakfast blend and Doughnut Shop the best as our "Normal" cup of coffee and Newman's Own Extra Bold when we need a Starbucks type of brew. If you love a light brew then you will love this.

I would encourage everyone to at least take a look at the Keurig site and compare what they have to offer in the way of coffee and prices.  I believe you will be very satisfied.  Free shipping, 10% off when you order 4 boxes, coffee club rewards program.  Just take a look.

review/summary: Pretty much a perfect all-around drinking coffee
review/text: This coffee is just great.  Not overpowering, but still relatively complete, even when brewed as a "large" cup, or even 2X small -- many of the K-cups come out tasting thin when you do this, but not this one!  It's so mellow that some may find it to be lacking in unique personality, and I suppose that being a "medium-bodied" blend, it doesn't shout out anything at the drinker.  Still, this is a very nice, all-around coffee that is great for everyday drinking.

It's sooo smooth, perfect strength, absolutely and utterly delicious! I use HALF the sugar and cream  that I normally do. It's really THAT GOOD. Haha, on a personal note, my hubby has been drinking this at work for a month. He made the cup for me, and waited anxiously to see what I thought... You know...the first thing out of my mouth was..."If GOD drank coffee, he would drink THIS coffee" hahaha...no joke. Deeelish!

review/summary: Caribou Coffee Blend K-Cups for Keurig K-Cup Brewers
review/text: Caribou Coffee Blend is our family's favorite K-Cup flavor. It's strong and smooth in the extra bold package so you can make a max-size cup without it tasting weak. Other flavors we've tried (and like, just not quite as well) are Green Mountain Double Black Diamond, Coffee People Black Tiger, Brooklyn Bean Colombian, Wolfgang Puck Chef's Reserve Colombian. The Caribou Coffee packs seem to be more fully filled with nitrogen which makes them puffy and seems like it may keep the coffee fresher.<br /><br />NOTE: We tend not to prefer dark roast so this review may not help you if you like darker roasts.<br /><br />Also, if you read the other reviews, AZS was correct that these 80 count packs are cheaper at S*ms. Wish Amazon was a little more competitive on the price.

The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it.

There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness.

review/summary: A very good middle-of-the-road blend for those who just want a plain old cup of coffee...
review/text: The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done.  We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild.  I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma.  It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste.  This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried.  We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.

review/summary: Go Caribou!
review/text: OK, so I'm a high school English teacher and a total Caribou addict.  There is not one in my city, but whenever I travel to Minneapolis, I hit a Caribou at least three times a day.  My school librarian got a Keurig coffee maker and made me a cup of this stuff.  I was immediately hooked!  I started buying boxes of these K-Cups so I could enjoy Caribou coffee all day long while teaching, and now students see a smile on my face, cup in hand, and my coffee-fueled lessons have been taken to a whole new level.  While I'm brewing my coffee, I communicate more closely with the librarian, and this has resulted in some collaborative efforts between myself and the librarian, particularly concerning research, which in turn positively impacts the education of my students.  I savor every delicious drop of my Caribou coffee while the other teachers choke down the weak and bitter rat pee in the teachers' lounge.  Guess who looks forward to coming to work every morning?  Thanks, Keurig, for making Caribou a part of my daily life!

review/summary: Good entry in the K-cup portfolio
review/text: Caribou makes a series of coffees; my current favorite is Mahogany. However, this, too is nice on the palate. The package describes the taste thus: "Caribou blend begins with a delightful heaviness on your palate and finishes with a relaxing balance of bittersweet chocolate and fruity flavors."<br /><br />For tree huggers and environmentalists, Caribou--as a company--is a member of the Rainforest Alliance, designed to "protect ecosystems and the people and wildlife that depend on them. . . ."<br /><br />The coffee? I like it. It is not my favorite K-cup product, but it is tasty. I would have preferred a bit more boldness to the taste, but it is smooth and has a nice aftertaste.<br /><br />If you've entered the Keurig world, this might well be worth trying out. . . .

review/text: There is not much to say about this Caribou medium blend coffee.  It has an unremarkable flavor with a hint of bitterness.  A bit of cream and sugar will cover it up, but that shouldn't be necessary given the coffee choices available.<br /><br />Drinkable, yes.  The coffee isn't so bad that I must throw it away.  I'll finish them off, but I won't be a repeat purchaser.

review/summary: Makes a good cup of coffee
review/text: I tried this k-cup in a sampler pack. Is full-bodied and tastes good but has an aftertaste (more like afterBITE). I like my coffee smooth, so that was a minus for me, but definitely not a deal-breaker. Made this flavor more than once, and the taste was consistent with each cup. Also, I can use the 9oz setting on the Keurig and the coffee does not taste watered down.

review/text: I used to enjoy coffee from my local Caribou cafe. When I moved to a location that didnt have one I tried the Caribou blend K-cups.  Caribou blend was never my favorite, but it was all the store had at the time, so I gave it a try. The flavor is incredibly flat, one dimensional, with a bitter aftertaste, and generally unpleasant aroma (sour).  It was so off that I checked the expiration date, but found out it was still months away.  I wont buy this flavor again.

So far the only K-cup coffee that I enjoy is the Barista Prima Italian Roast (I think that's the brand), but I wanted something I could order on subscribe and save, so I always had coffee.<br /><br />I ordered the Tully's Italian Roast to see how it is, but it too isn't as good as the other.

review/summary: First coffee I drink without sugar and milk
review/text: I started drinking coffee at the age of 2 when my grandpa would sneak me some in my cup. Ever since, I've required milk and sugar in my coffee as that's how I knew coffee. Drinking any coffee black was not the most appealing experience, until Cairbou. I've had Caribou coffee before the K-Cups and I'm a fan of their flavor, which is captured very well. Brewing this in 8-10oz cup sizes will give you the best flavor, and best of all, you won't need to have milk and sugar around all the time.<br /><br />There's no argument against the convenience and quality of a Keurig, and the Caribou Blend may be the best available, meaning little slices of heaven in each cup. The only downside is cost, which exists with all K-Cups. However, even at about $0.66 every 10-11oz, it's still cheaper than my neighborhood coffee shop AND it's in my own kitchen. Worth every penny.<br /><br />There are other great brands out there, but this flavor is the first to really stand on its own merits with me, and I feel like I need to pass that along.

review/summary: A very good middle-of-the-road blend for those who just want a plain old cup of coffee...
review/text: The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done. We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild. I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma. It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste. This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried. We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.

review/summary: Yum!  Finally!
review/text: Healthy Choice is my favorite soup and this is one of my favorite varieties.  I just haven't been able to find it anywhere in Texas since I moved here.  In fact, lately I haven't been able to find any of the 15-ounce cans, preferred over the larger soup cans from other brands, anywhere lately.  Only the overpriced microwaveable bowls.  One of my bosses likes their chicken soup and has cans, so I'm guessing at least that is available at a club store he frequents, but your average grocery chain appears to have phased it out.  But I digress.<br /><br />This variety is very tasty.  It's a hearty soup made with navy beans and a smattering of pinto beans for color I guess.  It also includes carrots, celery, and potato, along with a respectable amount of (chopped and formed) ham dices.  So, I can't wait for a sale and use coupons, but at least I can get it from Amazon at a pretty fair price.<br /><br />My only criticism is the condition in which it arrived.  (See photo)  The 12 cans are packed in a cardboard flat sealed with plastic, and *every* can was dented, four of them severely to the extent I am not sure they're safe to eat.  One I didn't even think I *could* open, but managed it with a special can opener that cuts along the outside of the rim.  (I still was afraid to eat it.) I might understand cans on the outer edge getting dented on one side or the other, but all of them?  It makes me suspicious that their stock are "scratch and dents" from the manufacturer.  Amazon has been kind enough to offer replacements, and I will provide an update if I find the same to be true of the next case.  Either way, the food bank will benefit from several cans.  I like this soup--a lot--just not 24 cans worth.<br /><br />UPDATED -- Just received the replacements.  This shipment also had some significantly dented cans.  (See photo)  Again, all of them had a dent somewhere, mostly minor, and I wonder if they buy "seconds" from the manufacturer of cans that crashed off the assembly line.  It's that, or their warehouse people are not even remotely taking ordinary care.  As excited as I was initially to be able to buy my favorite soup from Amazon, I don't think I'll risk it again.  I'll have to come up with another solution.

review/text: I don't know how healthy it is, but it tastes pretty good. I've scarfed down 2 cans at 720 calories and felt more than satisfied. 720 calories is about half of my daily allotment so I'm not too happy about that. For canned food that takes less than 2 minutes to get in your belly... it's close to homemade, just needs corn bread!

review/summary: Just like homemade
review/text: I discovered this soup several years ago.  Because I take medication for high blood pressure and therefore must limit my sodium intake, I always look for products that have lower salt in them.  For some reason, I haven't been able to find many Healthy Choice soups in markets for a couple of years.  I find them to have more home-cooked flavor than other name brand soups.  While I don't eat canned soups frequently, sometimes I just want a light meal & this one satisfies the need.  The Bean & Ham soup has an authentic home-made taste & consistency.  Like comfort food! It's also high in fiber, which is also a bonus.<br />If you want a filling, lower sodium, lower calorie soup, this one I highly recommend.  It's delicious! I was thrilled to find this on Amazon a while back & hope I'm able to get it for many years to come.

review/summary: Charms Super Blow Pops To Die For!
review/text: With no pictures or other info, I had to look up what a "power wing box" was on the interweb. It's just a normal rectangular box, with a flap that folds out to allow dispensing with the box in an upright position.<br />The contents, of course, are awesome if you like or love Blow Pops. The only thing that might be a drawback would be the size of the pops themselves. If you've never had a Super Blow Pop they are substantially larger than a normal sized one. So much so that they could be a problem if you can't deal with the extra size. Ok........<br />I can't think of any way to describe the problem with the size of these without getting into some awkward, and or funny descriptions. If you can handle the size you'll love them, if you can't you won't. (Told you). Once you do get used to the size you may not want to go back though. (again, I told you).<br /><br />The flavors are great as always. I normally don't care for watermelon or sour apple flavors, but love strawberry, cherry, and grape. So I was worried I'd end up eating all the ones I like, and have a box full of the ones I don't at the end. This candy is another deal though. I like all five flavors here. The watermelon here tastes different than the normal stuff they use as a flavoring, and better. And the Sour Apple isn't so sour as to rip the lining out of your mouth. So I ended up with an empty box when I ran low, rather than a bunch of flavors I don't like and had to find a way to get rid of.<br />In short, they're great!

review/summary: Delicious Alternative to Regular Potato Chips
review/text: The Good Health Humbles product line of their Natural Products is an excellent, tasty, potato chip alternative for consumers interested in eating more consciously to maintain good health.  I tried a single bag, purchased at a natural foods co-op, before deciding to splurge the 12-pack offered here on Amazon.com, and I was deliciously impressed by the taste and flavor of these chips!  This line of all natural snacks offers three taste sensations: Sesame Garlic, Olive Oil Lemon & Feta, and Roasted Red Pepper, as offered here.<br /><br />As soon as I bit into one of these chips, I knew there was no going back to regular grocery store offerings.  As someone who is trying to improve my diet, while also leaving a little wiggle room for eating healthier versions of the foods I love, Good Health Humbles fits in nicely, offering me a snack with 60% less fat than ordinary potato chips, with no cholesterol, and 3 grams of protein per serving!  When a crunchy-food craving hits, this product is something you can feel good about eating.<br /><br />For those concerned specifically about the nutritional value, I assure you this line of products is a healthier choice than your typical bag of chips: with only 4 grams of fat per serving, and 120 calories with no saturated or trans fats, this product also offers 1 gram of fiber per serving, with a only a small amount of sugar (1 gram), and a low amount of sodium (125 mg).<br /><br />Amazon.com offers a great value on these products.  As compared to the Good Health Natural Products website, Amazon.com's price is a huge enticement to shop here, when you compare it to the $30.95 you would pay for the same order directly through the company.<br /><br />After trying multiple so-called "healthier" chip options, I feel I have finally found one I fill good about eating, even when I devour the whole bag in one sitting!  ***Warning - this is  a likely occurrence once you've tasted one of these chips!***

review/text: I had purchased these hummus chips, sesame garlic, at a health food store and loved the true flavor of garlic and sesame.  I purchased a whole case from amazon the next week.  They are not like the typical snack chip you find in the grocery store, the humbles brand is healthy yet has intense flavor, you can tell right away with the first taste that they don't have that heavy salty oily taste like some chips have. I will purchase these chips again.

review/text: My husband and I are big fans of hummus, so when we saw hummus chips we had to try them.  Little did we know they would become our favorite crunchy snack. The Olive oil, lemon, and feta combo is perfect - and amazing with dip, cheese, hummus, and just by themselves.<br /><br />Even better - eating a whole bag (as we often do) isn't even that bad for you.  We are both gastric bypass patients and this is something we can eat without feeling any guilt - we just enjoy it.<br /><br />In fact, we just finished off a bag of these delicious chips with a combination of sharp cheddar cheese and Greek yogurt ranch dip (another amazing guilt free alternative).<br /><br />Highly recommend giving it a try - you'll be hooked just as we are.

So I might as well be eating Frito lay chips. They market it like its health food just because they are hummus, but it's just as fattening as potato chips. I probably would not buy again....

review/text: These chips are unlike any other similar ones that we've ever tried. For starters, they are generously seasoned and taste great! There's no hunting around in the bag for the seasoned ones because every chip in the bag tastes great. The texture is crispy and is more like a traditional fried chip than a baked one, in my opinion.<br /><br />Finally, I wanted to mention that my daughter and I have j-pouches and if you have one you know the struggle it is to find foods that work with the pouch. These chips are well tolerated by both of us and don't causes any of the usual problems that we experience with most other snack foods. So this may be one snack food you might want to try if you have a j-pouch.<br /><br />Yum!

review/text: Ugh, again ordered 12 pack of snack I never tasted, was hoping save time going to stores shopping for things like this, wanted to stock up, read all the great reviews figured I can't go wrong, but of course I ordered the weirdest sounding of the flavors, maybe I'd have been somewhat better off choosing the garlic whatever it was flavor than this one.  I tried eat a bag, now I don't touch em, another snack I've been contemplating bringing few with me whenever I go into city to see if homeless might want it rather than just throwing it out, at least for a snack it's on the healthier side.  But I'd kinda feel bad knowing it tastes bad, but if they're hungry they still might want it. I didn't like the crunch/texture of them, the taste, nothing really.  Just my honest opinion, I can't really say it would have been a lot different if it were one of the other flavors, but I don't think I want try them after not really even liking these a little bit. Maybe snacks can't really be too healthy and taste good.

review/summary: Bewildering and delicious candy!
review/text: I first tried this candy while out on a hike, and decided that I needed to get some of my own! It's like a cross between a nerd and a jelly bean, with the outside being hard and sour while the inside is soft and sweet. Also, the different colors actually do indicate distinct flavors, which I always appreciate in a candy. Oh, and by giant, they mean about jelly bean size, but they range in size from about 1/4 of an inch to 3/4 of an inch. The only down side to this product is that inside the package are 24 "small" packets of the candy, which is a LOT of packaging and bad for the environment. For me, the packets are also too big for a single serving (I get a sugar overload about halfway through one.) In short:<br /><br />Good:<br />- Amazing delicious candy<br />- Bewilderingly textured, which makes them really fun<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Too much packaging (I would rather just buy a big bag of loose candies)<br />- Single packets are too big for single serving
