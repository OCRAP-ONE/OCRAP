review/summary: Gas station coffee dispenser garbage
review/text: This stuff tastes like the "coffee" you get from those vending machines at interstate gas stations or 7-11s.  The first ingredient listed on the box is group of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.  Doesn't bode well for a supposed cappuccino.  That's followed by multiple, seemingly random sweeteners, then instant coffee, a long list of other stuff that has no business associating itself with coffee, and then (inexplicably) sucralose, which gives it a strong artificially bitter aftertaste.  I took 2 sips about 45 min ago, and still can't get the taste out of my mouth.  Definitely avoid.

review/summary: Really good for what it is
review/text: This was very different from what I originally expected it to be.  That being said, I found this to be probably the best k-cup I have ever had.  It is very creamy and has a great hazelnut flavor.  I enjoy a cappucino once in a while and I love hazelnut coffee.  I expected this to be more of  cappucino with a light hazelnut flavor.  That was not the case.  This is like a creamy coffee/hazelnut flavored hot cocoa without the cocoa.  I was expecting something completely different but ended up being pleasantly surprised.  This is a great after dinner or mid day pick-me-up and this will now hold a permanent row or two in my revolving k-cup counter top display. If you want a real cappucino, this isn't for you.  If you want a great tasting hot liquid sweet snack, get this.  I liked this so much, I will be ordering the French vanilla version to give that a try as soon as I complete this review. Also, you cant beat the price....less than $10 delivered to my door.  Wooooo Hooooo!

review/summary: For 10 dollars, yes. otherwise, no
review/text: This coffee is delicious. I would assume it's an instant blend, because the K-Cup is completely empty after usage. The caffeine content is low, so it's a great afternoon coffee that won't keep you up at night. If the price stays at 10 dollars with free shipping, it's a good deal. Once they raise the price though, I'm out of here.

review/text: Sure they are more like instant coffee than freshly ground, and there may even be some artificial sweeteners in there, but the truth is, they're delicious. And for those of you who don't want to put these things in your body, feel free to send them to me. I'm not that picky. I'm a healthy eater all day long, 2 cups of fakely sweetened, fake coffee a day isn't going to kill me. And if it does, so be it, a life without taste is a waste!

review/summary: Not pleased with these K-cups
review/text: I was so excited to receive these K-cups and had one today. I wasn't very impressed. It tasted watered down and I had to add Stevia and sugar free creamer to make it taste half way decent to drink. I like a stronger tasting coffee and these just don't cut it. I'm giving both boxes to my daughter-in-law. I knew I should have ordered only one box to try first. Oh well...live and learn. I cancelled my subscribe and save too.

review/text: I purchased the Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuccino K-Cups not really expecting much for the price...Boy was I WRONG!!!! This cappucinno is absolutely delicious!!!! It tastes just like what I buy every morning at the gas station on my way to work...ONLY IT IS MUCH CHEAPER!!! It's also more convenient now that I can make it at home and not have to stop at the station to buy it! Makes my day a little smoother and I don't have to rush!<br />Yes, this K-cup is instant coffee, but so's the stuff I buy from the machine at the gas station! I love it! I love the price! I love the taste! I will make sure to keep this in stock at my house...especially if the price stays low!

review/summary: Favorite Morning Coffee!
review/text: Love this coffee especially because I don't have to do anything to it! It has the perfect amount of cream and sugar which is great for me because I have more time to get ready in the morning. Some people say it's gross because it is instant coffee and uses hydrogenated oil but it's super great-- plus you're saving money on cream and sugar! Also, I agree with the person who said it tasted like gas station coffee, but we must have different gas stations because everybody (myself include) loves the cappucinos at my gas station!

review/text: It has that super sweet fake marshmallow in cereal taste. It's not great for coffe, but kids would probably love it. I was hoping to actually taste the hazelnut. All you taste is sweetness. It's an overload of the taste buds in all the worst ways.

review/summary: It taste ok!
review/text: I love cappucchino & carmel. After reading the reviews I decided to go ahead and buy this. The only thing I wish I had done was buy a smaller box. It doesn't taste bad but it isn't so DELISH that I would be running back for more. I am not a real coffee drinker and before Mcdonalds switched over to the stronger mud tasting cap I LOVED theirs so I thought this would taste like it. It is not real sweet (as other reviewers have indicated). I didn't add anything to it but I will have to doctor it up in order to drink all three boxes. I did not taste any aftertaste either. For me it wasn't that bad but it wasn't that GOOD either. It was just ok. I would be willing to try a sample of the French Vanilla. It might taste better.

review/summary: Scrumptious.
review/text: I ordered the Grove Square Cappuccino cups, Hazelnut.  The price was right, so I figured why not.  I prepared a cup & Had to run out, so I took it with me, I took a few sips & it was really yummy. I had to run in for a short meeting & left the cup in the car.  It was a cool day & when I got back to the car, my coffee was cold. I picked it up & took a sip, I was pleasantly surprise at the creamy cold taste, it was fabulous.  So now I drink it cold & hot. Very satisfied with the taste & creamines. So glad I tried it.  Thanks Amazon.<br /><br />Sylvia Lorenzano

review/text: These cappuccino k cups are perfect! Before I had a Keurig machine I used to buy the General Foods International French vanilla cappuccino, it is really expensive and not nearly as good as this. I have not tried any other cappuccino k cups so I have no other k cup cappuccinos to compare it to but I drink this every day and love it! It's cheaper than my Husbands k cups coffee, cappuccino is never cheaper than coffee! I compare it to the Irving convenience store's cappuccino. It's a great daily treat!

review/text: I have been very happy with the Grove Square K-Cup products.  I really like the creamy Cappuccino French Vanilla flavor.  The French Vanilla is great when you want a coffee that's creamy with a light flavor.  Great Price, cost less then other K-Cups which is also a great selling point!  I also like Grove Square Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa, Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider, and think the Grove Square Medium Roast is okay (it is an instant coffee, so it's lighter in flavor but still good).

review/summary: Pretty Good if You Like Cappuccino
review/text: I must admit up front that I don't really drink cappuccino. I'm a fan of stronger, black coffees and espressos. I purchased this for other family members and friends who visit. That said, I did taste it and it tastes, well, like cappuccino: ceamy, light, sweet. Almost like hot chocolate if hot chocolate were made of coffee.<br /><br />The price was very good with subscribe and save and still shipped pretty fast, I think it even arrived within 2 days, though as I recall when one uses subscribe and save, in exchange for that extra discount one loses the free 2-day shipping. In any case, it arrived very quickly and the price was 11.xx I think for a 24 pack which is ok for Keurigs on Amazon. I usually expect to pay under 50 cents a cup for my favorite coffees, and this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about this... the cups themselves seemed to require a little bit of a harder push than usual to puncture the bottom in the machine - the first time around it didn't puncture, but closing the top harder the second time worked. I've seen this issue before with a box I got from Sam's Club.

review/text: For 11 bucks a box, I was not expecting this to taste like gourmet Coffee shop coffee... lets be reasonable people, you get what you pay for .... for less than 50 cents a cup, you have to expect something less than what you'd get even at the gas station for a buck a cup... I thought this was on par, if not better, than some convenience store coffee drinks I've gotten in the past. I know a lot of people have issue with the ingredient list containing hydrogenated oils, or whatever, but this is exactly why you should buy something in person first before doing so online.  (Or else google the list of ingredients, which is what I would have done had little things like that concerned me) I took off one star because the sucralose seems to give it an slightly displeasing aftertaste, but thats true of all artificial sweeteners for me.

review/text: Having received a new Keurig brewer during the holidays, I was disappointed that the company no longer carries cappuccino cups. Voila! Amazon & Grove Square to the rescue. Good flavor and value. Signed up for automatic delivery, too.

review/summary: Tasty and sweet
review/text: These are so tasty, it's similar to the kind of capuccino you might get from a gas station vending machine. I'm not a huge coffee drinker though, so these are more of a treat. It's nice to not have to add creamer to it when I'm in a hurry. I definitely recommend these unless you're a coffee snob. :)

review/summary: Wish I had read the reviews
review/text: Was so excited to see Cappuccino Cups offered by Amazon....after one sip of this stuff I knew that something was wrong.  It would have been very helpful for there to have been a warning on the box that it contained sucrolose...which is a substance that I do not wish to put into my body.  Very disappointed in this product.

review/summary: Good for what it is
review/text: I tried the Gloria Jean's cappuccino and was disappointed.  It was not bad, it just didnt taste like  or have the texture of cappuccino.<br /><br />This stuff does indeed taste like gas station instatnt cappuccino but I would not expect a real cappuccino to come out of an instant coffee machine (which is really what the Kuerig is).  That is just not realistic.<br /><br />This product actually does taste like cappuccino and has the foam.  Considering its coming out of a K cup, that is good enough to impress me.  When I want real cappuccino, I will break out whole beans and my frother.  When I want a quick cappuccino fix, I will use this.

review/summary: I love it, stock up for the winter!!
review/text: This taste more like French Vanilla Hot Cocoa than coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised! It still has enough coffee taste that you realize it does have some in it, but it's smooth and creamy like Hot Cocoa. I've become a quick fan, and like it so much that I'm gonna sign up for the subscribe & save to receive a box every two months. Since the coffee taste isn't too overpowering, it makes an amazing drink for a cold winter night. Perfect something to warm you up!<br /><br />P.S<br />Top it with some whip cream, DELICIOUS!

review/summary: Used to love it.
review/text: I had to come back to edit my review after originally giving this product 5 stars.  Something has gone terribly wrong with this product.  I used to love it,  but now they are just terrible.  I don't know if they changed the formula or what the problem is, but there is a terrible after taste that never used to be there before.  I've heard other customers complain about it, but I had no idea what they were talking about.  I thought they were crazy.  Turns out they were right!  Not every cup, but at least 1/2 of the last shipment had cappuchino's cups that had a very bad after taste.  Why not all?  Can't tell you. When they taste bad they taste really bad and I found myself not even being able to finish.  I'm so dissapointed....

review/text: I had read other reviews where this was not fancy cappuccino, but more like gas station cappuccino. I have to agree. That's what I wanted. I am very happy with the flavor and simplicity of popping into the Keurig. Can have it made without having to make a stop on my way in the morning.

review/summary: LOVE this Kcup coffee
review/text: I am not one of the super picky coffee people out there.  Before my favorite coffee was from Starbucks, the Caramel Machiato.  But I absolutely LOVE this coffee.  I don't really care that it is instant, because I think it tastes really good.  My favorite thing is that on the medium Keurig setting I do not have to do a thing to it to enjoy it.  No sugar, no cream, no nothing.  Just pop the K-cup in, hit the button and enjoy.  If you are not a really big coffee snob and like sweet flavored coffees you might love this one, I do.

review/summary: Convenience Store Cappuccino
review/text: I was so excited to see this product (Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino) for my beloved Keurig.  I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar.  I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup.  I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.  Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino.  If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup.  I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.  It isn't as sweet and has more "real" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial.  FYI: In addition to the artificial dairy & sweeteners, the cappuccino uses instant coffee.)

review/text: Found this great coffee for Keurig coffee makers. I still can't believe Amazon is the only place you can find it. It tastes great and the price is great. I don't need anymore creamers because this coffee gives me exactly what I want. Nice and creamy which is delicious.<br /><br />Use the small cup because the bigger cup will water it down and it isn't too great that way.<br /><br />LOVE IT!!

review/summary: Adequate, but not enough to buy again.
review/text: I thought the flavor was decent, but that it just reminded my husband and I too much of something we would buy at our local gas station. This specific K-cup only makes a very small cup before turning into just dumping water, and therefore was never sufficient for my husband to drink. I should have read the reviews before purchasing, as it seems that others are having some similar feelings!
