review/text: This is my favorite oatmeal! It has little pieces of real apple in it and lots of cinnamon. Delicious.<br />If you want to make it by boiling your water first (negating the need for a microwave) you can just pour 1/2 C of boiling water over it in a bowl. it cooks up in just a couple of minutes.<br />Try this! You'll love it!

review/text: This flour makes a VERY delicious loaf of bread, which is fast becoming my favorite!!<br /><br />The recipe I use calls for 2 cups of Kamut and 1 cup of white (I use Wheat Montana white).  All four loaves I have made - using my Zojirushi bread maker - have exceeded my expectations.  And "yummy, yummy, yummy" was the response I got from a widower with whom I shared!<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill Organic Kamut flour WILL be a staple in my kitchen..........and I can't wait to try the biscuits (recipe on package) - as well as chocolate chip cookies!!

review/summary: Kamut Flour works....sort of.
review/text: This flour, while not a direct substitute for regular flour, can be used in bakery products when substituted for one half the flour. I use this mainly to make biscotti. It gives it a richer flavor than just regular wheat flour.<br /><br />The kamut is not a finely ground flour and as such, it is not a substitute for fine flours like cake flour. It has a higher gluten content than regular wheat and it takes work to knead it into a cohesive mass. It works very well for the biscotti but not so well for croissants. It makes a mean multi-grain bread where you don't expect a fine crumb. I will be buying this product again.

review/summary: HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP!
review/text: The main ingredient in this cranberry juice (maybe after water) is HFCS. If anyone reading this doesn't know the danger of this manufactured sugar, then please do your body and your families body a favor and find out the side effects of it.<br /><br />Some may say, that duh, you should know that most juices have HFCS in them now, that is true, HOWEVER, I ONLY buy Ocean Spray cranberry juice locally at Publix because the ones in the store have NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. I had no idea that "restaurant quality" meant "high fructose corn syrup", silly me.<br /><br />I was so annoyed with this shipment because it was too heavy to lift so it would've been a bear trying to take it to the UPS store to ship it back, and I didn't notice the HFCS until after my fiance had already consumed a can of the juice. So $50 down the drain. That's why I came here to warn other consumers, if you don't mind HFCS fine, but if you, like me, buy Ocean Spray because it's HFCS free, don't be fooled here. I know it's hard to eliminate HFCS from your diet these days, but there was no way my household was going to consume 552 ounces of the stuff under my watch. We drink it daily and that's a little too much consumption of this harmful artificial sugar for my sake.<br /><br />But I guess Ocean Spray is making a killing on these cans by using HFCS like all the other brands that do so, it allows them to make the same amount of product as their competitor, for way less cost, then they can undercut all the brands who are using other less harmful sugars (which cost more).

I haven't been able to find that tea and found references form other tea drinkers that this tea is a suitable replacement.  I would agree.  The combination of orange, lemon and bergamot with black tea results in a flavorful citrus tea that I enjoy.  I would definitely recommend this tea.

review/summary: Awesome Taste!
review/text: I test healthy recipes for a national website. Honey is a wonderful additive for food, but it's broken down as a simple sugar by the body, so we have to use it VERY sparingly. At least we DID have to use it sparingly! This tastes just like real honey...and there's no sugar. It's the best tasting honey substitute we've ever tried. It also works great in recipes we've make both hot and cold. We like it so much, we're no buying it by the case.<br /><br />There is ONE important thing to remember. It is sweetened with sugar alcohols (which is neither sugar or alcohol...but that's another story). For most of the people, that's no problem. However, some people will get an upset stomach by eating sugar alcohol. Just be aware of that one potential side effect.

review/text: I was overjoyed to find this product on your available items! I have used this product to make low-sugar pecan pies for several years, but suddently I could not find it at my local Wal-Mart Supercenter, as they discontinued the stocking of Honey Tree Sugar Free Honey. Without this imitation honey, I could not successfully make the pecan pies.  Now I can continue to make the pies for years to come.  Here is the recipe:<br /><br />3 eggs (well beaten);  1/2 cup sugar;<br />1 cup HT Sugar Free Honey;  1/2 stick butter (melted);<br />1/2 tsp. salt;  1 tsp. vanilla;<br />1 cup chopped pecans; and  1 - 9" unbaked pie shell<br /><br />Mix (by hand) the beaten eggs, sugar, honey, butter (or margarine), salt, vanilla and chopped pecans in medium sized bowl. Pour into pie shell (making sure it has no cracks, holes, or splits in it) and bake at 325 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven, cool and serve.

review/text: I am borderline diabetic who likes honey on occasion, which of course is a no no. I saw this walking through Wal-Mart, for half the price of real honey. I bought it, but was not expecting to much. When I tried it, to my surprise it really tasted like real honey. I had to take a second look at the container, thinking I might of picked up the real honey by mistake.<br /><br /> I gave this 5 Stars because it tasted like real honey, not because it is the best honey I ever tasted. I personally love a good orange blossom honey, this is more like the standerd honey you buy in the supermarket. Let me qualify my statements. I am not a honey expert, all I know is it tastes good with no chemical taste. If you are Diabetic or just want to cut down on sugar, try it you will probobly like it. All these 5 Star reviewer's can't be wrong.<br /><br />Hope you all have a Honey of a day.  WOW!! is that corny or what?

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/summary: excellent substitute
review/text: This is an excellent substitution for both sugar and honey. I use it in cooking and baking and you can't tell the difference! It is not too sweet and does not have a weird aftertaste like some other imitation sugars. I like it even more than regular honey, but the texture is just like regular honey.

review/summary: Imitation Honey from HoneyTree
review/text: Being diabetic Honey Tree's imitation honey has saved my life.  I buy it locally from a supercenter. If and when they ever stop placing this product on their shelves, I'll buy it directly from the Company. I use it on toast, bagels, peanut butter and crackers and at times squeeze it onto a spoon.  A delicious substitute for the real thing.

review/summary: Beware of this product
review/text: First, make sure you read the ingredients listed on this product: Maltitol syrup, natural and artificial flavor, Acesulfame K, Malic acid. Acesulfame K is an artificial sweetener, like aspartame. It is still a very controversial substance, and although the FDA has approved it, more research has been recommended. Maltitol is produced from starch, and can cause gastrointestinal problems and diarrhea. This product is one of the most artificial sweetening agents that are on the market. It is highly processed using patented and confidential methods. The mention of "honey" on its label is disingenuous and actually in violation of several state laws. Raw, natural honey remains the best and healthier sweetener out there for people with type II diabetes as long as they use it in moderation.

review/summary: Spoiled by real Japanese short-grain rice
review/text: I spent a few years studying abroad in Japan and got hooked on a lot of the local cuisine, not the least of which was the serving of rice with every meal.  I've never been a fan of "American" white rice so upon returning to the States, I found myself jonesing especially badly for some authentic, Japanese, short-grain rice.  Understandably, importing rice from Japan is phenomenally expensive and real, short-grain rice of any origin is extremely hard to come by in the middle of the Rocky Mountains.  Thankfully Amazon saves the day with their selection of JFC's California-grown, hybrid, short-grain rices.  I wasn't able to get a bag of the "Koshihikari"-derivative (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NRHBC6">Nozomi Super Premium Short Grain Rice, 15-Pound</a>) because Amazon didn't know if they would get more in stock, so I settled for the "Sasanishiki" (Yume).  A lot of the grains are broken and whitened (presumably from rough milling and heat), but it cooks fine and tastes great.  It's only been a couple of months and I'm almost done with it already. I plan to try the Nozomi variety next, but I think this is going to become an expensive habit.

review/text: I thought $30 for a bag of rice is expensive, but upon researching at local Asian markets, this product sells at an average of $27 for 15 lbs, so $30 including shipping was awesome.<br /><br />When I received the rice, I had to try it with a bottle of salmon cavier I purchased from Costco for $10, the rice was soooooooo good. I ate rice everyday, but the other day I had to go back to the $2 rice to see the difference, big difference, nothing compares!<br /><br />I bought Koshihikari this time around, I wonder if there is any difference with the sasanishiki.<br /><br />If you love rice, you'll love this!

But here's the skinny: sure, it works as a cereal (or a garnish for a flake-based cereal) and all those other things, but this stuff was put on Earth for the sole purpose of being a yogurt mix-in. I don't know what sort of magic happens when you drop a scoopful of this stuff in a bowl of vanilla yogurt (mango was another great choice), but some sort of magic does happen. Once I'd tried it that way, there was no looking back. It's now a staple in the kitchen. I don't think I've eaten yogurt without it in the last month.

review/text: I thought this was very good.  It was really crunchy, and I could taste the blueberries.  I also liked how there were several different grains -this gave it some variety (and the flaxseed raised up the levels of Omega-3s, which is great).<br /><br />It was also low in sodium, had NO saturated fats, and had FIVE grams of fiber per serving.  This is a great midday snack to give you the complex carbs that you need (without a large blood sugar spike) to get you to the next meal.<br /><br />I would definitely buy these in the future and would throw them in my luggage as a snack on a plane, or a treat to munch on when hiking.<br /><br />No chocolate chips needed in this granola snack!

Normally I need granola to be with something: Milk or yogurt or fruit cobbler or something like that. This stuff I was eating out of the bag like snack chips.  It has just the right cinnamon taste, and the oats taste fresh. You know how some granolas seem sort of cardboardy and tasteless? This does not. The clusters are crisp and flavorful--not just cinammon and sweet, but hearty and oaty.  It's like the best part of a healthy cereal...minus the milk and the not so tasty part.<br /><br />If this came in snackpacks I'd buy a ton to tuck in my bag for lunches.  Heck that's what I did with half this bag!

review/text: While this product didn't feature a lot of big clusters, I found it quite tasty and loaded with healthy ingredients.  It had enough cinnamon to complement the taste, but not too sweet.  With nearly as much fiber (15g) as sugar (18g) per cup, and 9g of protein, one could definitely do worse.<br /><br />Apparently one of the issues that comes with relatively low sugar granola is that the clusters don't stick together so well.  However, this is not much of an issue if you're eating this with yogurt or milk.<br /><br />Overall, a great product worth recommending if you like granola.

There's a surprising amount of sugar in here, and not to be super-picky, but the flax seeds pretty much just get stuck in your teeth, where they have minimal health benefits. This was also rather on the tough side as far as chewing, which can be a concern for some.

Since I am Celiac, my breakfast cereal choice is somewhat limited.  I was looking for something different to break up the monotony and decided to give this a try.  I am glad I did.  The only downside to this is that it is a bit expensive.  I think it is worth it though.  I just ordered the Maple Walnut clusters and looking forward to trying them.

review/summary: Granola with a bad flavor
review/text: Maybe I got a bad bag but... the flavor of the vanilla blueberry was unpalatable. I love granola and was looking forward to trying this healthy version but it tasted old, almost as if it had "turned." If it weren't so expensive, I would try it again. I love the idea of including flax seeds in the granola.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Granola
review/text: Best granola on the market! Would never guess it's gluten free. I order six bags at a time to make sure I never run out. I eat it straight from the bag as a snack, put it on top of yogurt, and eat it as cereal with milk. Tried many other brands I could find locally but none even come close, so I will continue to order Kind.

review/summary: love Kind products
review/text: As a lover of Kind bars, I was excited to see this granola. I'm generally not a fan of grains unless they're sprouted grains, but this was great. Low glycemic and tasted SO good. It's full of amaranth, quinoa and millet as well as flax which provides the Omega 3. I love how the blueberries add a nice sweet/tart taste but was disappointed to learn that they're blueberry puree as well as apple and plum puree. I wish they were just dried blueberries.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great granola and has a nice depth / complexity of taste.

review/summary: Vanilla covering mars the texture and taste of the snack
review/text: I wanted to like this healthy snack, and perhaps I chose the wrong flavor.  The blueberries were nice -- tangy and flavorful.  The grain is crunchy.  But the vanilla covering (or glue or whatever it is that is sticking the grains together) has an unpleasant rough, starch-like texture and a bland aftertaste, kind of like that chalky aftertaste you get from Pepto-Bismol (although NOT that flavor.)<br /><br />I think I will give this brand another try in another flavor.

review/summary: Healthy but still tastes good.
review/text: I'm not a health nut. In fact I'm a foodie who wouldn't give up anything in the name of health. I do tend to think that stuff like this sacrifice taste and don't buy them. So why did I get this? the description had said they could be sprinkled on yogurt and I do eat lots of yogurt.<br /><br />Surprisingly, however, these taste good. I like them. For the most part, I ate these with milk as morning cereal or I snacked on them. I never got to put them on yogurt (which was my original intention). If these come with the subscribe and save plan, i'll order it just to have them over. Otherwise, they'll be an as needed buy.<br />A little goes a long way with these. The didn't taste like raw bran or some "healthy" cereal completely robbed of taste. Instead, even a sweet tooth like me liked it. Just a reference, I don't drink skim milk because i think it taste like water so that should give a little idea of where i'm coming from.<br /><br />My only con with these: they packages aren't big. Not like regular cereal bags. They're much smaller.  I wish they came a little bigger which is why i took of a star. But then you don't need to eat much to feel full so i guess....<br /><br />Anyway, If you're the kind of person who avoids stuff like these because you think they taste bad, try this and be amazed. If you're a health food junkie, well, now you don't have to sacrifice taste.<br />Cheers!

review/summary: This is an HONEST, kind, product!
review/text: I find myself searching grocery store shelves. I read the labels, scour the freezers and even the so-called healthy products-aren't. This wonderful granola type snack is different. It contains healthy grains but is minus the un-healthy sugars, syrups and fats. I found that it tasted great. In fact I prefer it over the sickening sweet alternatives marketed by the food packing giants. With flax seeds it is uber healthy with so many essentials. The cinnamon taste is pleasant and if I am not mistaken, cinnamon is thought to be a "fate burner"!<br /><br />Be kind to yourself and give Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters a chance!

review/summary: hmmm.....Tasty!
review/text: This is a lovely little granola. Just enough sweet, but not TOO much. The vanilla/blueberry clusters add taste interest without being overpowering. I can take or leave the flax seeds since they aren't well digested in whole form for most folks. Ground whole flaxseed sprinkled on your food, or flax seed oil are both more beneficial since they are more easily digested and utilized by the body. The whole flax seeds do give some good textural interest along with the grains. Very nice with Greek yogurt and fruit and NOT "cardboard-y" at all. Definitely a two thumbs up rating from me.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: I'm not a granola expert of fanatic, but I thought I might enjoy this product more because I like blueberry and vanilla.<br /><br />When I opened it, it smelled musty, like a year-old box of cereal.  I found that very odd, but plunged ahead anyway.  It was disappointing, because I picked up on pretty much no blueberry flavor (or blueberries, for that matter).  It tasted like really dense granola.  From a pure flavor and eating enjoyment aspect, I did not really care for it.<br /><br />From a health standpoint, this product is free of everything "bad" and full of "good stuff"...heavy on flax.  I'm not a health food fanatic, so again, this was lost on me.  But my son, age 24, really seemed to enjoy it.  He's much more attentive to what he consumes, and I think he liked the taste as well.  He ended up being the only consumer of this product.  (My wife liked it less than me.)<br /><br />I have to conclude, based on the non-scientific study of my family, that this product appeals to folks accustomed to more "healthy" snack foods...and not folks like me who have no problem with more "commercial, processed" snacks.  I had hoped that KIND would be both tasty and healthy...but it fell short.  I'd be a two-star reviewer...my son would be 4...so I'm splitting the difference.

review/text: My son and I both enjoyed this granola as cereal in the morning. The clusters stayed crunchy in milk and it was quite flavorful. We could see bits of blueberries and their flavor was noticeable while not too overpowering. The flax seeds did sometimes stay in the milk afterwards but as long as you drink the milk you get their full benefit. We both enjoyed the taste and the variety of grains included. It is relatively healthy and we've always been satisfied with KIND products. This is a tasty granola option.

review/summary: My kind of snack!
review/text: I love having something in my pantry I can take out and munch on without guilt--this is exactly my kind of snack.<br /><br />The best thing about Healthy Grains Clusters is how healthy they are. They're made with whole grains, including quinoa, one of the healthiest grains out there. The flax seeds are an excellent way to get important omega-3 fatty acids into your system.They're also a very good source of fiber. Best of all, they're made with all-natural ingredients.<br /><br />Besides being good for your diet, these crunchy clusters are addictively good--both by themselves and as a yogurt topping. I wasn't sure how'd they would actually taste, as I've had plenty of bland health foods. They turned out to be one of my new favorite snacks!<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent granola that satisfies your sweet tooth.

review/summary: Nice crunch and better than Bear Naked Granola
review/text: For years I have been eating Bear Naked Granola (Fruit and Nut, in the orange bag) with vanilla yogurt and berries as one of my favorite breakfasts.  When I was offered an opportunity to review this similar product, I was skeptical that anything could top my favorite granola.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the Kind Cinnamon Oat Clusters granola.  It actually tasted fresher than Bear Naked and I can eat 1/3 of a cup for roughly the same calories as 1/4 cup of Bear Naked.  (The rest of the nutritional info is roughly the same between the two brands.)  The Kind granola has a nice crunch and didn't get soggy when mixed with yogurt.  The cinnamon flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  It's packed with whole grains, Omega 3 and other healthy ingredients.  It would also be good served as a cereal with milk.  It's a bit more expensive than Bear Naked, but if both were on the same shelf, I would definitely reach for the Kind Cinnamon Oat Clusters.  I would also be interested in trying other versions/flavors of this product.

review/summary: Nongluten granola
review/text: I do not eat gluten, so it was important to me that this product be non-gluten.  I looked the package over and nowhere did I see "without gluten" on it, except in the ingredients where it lists the whole grains used to make this product, it did say "gluten free oats" but still I wondered about the other grains.  Another ingredient was amaranth, which has no gluten (neither do oats, but they easily become contaminated by gluten in processing) so I checked this site and lo and behold, it says that it is non gluten!  So, not on the package (unless I am missing it?) but yes, on this site.<br /><br />I took this bag of granola with me to my daughter/husband's house and they tried it too.  It was a very nice tasting cereal, loaded with whole grains.  I did not experience what some other reviewers said, with having no clusters in their bag (in other words, some got kind of a granola dust, but mine were big chunks, just like they are supposed to be).  Mine was packed in a box with some of those air pocket things, so it came through just fine.  I also didn't notice any funny aftertaste.  The cost is $16.56 for 3, 11 oz bags, or $14.08 through "subscribe and save" ($4.69 per bag).  I think this is a little higher than our local Walmart Bear Naked granola, but not that much higher.  Also, Bear Naked granola isn't gluten free (the oats are not gluten free, to my knowledge), whereas the Kind variety is.<br /><br />Although the variety of this cereal that I had (Cinnamon and Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds) did not have glycerin as an ingredient, I noticed that my bag of Bear Naked fruit and nut granola did have glycerin, apparently with the raisins and cranberries that were in it.  I have to admit, I had always associated glycerin with soap (like Neutrogena) but note too that nitroglycerin (an explosive) has glycerin.  Glycerin is also, apparently, a sweetener (probably why they use it with raisins and cranberries).<br /><br />In the end, I would say that if you like the taste of this granola, the price on this one isn't bad.  And taste is a matter of, um, taste.  Because it is non-gluten, I may just buy this instead of the Bear Naked granola that I usually buy (yes, I know that Walmart's Bear Naked granola isn't non-gluten, but I like it and it is cheap and for reasons that I do not understand, I do not have to absolutely abstain from gluten, although I usually do).  I would definitely give this granola a chance and if you like the flavor, go for it!

review/summary: A bit too sweet and pricey, but it's a delicious all-natural product
review/text: PROS:<br /><br />- It's a very natural product. Just look at the ingredients: Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin.<br /><br />- It tastes delicious. The cinnamon comes through nicely.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- I felt it was slightly too sweet. Obviously, that's subjective, so look at the sugar content: 5g of sugar in a 29g serving. The good news is that "sugar" isn't in the list of ingredients. The product gets its sweetness from the juices in the ingredients. It claims it's "low glycemic," but you might want to be skeptical about that.<br /><br />- Only 2-4 realistic servings per package. Most cereals have a serving size of 3/4 cup. Here's it's just 1/3 cup. On the other hand, the serving size is 29 grams, which is comparable to the average serving size weight for other cereals. The package claims 11 servings. Sure, if you're just nibbling. But if you have a standard bowl of cereal, you'll find that it only has 2-4 realistic servings (depending on your bowl size). So it goes quick! This makes it somewhat pricey and lowers the overall value.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: If you're not concerned about the relatively high price and you like a sweet cereal, then this is a perfect product!

review/summary: Tasty, healthy product with multiple uses
review/text: Though I'm in the latter phases of the Atkins approach to eating and can now be a little more relaxed about my carbohydrate intake (people slam the Atkins plan for being unrealistic, but it's only the initial phases that are truly restrictive), I still keep an eye out for needlessly excessive carb counts.<br /><br />Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds are therefore right up my alley.  They're tasty and crunchy, perfect for stirring into my plain yogurt, sprinkled over hot cereal, or just enjoying in a flavorful small handful every now and then. A third of a cup serving- more than enough for the uses I mentioned- contains only 17 grams of net carbs (22 grams of total carbs minus the 5 grams of fiber).  For calorie watchers (like my wife), total calories for that amount aren't bad, either (about 130).<br /><br />As I've said in the past when I was pleased with a free sample of a product from the Amazon Vine program, I'm definitely open to picking up a fresh supply of these healthy, good-tasting clusters at my own expense once my free supply runs out.

review/text: I am not a health food fanatic. In fact like many Americans I am overweight. Deciding to make my forties a healthier decade means making some changes. So I am exploring healthy food options.<br /><br />Kind vanilla blueberry clusters is healthy but is it tasty?<br /><br />The first morning I had it with milk. Crunchy, tasty but a waste of time. Even though it was soaked in milk it wasn't really a cereal and it was still dry. How? I wound up drinking the milk from the bowl at the end. - fail.<br /><br />I bagged some and took it as a snack. Better. Great and crunchy. Tasty but have a drink handy - Good.<br /><br />The next morning I had Greek fat free yogurt and sprinkled some on top. It required some hands crumbling clusters but not really that much work. It added a bit of flavor to the creamy goodness that is Greek yogurt (not the other kind of tangy yogurt) and it gave it some crunch. Not thirsty after words ) the best way to have it.<br /><br />Over all if you like crunch and want to add some healthy omegas to your diet this is a good way to do it. Especially if you eat yogurt or like snacking. If you are looking for an alternative to sugary cereal or hate dry food look elsewhere this just won't cut it.<br /><br />Personally I would keep it but not as a breakfast food.

review/summary: a tasty breakfast or snack
review/text: I've been eating KIND bars for a couple of years.  They are a truly healthy alternative to the many so-called health & energy bars that have flooded the market in the last decade.  KIND is also a socially conscious company which donates portions of its proceeds to worthy causes.  They've now added cereals to their line of bars.  I tried the Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds.  It was tasty & satisfying.  It was tasty with milk, or on yogurt (Greek in my case), or as a stand alone snack.  However, the portion sizes listed on all food products are ridiculous & don't reflect real life.  At least not the life I know.  However, even doubling the portion size the result will still be a filling meal which is low in calories, high in protein, low in sodium, low in sugar, with 0 sat. fat & 0 trans fat.  That the package is just 11 oz. in size is one of my major complaints.  This is a healthy alternative to many of the granolas which are on the market.

The amazing variety of grains used in this is a selling point to me, I like the variety and it's not over-sweet. I do like granola that's not all broken up into tiny little pieces, but has some chunks in it, which this does have.<br /><br />Kind granola is also gluten free and vegan friendly. If you are on a restricted diet this is perfect. I thought the cinnamon was just the right amount, not overpowering. To me, things that are 'healthy' for you aren't very useful unless they taste good too, this tastes good. Enjoy it on yogurt, or out of the bag, or with milk. I put it in little baggies and throw it in my backpack for a snack at school.

review/text: Unlike some of the other reviewers' experience, the product I received had nice big clusters and a good crunch to it.  It seemed slightly bland to me, though, so I added an extra dash of cinnamon and a little nutmeg, which made it taste much better in my plain Greek yogurt.<br /><br />Overall, I like the oat clusters and I like the extras that are in it, such as the flaxseed and Omega-3,  which make the calories worthwhile.

review/text: I wasn't fond of this with yogurt, but it's SUPER with milk and a splash of fruit/nut mix. I let it soften a little and snarfed it all up! Very highly recommended.

review/summary: Really tasty
review/text: I received one pack of Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds through Amazon Vine, and it made a great breakfast for me. Very tasty, and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well. My only regret is that I didn't get more--it was so delicious that I ate it all in one serving. I'll probably be ordered some more soon.

review/summary: not a granola fan, but I liked this one
review/text: I've always thought I should like granola, but I had never found a packaged one that really did it for me. I'm a big fan of KIND bars, so I was excited to hear that KIND had a new granola product line. Finally, I've found it, a package granola product worth eating.<br /><br />As with other KIND products, I like that their granola is made of natural ingredients. As their slogan says "ingredients you can see and pronounce." But, of course, that only gets you so far if the taste isn't there. KIND granola comes through on the taste to though. It's sweet but not too sweat, and I liked (unlike some other reviewers) that the blueberry flavor wasn't too strong. The texture, which is always tricky with granola, was also just right - the perfect combo of crunchy and chewy.<br /><br />I enjoyed mine both on its own and with milk. However, I do agree with the other reviewers who said that larger clusters would be nice when you're eating it on its own.<br /><br />Oddly, my 15-month old daughter also loved this granola. She would actually shake with excitement when she saw the bag come out of the pantry.

review/summary: Snack or cereal
review/text: Excellent whole grain cereal. Lightly sweetened with brown sugar. It is very similar in taste to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7TH24">Heartland Granola Cereal, Original, 16-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a> but of course with flax and a very light blueberry taste.<br /><br />It is easy to eat as a snack because most of the granola clusters are pretty large. Four kids and I wiped it out in just a few minutes. Highly recommended. Excellent taste and healthy ingredients.

review/summary: Great snacks for in the car or at home
review/text: My wife and I had to run out the door for a class and didn't have time to really get any food in advance.  Luckily I had this and took it in the car with us.  It was a great snack to have on hand and I like the fact that it's not overly sugary as these granola products can be.  Flax is an added bonus as it is one supplement that I always want to take but never seem to get around to do doing so.  The reclosable bag worked very well for us.  The last serving I put over milk to see how it would work as a breakfast cereal and that was fine as well.  My only complaint is that it wasn't very clustery, it tended to break down into smaller grains of stuff, but who really cares about that most of the time?  The taste was awesome.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy
review/text: Kind makes a range of great products with minimal additives and fresh, bright flavors. These clusters are nice and crunchy, and great for any granola-type use. The clusters are not very big, so this product is better for me as a yogurt topper or breakfast cereal than snacking. The blueberry-vanilla flavor was a bit muted but I'm happy to compromise on that for such a hearty, healthy product.

review/summary: Incredibly good
review/text: Not only are these really tasty, the ingredients list is pretty awesome as well. I decided to order some more after this Vines-provided bag was gone. For the record? The peanut butter flavor tastes like someone mixed granola with Nutter Butters. Amazing. The cinnamon is a hit with my wife, who hates all forms of healthy granola/seed foodstuffs.<br /><br />Great product.

review/text: This is the kind of thing that I can't have in the house because I can't stop eating it!  It has flax seeds!  It has terrific ingredients!  It is FANTASTIC!  Will be buying this (only in a moment of weakness like right now when I'm starving) and I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Yummy but Crummy
review/text: Maybe it was the way these were shipped -- perhaps they sat around a while or got beat up in the delivery process -- but I was a little bummed that there was so much "dust" at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />Other than that, these were very yummy.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical, being "healthy" as they claim, that it might be boring or dry -- but it was neither.<br /><br />The bag is a good size, and more than enough for a few snacks.  They were great as a cereal and as yogurt toppings.<br /><br />The cinnamon was noticable but not overpowering, and made it just sweet enough.  The product also tasted fresh, and I appreciated the resealable bag.
