review/summary: This must be some sorta miracle?!
review/text: I cannot believe I just ate GF bread straight from the bread machine WITHOUT being toasted! This bread is that good. I have always been a big bread eater, I could seriously make a meal out of it and be perfectly content. I literally "mourned" bread for the first week of going GF. I have tried so many brands from mixes to frozen. My go to was always Udi's, however, they are charging 7.50 a loaf here in NY for it. Crazy. I will not pay that much, ever. I tried Pamela's baking & pancake mix and absolutely loved it, which led me here looking to see if they had an actual bread mix to purchase. Without even testing it first, I purchased 3 4lb bags and I am so glad I did! This bread is a little sweet but I don't mind it at all. There is no bad after taste with this bread, like so many others. The texture of this bread is pretty close to real bread too! I am so excited to have finally found 'the one' :) Can't wait to try making pizza dough or bagels. Oh and I did the math it's around 2.50 a loaf if you subscribe & save. Great deal, thank you Amazon, you will keep my business for sure. My only gripe about this product is the calories with the added eggs & oil. I would love a lower cal version bc 170 cals or so per slice is more than I would normally indulge in. If anyone has a tried and true sub for eggs/oil in this mix please let me know I'd definitely be interested in trying it out.

review/summary: Hands down the best GF flour available!
review/text: My poor husband has celiac but has the worst sweet tooth ever. i use this flour for any sweet treat i make him. the flavor is good and the mix of flours makes a truly perfect GF flour! Of course, like any GF product, it can fall apart. but when making cakes, pie crust, cookies, bread, waffles, pancakes, or rolls, you have to know how to work with GF products in order to make them look and taste good. for anyone who is just starting their celiac disease diet or who is looking for a good GF flour to use, this one is the best!

review/text: helped my family go gluten free with me. I have celiac and am extremely sensitive. My family loves it after I tinkered with the recipe. I was way to mushy. The main thing, is take out 1 egg yolk, add a 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and sugar, 1 teaspoon vinegar cider, I also had to add a few degrees to the oven and a few minutes. The neighbors now ask for my bread!

review/summary: Helpful start to a GFCF diet
review/text: This was recommended by another mother.This works well for making bread (it comes out more like rustic beer bread type texture) and for making pizza crust. I have not tried other recipes with this yet. The only downside is that it is rather gooey in texture while mixing the batter. It will run up the beaters or inside the mixer blade. You must eat within two days as it has a short shelf life due to no perservatives. Also did not know until I bought it that there is a possible cross contamination with casein possibility. Luckily my son only has an intolerance. No allergies.

It is moist even though it does not take much oil at all and it stays put together, it doesn't fall apart when you make a sandwich.  One bag makes 3 loaves of bread.<br />One thing that is good to know  for those of you avoiding sugar is that it does have brown sugar, and granulated honey in the mix.

review/text: Even the rest of the family can eat bakery goods made with this flour. Where other GF flours have been detected and detested this flour is a true winner. Bread is flavorful with no bitter after taste. The loaf is tender and raises well. I use a bread maker and it could not be easier to make fresh bread. The 4 pound bags make the mix a lot more economical. For cookies and pancakes and quickbreads use the pancake mix by Pamelas.

review/summary: Finally, a way to make gluten free bread that tastes GREAT
review/text: I love this mix so much, I have it on subscription here at Amazon -- see Subscribe & Save, you can even shop just for GF stuff for subscriptions ;-)<br /><br />I make this in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000T6J3I">Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine</a> set to the "Quick" cycle, light crust color. It comes out completely moist with a medium brown color crust, not a light one - I think maybe GF grains brown at a different rate than wheat?  A couple of caveats:<br /><br />1. This product package has several recipes on the side - very helpful! However, to get it to turn out using the recipe, you have to assume using JUMBO eggs, or you'll need to add some extra egg whites to get the right volume of egg product.<br /><br />2. EXPERIMENT some: You can play around with adding a little sugar or Agave nectar or brown sugar to tweak the taste out the way you like it, but if you use as much as the sweet bread recipe (on side of package) calls for, you'll end up with such sweetness that it really works only as a breakfast or dessert product. You can use cooking oil instead of butter in the recipe for greater moisture, and you can sub milk or soy milk or almond milk for part or all of the water requirements, as long as you don't change the total amount of liquid from the total amount called for in the recipe. Just play around with it some to get it the way you personally prefer it. Get creative and add other stuff like cheeses or olives or nuts or seasonings that you enjoy. Have fun!<br /><br />3. Be sure to remove the loaf from the pan immediately upon completing the baking cycle, and leave it in open air to circulate around it (for instance, on a wire rack or cool eye of the stove) until it is completely cool. This will not harden the crust much at all, but it will prevent premature molding. Then put the cooled loaf into a ziploc bag or other bread container. Doing so gives the finished loaf a shelf life of a week at room temperature for me, even though I currently live in a humid climate (where other GF breads mold in about 3 days). This is important, because GF grains usually aren't bleached, and so they'll mold faster than flours made from traditional gluteny grains like white flour, etc.<br /><br />This is my FAVORITE gluten-free bread mix.  :-)  My friends who don't have to avoid gluten and who typically shun whatever is gluten free actually request me to make this GF bread for them.

review/summary: Great Product, Great Price but Read the Ingredient List BEFORE Purchasing
review/text: I have loved Pamela's Products for many years, and the bread mix is a real hit with my family.  We miss homemade bread, but gluten free baking can be complicated.  I am glad there is a mix that takes care of all the intricate mixing of flour and makes things easy for me.  Putting it together in the morning takes about 10 minutes.  YAY!<br /><br />The taste is really yummy, too.  Soft, moist and even textured - not like the stale bricks that pass for gluten free bread in the store.  We really like this mix and the Amazon price is a real break from the high cost of purchasing it locally.<br /><br />One note about allergens:  Pamela's is GLUTEN free, but not necessarily free of other allergens.  If you have other food sensitivities, be sure and read the latest ingredient list on Pamela's website, or locate a package at your local health food store and read the ingredient list carefully.  Amazon does not always post ingredient lists, and when they do, they are sometimes inaccurate.  I would post the ingredients myself, but companies often change their recipes and I would hate for something I write represent an obsolete formula in a year or two.<br /><br />Anyway, if gluten is your only issue, this could be a wonderful bread mix.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent taste and texture, but not for certain intolerances
review/text: This bread mix makes a very dense, moist bread. I really like the taste. It's also very filling and when it comes out of the oven, the smell is appetizing. I love it with cream cheese.<br /><br />Problem: While this is wheat free-gluten free as advertised, commonly wheat allergy/intolerance/etc. occurs along with various sugar intolerances, malabsorption, etc., such as fructose malabsorption. Depending on the type of intolerance, lots of sugars can cause trouble, including honey, fruit juices, brown sugar, molasses, blue agave, maple syrup, turbinado, and even other foods you wouldn't expect, such as onion and chicory. This bread has three offenders: honey, molasses and chicory.<br /><br />So, I'll give it five stars for texture, taste, aroma, ease of use, etc. since it never claims to be anything more than wheat free-gluten free. But for a food that caters to people with food allergies, it's much safer to have an unsweetened bread. After all, the regular wheat bread you're avoiding doesn't have sugar in it, does it? Only dessert-type breads have that. But in any case, I enjoy other foods from this company and I'm glad it exists.

review/summary: Best GF bread mix ever
review/text: I've tried many GF bread mixes and ready-to-eat brands and this mix is the best. It's also very versatile and forgiving...I've made it without eggs in the bread machine, even though the pkg cautions not to, and it was just delicious. My grandson asked, "Are you sure this is gluten free?" For a dairy free, soy free, gluten free diet, it's the best, no doubt.

review/summary: very good mix
review/text: By using the directions provided on the bag and my Cuisinart bread maker, we have had excellent and consistent results.  The bread rises nicely, the crust is a lovely brown.  The texture is somewhat dense, not at all crumbly, and the taste is slightly sweet.  It is very good toasted.  My only complaint is that the flavor is a little "yeasty".  Otherwise, my husband and I are quite pleased.  You wouldn't guess that it is gluten free.

review/summary: AMAZING--and I'm not even Gluten Intolerant!
review/text: First of all, I'm not gluten intolerant, but I saw this mix in the store and was  curious.  WOW, this bread is amazingly good!  I can only imagine those who do have an intolerance what a blessing this would be!  It's simply a great product, and tastes very good, and has a great texture.  Something I've notice people say about other gluten-free breads is how they fall apart, and this bread doesn't seem to have that problem.  My husband (who is a hard sell) and kids loved it too!  I've decided to buy more through Amazon's Subscribe & Save service, since it's quite a bit  cheaper than what I would have to pay in the store.  It's a great product, very easy to use and versatile for other recipes too, which I plan to try very soon.  I also love Pamela's Pancake Mix (it tastes and looks like regular pancakes--you wouldn't guess it was gluten-free) & Namaste Spice Cake mix (also gluten-free) is very yummy!

review/text: We have been a gluten free familiy for years and Pamelas products tend to impress. I like this bread so much that I bought 9 bags of it and took it with me to China where we are currently living. I think it is best made in the breadmaker though... This is a bread that can be eaten as just bread for the first day or two after it is made-- many are best as toast. In response to the notes above, I did not find holes in my bags of flour.

review/text: Every year we host the family Christmas get-together at our house. About 6 months ago we discovered that our son & I are both gluten intolerant and the thought of having to bake stuff that everyone could eat AND enjoy without having to make two versions of everything almost sent me over the edge. I used Pamela's Bread Mix & Flour Blend for cookies, brownies, cakes, rolls, crackers ... EVERYTHING ... and all of the "normal" eaters enjoyed the food just as much as my son & I! I'm so thankful Amazon has the bulk bags and the subscribe & save. We already used a lot but now that I've proven just how versatile it can be I know we'll be using even more.

I called amazon and reported it to them and they were very nice and refunded my money. I really hope they fix the problem so i can order the big bag from amazon.

review/summary: Great GF Bread!
review/text: I have used the individual bags of Pamela's Amazing GF Bread mix for some time, but I recently purchased the 3-pack of 4-pound bags.  I am very happy to report that the resulting bread is just as consistently wonderful as always.  Many of my non-GF friends have tasted this loaf, and they are amazed at how good it is! I use the stand-mixer-and-oven-baking method (rather than a bread machine), as I often make round loaves or rolls from the mix.  The bread is delicious, the preparation is easy, and now the cost is much more economical for me.  Just so you know (and you can do the math for yourself to see which is the better purchase for your family), there is (almost) enough flour in each bulk bag for 4 loaves, as prepared according to the directions on the back of the bag. Remember that with this product, yeast will be needed to add to the mix, along with eggs, oil, and water.  Using milk (rice, cow, soy) for all or part of the water will result in an even more tender and moist loaf.<br /><br />I have two loaves in the oven right now.  They smell fantastic!

review/text: This is my favorite wheat-free bread mix. It bakes into a semi-dense, *very* tasty loaf with a toasty color. The crust is light and chewy! My wheat-eating friends and family love this bread even compared to the wheaty varieties out there.<br /><br />It's a tad expensive and you have to get your own yeast for the 4-pound size. I bake a loaf in a bread machine once or twice a week with 10 minutes of kneading, 70 minutes of rising followed immediately by an hour of baking, and although the results vary a bit on humid or dry days, the fresh bread is always delicious.

I love that it has recipes on the back of the bag for all sorts of breads, bagels, and other baked goods. It even includes directions for use with breadmakers. It's so easy. And the results are tasty. The breads to turn out more dense than non-GF loaf bread from the store, but that's the case with most breadmaker breads.

Maybe it will work better for that.<br />Other than being at high altitude (and I followed the high altitude directions) I can't think<br />of anything else that could have gone wrong.

The one huge drawback was he really missed breads and cakes and cookies.  This product has been a prayer answered for our family.

This will now be a permanent fixture in our home. As if we weren't already thrilled, the cost is very reasonable for a gluten-free product.  I wish I could give this product 10 stars I am so happy with it!!!

review/summary: Awesome bread!  We don't miss the store bought stuff with gluten! ;-)
review/text: When we found out my wife had a gluten intolerance, we thought food as we had known it was gone forever.  WRONG!  We now have superb bread daily from this mix.  I have messed up the recipe a few times (forgot to count on the cups of mix, had too much water, etc) and it always turns out great.  We use a Panasonic bread machine (bought here on Amazon).  I will admit this bread is best right out of the machine and gets dry after a couple days (we store it in the fridge).  We always toast it before making sandwiches and it's good to go.  We now subscribe to this mix every 2 months from Amazon and the price per loaf is awesome.  We started with the single loaf bags and then went to these big boys (save $$$).  One note that we learned from the little bags is to substitute a 1/2 cup of the water with milk.  We like the results.

review/summary: Moisture Bread - Jenny from NY
review/text: I ordered this item two weeks ago and started using it.  It is easy to use and the bread was very testy.  I also used other GF mix; they are all strong in bean flour/smell/taste. This mix is a very good with raisins and bread stays moisture for days.  I also use this mix to make chocolate chip cookies and everybody loves it.  Jenny from NY.

review/summary: Warehouse issues are a problem for this product
review/text: My husband has loved bread made from Pamela's Bread Mix ever since we first found it available at a specialty foods store, and we were delighted to learn of its availability in bulk, since he goes through a lot of it over the course of a year. However we have yet to make use of ANY of the bags we purchased from Amazon.com due to the fact that somewhere along the line in the supply process some sort of packing equipment being used managed to puncture every single bag we purchased. All three of the first bags we bought had identical holes in identical locations and were leaking mix out into the box. When we asked for replacements we had to wait several weeks for them to arrive, and when they did the new bags were also punctured in the same spots. Unless Amazon.com, or the manufacturer itself, is able to prompt some sort of better oversight of the equipment used to handle these bags we do not recommend you purchase this product. It's a shame that the warehouse or the operator of the equipment--whichever it is--can have turned out to be such an impediment. We were given a refund for our purchase and have discarded all six bags, unfortunately. So just beware, and check the bags as they come in. These days it seems less than prudent to use any food product that does not come in a fully sealed package.

review/summary: Finally, bread I can eat without it being so heavy it could break a window
review/text: Over the years I have tried many different gluten free flours with pretty bad results! I only wanted to make bread that tasted like bread and wasn't so heavy that I could break a window with it! Finally I tried Pamelas. All I can say is wow! It is so easy to make a loaf a bread in my bread machine that tastes and looks like bread. There is none of the rice flour smell or taste or that gritty texture - I couldn't get over that in many of the flours I had used and although rolls are a little more cumbersome to make, they are so worth it. I make the dough in my machine and then put an icecream scoop of dough into large muffin tins, let it rise and bake it. They are a little more cake like than bread like, but the taste is good. I also add just a little more water then the recipe on the bag suggests - I hate dry rolls.<br />I have also used it to make pancakes and cookies which have come out wonderfully. I tried muffins, but they came out too doughy, although they tasted good.<br /><br />Update - I made cupcakes this week and they were absolutely wonderful. In fact they came out better than ones made with wheat flour! The trick is to add an extra egg to the batter. They were light and fluffy and I ate far too many of them!

review/summary: Great GF Bread in Economical Packaging
review/text: We've tried all the mixes over the years and I have made many homemade mixes.  This is right at the top with the best of the homemade. The only tweak I make is to add  2T bean flour to give it more springiness.<br /><br />Because I have the mix in the large package, I've been able to reduce the amount of mix I use; I use a smaller bread pan with taller sides.  It takes less mix to make a higher loaf than in a traditional pan, so the bread slices are tall as normal bread is. Buying it through Amazon with the regular shipping option makes the loaf price(mix only) go from $5 a loaf for the single package at my local store to $2.50 a loaf for this.

review/summary: Why I like Pamela's Bread Mix
review/text: I like Pamela's Bread Mix because the whole grains used in this mix makes it more nutritious than those used with white flours.  It is easy to use and produces a good loaf every time.  I also like to bake it in my crock pot, using the baking pan especially for crock pot baking.  The batter breads required for gluten free breads work well using this method.  I mix the dough as per directions for oven baking .  After putting it in the pan I follow directions given in my crock pot baking instructions.  Try it, you'll like it!

review/summary: Best gluten free bread, great texture, moist, keeps well
review/text: I fell in love with Pamela's wheat free & gluten free bread mix the first time I tried it. Great taste, moist, good texture - no big holes, etc. I mixed this with a small hand mixer, because I don't have a stand mixer which the recipe actually says to use. I still end up with a very nice bread. It is stickier than a flour based bread that you would knead. Because of that I find it hard to get a really smooth top - no kneading, no rolling, to shape. I even took my Mother a slice. She is a white bread person. She toasted the slice and really liked it. It does taste a bit like a whole grain bread, bit of a sweet tasted. The next load I make, I will probably try a variation and add sharp cheese to the mix.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone wanting a great tasting wheat/gluten free bread mix.

review/summary: This stuff is the best
review/text: We use this for yeast bread, quick breads (like zucchini bread), pizza crust, and pie crust. It is hands down the best gluten-free mix we've found. You can substitute it for wheat flour in most recipes without doing anything fancy, although it helps to add a little extra egg (when the recipe calls for 3 eggs, I add 4).<br /><br />One thing to note is that the dough doesn't rise that much till you put it in the oven, so don't panic about that.

review/summary: Good for desserts not great for bread or pizza
review/text: This is a fairly good GF bread mix but it is WAY sweeter than is necessary. We have used this to make bread and pizza crusts so far. The bread is very odd when used for sandwiches made with lunch meat. The sweet bread contrasts the salty meet in not a good way. That being said, its sweetness adds a pleasant element to PB&J. Likewise, with the pizza, the crust was oddly too sweet. I have yet to make rolls or a cake with this dough mix. I believe they would be a much better application for this mix as the bread seems cakey all by itself. The dough is very messy to work worth but par for the course in the GF world. For bread and pizza crusts, I think I will use some of the more expensive and less sweet mixes that are available. I am going with 4 stars as this product does make good but very sweet products.<br /><br />Now that I've had a few desserts made with this mix I thought I would add an update. So far, I think sugar cookies are the best application for this mix. They have been well enjoyed by all the celiacs and glutenatious people I know. They are slightly cakier than a normal sugar cookie but I don't really find that to be an issue. So for products that are normally sweet any way, this is a good mix. For regular breads and pizza crusts, I still don't love it.

review/summary: Love this Bread!
review/text: I love this bread.  Because we live in Canada and Amazon cannot ship this item to Canada, I have to drive to the USA and pick up my order at a postal outlet.  And I am willing to do it for this product.<br /><br />I make this bread in a Kitchen Aid stand mixer and bake in the oven.  I have changed the recipe quantities slightly to suit my purposes.  I weigh out one third of the bag and make two (smaller) loaves with this amount.  I use slightly more eggs than the recipe calls for--One time making the bread it came out even better than previously and I realized that the eggs that time were much larger than normal large eggs, so thereafter I increased them.<br /><br />I also let the bread fully rise before baking.  I bake for one hour and it turns out excellent EVERY time, I really cannot imagine how anyone could have a problem with this bread.  Maybe they used bad yeast???  Use fresh, good quality bread machine yeast for consistent, quality results. And ensure that your oven temperature is accurate if you have a problem.<br /><br />The best thing about this bread in comparison to other GF bread, is that you can make sandwiches with it and they are still fresh and tasty many hours later, even after travelling through airports and buses and taxis....  Never happened before!

review/summary: Amazing?! More like worst GF bread ever!
review/text: After reading raving reviews ordered this thru subscribe and save, boy, i was wrong! Followed directions very carefully, (basic white mode in bread maker) it didn't rise, came out very hard and dense like a brick and burnt. Didn't care for the taste, smells weird too. Second time used KA mixer, again, followed directions, baked in the oven, (according to directions: bake for 70 minutes, 350F) , bread was already dark in 40 minutes, after 30 more minutes it would be burnt for sure. Didn't rise, again,  like a brick hard and dense.<br />I used the same yeast to make regular French bread just to check if yeast was fresh enough. Wheat flour bread baked beautifully and was very delicious.<br />I just don't understand all the positive reviews out there, nothing is amazing, it's the worst bread mix ever and I can't even return unopened packages :(<br />I want to try other brand bread mixes.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Bread Mix
review/text: I have tried many bread mixes that are gluten-free only to be left with a very bad tasting loaf. This bread works on the normal cycle in my bread machine. Do not try to get fancy and use other bread cycles. Just keep it simple and you will have no problem with the bread coming out right. Its easy to make. The flavor is wonderful. It browns on the outside of the loaf beautifully. It's really not hard to get used to having gluten-free bread when this mix tastes so good.  I highly recommend it. I put cinnamon and raisins into the "Pamela's Sweet Bread" recipe on the back of the bag. Its wonderful and smells so good while cooking. My husband's favorite recipe is the "Pamela's Sweet Bread". There are other recipes on the back of the packaging. (Chewy Pizza Crust, Gingerbread Cookies, Easy Pie Crust, Bagels, Egg-Free Bread and of course the basic recipe and the Sweet Bread recipe.  I am ordering from Amazon because the price is cheaper than locally.

review/text: Pamela's gluten-free bread mix is the best I've tried so far. I was even buying a loaf of g-f bread from a dedicated g-f bakery. It was good, but Pamela's is much softer and holds together well. It does not dry out after a few days like some of the rice breads I've tried. It also holds up well to freezing. So I can make a couple of loaves at a time and keep one on hand in the freezer.

It's easy to put together, versitile (pizza crust, pie crust, bread etc)  However it took me many many months to realize it was this mix that was causing my stomach to still hurt.  Badly.  I don't think it's the sorghum flour I'm leaning towards the chicory root maybe?  My mom has the same reaction to this as I do.<br /><br />If you are new to celiac, need somthing that will work with little effort than this is the mix for you (and deserves 5 stars).  If however, you have a sensitive stomach then I think you should try another mix.  I would definately suggest trying the small bag first and if you don't blow up like a balloon think about getting a larger amount!

review/summary: The worst gluten free bread mix ever
review/text: I have purchased Pamela's products thinking that it would be great to be able to make homemade gluten free bread that tasted fresh, but I was very disappointed with this product.  It is the worst gluten-free bread product that I have ever tried.  It not only did not rise (the first time I thought it was just a bad batch, but it happened twice), and the bread doesn't cook completely, even when you extend the time.  It comes out doughie and uncooked in the center.  And don't think that I am a novice bread maker, I have been baking bread for years.  I would never buy this product or recommend it.  If you want great homemade gluten-free bread, buy gluten-free pantry bread mix.  It tastes like regular bread and works like a charm.

It doesn't have any of that chalkiness of other gluten-free bread mixes and has a yummy flavor that's close to the taste of a whole wheat bread. If you don't manage to consume the whole loaf, I recommend cutting it up into small cubes and drying it in a low-heat oven -- it makes fabulous croutons or you can grind them up to make tasty bread crumbs.

review/summary: Too good to be true!
review/text: I've tried several different gluten free breads, and had resigned myself to 'gritty' tasting products.  Boy, was I overjoyed when I baked and tasted my first loaf of bread using Pamela's Bread Mix & Flour Blend!  The loaf lasted approximately 5 minutes - a sure sign that my four teens agreed!  The bread was fluffy, yet substantial, and tasted just like the homemade loaves that I used to make before giving up wheat.  I make this in my Cuisinart bread machine, and have not had a single problem to date.  I've taught my teens to make this bread as well, and we now take turns preparing the morning loaf. Recovering from colon cancer surgery and learning to follow a celiac diet has been difficult to say the least, but this product has returned a bit of normalcy to my daily routine.

review/summary: Awesome Bread Mix
review/text: This is so far the best gluten-free bread mix I have found. While not exactly like wheat bread it is a great substitute, making large fluffy slices of bread that do not break into crumbs.

review/summary: Good for Sweets--Not Exactly All Purpose
review/text: I have mixed feelings about this mix. After all the hype, I was expecting a mix that was out of this world fantastic. And it had all the texture, shape, and smell of real bread, but something was off about it. It had a sweet taste to it--which I hate in bread. Pamela's is a great company and their products are fantastic, but I don't find this all purpose at all. Evaporated cane sugar, honey, and molasses have no business in something a company claims customers can use for anything from pizza to biscuits.<br /><br />I made the mistake of using this stuff for dredging for fried chicken. I almost threw up--sweet fried chicken? Gross. The dumplings in chicken and dumplings? Sweet enough to be unpalatable. Pizza? My 4 year old wouldn't eat it.<br /><br />But hey--if you're using it in something sweet like waffles or making cookies, it works like a dream. And I will sing it praises for that, but unfortunately, I need something that is truly all purpose and without added sugar.<br /><br />For me, I'd rather mix my own GF mix, it's cheaper and just as fast without the hit and miss issues with this mix. I'll use up the stuff I have for anything that requires sugar, but I've learned my lesson.

review/summary: Gluten Free Flour - wonderful!
review/text: Excellent service. Speedy delivery and perfectly as advertised. Thank you!<br /><br />It makes excellent bread. My son is gluten intolerant (self diagnosed) and we have found that if you adhere to the recipe on the back of the flour, the break comes out too hard and crumbly for him. We have added an extra teaspoon of yeast, and a half cup extra of liquid. The mixture rises much better now, leaves decent sized CO2 holes in the bread and is much more pliable. He says it now testes like real bread! That is what I call a result!<br /><br />I suggest you experiment with the ingredients until you find your ideal mixture!

review/summary: Been wanting to try this......
review/text: So I have really been wanting to try this. Signed up for Subscribe and Save, hoping for the best. I made it for the first time tonight and OMG. This bread is soooooo amazing!! I have done different homemade loaves and loved Udi's but was getting burnt out. I found Pamela's to be very moist, springy and does not crumble like others have. The flavor almost reminds me of a sweet version of sour dough bread. I trimmed the edges some and got the equivalent of 9 sandwiches, using my electric knife. I am absolutely thrilled with our new bread!!! It's a keeper!
