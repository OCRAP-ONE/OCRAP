review/summary: Tim Tams rock my face off
review/text: Tim Tams are the most amazing cookie ever created. Just bite off both ends and suck a hot drink through it (like coffee or my favorite, hot chocolate). You gotta wait until it's about to fall into the drink due to over-saturation and then SLAM IT! (That means put it in your mouth and eat it.)

review/summary: The Third Bite
review/text: These cookies will surprise you, but only if you take at least 3 bites.  I shared my box with friends and family, yet each of us noticed a pattern.<br /><br />Bite 1 will remind you vaguely of other US cookies-candies yet you cant place the taste.  Bite 2 you'll say, "This is pretty good but not worth importing it from Australia.". By bite 3, you'll be searching for more.  Each of my friends who tried one vowed on their 3rd bite to buy them online or when the holiday season finally brings some to Target.  My coworker tried a Tim Tam slam (bite the ends then suck milk through like a straw before eating it).  She went from not impressed in bite 1 to asking me to help her order enough some from Australia.<br /><br />This isn't a soft or gourmet cookie.  Its similar to the simple joys of an oreo but far more addictive when you reach bite 3.  The closest comparison i can give is BERGER COOKIES from Baltimore which are simple but beyond addictive.

review/summary: Amazon comes through AGAIN!
review/text: My vet of over 30 years has a mom that still works in the hospital. I adore the woman and one day she shared one of these cookies. She told me another patient's "person" brings them to her from Australia. I knew I could find and probably at a nearby deli that I use often. It has a great international selection. Since they never bothered to return a call or answer my email, I went to my old friend Amazon. Sure enough, there they were!  I bought my friend some more and also some for my Mother ( actually mother-in-law) who loves sweets. They are delicious. Worth every penny.

review/text: Love these and am glad to be able to get them here.  If you're looking for a rich chocolate cookie, Tim Tams are it.  Not sure which American cookie to compare them to, probably a chocolate covered Oreo, but with a chocolate middle.  Lots of chocolate here.  That's actually a downside for me.  Too much chocolate.  A little goes a long way with me, so these are amazing in moderation and with a big glass of milk.

review/summary: These kick Oreos in the Behind
review/text: I'm not sure what "Hipcat 21" is referring to, but the Tim Tams I just ate from Australia would be pretty darn hard to suck milk through. They are a layered wafer cookie, and you'd have to have the suction of a Hoover vacuum to pull milk through those babies. But, they are amazing little pieces of heaven, even if completely worthless as a straw. They are crispy, and chocolaty, and so darned good that I would gladly give up my Double Stuff Oreos if these were widely sold in the US. Those lucky Australians!!

My boss at work get's the Pepperidge Farm versions in Canada and they are tasty, but don't compare to the variety and subtle creamy finish of the Aussie bars. I guess $13 isn't too much to ask to send something all the way from down under. I LOVE THESE BARS!

There is a catch with ordering them from Amazon: THEY TAKE FOREVER TO GET TO YOU. Mine probably spent 2 and a half weeks with Singapore customs. My friend who also ordered on the same day as I have experiences the same delay.  By the time i got them I had forgotten I even placed the order. Cookies were great but not really worth the wait.

review/summary: One of the Best Cookies I've Ever Tasted
review/text: Don't be fooled. It is a biscuit...but it tastes more like a chocolate bar, and has calories to match. Yet this is probably Australia's best treat. It is very good. I was surprised. It's fun to eat and it tastes very good. The level of sweetness is just right. While I describe Tim Tam as a dense malt chocolate biscuit, with a dense chocolaty creme atop, covered in milk chocolate, I must say that it's much more than that (as far as sweets are concerned). Try it out. I'm assured that you won't be disappointed. It's also fun to bit off two end and suck in milk to make it mushy. This is definitely a classic, up there with the Oreo, or higher.

review/summary: Excellent price, but a little dusty
review/text: This tea's got a lovely flavor (I've probably made about five gallons of iced tea with it so far), but there's a lot of sediment left in the bottom of each batch (I'd say on par or greater than most tea bags I've seen, which normally are far worse than loose teas).  It's perfect if you want an unsweetened iced green tea with a mango backnote.  (I steep mine at 140F for 3 minutes).  Just be prepared not to finish the end of your brew, as it'll have a good bit of bitter sediment in the bottom (which somehow doesn't seem to impact the flavor of the tea itself, even if you let it sit in the fridge for a few days).<br /><br />I'll definitely be looking into other offerings from Coffee Bean Direct once I figure out what sort of tea I want next.

review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.

review/summary: The worst 'tea' I have ever tried.
review/text: I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.

review/text: First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

review/text: I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best. I use honey and sugar to sweeten and down the hatch it goes! Expect some, um, gastrointestinal responses the next day. Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I don't. Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to 'work'...and sometimes it won't!!

review/text: though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did

review/text: I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else.

review/summary: Tastes like sweaty gym socks
review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

review/text: I also was unable to find this gum at local stores any more.  It's a nice, solid mint with a twist.  Sweet enough, but not too fruity sweet.  The packaging always makes me happy, too.  If you use the bottom compartment of gum first, it tears off and you can then continue to carry around your now-smaller but still solid package of gum.  If you haven't seen the packaging yet, it will make sense when you do.  I've had trouble with other gum containers becoming harder to work with as the product gets used up.  This one is never that way.

review/summary: True Apple Taste
review/text: I have tried a number of apple green teas and have always felt a bit let down, until I met this one. It's beauty is in it's simplicity. You won't taste cinnamon or any other spice that so commonly turns up in any teas that have apple in them. The apple flavor comes from the bits of real apple found in the flow through pyramid tea bag.<br /><br />The green tea itself has a nice smooth flavor that goes so well with the very present, but not overpowering apple flavor. I like to put just a smidge of sugar in it and then sit back and enjoy. The only problem with this tea is that it often is hard to get. It's a little costly, but in my opinion worth every penny. I highly recommend that you give it a try.

review/summary: Most AMAZING tea
review/text: Strange how from time to time, a certain product will COMPELL you to actually go out of your way to write a review. Well, this one is it. I had sushi with a friend on Valentines Day, and, while plum wine is usually what we drink, I opted for a warm tea that day. This tea is absolutely exquisite from the design and texture of the pyramid teabag, to the granny smith apple notes. It is mild and delightfully smooth (whereas other green teas, you get a bitter green tea flavor) and, combined with the bits of granny smith apple, it made for yummy tasting tea. Heaven. It stands well on its own without sweetening (again, I'm thinking of all the other fruit teas i've tried from Celestial seasonings such as lemon zinger, that are way too sour and somehow require that you neutralize the acidic aftertaste with honey or creamer) this one is just perfect! Certainly takes the bordome out of ordering typical green tea. I recommend this one to anyone who does not typically like the taste of green tea, but is taking it for dietary reasons. Must order me some packs.

review/text: We understand the need for orgainc foods. So, I was glad to try this brand of meat. We ordered these steaks for a holiday dinner and you can imagine how disappointed we were when they arrived at room temperature with no kind of coolant intact at all!!! What cooling agent there was, was long since spent. We are afraid to eat the meat.  I immediately called the organic meat company, and asked for a refund; left a message on voicemail.  I have not yet called Amazon cutomer service, but, will of the meat company does not make good on our order. Very annoying. If a company is going to send perishables, it should take care in doing it.<br /><br />Follow up on this order. The owner returned my call and another order of properly shipped meat was deilvered to us. We cooked some of these steaks and they are superb. If you are a meat lover you owe it to yourself to try these steaks.<br />DF

review/text: Bigelow's Green Tea with Blueberry was a wonderful surprise on a recent camping trip in Alaska! The blueberry adds a great tone to the taste of the smooth green tea. I highly recommend this tea to anyone looking for a change from typical green teas. Note that the recipe seems to have changed, though, from Blueberry to "Wild Blueberry with Acai". I haven't tried that one yet...

review/summary: Just Peachy
review/text: Okay, you have to accept these for what they are: Freeze dried peaches. They are very, very light. Almost like sweet, peach flavored styrofoam. Not appetizing when I say it that way but they are delicious. The concentrated peach flavor is appealing though the crunchy texture gives way to an almost sticky consistency when you eat them straight.<br /><br />They make an unbelievable topping for cereal (warm or cold). Also fun to bake into bread.

review/summary: Great for toddlers and mamas
review/text: These peaches are a great treat for toddlers--I give them only four stars because, though most of the chunks melt in your mouth (great for older babies), some naturally dry tougher and are grown-up only consistency (chewy, tough to bite, and downright hard). This is not a flaw from the makers, but a natural variation inherent in fruit. Still, it keeps them from being perfect.<br /><br />Please note: to give these peaches to toddlers you have to supervise the biting into smaller pieces, or chop them up before handing them over, because the pieces are too big to be safe straight out of the tub. Worth it, though.<br /><br />These peaches are a bit tart, so they're nice because they're not overly sweet or fake peach-tasting.<br /><br />Other fruits from this brand that are good early finger foods for toddlers are the strawberries (once you've introduced this potentially allergenic food) and the raspberries. Some, like the raisins, mangoes, and especially persimmons, need to be rehydrated before giving them to small people.<br /><br />Organic version available at the just tomatoes web site, if you prefer.

review/summary: Sort of like weird fizzy rocks. Expensive Fizzy Rocks
review/text: Peaches are my favorite fruit, and after having wonderful experiences with the other "Just Tomatoes" products, I was looking forward to trying these. I expected something like the concentrated flavor of peaches in a tasty, very crunchy package.<br /><br />Sadly,my expectations were not met.  At all.<br /><br />The package I had was not crunchy in the usual sense:  the little cubes were tough to bite into, and little bits of cube stuck to your teeth.  The cubes were barely sweet and had no discernable taste of peaches. After an initial handful, no one in our family would go near the things.  I ended up throwing the remaining cubes into a batch of cupcake batter, figuring that it might add a bit of extra nutrition.  It did that, but even better, the chocolate cupcakes have a mild taste of peach.<br /><br />But there is no way I would buy these again as a subtle cupcake flavoring.  I'll eat the strawberries and blueberries, and leave these peaches to find a nice home with someone else.

review/summary: World's best chili
review/text: If you realize how much store bought chili has in daily salt it might concern you and of course it has meet products on the average. I feel virtuous when I eat this chili. No meat and low salt with a great taste. I wonder if it is healthy for you - it just might be. Of course, after I add the cheddar cheese and more salt it is a wonder my heart does not stop working. Still, adding your own salt will give you a lower salt chili. The human tongue has a hard time reacting and tasting salt that is dissolved in tomatoes or beans or any number of other products. However, if it is on the surface like a potato chip it might have less salt that you would otherwise believe. So just a pinch of course sea salt and it becomes  salty enough.<br /><br />I could eat this chili everyday of my life if I had to and would have no complaints. I buy a case each month and try to keep myself from running out. The only bad news is I have tried a thousand times to please myself with homemade chili and now I think I will just buy Amy's Spicy Chili and give up on the idea I could make anything better.

review/summary: Great Product, Bad Delivery
review/text: Amy's Chili gets 5 stars from me for quality - it's fantastic and is the only canned chili I will eat. The non-lite version is slightly better but this is quality in it's own right. The consistency is good and the spice is acceptable to me (I add more) but not too much for people who prefer a milder flavor. EXCELLENT product.<br /><br />Sadly, Amazon's delivery of this product is sub-par. ONLY order it alone. If you subscribe and save multiple items they will bundle this into a large box and you will end up with 12 out of 12 badly dented cans (which may or may not be safe to eat - I personally wouldn't risk it). I've gotten several boxes, but they were all single orders. Lesson? Pay the extra $3 or whatever and order this separately and NOT on the subscribe and save plan.<br /><br />Or just go to your local store and buy it.

review/text: True it is a little mild, but the base is great, vegan, half the normal sodium and 30 gm of protein per can. Easily fixed; just add crushed red pepper flakes (better then hot sauce because it does not add sodium unlike most hot sauces)(Trader Joe's does carry a sodium free hot sauce called CHILI PEPPER SAUCE that could work too) and add garlic powder(NOT garlic salt). This is a perfect heavenly fix alone that really bumps up the flavor but I have occaisiionally added sesame seeds also just for an interesting variation. Two minutes in the microwave and it really cures your chili craving! A cheap easy fix and you will never miss the salt!

review/text: I agree with some of the other reviewers (for the NON-Classic syrup). I have been buying this product, mostly to add to coffee, for several years. At some point, I noticed that the flavor changed, and (to my palate at least), it was a change for the worse. After noticing some of the recent reviews, I made sure to order the "Classic" flavor when my supply started to run low. When it arrived, I taste-tested vs. the "non-Classic" syrup that I still had on hand, and (again, to my palate), the "Classic" tasted far superior. I suppose other people may prefer the new flavor, but for me, the Classic is the one I'll order from now on.

review/text: I searched a long time this summer for these vines - missed out the first two times Amazon got some in stock, but finally got them in my cart and purchased. I was expecting a bit stronger of a grape flavor (like Jolly Joes), so my first impression was disappointment. But as I've eaten a few more packages, I've come to appreciate the more subtle flavoring. The flavor could be a bit stronger but I can appreciate what Red Vines is trying to do here, I think.  I haven't rushed to eat the initial shipment and am still deciding if I'll order more or just hope to find them at retail, but they are worth at least sampling.  Just don't expect strong grape flavor.

review/summary: Waiting on grape flavor to develop further
review/text: There is a vast improvement in both texture and grape flavor once the package is opened and allowed to air-dry for 36 hours.  Initially, the first piece I withdrew from a fresh package broke due to the very soft texture.  Further, I could not discern any grape flavor and worse, a waxy profile permeated the twist.  After 1.5 days, the texture improved 300%, the aroma at least 100%, and I could clearly discern the subtle grape flavor one reviewer cited.  The "waxy" profile was reduced by half its original strength but remains noticeable.  I will continue the curing process and re-edit this review after a week or two; hoping to report the grape flavor has concentrated further while the "waxy" flavor has diminished.  These twists are mildly sweet with 4 grams of sugar per twist.<br /><br />If the grape flavor were much stronger and the "waxy" flavor eliminated, this product would be 5 stars.

I eat them, but they are not satisfying to a sweet tooth craving in the same way the red vines original red licorice flavor are. My 14 month old loves them, but we don't give her sweets often, so they might be really sweet to her.

The red vines/grape vines product is by far the best licorice vines out there.<br /><br />One good tidbit to know is that if you leave in the open over night it gets hard, which is a good thing in my book.

review/summary: STALE :(
review/text: I love RedVines and I love grape flavored candies, so when I saw they also made GrapeVines (which stores in my area don't carry) I was completely on board.  In theory, I think these could be good.  Their flavor actually tastes pretty much like grape kool aid from what I could tell... its just that arrived very very stale.  I know the "trick" about microwaving stale redvines to refresh them, however when I open the box the day I order a product and they are already so stale you can hardly chew them it is very disappointing.  These would probably have been good fresh, and were "okay" (definitely not craveable) with a little microwave boost, but they should have ARRIVED fresh.  Yuck.<br />I guess I should have known better than to order a somewhat obscure product on amazon.  I will not be buying these, or likely any other candy, on amazon again.  It's not worth the very likely chance that it will come stale. So disappointing! :(
