review/summary: Outstanding Spice
review/text: A great spice for cooking. Used properly you can get all the flavor and the heat but the duration of the "burn" isn't as long as the sauce. Like an extra sharp cheddar cheese you need to cook with it to appreciate its quality and potential.

review/summary: Ghost Pepper Powder Review
review/text: It is very good and when you eat it, it gives you a very slow burn where you feel nothing at first but as time passes it gets to more and more hot. The one negative thing is that it is not as hot as you would expect, I beleive that they put filler in it because I actually ate wings that were hotter before and I tried a spoon full of this powder straight.

review/summary: Excellent, But Take Care
review/text: Not terribly long ago, I found some really delicious Sunsweet Dried and Pitted Plums on a small bag (about 6 ounces). They were excellent, some of the best dried plums I've ever had. Of course, I wrote them up for Amazon an Amazon review and gave them a 5-star rating. You can probably find my report, if you like.<br /><br />Well, today I visited my local Costco warehouse store and found those same dried plums relabeled under the Kirkland Signature/Sunsweet brand and in a much larger 56-ounce bag. I was delighted and picked up a bag, although this is a lot of dried plums. Anyway, they're an excellent product and much cheaper by the ounce in such a economy large bag. They're good tasting and have a lot of vitamins and fiber and they're not overly high on calories. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />As you may know, plums (or prunes) can be an excellent natural laxative for bowel regulation and I use them on that basis frequently. You might take care with these. They're so delicious that you can easily overindulge and may pay the consequences. Not too long ago, I greatly overate and about a couple hours later I was able to excrete through the eye of a needle. Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration, for a little touch of humor, but take care.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: delicious and healthy--when enjoyed in moderation, of course
review/text: The packaging label may indicate that both Kirkland Signature and Sunsweet made these "pitted dried plums;" but rest assured that these are the same delicious prunes as the ones you can buy from Sunsweet. (The name is sometimes changed from "prunes" to "dried plums" so that they would sell better!) The main advantage here is the size of the container; you get 50 ounces and that should last you a while longer than smaller sized packages. They are delicious, sweet and tasty; and if I didn't know I have to watch how many I eat to avoid stomach problems, I could eat these all day.<br /><br />If you eat these pitted dried plums routinely to keep "regular," I would suggest that you buy them in this size. They won't go bad unless you open the container and let them sit for months; this won't happen though since you'll have finished eating these well before then.<br /><br />In addition, these contain the same wonderful antioxidants, fiber and potassium as any other brand of dried pitted plums or prunes; and that's a huge plus. However, they do contain a fair amount of sugar; if you're diabetic you might want to check with your doctor or dietician before you eat too many of these.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these dried pitted plums; they are healthy and make a terrific snack. They contain sugar for a relatively quick, short-term energy boost in addition to the health benefits and they are always fresh and tasty.

review/summary: Highest antioxidant...
review/text: I keep the big bag in the refrigerator inside another zip lock bag even though I consume this frequently and need to purchase another bag every month. Excellent tasting. Prunes are dry plums but amazingly California changed the name to DRY PLUMS couple years ago for marketing reasons. It is amazing what marketing does since here is a product called prunes which has twice the amount of antioxidants as blueberries but it does not get the recognition since it does not cost ten times more, or because it is not exotic enough or probably since it does not come from Amazon. Regardless I consume 5 to 10 of these every single day since not only these are excellent tasting fruit, it has no additives and it tastes well with hot tea before bed time but more importantly what a help it is when I get up every morning... the best thing you can give to your digestion system... Bravo.

review/summary: Very good deal.
review/text: These are very good, sweet, full plums, exactly as advertised, and just like you get in the store (in smaller pack sizes).  It is nice to be able to order a food product through Amazon when the store is out.<br /><br />Only one minor problem.  The sack is huge.  It contains about 3 paks of the Sunsweet Family size you can get in the store.  Towards the end of this pack, the prunes can be a little squished and hard to get out (you have to reach very deep).  The Family size pack by Sunsweet is ideal.<br /><br />The box the product arrived in was not too well sealed with tape.  The yellow bag was fine, but the cardboard container was not sealed well, and when it arrived, I could imagine that the yellow bag could have easily slipped out.

As a kid growing up in the South, it seemed like I could always find them somewhere.  In recent years, I haven't been able to find even bad ones to satisfy that very specific craving.  These Stuckey's logs are almost as good as I remember from my youth and the 4 oz size is just about perfect. Even for someone like me who has been craving a good ole pecan log for a few years, the amount was more than enough to satisfy that long overdue craving but not too much to make be sick to the stomach.

review/text: For years I have loved getting the Swedish Crepes from IHOP.  Everytime we went I would get this dish.  My wife surprised me one day by making Swedish Crepes with the Lingonberry preservers and the Lingonberry butter!  It is the BEST breakfast I have ever had and will be having a major impact to my waistline.  I refuse to let her make them for anyone else, not even the kids.  The Lingonberries are an excellent cross between cranberries and strawberries.  Not too sweet not too tart.  Wish the price was a little better otherwise highly recommend.

review/summary: Low Quality
review/text: These chocolates seemed like a REALLY good deal. I love Lindor, but the store near me was out of the assorted kind. I wanted some for my sister's birthday party. I got on Amazon and found these, cheap price and free shipping! Wow! So I ordered some.<br /><br />First, they came, and I opened one, and immediately got suspicious. They looked melted, and they were soft. I had read some reviews that people got melted ones, but I ordered mine in April, a cold april, and the temperatures hadn't been over 55 degrees. It hasn't been hot enough to melt them! I've had chocolate melt on me before, and then harden back up. It looks a little glossy, sometimes white on the surfaces, and is usually denser (not lighter/softer/greasier), but I've never seen or tasted "melted" chocolate like this.<br /><br />Second, they tasted, well, cheap. I still had some of the milk chocolate variety, and I tasted them, bite of one, bite of the other. And there is a big difference. Also, the chocolate in the center of the Amazon one was LOW. Not NEARLY as much as the store bought one.<br /><br />Third, I stuck them in the fridge, thinking that would stiffen them up. I was hoping the off/cheap taste and the softness was from somehow being melted (though even then I had my doubts). They've been in the fridge for two days. I opened one this morning, and they are still as soft and cheap tasting as the one I had before. Also, this one has a poke hole in one side and a "plug" that had fallen out. This plug was big and light colored and soft. It seems obvious that its not the same qulity of chocolate and that the process that poked the hole in the side and "plugged" it was not the regular Lindor method! I compared it to one of the store bought ones, and it looked NOTHING like the storebought ones. It just looks terrible.<br /><br />I am not a chocolate expert, and can't say for sure that this is not because of them being melted, but they look ALTERED to me, and taste CHEAP and OILY - GREASY like they were cut with much cheaper chocolate. I don't know how the packaging and wrappers would be Lindor while the chocolate isn't, but that's how they looked and tasted - different. Can melting change the density, texture and taste of cholocate? Maybe, but, in my experience, not like this.<br /><br />I am beyond suspicious and into nervous. I ATE these, and I don't know what they are! They don't look or taste real! It makes me sick to my stomach to think they might have been altered or cut or faked.<br /><br />I am very disappointed, and am sticking to the more expensive store bought. My sister and her friends are just going to have to deal with a plain old one flavor bowl full.<br /><br />I really hope I'm wrong, but buyer beware. If they look funny, feel soft and have fishy looking poke holes/plugs, think twice. Eat them if you want to, but mine went in the garbage.

The infection may still be there but the sore are all gone. All he has now is some red spots. He no longer has to take pain pills every day, and he has not been back to the stupid doctors since.

review/text: *****Update 11/17/10****** When I created this review, the product being sold was HNZ Honey New Zealand Active 20+ honey.  This product listing has been changed to an unknown brand.*****<br /><br />This quote is taken from the HNZ website Q & A regarding the difference between "UMF" and "ACTIVE" Manuka.  I don't know who posted the "Product Description" for this product, but it is wrong and falsely leading consumers to purchase something they think is UMF. I am not discrediting the Active 20+ Manuka honey from HNZ.  It may be just as healthy as UMF 20+.  I have the Active 30+ and it tastes amazing, like caramel. In fact, the Active honey HNZ sells is the best honey I have ever tasted.<br /><br />""What is the difference between `UMF' & `Active' Manuka Honey?<br /><br />Not all Manuka honey has UMF (Non peroxide) activity and we differentiate this by using the names UMF Manuka and Active Manuka Honey.<br /><br />UMF Manuka Honey guarantees a Non Peroxide activity that is based on the UMF testing regime initiated by Prof. Molan. This in turn is measured against a standard Phenol (antiseptic/anti bacterial) solution to gauge the relative strength of the Non Peroxide activity against Phenol. So, UMF 20+ guarantees antibacterial Non Peroxide Activity (UMF) level of 20+.<br /><br />For example, Honey New Zealand's Active 20+ honey guarantees honey's total antibacterial activity level of 20+. This Total Activity is mostly from the Hydrogen Peroxide activity of honey (as opposed to the Non Peroxide Activity of UMF Honey).<br /><br />Both Total (Active) and Non Peroxide (UMF) activities are tested by certified independent lab in New Zealand.<br /><br />In regards to health benefits, UMF is more stable over time, does not break down with heat, light or body enzymes and may even grow in strength over time.""

review/text: Manuka honey is very good for you but also generally overpriced. This honey has a Unique Manuka Factor ("UMF") of 20+, which accounts for part of the high price. However, you can also get UMF 16+ for only about $30, which in my view is worth the savings. Bio Active has other products to choose from.<br /><br />If the UMF of 20 is important to you, this product is recommended. Otherwise, I would recommend a 2.2 lb jar of UMF 16 - slightly little more expensive, but twice as much honey.

review/summary: Another winner from Amy's
review/text: In a world where canned chili is usually filled with fat, salt, and preservatives, Amy's chili is a welcome relief to those of us who are trying to eat healthier.  Chili is a favorite in our family but I can't seem to make it very well for some reason. It's just not my fort&eacute;. However, other commercially-made chilis are so very high in sodium and fat that we just had to go without chili for a while. When we tried this, we weren't sure what to expect.<br /><br />The results were delicious!  It's just the right amount of spicy, you don't miss the salt, and it's bursting with flavor. This chili is even good straight-out-of-the-can so if you live in a hurricane area, this is a must for your hurricane kit. I highly recommend this for chili-lovers who are trying to have a healthier diet.

review/summary: It's okay, but better with "tweaks"
review/text: I find that this is nice and filling and, being an Amy's product, gives me greater peace of mind about quality ingredients.<br /><br />However, let's be honest--this is still a rather bland chili offering. And I don't mean bland in the spicy-level way. I mean bland in the flavor way.<br /><br />YET..it's a very, very good base to customize. You got the nice ingredients, the plentiful beans, the tofu for protein (if you don't mind that). I add tomatoes, peppers, onions, and hot sauce or some sort of salsa, plus onion powder, to give it more flavor and texture. I will add some organic or low-fat shredded Mexican or cheddar on top for fun, too. I find once I tweak it, I really like it for lunch with some brown rice or organic tortillas.<br /><br />It works very nicely in a layer dip with chips, too.<br /><br />I appreciate the lower sodium levels, as I have high BP.<br /><br />I recommend this if you don't mind customizing your canned chili. Or, if you're used to bland canned food, then it could suit you "as is" from the can.<br /><br />Either way, if you're looking for a convenience food that's as wholesome as prepackaged stuff of this sort can be, this is a good bet. Give it a try. Play with it. It might become a staple for you.<br /><br />And if you like canned convenience foods, try Amy's Low-Sodium cream of tomato soup. I find that one very nice--comfort food. (The cream of mushroom is nice if you add more of your own fresh organic mushrooms and some spices--garlic powder, onion powder, a pinch of thyme, black pepper, otherwise it also is rather bland.)<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir

review/text: This is a hearty, healthy and tasty chili.  I eat it alone or use it as a topping for vegetarian hot dogs or burgers. It's labeled medium-hot but I found it to be a little spicier than expected; not to worry though,I toned it down by adding a tsp of lite sour cream - yum! I think you'll enjoy this product. The flavor is so good that you really don't miss the salt.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I enjoy many of Amy's Organic products so when I purchased this I assumed I'd like it.<br /><br />I had planned to use this as a base and later add in more ingredients. But after opening the can, emptying it into a pot to shimmer, and sampling it I changed my mind. Ick! The grated tofu (I assume it is the tofu adding the grittiness to the chili, anyway) is very unpleasant. It didn't taste like tofu, or anything really.. It just felt tough and like plastic. The texture it added was not enjoyable at all.<br /><br />The flavor wasn't anything to rave about either. It was alright, but I couldn't get past how gross that grit was so I wasn't able to eat much of it.<br /><br />In the future I won't take short cuts... I'll just make my own chili from scratch.

review/text: I was expecting this to be like the regular Amy's Medium Chili, just less sodium.  Doesn't seem to be the case.  I love the regular, but this was really bland and tried "recovering" it with salt, then pepper, then hot sauce.  No go.  I couldn't recover anything like the regular. Since we don't have issues with blood pressure anyway, we're sticking with the salted version!

review/summary: AMY'S LOW SALT MEDIUM CHILI
review/text: I ordered the following Amy's Low Salt Products: Lentil Soup, Pea Soup, Minestrone Soup, and Medium Chili.  All of them are great.  If you are just now switching to Low salt or no salt you may find them to be bland until your body adjusts to the lowered salt intake (that could take months or up to a year).  The biggest complaint most have is the dented cans.  My Minestrone and Chili came in without any dents, the Pea Soup had 2 dented cans and the Lentils had dents in every can.  These dents are not caused by shipping.  All of my shipments came in with the packages totally intact with no signs that the outer shipping box had been roughed up in shipment.  These dents are caused by Amazon or Amy's warehousing.  The cans are not in boxes, they are shrink wrapped so when stacked the cans are actually bearing the weight.  Too much weight and the cans begin to buckle and this buckling will look like dents.  You can also get this same effect if the warehousemen are slamming the 12 pack cans down hard on top of each other.  This happens when workers in the warehouse get tired and become careless, are untrained, or just plain don't care about their job.  If you want to feel better then stay on a low salt diet, if you have ankle swelling then get on a low salt diet and get checked for congestive heart failure.  If you have high blood pressure get on a low salt diet and then increase your intake of magnesium.  Backing off your salt is not easy as it begins to change the way you taste food but if you stay with it and get off the high salt diet you will begin to taste food and not just the salt.  Have you ever eaten at a restaurant where the cook's salt intake is so high that the cook can't tell if he has too much salt in the food he is preparing?  I have more than once and it just destroys the meal.  Instead of buying 12 cans now try the Amy's Low Salt by getting it at your local health food store one can at a time then if you like order from Amazon and save.  Right now they have a 25% discount code when you order.  Write it down and use it as it saved me a few bucks.  Hope this review helps you.

review/summary: SO MUCH CHICKEN THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT
review/text: I was told by my vet that I had to put the world's pickiest cat... my European Burmese, Dante, on a wet cat food after he had lived on a dry food diet the first 6 months of his life.  3 months later, I'd tried a can of every cat food at 2 pet stores with no luck.  Then, I decided to try the Soulistic brand of pure shredded chicken in gravy. This is a cat who wouldn't even eat boiled chicken and he inhaled this!  It has to be a texture thing with him because he hated pates and gelees. Now, after a year on the Soulistic plain chicken in gravy (He still won't touch the chicken with pumpkin!)he has decided to include the chicken and tuna in gravy.  We are delighted to have found a healthy diet for our cat at such an affordable price for a generous 5.5 ounce can.  One other company has offered a similar product but offers a 2.2 ounce can at a much higher price.  I agree that the chicken and tuna has more gravy than the plain chicken formula with gravy, but we feel that it provides a good balance in his diet by using the two varieties.

review/text: Having purchased the Soulistic "Gelee" and BFF (made by the same company) I wanted to try the "Gravy" flavors to add some more variety.  Although the food looks appetizing and all the cats seem to like the food, I was dismayed to see that there seemed to be as much gravy as food in the cans.  I do not want to be paying the same price for cans that contain this much liquid and less food.  I will purchase the "Gelee" foods and BFF again, but it isn't likely that I will purchase the "Gravy" flavors.

It is absolutely delicious.<br /><br />When I have friends who tell me they don't like curry, I make them try this.  It is sweet (being made with coconut milk and cinnamon) and savory (having potatoes and peanuts), only mildly spicy.  Since it is made with coconut milk, it is also naturally dairy free!<br /><br />It is also highly adaptable - the recipe calls for potatoes, onions and chicken, but you could also use beef, shrimp, pork, or throw in some carrots, whatever you want!

review/summary: Crushed leaves
review/text: I just received my order and within the expected time frame. What I expected were whole leaves, but instead I received 12 small bags of leaves that have been crushed into small and tiny peices. I am using them (I need them for a dish and they are hard to find), but I was hoping for the whole leaves. If you are interested in this item, please know that they are not whole leaves but small peices.

review/text: I have loved elderberry jelly since I was a child in the 60s. As an adult, I was extremely dismayed to find Smucker's no longer offered elderberry in their line of jellies. After much searching, I found Mrs. Miller's Homemade Elderberry Jelly on Amazon and could not wait for my order to arrive. And I was not disappointed! In fact I do believe Mrs. Miller's Homemade Jelly is the best I have ever had. The taste so fresh and crisp. The jelly wholesome and packed with flavor! The taste transported me back to my childhood and wonderful memories of warm toast and jelly in the mornings shared with my Mom. She would have loved it, too. My next order is going to be a big one!

But there are no Elderberries growing in Arizona so I was extremely happy to find some before my husband passed away.  Mrs. Miller's tastes just like I had picked the berries and made the jelly myself.  Thankyou soooo much!

review/summary: Making Memories Last
review/text: Not only do plain elderberries taste good, but they have amazing health properties.  On May 31, 2012, Dr. Oz had a show featuring ways to prevent/reverse Alzheimer's.  He had a guest, a Dr. Fotuhi who is a specialist in brain growth and development.  Dr. Fotuhi gave the voice of hope - we all have the ability to make our brains literally grow and thus prevent/offset degenerative neurological conditions later in life.  One of the healthy approaches recommended on that show was eating elderberries.  That is an added incentive to eat something that is not only good, but good for you.<br /><br />While I never liked jelly/jam/preserves as a dessert or in any sandwich, I do like using a jelly/jam/preserve glaze on meats.  I was delighted to find this.  It tastes really good as a glaze on chicken and your guests will want seconds. Mrs. Miller's Homemade Jelly is fresh and crisp as others on Amazon U.S. have noted.  I can't recommend this highly enough!

review/summary: EXCELLENT for Beet Cake (recipe on back!!) BUT OVERPRICED!
review/text: Good Ole NutriCity - They ALWAYS are WAY OVER market on their pricing, and then they add exorbitant shipping that always seems to cost as much, or more, than the item?? We have a so called (very pricey/spendy) "Gourmet Market" near our office and they price these exact beets at under three dollars - this NutriCity price works out to almost five dollars per jar - there it is. Buyer beware........  However, these Aunt Nellies Harvard Sweet & Sour beets are unusually gooooooood! So tasty right out of the jar, they are even better added to a salad, or rinsed and patted dry for a appetizer tray before dinner. BUT the BEST reason to buy these awesome BEETS is the HARVARD BEET CAKE recipe on the jar! It is the BEST spice cake you EVER tasted and gets a whole lotta veggies into your kids on the sly!! NO ONE, especially kids, will guess the secret ingredient that makes the cake disappear so FAST, so do NOT tell!! The cake is excellent with or without the optional walnuts and we like it both ways. Aunt Nellies Harvard Beets are recommended!

I was surprised to find out later on that this product lists high fructose corn syrup on the third in the ingredients list. If you don't care consuming HFCS, then disregard this feedback.

review/text: The beets themselves are great.  They're small/medium sized, sliced like one would slice an orange, and and firm and nice.  The syrup however is horrible.  It is thick and and not flavored in a good way.  While the first few beets in the sweet & slightly spicy syrup are OK, after the first few the syrup is unbearable.  I wish they'd dump the syrup and just put it in vinegar and maybe a tiny bit of spices.

review/text: I'm a huge fan of dark roasts, and my absolute favorite coffee is Starbucks' Gold Coast Blend; however, I recently took the difficult decision to switch to decaf for health reasons, and I had to give up my Gold Coast extra bold. I was stonewalled in my attempt to find a decaf that left no aftertaste and wasn't offensive to my finely tuned taste buds :o) I came across this on-line and took the decision to purchase it. I live in the Caribbean and there are no Starbucks stores in my country, so I bought three packs from Amazon, and prayed I wouldn't regret the purchase. At first, I was a little bit disappointed because this roast is not as dark as the extra bold I prefer. However, after a couple of days, I began to really enjoy this particular brew. I no longer dread my morning cup of decaf, because I have found one that truly satisfies my taste buds. I HIGHLY recommend this coffee for those switching from a dark roast to decaf.

I bought it at the grocery store because I thought it would be fun to find new ways to incorporate more fruit into my diet vs. buying junk food.  I couldn't believe how wonderful it tasted. Since then I've had trouble finding these packets because they're always sold out and now I think they may have even discontinued it at the Safeway where I buy them.  I love this stuff, so I'm very greatful for Amazon.com for carrying it.<br /><br />One caveat though, use at least 2 real lemons for the juice. I tried one with the juice I got in a bottle from the Realemon brand and it tasted flat. When I used real lemons it was like drinking pure heaven. This tastes much much better than any chocolate I've ever tasted in my entire life, plus I feel refreshed after I've tried it because of that lemony flavor.

review/text: Lundberg Jubilee is a blend of sweet brown rice, short and long grain brown rice and colorful red and black whole grain Wehani and Japonica rice varieties which are also very round and short-grained.  This product looks very pretty in the package and cooks up nicely.<br /><br />However, I bought this rice as a rice to eat with stir fry dishes and, in that capacity, I developed the opinion that this product doesn't have the amazingly appealing scent and texture that the Lundberg long grain rice has on its own.<br /><br />I will try cooking some rice salads with this Jubilee rice blend because, as some of the other reviews have pointed out, that's probably a good way to put this rice to its best use.<br /><br />From using this product, I have learned that for use as a side dish with chicken, stir-fry, etc. I think that long grain rice is a preferable choice.

I found the rice at a local store and one bag got me hooked! Now I order from Amazon to get a better price. As someone who though minute rice was the only rice this has been a wonderful surprise. Great flavor and texture! I did make a minor adjustment to the prep instructions. I use 1 3/4 cup of water to a cup of rice and bring water to a boil before adding the rice. Seems to work perfectly for my tastes.

review/text: I ordered this item as a staple food supply, and I must say it's really good tasting and takes little time to cook. The 6 - 16 oz units would last two people probably a month. A very good source of carbohydrates. mmm

review/summary: Healthy Option and Tastes Great
review/text: I was never much of a rice eater, until I discover Lundberg Jubilee Gourmet blend of Whole Grain Brown rice. I saw it on Amazon.com and took a chance and purchased some to try it. Now I can't live without it. No more plain old white rice for me. This stuff actually smells good while it is cooking. Kind of nutty earthy flavored, and has plenty of texture when you eat it. My favorite is to serve it with General Tso's Chicken. It's a great product, a little pricy, but in my opinion worth it. I have bought the six 1# packs about 3 or 4 times now on Amazon.com and will continue to do so.

review/summary: Some Good Rice
review/text: Mind you, I never venture much beyond basmati, but I've decided to add more brown rice to my diet and figured I should try Lundberg Jubilee.  This stuff is really great!  I cooked it in the rice cooker, adding a bit more water than called for on the package, just to be sure.  The house smelled so good while it was cooking, and it came out perfectly.  I ate two bowls right away and have plenty left over for the rest of the week.  I'm sold on this stuff.

review/summary: Yummy & easy
review/text: My family really loves this rice. With a little splash of soy sauce, I'd be happy eating this rice by itself!<br /><br />It's super easy in the microwave. We put one cup of this rice plus two and a half cups of water in a covered pyrex dish then nuke on high for five minutes, half power for 35 minutes -- fluff with a fork & serve. perfect. (YMMV depending on microwave power)

review/summary: Lundberg Jubilee Rice- whole grain brown rice
review/text: This rice is an excellent rice for those who want something special from rice.  Since it's whole grain it is more nutritious than common grocery store white rice.  It is a very tasty option from brown rice since it's seasoned.  It can substitute for bread and even meat in some meals and it is filling.  I mix curly chard that I have cooked in my slow cooker with the rice finely chopped and add a salad and have a meal.  (I cook the rice separately.)  I usually cook my chard with uncured apple flavored bacon so with the seasoning from the rice, it's quite tasty.  Add a salmon steak and you have a meal or eliminate the salmon and have the rice and salad alone.  It's very versatile.  I try to keep a pack of six in the cupboard.  I don't remember how I found out about this rice but I'm glad I did.  It's a change from the ordinary.<br />I would imagine that you could fry up some chicken livers with onions, chop them up fine and add this to the rice for a gourmet treat.  I plan to try that next.

review/text: In vain I have tried to introduce more brown rice into my diet and that of my family.  Until now.  We love this blend of brown rices!  It has a natural sweetness and flavor that is better than any white rice we have tried!  To cook it, I put it in my microwave (1 c. rice, 2 c. water) and press the rice button.  When it is done, I push the rice button again.  I ordered a pack of six and will soon need more.  It is that good.

review/summary: Wonderful Whole Grain Brown Rice
review/text: Purchasing Lundberg Jubilee, Gourmet Blend of Whole Grain Brown Rice, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6) was a great decision. This rice has a great nutty taste. The other benefit is that since it is whole grain it has a low glycemic index. The price is much better than I receive at the local grocers, when I can find this rice.<br />I love it and I highly recommend it. You may never go back to white rice!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G82L5I">Lundberg Jubilee, Gourmet Blend of Whole Grain Brown Rice, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a>
