review/text: I purchased two cases, because the description and price was right.  I'm not often motivated by "celebrity" endorsements or branding.  But THIS PRODUCT really hits the mark!!  True BOLD TASTE and causes me to always want a second cup.

review/summary: Delicious, great for the morning
review/text: I purchased these K-Cups for myself at our office based on the low price per cup. I didn't have very high expectations as these are roughly half the cost of most K-Cups. Despite not having much hope for this product to be any good, I am extremely happy with it! My coffee mug is extra large and I usually run each K-Cup twice, once on medium and once on small, to fill my mug. The flavor is strong and appealing, and the caffeine boost is welcoming. When I brew a cup, the aroma fills the office and my co-workers gravitate towards the machine to make their own coffee with their twice as expensive K-Cups.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product based on its value-to-cost ratio!

review/summary: Average cup 'o Joe.
review/text: I like a good strong cup of joe.  This is just a strong cup of average joe.  It is no Community coffee, no 8 o'clock coffee with the spoon standing straight up.  It is better than many other standard k cups.  But still I think there are better full bodied k cups out there.

review/summary: Excellent bold coffee, high price
review/text: I can purchase an 18 pack of these at Target for $11.99 (that's $0.61/cup) instead of the much-too-high $0.85 per cup price here. Beware Amazon Prime members....K cups aren't a good deal on Amazon, despite the free two day shipping.<br />The coffee itself is GREAT. I basically like a cup of mud, as bold as it gets. This is that, with a great burnt taste and wonderful aroma.<br />HIGHLY recommend the coffee, but get it at Target.

review/summary: A good strong , not bitter coffee
review/text: Though one k-cup arrived partially opened allowing the coffee grains to spill into the box.  But considering I got this for only $24 on sale, no big deal.  If you like a nice strong French roast style, this coffee is for you.  No bitterness at all.  This brew is smooth and full bodied, even on the larger cup choice of my Keurig.  Most coffees I have to brew on the smaller cup choice.  Wish this came in decaf, but until then I can only have one cup in the morning as I am very sensitive to caffeine.

review/text: This flavor coffee is the only one I can find that is strong enough to handle the large mug size without getting weak.  It took forever to be shipped, though.  Waiting a full weekf or your coffee is not convenient.  The purpose of ordering it online is to avoid a trip to the store and it took so long to arrive I couldn't wait.  I ordered it before and it arrived within 3 days without shipping charge.  Very disappointed about that.

review/text: Emeril! I've never really seen him on TV  since I don't watch food stuff generally but I kinda know his catch phrases for some reason. I know celebrity products are just celebrities tasting products and deciding to put their name on them. After my last bad bought K-cups which were 3 dollars cheaper but ended up being instant coffee (Grove Square), I'll give this 5 stars for being real coffee with real flavor and nice strength to it! Cheers Emeril!!<br /><br />Bought this are Target for a few cents less than 12 dollars. It was an 18 pack. Not a bad deal with 18 REAL cups of coffee and not watered down stuff.

review/text: I didn't care for this blend because for a extra bold, it had a weak taste.  Its hard to explain but a bold and extra bold has a dark, rich taste to it, and this blend was disappointing.  I was just missing that bold flavor.  It tasted like McDonald's coffee that has been sitting for an hour.  The smell was also weak.

review/text: We received just one K-Cup sample when we purchased our Keurig, and I remember it wasn't bad.  While I prefer Tully's coffee - we decided to give these a chance.  I was very pleased - the coffee is smooth, but still has that strong rich flavor I love.  I have not had issues like some of the other reviewers with the actual Cup itself.<br /><br />I would give 5 Stars - but Costco has Tully's French Roast K-Cups in bulk as well as Tully's Kona Blend - and I do prefer those when the price is right.  I mean - I like my coffee - but I love a deal more.

Honestly I don't think he even tasted this coffee much less called it Bold.  Its not bold, its got a bad after taste, its weak even on the smallest cup setting.  If you like weak coffee, and I mean weak, this is for you.  In all honestly the Folgers K-cup is much better. So far this is the 2nd worst I have tried.  Not bold, how about "Emerils Big Sissy Coffee"!

review/text: I like bold but not bitter coffee. And since I add a generous amount of cream and sweenter this coffee works well for me. Yes, it is much too strong if I try to drink it black.  Actually, I "double-brew" it and it comes out perfect. I run the K-cup through on the "medium" setting and then run the same K-cup through again on the "small" setting and it comes out perfect. Perhaps that doesn't make me a true "bold" coffee drinker, but I love the flavor that results. I would recommend people try the "double-brewing" method if you find that some of the K-cups are too strong for you.  You get more coffee with  just one K-cup.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee
review/text: My wife just gave me a Cuisinart K-cup coffee maker for Christmas, and I was very happy until I tried the so called "extra bold" k-cups that came with the machine.  It tasted much too weak.  We bought some decaf for her at the store, and it was worse.  As much as I liked the concept of the machine and the ease of brewing coffee, I was prepared to return it.  We went to the store today and I saw Emril's Big Easy Dark Roast K-Cup and decided to give it a try.  To give it a fair shot, I was going to set it on 8 ounces as I had the other coffees, but I forgot to put the maker on that setting, and it was at 10 ounces.  What resulted was a great cup of nice and strong coffee.  If this is not strong enough for you, you must be drinking "battery acid" coffee like some people I know do.

Since my savings price became as high as the non saving price of other very good coffees I canceled my order. In this case I think the higher price is for the name more than anything else.

review/summary: Great coffee but...
review/text: Excellent dark/strong coffee.  Seems like I'm like a lot of the other reviewers here who are fans of this one.  Others that I like are Coffee People Jet Fuel, Van Houtte Extra Bold Dark, Coffee People Extra Bold French and Black Tiger, but this one is my standard.<br /><br />I have this on subscribe and save for every other month which was a great deal, but I was running low and was going to ship my next shipment early and saw the price jumped to $28.80.  Even with the 15% S&S discount, you're at $24, which is $0.50 a cup.  Hope this is just a temporary price bump.  The Emeril's decaf is still at $23 before S&S.  Might have to switch to the 50 pack Jet Fuel in frustration free packaging ($18 after S&S).

review/summary: Replaced my home-brewed Dunkin
review/text: I loved my daily brewed pot of Dunkin Donuts Original Blend coffee and was skeptical about the Keurig system. In July, I had my first Keurig cup at my daughter's home in Virginia and was pleasantly surprised. Quick, convenient, and most important, consistent with every cup. She had several varieties to try and I'm ashamed to admit I burned through most of those in short order. As the k-cups dwindled, we looked online for other varieties, but discovered Newman's Own Extra Bold was available at BJ's. I bought that to replace her stock and was very happy with it. I liked the Keurig system enough to order one myself and in late August came home to set it up. I ordered Newman's, two Green Mountain varieties and a bold sampler box to try other coffees. I thought Newman's was going to be my go-to morning cup, but was quite surprised by Emeril's Big Easy Bold and how much it tasted like my brewed pot of Dunkin. Just today, I ordered on the Subscribe and Save offer from Amazon and I am happily set up with my morning brew.<br /><br />Further observations from reading all of the previous reviews here:<br /><br />I did try using Dunkin in the My K-Cup filter that Keurig sells. It did not taste like my Dunkin coffee. I think that the brewed Dunkin derives some of the body from sediments you get from brewing by the pot.<br /><br />I agree that this is better than Starbucks because I've never had a Starbucks coffee that didn't taste burnt. If you're looking for a Starbucks match, IMO, this isn't the coffee you're looking for.<br /><br />I specifically wanted to address Dunkin coffee because I love it and it wasn't mentioned in any of the reviews. I mistakenly thought that Donut Shop and Donut House would be similar to Dunkin, but was sorely disappointed to find out they were not.

review/text: This is the only k-cup I have found so far that can fill a travel mug with ok coffee.  Of course, no travel mug will fit under the platinum model, so I use a pyrex measuring cup, hit the LARGEST water selection and BAM!  It's not great, but good enough to save me a time-consuming and expensive stop at Starbucks every morning, and that's why wifey gave me the machine for C-mas. (I figure about 6 months should be the break-even mark)

review/text: We just recently got our Keurig brewer and have been expeerimenting with different coffees.  My husband wanted to try something a little stronger, so I ordered the Emeril's Big Easy Bold.  It was a little too bold for his taste, but he said it was a good-tasting coffee.  For those who like a stronger tasting coffee, it is probably a good one.

review/text: Others may love this k cup but I found it way too bitter.  I have to admit I don't drink that much bold coffee but have had a chance to try a few others and don't care for this one.  My Keurig only has the 8oz capacity and I took a cue from other users and run the bold k cups through twice to make 12 to 16 ounces depending on the type coffee.  Well even if I run this through twice at a total of 16 oz it is still too bitter... just not my k cup of coffee I guess but I do like Donut Shop and Newman's Own Extra Bold.

review/summary: Perfect if you only want one strong cup
review/text: I use one k-cup to make 8 oz of coffee and it's just the right amount and strength for one little pod of creamer.  The men in my family prefer milder coffees but I like it strong (I'm the grandmother).<br /><br />I'm adding this note months later with a different perspective.  Having tried almost every k-cup made, I judge this coffee as the most harsh.  Although I still prefer strong coffee to weak, I'd recommend this one only to people who like Army coffee.  For a good strong cup of coffee, I recommend either Timothy's Rainforest Expresso or the Obama coffee.

However, after my excitement while tearing open the box, I felt like the "BAM!" was the blow of disappointment as I smelled the coffee brewing.  To my dismay, the taste of the coffee was totally bland, and not really distinct in any way.  This box turned me off to buying any of Emeril's coffee products.  I'll stick with my utterly perfect, always there for me Dark Magic, thank you very much.<br /><br />Don't worry Emeril, I'll still be buying the next edition of your cookbook.  I'll just skip over any of the liquid sections.

review/summary: Emeril Doesn't Know Beans
review/text: If coffee is not a dark roast I pass it by.  There was a sale on Emeril's plus I had a 30% off coupon [should have known better].  While I was not expecting a French or an Italian level of dark roast, I was anticipating a decent cup of coffee.  "Big Easy" is a misnomer for "Big Zero."  When I add a tablespoon of half&half and the color of the coffee goes to tan, that's telling about the darkness therein.  That's what happened here.  Then I went on to the taste:  this stuff is weak with a bitter undertone; and then, oddly, it tastes, as the first sip goes down, as though water was added.  I use the 5 ounce side of my Keurig.  Can only imagine that the large cup would be right up there with dishwater.  I will slug down the remaining 17 kcups, but will never purchase again.

review/text: Best K-cup coffee I've found so far. (Also applies to Emeril's Decaf - best decaf I've tried) All OTHER brands and blends have been way too weak, or weak with an over-roasted taste. I use the 3.7 oz setting on my Keuring machine - anything more than that dilutes the finished product resulting in a watered down cuppa. (I'm not 100% satisfied with the Keurig system in general, but it IS convenient.) Thank you, Amazon for carrying both Emeril's coffees and delivering them to my door. Easy!

review/summary: I have 6 favorites, this is one of them
review/text: This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.<br /><br />Regarding coffee, I like strong and smooth.  I don't like French roast as I find it too harsh, but I do like Italian roast.  Kona is great and I like Hazelnut, Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.<br />I drink my coffee with probably too much (at least 2-3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee) of evaporated milk in it or plain non-dairy creamer. No sugar.<br /><br />That being said...my favorite coffees are:<br /><br />Green Mountain Hazelnut Dark Roast Extra Bold<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee<br />Newman's Own Extra Bold<br />Tully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra Bold<br />Folger's Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti<br /><br />and a special mention for<br />Timothy's World Coffee German Chocolate Cake - It has an almost coco-nutty taste to it. Not the deep chocolate taste I was looking for, but the best I have found so far. Please if you can suggest a Dark Chocolate Flavor coffee to me; do so.<br /><br />Also since I have posted a review about a Senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to Keurig a bit about why... if you're interested..which why I put it last.  Feel free to ignore it.<br /><br />We decided to get a Keurig coffee maker after enjoying the Senseo system for over 3 years.<br />Please note, since we got the Senseo system essentially free, not much thought was put into it's purchase. However it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems.<br /><br />We switched to the Keurig system from the Senseo for several reasons.<br /><br />1. Local availability of coffee. For some reason the Senseo system was waning here at the Rochester NY grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee?  Yes, you can buy online, but sometimes when your planning isn't the best, you might run out. What coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences.<br /><br />2. Online purchases of Senseo coffees  were either for 4 bags of 16-18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees. Invariably there was a few you didn't like.  I never saw small quantities of 5 or so.<br /><br />3. The Senseo "duck" for filling  with your own coffee never worked for us.  I'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector. We literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could. Maybe we had a faulty unit, but based on reviews here, we were in good company. I knew many that had luck with the Keurig system however and we did as well.<br /><br />4. Once you open a bag of Senseo pods, they are starting to go stale, by virtue of being open to air. The Keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors "open" at once. Yes for those of you that are "green" there is more plastic waste. However I'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee.

review/text: I, too, think the 25% price increase for Big Easy Bold is out of line.  But I disagree that the increase in the commodity price of coffee can justify it.  The overall amount of coffee in k-cups is not large enough to have driven such a big increase.  My other favorite k-cups are going up "only" 16%.  I don't get it, and I'm not buying it... even though I enjoy the product.  I, too, cancelled my order.  So 1 star for the sticker shock!

review/summary: What happened to Emeril's?
review/text: I have to agree with Dr. Pete's review below.  Up until this batch, Emeril's Big Easy was by far my favorite coffee.  To give you an idea of what my taste runs to, I also drink Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast along with an occasional Van Houtte's Honduran.  However, Emeril's was my standard cup.  But this latest bunch is nearly tasteless and watery!  It used to have a great aroma, full body, and was easily drinkable.  The only reason I didn't score it lower was because it is still not bitter or has a bad after taste.<br /><br />I am not sure what to do now.  I just put this on auto renew when I got this batch. I'm kinda' scared to keep on getting it, if it is going to stay this way. I might just cancel it and drink more Black Tiger (the most similar IMHO).  Too bad; I have frequently seen coffee quality from the same brand change in my life- and not only in the k-cups.<br /><br />Update: I tried using this on my 7.5oz instead of 9.5oz setting, and it is somewhat better.  However, it is still not nearly as flavorful as it usually was on 9.5oz.  I am really puzzled why more people have not experienced this; maybe my taste buds are growing Old? ;o)  However, my other coffees still taste the same.

review/text: This was my first time trying this brew of Kcup. It is ok, but the flavor is a bit acidic. I like a bold brew, even though I do add cream and Equal. When using this Kcup, I found I used at least one extra sweetener packet and twice the half & half. Friends of mine have enjoyed this flavor, however.<br /><br />I'd like to find a brand of kcup that is similar to Newman's Own, extra bold.  I have found this brand on Amazon, but it is through outside sellers, so not eligible for subscribe & save. The price through these vendors is also nearly twice the price of most of the kcups offered on amazon. So, for now, I will keep trying different varieties of kcups and trudge to Walmart to buy boxes of Newman's Own Bold 18 kcups for $10. If I see them on Amazon, I'll probably order several boxes.

So, all the coffee lovers, , this is for you! Medium guys and gals, not so much. Interestingly, I do not disagree with the positive reviews -- this is a really strong coffee! Emirils coffee, as one reviewer said! Or, a slap in the face, as another one said! This is just too strong for me. I thought I liked strong coffee until I tasted this one.

review/summary: Bold Isn't Always Better
review/text: Emeril's "Big Easy Bold - Big Easy Intense" Gourmet Coffee is anything BUT easy.  This thick, pitch black coffee mounts an EXTEMELY rich attack on one's palette quickly followed by a bitter, gagging, complex finish of earthy flavors.  This stuff tastes like that tar-sludge coffee in Monsters, Inc. looks!  Beyond the shock and awe of the cutting, intense attack on one's senses, the coffee blends an unpleasant mix of flavors that may induce nausea.  Unless you can drop shots of 100-proof vodka as if they were Jello shots, this is NOT your coffee.

review/summary: Love the coffee but not the new higher Amazon prices
review/text: Love this coffee. However, now that Amazon has substantially raised, by 25-30% the prices across the board and subscribe and save has been removed I have found, at least temporarily, a cheaper place to buy. If you have a Bed Bath and Beyond near and get the 20% off coupons you can buy three 18 box cartons and save about $5. Cost me with tax about $25 and I got 6 extra cups vs the 48 box offered here. Just a suggestion. There may be other places as well.<br /><br />I do enjoy buying from Amazon and hope, maybe after the holidays? that the prices will become competitive again.

review/summary: Only Strong Cup Out There
review/text: I tried about 20 different cups before settling on this surprise contender. I hated to buy a celebrity-endorsed product but this was the only one that didn't taste watered down. I was testing the other cups at 7.5 oz of H2O but with Emeril's I can run it at 9.5 oz and be happy. True, it has more body than flavor, but unlike Emeril himself (or me a 45 year old tech ops loser), this coffee has a REALLY nice body. If you're looking for thick and rich, this is it. I've tried other Timothy's coffees (Emeril doesn't roast/grind "his" own, of course), and have found them sub par. I may rethink the Timothy's line now. There is a French Roast offering from Emeril/Timothy's now. I just ordered a box. Hope it's as good as the Big Easy.

review/summary: Maybe too bold...
review/text: We've tried many K-cup flavors in our house and this one quickly became the one you had to drink when we were out of everything else.  Finished the last one this morning and can safely say we'll stick with other tried and true flavors (like Tully's Kona Blend, Caribou or Gloria Jean's Cappucino).  Definite bitter taste and aftertaste, takes a ton of flavored creamer to make it palatable.  My wife went as far as to describe the flavor as what burnt tires would taste like.  Wish I'd read the other review about one k-cup being good for 2 cups of coffee--might have meant less creamer!

review/summary: Tried to like it...
review/text: Not one person in my household who has tried this, has enjoyed it.  I bought some of this for my dad and i thought he would love this because he likes a really bold cup of coffee but he hated it.  I have to had it to him though... he tried to like it for my sake.  He tried it several times before he was honest and said he truly hated it.  My mother, who likes her coffee on the weak side tried to water it down but she said she almost spit it back out into the sink when she took the first sip (wish i had been there to see it).<br /><br />I tried it knowing it wasn't really my type because my dad honestly didn't like it and that made me curious.  Also i tend to believe with the appropriate amount of milk and sugar any coffee can be decent right?  Well i didn't finish the cup even after the extensive doctoring i did.  It was burnt tasting and very bitter.  I'm very surprised there are so many good reviews for this one.  The only use i could think of for it is if you are on a long drive down the highway at night... it would be good to keep you awake.  Not only will the caffeine help but the terrible taste in your mouth.

review/summary: Bold? Not!
review/text: I bought Emeril's K-cups based on the reviews here. I love strong, bold coffee but Emeril's goes way over the top. There is a difference between bold and bitter and this coffee is just plain bitter and it is one of the worst coffees I have ever had. I got a Keurig B60 after my coffee maker broke and saw a Keurig in one of the lounges at work. I was taken in by its convenience and bought one and am the sorriest person I ever did. I have sampled all the Keurig K-cups and cannot find one to my liking. They are either too weak and watery no matter what size cup you make or just plain bitter which leaves an aftertaste. In addition,if you like stronger coffee, you need to make the smallest size cup, 5.5 oz. which in this day and age is ridiculous; people drink out of large mugs and you can drink that 5.5 oz in 3 or 4 gulps! I am getting rid of the darn thing and going back to brewing my own. There is a reason that the majority of the nation's premium coffee roasters have NOT jumped on the Keurig bandwagon. It does not make an excellent cup of joe.

review/text: This Extra Bold, Dark Roast K-Cup is great for those who like the convenience of using a K-Cup, but prefer a richer, more bold flavor to coffee. If you're like me, and tend to find most K-Cup coffee weak and reminiscent of vending machine coffee, you might like this. Its flavor and strength do not seem to require using only the smallest cup size, but seem good to the medium mug size. It is similar to Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond, Tully's French Roast, and Black Tiger (among a few others).
