The only reason I marked it down is because it brewed like it was very fresh and tasted great like I am used to, but I was a little bit off-put when I first opened it because I couldn't hardly smell the coffee - usually indicative of it not being as fresh.  Still, would buy again and recommend to others!

review/summary: Tastes like a wet ashtray
review/text: I'm not even trying to be funny, that is honestly the most accurate way I can describe the taste.  I am interested in detoxing and I did spend the money to buy this so I am choking my way through the box rather than throwing it away, although part of me wants to do that.  Through repetition I have sort of gotten to a point that it is at least tolerable to consume, but I don't look forward to drinking it and will not purchase it again.  Unfortunately many detox teas taste really bad because of the herbs used I guess, but some do taste better - for example the Yogi Tea Peach Detox was what I was using before so I will definately be running back to that. It makes me wonder though - are the better tasting ones less effective?  I guess that's why I gave it two stars and why I am choking my way through it.  Because if it tastes this bad, it must be working - right?  I sure hope so.  But with something like "detoxification" it's really hard to tell whether anything is really doing it and to what degree.  It's not really measurable.

review/summary: I like this product
review/text: I recently bought a box of the Lemon Every Day Detox with Burdock Root at a local store (for $4.99) to detox my liver from past medications (per the advise of my nutritionist). I was surprised that it taste as smooth as it did (considering some of the herbs that are in it that I usually don't like). I was very happy it was not real lemony tasting (I don't like lemon or lime to take over the taste of any beverage I drink and especially in teas served hot). Unlike the other reviewer, I didn't think it tasted like dirt, at all. I was raised on tea (black tea) and so I  enjoy the taste of most teas. My husband was not raised on tea and he doesn't like the taste of most teas (so I know taste differs from person to person).<br /><br />You only get 16 tea bags in one box and the recommended dosage is 2 bags in one cup twice a day. Use as recommended, and you have 4 days worth of detox in one box. That may be good for a quick detox but I plan to detox for 30-60 days so the pack of 6 boxes ($22)is the best bargain for me (which is why I am shopping on Amazon).

review/summary: Smoked Salmon - Foil Sealed
review/text: All the men in my family give me positive feedback on this smoked salmon as a gift.  For years, gifts would be sent and not much said until I began to send this Naturally Wild Smoked Salmon.  Now they all make a point to tell me how much they appreciate it.  I am fortunate enough to live in a area where I can find it in the stores, so keep a supply handy.  It does not need refrigeration until the foil packet has been opened, but once opened, does not stay on the plate long until eaten.  The only other smoked salmon I like as much is from Fresh Foods at Pike Place Market in Seattle, but it has to be constantly refrigerated, and when shipped, you have to make sure someone is home to take delivery.  The Naturally Wild Smoked Salmon costs less, can sit in the mailbox, and can store in the cabinet until you're ready to eat it.

My problem is the graham crackers did not come in the manufacturer's box. All were loose within box shipped in thus way too many of the crackers were broken. If you were to use the crackers for a graham cracker crust, you wouldn't mind. However, these are now too messy to give the kids as a stand alone snack and not usable for smores. Very disappointed. A little TLC and all would be fine. Last note, I tried desparately to find a link to complain but came up empty handed. Seems all I can do is return them, paying shipping. Ugh!

review/summary: Clean ingredient list and it tastes pretty good!
review/text: I just made this icing to on a Dr Oetker organic chocolate cake.  It really made the cake taste a lot better.<br /><br />I usually think of "icing" as a thin frosting, but I think this mix could be either.  Following the instructions, I ended up with what I would consider "frosting" but I think if you were to add more milk (or water) you could have a thinner "icing".<br /><br />The instructions call for either water or milk, and I used milk.  (The other required ingredient is butter.)  The icing is very sweet, and you can taste the butter.  Overall, I think it is pretty good.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know that I will buy Dr Oetker cake and icing again, because the cake was not very impressive, and if I'm going to go to the trouble of pulling out my mixer to blend milk and butter with powder to make icing, is it really saving me any time to not have to measure powdered sugar and cocoa?  (Not really.)  The point of buying a premade icing is for convenience, and when you have to mix it yourself anyway, it isn't very convenient.  Of course, it cannot have the milk and butter already added, or it would have to have a whole lot of fake ingredients and chemicals that we're all trying to avoid.  So that wouldn't work either.<br /><br />I would recommend this icing mix if:<br />1. You want an organic cake while you're on vacation and you don't want to (or cannot) find organic ingredients in larger packages, because you only plan to use them for one cake.<br />2. You're giving a cake and icing to someone, and the fact that it is packaged and "ready to make" matters.<br />3. You're curious to find out what this particular product tastes like.<br /><br />Otherwise, just use a recipe and mix up your own!  I've made frosting/icing before and it's very easy.  You just mix confectioners (powdered) sugar, butter, and milk.  Plus cocoa if you want it to be chocolate icing.

review/text: This does not taste artificial. It's delicious! Better tasting than most actual pulpy peaches these days. You'd have to have the tastebuds of a Macho Montana Iguana to not enjoy savoring this tea. I know whereof I speak, having entertained an Irascible Iguana who only deigned to eat raw elk-burger. Then he'd run around and try to bite the cat's tail. He grew large and monstrous on elk-burger, but would never eat a peach, or any other foodstuff he was supposed to like, aside from meat.<br /><br />So, go for it. Be an Uniguana and drink your serene peach tea sweetened with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6JPQQ">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Granular, Individual Packets, 700-Count Box</a>.

Fortunately, I can have peach tea all year.<br /><br />And not only is peach my favorite flavor of tea, but there are certain things (and certain flavors) that just go together.  For example, cornbread and iced tea; fresh-cooked tomatoes and pasta; Italian bread sticks and homemade minestrone soup; and tea and peach.  The tea flavor and the peach flavor blend together perfectly for that heavenly taste.

review/text: I really like the flavor of this nice, peachy tea.  It tastes great hot or cold.  My husband drinks his with sugar, and i sweeten mine with liquid stevia.  This is a great summertime tea, with its nice, light peachy herbal flavor.  The tea is sometimes a little weak flavored, or perhaps I just wish it was stronger because I enjoy it so much!

review/text: This is a great herbal peach tea--most "peach" teas are peach-flavored black teas (Bigelow makes an herbal peach, but it's not as good).  I've only ever seen it in the Celestial Seasonings sampler packs, and I always go through the peach flavor first and unenthusiastically drink the other flavors.  I'm really happy to find a source for JUST the peach flavor, at a great price.

review/summary: If too strong- can be mixed with other flavor
review/text: As much as I like peach tea, I found the flavor of this to be a bit intense by itself.  To make a gallon pitcher of perfect ice tea - I will steep 4 bags of this peach tea with 10 bags of the celestial seasonings decaf green tea (on the box it says it also has white tea for smooth flavor).<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LB0">Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, Decaf, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br />Then, after removing the steeped tea bags, I add 1 1/2 cups of sugar to the hot tea and mix well until sugar is fully dissolved.<br />Tip:  It is easier to just boil 1/3 of the pitcher, steep the tea and mix the sugar in that hot tea, and then add this to the other 2/3 of the pitcher when done.  It's less water to boil and therefor faster.<br /><br />Pour some of this freshly made stuff into a big glass of ice cubes and you will experience a blissful tea which tastes similar to McAlister's Deli sweet tea.  They charge $5 a gallon for theirs, you can make a gallon of even better tasting tea for just over $1 with these tea bags bought off amazon.

review/text: My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!

review/summary: excellent stuff without the sour stomach blues
review/text: This is the third large batch of this stuff I've ordered.  It comes in a very convenient package that supplies enough for a bottle of water.  It's great on the job and in summer heat especially for replenishing what you sweat out working. Each little packet is a plastic foil pack that you can put in your pocket without getting it soaked as you work.  I find it does not create the stomach upset I often get with other "sports drinks" when consumed in large quantities. I've tried both the orange and mixed berry and like the flavor of both.  No chemical or acidic after taste.<br /><br />My only gripe is that you never know exactly what your ordering from the blasted descriptions they provide - not an uncommon problem on Amazon.  This case of 20 is actually 20 boxes of 10 individual packets.  When I first read it, I thought it was ridiculously expensive to get 20 little packets at this price.  It's actually 200 packets....and well worth it.

review/summary: The best disposable, single-use coffee filter
review/text: In my opinion, the best way to make a cup (or more cups, using a larger filter), is to use a first-class paper filter inserted into a reusable filter cone and throw away the filter and the coffee grounds after it is used. Melitta makes the best single-use paper filters. I regularly use the #4 filter made of Natural Brown paper, with a ceramic #4 filter cone. This pack of 600 of these filters (in 6 boxes) was by far the best buy of these name brand filters that I could find. Kudos to Amazon for providing these in the smallest possible package!

review/summary: Help! I'm up to my eyeballs in coffee filters!
review/text: My old Braun coffee maker requires these peculiar cone-shaped filters--basket style filters usually don't work as they have a tendency to fold over on themselves during the brewing process.  Trouble is, alls I can ever find at the local supermarket place are overpriced little 40-count boxes.  That means I've gotta pick up a new box every month!  Now, thanks to the good folks at Amazon, I won't need to buy coffee filters for nearly two years!  Order now, and in a just a few days you'll be treated to a 13-inch-high stack of six boxes, each containing a generous supply of 100 super premium, natural brown, number 4 filters with flavor enhancing micro-perforations!  That makes a grand total of...let's see.....600 filters!  Just so ya know, number 4 filters will fit an 8-12 cup cone coffee maker; number 2 filters fit 2-6 cup cone coffee makers; and number 6 filters fit 10 cup non-electric coffee makers.  So, if you own a cone style coffee maker, pick your size and request your big crate-O-filters today.  Then you can cross coffee filters off your grocery list for a good long while.  (I just hope my coffee maker doesn't break within the next year and a half...)

review/summary: "generic" not equal to brand name for coffee filters
review/text: I have been using "generic" Homelife #4 unbleached coffee filters in my Mellita coffee maker at 2/3 the cost of the Mellita filters.  When I make a full pot, the water may overflow the top of the filter.  The grounds can run down the outside and clog the opening, then water and grounds end up all over my kitchen counter.  Yuck.  With these Mellita brand filters the flow through is a bit faster; no overflow.  As 4 minutes is about the best amount of time for water to be go through the grounds, the faster flow through these filters with "microperforations" would be expected to give better tasting, less bitter coffee as well (though I am not enough of a connoisseur to say).  While in general I think buying brand is a waste of money, in this case seems worth the extra cost.  Price is great, as usual, on Amazon.  Almost as cheap as the generic filters at my grocery store.

Assuming you are using a quality coffee maker - fresh quality coffee - fresh cold water - then you must know that a quality coffee filter is of the utmost importance.<br /><br />People tend to overlook this little item but let me tell you - the coffee filter is as vital to the taste of the coffee as the quality of coffee you use.  You might think - yeah right!  Well, I sugggest you try a quality filter like Melitta and taste for yourself - if not, then you might as well use a rag as your coffee filter.<br /><br />Enjoy your coffee the way it should be enjoyed - Good day!

review/summary: Solid Performance!
review/text: Bought quite a number of these. I had not realized that by buying in bulk I would end up with 600 filters at my disposal. I do not like the fact that they will last at least 2 years or more. I do not like to think that far ahead where coffee filters are concerned. Specially since now I will have to make sure that whatever Coffee Maker we use it will require to have number 4 cone filters or else find out which of my neighbors use the same size and surprise them with an unexpected gift, for we are not at all close. That aside, they do the job really well. Fit just fine and it looks like the brewing season will go uninterruptedly for quite some time. I have to slow down, between Costco and Amazon all this buying on bulk is getting to me. I probably could have went to a local place and purchase one or two of these Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, perhaps in white or like I just did, in brown. Now that the deed is done, with no more anxieties on my part regarding enough coffee filters I give Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 4, 100 count (Pack of 6) a solid 4 Stars.

review/text: My order was messed up = I ordered 3 rye and got 1 rye and 2 other kind.  I wrote to seller, explained problem and asked for overnight shippment so we could cook my grandma's favorite cereal for her big day with the family sharing all of grandma's favorite foods from her lifetime (Age 95)  The product did not arrive by the event planned, however, it was shipped and received the next day with the correct contents. When I called to returned unordered items, I was told to keep them and enjoy.  The seller really tried their best I believe to correct the order in time for my needs, however, it fell one day short.  Overall, grandma got to eat her Rye cereal (we did not get too except for a spoon full), and I will give the seller a 5 star, because accidents do happen and I truly do not believe the error was intentional.

review/summary: Engage your inner Jean-Luc
review/text: Star Trek: The Next Generation's Jean-Luc Picard is a private man, but one thing fans know about this French Starfleet captain with a British accent is his love for Earl Grey Tea. It would be especially cool if we had our own replicator that would spit this out perfect, as-is without having to fudge with a bag, a string and a packet of sugar, but such is life in the early 21st century.<br /><br />Earl Grey is a smooth tea, it doesn't have the dry, almost bitter flavor of "regular" hot teas. Not too flavorful, but just a smooth herbal, yet mild flavor. Smooth, classy and the choice tea of the captain of the Starship Enterprise.

review/summary: Heavenly Honey
review/text: Skippy Honey Nut Peanut Butter Crunchy / B001E4S88W<br /><br />I saw this peanut butter on Amazon and couldn't wait to try it - the combination of honey and peanut butter makes my mouth water. I didn't want to order bulk without tasting it first, so I finally found it locally - but more expensive, of course. I was not disappointed - the peanut butter is absolutely wonderful, with hints of sweet honey throughout, but never cloying or unpleasant. This is the perfect peanut butter for a sandwich, and I usually take one to work with me at least once a week. There's no trans fat, although (of course) there is about 16 grams of fat per serving (2 Tbsp.), which is pretty standard for peanut butters.<br /><br />Having tried it, and loved it, I won't go back to other, non-honey peanut butters. Amazon offers a much better deal on bulk and peanut butter is about as non-perishable as food can get. The last order I received was in September, with a "best if used by" date of the next July, which is plenty of time to finish off the last bottle.<br /><br />This product contains peanuts, honey, sugar, molasses, hydrogenated vegetable oil (cottonseed and soybean), and salt, in case you might be allergic.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/text: So it's a given that Skippy makes the best peanut butter. Their regular Super Chunk set the bar. But the addition of honey makes this the best pb I've ever tasted.<br /><br />So why did grocery stores throughout Illinois stop carrying it? I have no idea. I've checked multiple stores and ended up buying it through Amazon. It's a little strange to buy peanut butter this way, but it's worth it since it's the only way I can get it.

review/summary: Not as good as anticipated!
review/text: I am a peanut butter lover.  I am the type of person who dips the spoon in, and just eats it straightaway - no bread or any other food additive required.  I go through six jars of peanut butter in the space of a month.<br /><br />With this in mind, I was estatic when I found that Amazon offered six jars of Skippy Roasted Honey Nut SuperChunk at an EXCEPTIONAL price.  When I received the shipment and gave it the all-important taste-test, however, my excitement about my remaining jars was noticably dampened.<br /><br />Skippy Roasted Honey Nut Super Chunk isn't bad by any means, but I don't really notice a huge difference in it and any other peanut butter.  Instead of a hit of sweet flavor on top of the crunchy peanut butter, I found that the honey taste isn't dominant at all -- in fact, it's barely distinguishable from the regular peanut taste one would expect out of any other peanut butter.<br /><br />I'll finish this set of peanut butter with no problem -- but I won't be ordering this particular peanut butter again -- it's just not as special as I expected it to be.

review/summary: Other Peanut Butters Must Quake When This Is Stocked At The Store!
review/text: I recently moved to Texas and searched in vain for Skippy Roasted Honey Nut Super Chunk peanut butter. I found it impossible to believe that, by the unfortunate circumstance of geography, I would not get to enjoy what could be the best peanut butter ever made again.<br /><br />But then, like a flash of inspiration, I checked Amazon and LO AND BEHOLD, one can purchase it by the case! Mirable Dictu!!! What's even better, one can set up delivery so it's delivered at a set schedule. My wife thinks I'm weird for ordering peanut butter online; I told her at least I'm not ordering <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032G1S0">Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz</a>!<br /><br />To be honest, ordering food from Amazon does make me feel a little bit like a hermit... but then when I make myself a sandwich with this peanut butter of the gods, it's SOOOO worth it! It's a good thing that the grocery stores down here don't carry it, other wise they'd never be able to sell the other peanut butter brands!

I can't say that I really noticed a different flavor to this "Honey Roasted" brand, but then again I only eat it with bread and syrup.  I think it is a good value for the price.  And it must taste pretty great because my husband devours it, even though he prefers creamy!

review/text: After eating the Roasted Honey Nut peanuts and nuts for the past couple years I thought I would give Skippy Peanut Butter, Roasted Honey Nut Super Chunk a try. All I can say is that I have been missing a great tasting chunky peanut butter during this time period. It not only has a great taste but also this chunky peanut butter spreads easily for the size and quanity of the peanut chunks in the peanut butter. Now I will have to order the Skippy Peanut Butter Roasted Honey Nut Creamy Style for the family members who prefer the creamy style over the chunky style. Naturally I will have to give it a taste test too!!
