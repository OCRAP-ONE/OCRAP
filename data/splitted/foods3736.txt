review/summary: Why bother?
review/text: I feel that this is a rip-off.  It has 1/3 of the coffee of the drinkable brands, and lacks taste and character, such as is possible with other decafs.  It makes me want to return an otherwise good coffee maker.  If I were Tassimo I would not license this product unless they gave it a full-size portion of coffee.  I agree with other reviewers that this is like drinking diluted coffee.  I wish Starbucks or another maker would weigh in on decafs for Tassimo.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: In the great trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it. Best of all, you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and Ovaltine you add.

review/summary: Captain Midnight, you lied to me!
review/text: I can still remember Captain Midnight sitting there in the uniform of an astronaut of the 50's (khaki shirt and black four-in-hand tie) telling me solemnly that I should drink my Ovaltine because it tasted good and it was good for me. It was, after all, brown and that meant it had to be chocolate, my favorite flavor.<br /><br />What the Uranus traveler never told me was that they were crystals that would sit at the top of the warm milk and never dissolve. Furious stirring with a metal tool called a spoon didn't do it, nor did trying to grind them up against the side of the cup.  Even using a tenderizer tool didn't work as I soon discovered that as you pushed it down the cup, the warm milk came up and out. You had to compromise by trying to round up the little critters on the spoon and that offered little comfort as the crunchy buggers didn't taste all that great anyway. To top it off, all you had left was warm milk.<br /><br />The jar of Ovaltine was also very resilient. It lasted a long time in our home. It was the same one. Even my father who liked the "old standbys" of Shredded Wheat and Corn Flakes we never ate, didn't go near this stuff.<br /><br />I only recommend this for those who have lost their taste buds through constant sword swallowing or that fire breathing trick.<br /><br />Captain Midnight, you lied to me!

Much less sodium, lasts 10 times as long in the fridge and the flavor is more akin to a home made stock from reducing beef bones then the flavorless bouillions or stocks. It is great to add to a pot roast or chili or as that extra flavor to a quick beef stew. Absolutely love, I buy this over and over again. Wish I could get this locally!

review/text: I give these to my 49 and 30 lb dogs all the time. They simply love them.<br />I've had co-workers tell me the rawhide chews can result in surgery, and with these I know the small bits are digestable.<br />My dogs love them, and they seem to last much longer than other chews.<br /><br />The only down side is when the chew gets really small, my big dog can swallow the remaining amount.<br />So I find it best to put into a kong toy to allow here to continue to gnaw on it without swallowing it.<br />If she does swallow it, it will make her ill, she ralphs, and feels fine again. Not a huge danger, but<br />watch out for that.<br /><br />I will continue to order these, really saves 5the other stuff in the house from getting chewed up, and<br />the dogs love them.

review/summary: Best Chew Toy
review/text: We have tried multiple chews and this is the best one we have found for our Bouvier puppy. They do not smell and they provide many hours of chewing enjoyment. She also loves bully sticks but they smell horrible (even the ones that say they have no odor). We recently had our dog spayed and she chewed on her Himalayan Dog Chew for days and did not bother her stitches at all. Granted, these chews are expensive and do not last forever, so you may want to save them as a special treat. They can also break when your dog drops them on a hard surface. Although they do not smell, you may find some little chips from the chew around the house. When they get too small, you will have to throw them away because your dog will continue chewing on them. In summary, we absolutely love these chews and our dog does, too!

review/summary: Strong long lasting dog chew
review/text: I was introduced to these Himalayan Dog Chews in a local pet store.  My GSD pup loved it at first while it was fresh and she could nibble down the flavor.  But as with all dog chews, she gets bored with them so I have to switch it up so these seem new again.  Two things to note:  1) This dog chew shreds...like into very very fine 'grated cheese' like particles that get all over the floor.  So either make sure your dog is on an easy to clean flat surface or on washable dog bed.  2) The larger sizes tend to break in half easily.  While my pup has been enjoying them, she will occasionally drop it and it would break in half.  We are on our 2nd one with 4 unfinished pieces lying around the house.  Otherwise, great alternative to having the pup chew on our furniture!

review/summary: Miracle chew
review/text: Is it possible for you to have a non-stinky chew that your dog is actually interested in?!?!  YES!!!!  This chew is really hard and feels almost like hard plastic when its dry, but softens up a little when really wet.  I got this for my 12 lb Shiba puppy (3 months) and he's BARELY made a dent in it!  I initially got the smaller pieces (pet store recommendation), but i thought it was kind of a choking hazard in case I just wanted to leave it out, so I opted for the magnum!!!  My puppy can barely get his mouth around it but he loves this big chew and I'm sure it'll last a month or two.  This chew doesn't smell and sometimes little pieces come off, but since it hardens, its easy to vacuum up off the carpet.  Puppy smells like cheese after too!  And no staining on carpet or other materials.  I gave my neighbor the smaller chews I bought-- this product may not really be for super heavy chewers, his dog went through the chew in a DAY where as my puppy took a week before I got too paranoid and had to microwave it to make a cheesy pouf.  (30 seconds works well).  Really great buy.

review/summary: Best Birthday Preset
review/text: We got these chews for our husky's 2nd birthday (of course sis got one too) they both love them. We have a hard time finding chewies that will stand up to all of our criteria and were recommended these at our pet store, now we're hooked. Both pups are on wheat, corn and soy free diets, and we try not to give them super processed/unnatural treats.<br />Despite being an incredibly agressive chewer our female husky/shepard mix has unfortunate tummy reactions to any beef and pork based chews. These chews are amazing for our needs. Our little girl's is actually lasting longer because she only chews it, where our little boy licks and sucks on his making it softer, but he is also very slow and delicate chewer so it typically takes him way longer to eat anything.<br />The website says that some dogs may have slight tummy reactions at first but it typically goes away once their system gets used to it. We have not had any such reactions and are so happy to finally find a natural chew that satisfies our needs.

review/summary: Yummy "cheese bone" for my puppy
review/text: My 6 month old Aussie puppy loves these chews. The first one I got her was a medium, then a large, and now an extra large as she has grown. The medium ones used to last for weeks with her puppy teeth but now that she's getting her adult teeth, the XL I got her was gone in a little over a week! So not as long lasting as I thought they would be, but she'll probably stop chewing so much once she's done teething. I like these chews for her because they are healthy, they last longer than bully sticks, and they don't stink. I let her chew them on the couch next to me or in my lap without much mess other than a few shavings that I brush off.  Also, she prefers these to deer antlers which she gets bored of and might move onto something not meant for her, like a sock or the couch. Give her a himalayan bone on the other hand and she is set for as long as you want her to be. :)

Unfortunately it didn't turn out to be quite the incredible new chew discovery I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />First of all, I am not new to dog chews.  My fiance and I have an 80 lb Doberman who has had raw hides (in many shapes and sizes), bully sticks, tracheas and a bunch of other kinds I can't even remember the names of.  Since she is quite the spoiled little princess dog, she gets chews on a pretty regular basis and has learned to make quick work of chews that used to take her longer.  Raw hides and bully sticks last the longest with her.  She'll usually work on it for an hour or so (maybe less) before wrapping it up and saving it for later.  They usually last 2-3 sessions.<br /><br />Since this is supposed to be ultra-long lasting, I expected it to last longer than her raw hides and bully sticks.  Well...in an hour (maybe a little longer...but only by 10 minutes at most), she had finished half.  So pretty much that means it would last 2 hours if she ate it in one session.  After half she decided she had enough and lef it for later.  So really, this lasts no longer than her raw hides and bully sticks except it costs about 4x (or more) more.  Granted the benefit of this is that it doesn't smell (like bully sticks) and it doesn't stain (like raw hides).  However, I don't think that benefit is worth all that extra money.  Obviously this is expensive because of its source and the process for making this and I completely appreciate that...I just don't want to spend money on that.<br /><br />Really though, if this was something she absolutely went crazy for, I'd say it's still worth it to purchase for her (like I said...she's spoiled)...but she's not even that into this thing.  I thought for sure she'd love it since it's dairy-based but she's pretty 'meh' about it I guess.<br /><br />It took her awhile to get into it.  She was crazy sniffing and sitting for it when I first took it out to give to her but after she got it she spent quite awhile trying to find a place for it and then pretty much just left it there for a few hours.  I figured it was because she wasn't familiar with it and wasn't sure what to do with it, but now I think it's just that she has other chews she prefers.  After she finished half to leave for later I was worried she would finish the whole thing in one day so I took it away for awhile.  When I gave it back to her she pretty much just found a place for it and left it there...she'll pick it up occasionally but not to chew.  She likes to pick things up when she gets excited and that's the extent of her interaction with this thing.  Since then she has received a few other chews that she has chewed, left, and gone back to and finished...this one is still just sitting there.<br /><br />I'll probably buy another one at some point in the distant future to see if she takes to it more (maybe it IS just a novelty thing with her) but really, this is no miracle ultra-long lasting chew...at least not for my dog.  2 hours is a good amount of time but there are other chews that provide the same chew time at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Oh...I should also mention that there didn't really seem to be any adverse effects with this for my dog (stomach upset, diarrhea etc.).

review/summary: not what I was expecting
review/text: my dog is a 3 yr old 70lb American bulldog/German shepherd mix. after buying the thicker 12 inch bully sticks for her I wanted to try something that might last longer. (she goes through a 12 inch bully stick in about 20 mins.) I also wanted something that would be good for her teeth. I started w the large bone but she got down to half of it in about 15 mins. i had read that its not a good idea to feed one that's too large for your dogs size because it could fracture their teeth but i decided to try xl bone anyway (i think it says 80 ir 90+ lbs on the pckg) shes chewed on some pretty hard things before with no issues. but the XL (19.99 where i bought it) she managed to bite chunks off of so I had to take that away and trade her for a bully stick because I was concerned about her trying to swallow the large pieces. i was hoping it would be like rawhides n bullysticks and would get softer as she chewed so she could eat small pieces. but its really hard and stays that way. I'm sad it didn't work out for us because it is healthy and definitely would have been good for scraping her teeth. back to bulky sticks we go.

review/summary: Good chews but too expensive
review/text: I got these for my two golden retrievers. I was concerned about them making a gooey mess - but they really didn't and that was a nice surprise. I think that they were so good that they made sure every bit was swallowed.<br /><br />However, the one thing I did not like about these was how quickly they were consumed. I was looking for a dog chew that would keep my dogs occupied. I usually give them sterilzed bones but was looking to mix it up a little for them. After only 4 hours they were already through 1/2 of the chew! That is too fast for how expensive they are. Also consider they can't consume the entire chew - you need to pick it up when it gets to be a choking hazard. This was well over half the chew. I do have aggressive chewers but I'll need to stick with sterilized bones that they can get days and weeks of entertainment out of.

review/summary: Breaks into smaller pieces
review/text: Such a disappointment! I ordered 2 of these for my Lab/Weimeraner mix puppy. She destroys everything within minutes, and finishes store-bought chewies within a day. These chews would have been great had they not broken immediately. She dropped it on the ground and it split in two- which made them perfect size to choke on. So I had to give them to my other smaller dog, and only when they're in their kennels at night so super dog won't choke. Not worth the money.

review/summary: Great supplement but use sparingly
review/text: I took one vial and felt great. I felt like I'd never want to use any medication again. Then I had another and didn't feel any different.<br /><br />Ginkgo on its own improves circulation and is a mild stimulant, but combined with eleuthero (aka siberian ginseng) and rhodiola, it can create a significant feeling of relaxation and concentration.<br /><br />I suppose it works for some people (like the previous reviewer's roommate) and doesn't for others. But, based on my experience, I can say that it works best if used sparingly and if it is taken on an empty stomach.<br /><br />Once I started taking it while I ate and doing it every day, I stopped feeling any effects. But if I avoid it for a long time and then take it on an empty stomach, I feel awesome again.<br /><br />In any case, it's a good supplement and at under $10 a box, it's a good deal.

review/text: I bought the 1 lb. bag for something like a trial-pack, and I regret not buying more! This was the first time I had ever used oat bran, so I was not quite sure what to do with it, but I have found that it works EXTREMELY well when mixed with old-fashioned oats (for my typical breakfast of pumpkin maple oatmeal =]) The oat bran is finely ground, but it does a great job thickening up oats and giving it more texture as well as a little additional fiber. I highly recommend this product, and I look forward to purchasing more from Barry Farm

review/summary: Delicious Tea - Update* Only the first box was fresh.  Tossed the other 5 boxes.
review/text: I'm not picky when it comes to tea but I love tea.  I got this as a loose leaf a couple of years ago and I was surprised how delicious it was. I had to get more and ordered this Afternoon Tea.  I also have the Breakfast Tea but hands down the afternoon tea is much better in my opinion. $23 for 300 tea bags seemed to me like a good deal for quality tea.  Also the tea bags are pretty big so in a large cup I usually get to pour for 2 with one tea bag.<br /><br />UPDATE** Sadly after my first box, the other boxes had a different odor. It was not a good smell and I couldn't even drink it.  My mom ordered one at the same time and she felt exactly the same.  We realized we were sent a very old bath of tea.  Amazon has amazing service and they were kind enough to refund the money to us.  We were really sad that 10 boxes had to be thrown out.  It was so gross.  Hopefully others didn't have a bad batch like we did.  We really love the flavor of this tea.  Just make sure when you get your order to open all of them and check the smell.  You will notice it right away if it is OLD.  I had to go from 5 star to 2.

review/summary: So dissapointed
review/text: I have been drinking Ahmad English Afternoon Tea for several years and it has been my favorite black tea.<br /><br />I had been buying this tea at the "British Isles" store in Houston, Texas. However, a few years ago I moved to Hawaii, and had to order this tea from Amazon.com<br /><br />I bought 6 boxes of 50 bags of the Ahmad English Afternoon Tea and upon opening the boxes the first thing I noticed was a VERY strong smell of bergamot. Upon brewing the tea,<br />the taste and smell of bergamot was overwhelming. I think the bergamot is even stronger than Earl Gray tea. So I am sadly disappointed that this Ahmad English Afternoon Tea was<br />very different from the one I had been buying for years.<br /><br />Maybe the blend was recently changed? Could it be a quality control issue? I emailed Ahmad Tea and got NO response about this matter so I am posting this after a fair attempt to get an explanation.<br /><br />Buyer beware, Ahmad Tea may be selling "rejects" on their online store.

review/summary: Fruity Tea
review/text: I have been drinking tea for about 50 years or so, and Stash makes a great-tasting full-bodied tea.  This tea has a smooth fruity taste (peach).  It is not overbearing, but a nice subtle peachiness.<br /><br />Individually sealed in a paper/foil pouch for added freshness, this tea is listed as having 100 % natural ingredients.  They are, in the order listed, wuyi oolong tea<br />orange peel, lemongrass, and white peach flavor.<br /><br />It has been said that oolong tea was named after the part of Wuyi mountain, in China, where it was originally produced. It is among the most popular types of teas served in typical Chinese restaurants. (I have also found Jasmine tea and varieties of green tea in typical Chinese restaurants&iexcl;Xand plum wine.  Yum.)<br /><br />It is also suggested that oolong tea is useful for weight loss.  In my (non-medical) opinion (I am not a doctor), like anything else, it can HELP but won&iexcl;�t carry the load.  Oolong appears to be a diuretic, helping you to loose excess water.  If you lose too much water, you might dehydrate or lose valuable potassium.  So, I suggest that you limit yourself to 24 oz a day.  As with anything else, seek guidance from your health care practitioner.<br /><br />I suggest adding agave cactus juice, unbleached natural brown sugar, or honey, if you want a sweetener.  I like fruity teas often in the evening, and instead of dessert.<br /><br />Darn it!  Now I&iexcl;�m craving Chinese food and am snowed in--in a blizzard&iexcl;Xwith over 40 inches of snow on the ground.  I wonder if they will deliver? �

I don't know what led me to try Stash's Chocolate Mint Oolong but this tea is outstanding! It does NOT taste like Palmer's chocolate coins dissolved and diluted in too much water, which is what most chocolate tea tastes like to me -- not even a Hershey's kiss, but Palmer's -- yuck! This tea has a very light yet distinct chocolaty flavor followed by sweet mint. It's refreshing in the evening after dinner when I want something sweet but don't want to load up on sugar right before bedtime. And, truth be told, it's a delight any time of day.

It's caffeine free and I like this espeically as a cold drink in the mornings vs coffee in the summer time;  very refreshing and tropical.  Takes 3-5 minutes to steep and if making iced tea Stash recommends using double strength...2 bags per cup.  As with many of the unique Stash brand varieties ; licorice and pure peppermint,  this is difficult sometimes to get at the local stores so I buy either direct from the company or here on Amazon. Delicious. 5 stars to a great brand of Stash.

After finding it once, I haven't been able to find this flavor at any of my local grocery stores, so I ordered the box of 6.  Everyone I have shared this tea with has loved it too!.

review/summary: Not what is advertised
review/text: The kits I received are not what was advertised,,,I received 7lbs DME and 1lb corn sugar as opposed to the advertised LME.  DME is lighter than LME of course, but the inclusion of corn sugar bothers me a bit.  Also received .25 lb of Crystal instead of the promise 1lb.  Just be aware that the recipe contents seem to be variable.  The character of this beer is much different than  what the advertised contents will give you.<br /><br />That said, the kit itself has potential though it's sad that I have to add more ingredients.  I'd suggest dry hopping with an extra 2 oz of Cascade.  You may also want to add a bit more in the way of specialty grains (really, a quarter pound isn't that much...).  The hop character itself is lacking a bit  although the kit only included 2 oz of northern brewer hops...) and since most of the hops are bittering hops you don't get a tremendous depth of flavor...you may want to modify the hop schedule somewhat to add an ounce at about 30 minutes instead of all the Northern Brewer at the beginning of the boil.  Better yet add an extra ounce over what the kit includes.<br /><br />Lastly, I'd also suggest using a liquid yeast like Wyeast 1056 instead of the included dry yeast.  Yes it's five bucks more but I think you end up with a cleaner tasting, better fermenting beer.<br /><br />All in all, it's an acceptable kit but much different than what is advertised.  It's almost a pound short on fermentables (and I don't consider corn sugar an acceptable substitute for malt extract...) and missing an ounce of hops.  I can't help but feel a little shortchanged here.  It's doubtful I'll be purchasing fromm this vendor again.  Three stars based on the value of the raw materials and the buy three get one free special.  I figure combining all the kits gives me three good batches instead of four mediocre ones,

Loved it!  We are so thrilled for Miss Peanut.  She has found her food.  Yeah!!!!

review/summary: Dr. Chew Sweet Potato dog treats
review/text: We have a pure breed dog who is allergic to almost everything and can't eat most dog foods and treats.  After trying every kind of veggie, no wheat, no soy, duck, etc. treats and spending copious amounts of money only to find that he won't eat them, the only two kinds of treats in the world that he will eat are Milkbones (go figure) and Dr. Chews!  He LOVES Dr. Chews and they have only one ingredient, sweet potato.  Cooked, sliced, sun dried sweet potato.  They're full of fiber and vitamins and they don't stain fabrics.  The only concern we have is that they are made in China.  We found no negative history on this product (although we are not professional researchers) but we are still careful to give him only one at a time and let a day or two go by before he gets another.

review/summary: Misleading picture, lower quality product
review/text: Unfortunately bought the product based on the picture, clearly showing a pack of Stollwerck Xmas candy. The description correctly identifies the product as Bonboneti. Probably does not make any difference for a first time buyer, but if you happen to know the product and crave for the real deal, this one does not satisfy it. A 3 start effort at best, a 5 star learning for me to read the description fully and 0 stars to the seller for the misleading picture.

review/summary: The Best-Tasting Brand and Very Inexpensive
review/text: Many green teas leave an oily residue on the surface of the beverage and in your cup. They taste bitter and have an unpleasant taste. This is a nice, clean tea, and it works for weight loss as long as you have commitment. (You have to drink a LOT of green tea to see results, but I've taken off 12 pounds in a few months drinking it cup after cup.) It helps suppress appetite. And it's organic, free from pesticides. Green tea is naturally low in caffeine, mcuh lower than black.

review/summary: Smooth and Rich Coffee
review/text: This is a great brand of coffee....made in Knoxville, Tenn. I am no coffee expert, but I will describe it as best I can. I enjoy a medium to mild roast coffee with an extremely smooth, non-bitter taste that still had that true fresh brewed "coffee" flavor. This fits the bill exactly for me.<br />  I get mine fresh off the grocery store shelves in Tennessee, and keep a stock of it in the freezer until my next visit. This price is not much higher than buying it off the shelf, and it really is worth a try. Everyone I've served it to really loves it. I drink it black.  I prefer the one marked Special.....but have noticed the newer Bonus Blend recently....have no knowledge of that one. Hope this review helps someone decide.

review/text: For some reason butterscotch disks have become hard to find where I live. So I turned to the trusty Internet to satisfy my craving.<br /><br />Although these looked exactly like what I'd been searching for, their difference in manufacture is evident in their taste. They taste delicious but they're richer than the brand I grew up with. This is not a bad thing; just an unexpected one.<br /><br />Meanwhile, my local grocery now stocks the candy in the flavor I'm used to. Since this was an "old times sake" search, I won't buy these candies online again in the near future. But that's the only reason; these candies were quite tasty.

review/text: **Update** The recipe for this product has changed.  The second ingredient listed is almond butter.  I didn't realize that it had changed and bought some.  It's cheaper now, but not as good. Very disappointing.<br /><br />Old review: I love Nutella, but I stopped eating it because it has dairy (I'm allergic) and hydrogenated fat.  So, I was very excited to find Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Butter.  This product is non-dairy, has no hydrogenated fat, and has less sugar than Nutella.  While it is good, I think it tastes a little too salty, especially if you put it on a cracker, since they also tend to be salty.  My final descriptions would have to be: good stuff, could be great with a little less salt.

review/summary: Healthy, tasty snack!
review/text: Recently while shopping at Alfalfas Grocery a friend told me I had to try out Justin's Nut Butter squeeze packs. I have a sweet tooth, so the thought of buying a tasty and yet healthy snack seemed to be a genius plan. I quickly bought one of each flavor they carried and sat down by Boulder Creek to try one out. Next thing I knew, there were eight empty wrappers surrounding me. Yes, I felt embarrassed that I had gorged myself in public, but the blame certainly fell on the chocolate hazelnut flavor being far too tasty. This wonderful snack discovery made me curious... What is Justin's Nut Butter? I decided to investigate. Once I found Justin's website and read the mission statement, I knew Justin's would have a customer for life. Discovering that they are a homegrown business that strives to use local, natural and organic ingredients sold me. Not to mention the importance of reducing ones environmental footprint and giving back to the community.

As for being too salty, I eat this product on the 'cardboard rice cakes'(yes, the whole concoction is quite good!) so the amount of salt included in this product is just right!

review/summary: Tasty and conventient
review/text: I don't usually go in for convenience packaging -- but these packets are the perfect size for a purse or pocket-able snack when not at home, and much less wasteful than an open jar.<br /><br />I bought this chocolate-hazelnut spread at the local market first to see how it stacked up against Nutella and I really loved this product.  It has a grainier texture (more like natural nut butters than the super-smooth spread) and just the right amount of cocoa and sugar.  The market also had these little single-serving packets, but they were outrageously expensive -- I could have only bought 4 for the price of the jar.<br /><br />Amazon's price made the packets very close to the cost of the jar -- and each sealed packet opens fresh, without time spent oxidizing and going stale between servings.<br /><br />It's just the right size serving to go with one of Fiber Gourmet's bags of tasty wheat crackers -- making for a 255 calorie snack with 15 grams of fiber, and 10 grams of protein.  Can't beat that!<br /><br />I give the 4 stars instead of 5 because the hazelnut/cocoa blend is slightly oilier than the almond version, and could probably be stripped of a bit of the fat with no loss to taste or shelf-life.

The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.

I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/summary: You gotta use it quick. (according to the manufacturer)
review/text: I purchased this fil&eacute; from Amazon after not being able to find it in any store near me and let me be the first to say (literally this is the first review) it's a great product. It's by far the best value around on fil&eacute;. At about 50 cents an ounce, you cant beat it. However, one would think since it's so cheap it would be of poor quality, but this is simply not the case, this fil&eacute; is high quality potent stuff. I use a ton of it in my gumbo and nearly a year later, about 6 large pots of gumbo, I still have over half of it left, and that is after I gave my cousin a quart sized container of it! One cannot simply do that if you bought a tiny 6 ounce container of fil&eacute;. My advice is if you're a Creole like me and use a bunch of fil&eacute; look no further than this. However, if you're just a casual spice experimenter this may not be for you as fil&eacute; has a unique taste and smell that may not appeal to all and this being such a large container it would be a waste should you not like it. I recommend buying a small amount first in order to make a determination.<br /><br />Note: The container says it will expire about a year from when I bought it, but I have never know fil&eacute; to go bad as my mom had the same little jar the entire time I was growing up.

review/summary: Pretty good, a tad salty
review/text: I made some Nutella Puppy Chow with them - turned out pretty well- but I think it'd be better if there was a little less salt.  As can be expected, it's oily on top - so be careful when you open it or you could splash some on your shirt.

review/text: I tried another brand before I tried this, and this is what I was looking for. It took maybe a week to arrive, but worth the wait. Delicious! I've almost finished my first order and I'm ordering again.

review/summary: Seems to live up to it's claims . . .
review/text: I have only used a pack of the Mastic Gum to date but find it pleasant and it being a smaller piece of gum makes it easy to carry around in the mouth for long periods.  Maintains it's level of freshness and does seem to cleanse the breath.  Too early to judge other dental claims.

review/text: Our two Standard Poodles have been on Purina One Rice and Lamb since we got them.  We have had our male for 4 years and our female for over 8 years.  We also had our last two Standard Poodles on Rice and Lamb for even longer.  We originally put them on because we had studied all of the available foods and decided this was the best for their health and well being.  A fantastic thing about the food is that it really reduces the volume of their feces to about 50% of other dry dog foods.  We had both of our old poodles with us when we went full time in our RV for a little over two (2) years; reduced output was a real bonus when scooping all the time.  Overall all four of our dogs were health and happy while on this food and had no problems with their skin or coats.  A recent change was a new formula with the "Smartblend" which seems to have made our dogs eat the food even better.  Both my wife and I believe that this food has helped to make our dogs healthier with the bonus of being easy to find as we travel.  I can highly recommend this food.  If you switch to it, remember to gradually introduce it while reducing the old food.  Feeding all dry is the best way to help prevent dental problems also.

review/text: This is a great natural nutrition. Most people don't eat enough vegetables in a day and this wheat grass rich in vitamins, minerals and other nutrition to replace the lack of greens. 1 scoop should give enough serving of vegetables for the day. I combine it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039ITKR4">Nutrex Hawaii Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica Powder, 16-Ounce Bottle</a> to make yummy smoothie in the morning.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: This product has not been the "wonder supplement" it is cracked up to be on videos and online.  It does help to make your smoothie greener.  Taste wise by itself...bleecch, however, in a smoothie, it adds that "green taste" which I miss when I forget to put it in.  What it does for me?...well, I have added this to my daily green smoothie along with my other supplements and find that I can extend the time between breakfast and lunch to about 6 hours without<br />a blood sugar "low".  My fasting blood sugar has dropped by about 10% which is a good metric for me.  So  I give this a 4 star rating, with no complaints, I just can't say I love it, but I will be ordering more.

review/summary: High quality wheatgrass...for the whole family...
review/text: This product has been so good for me that I quickly went from the 30 serving size to the 100 serving size.  Ive tried it in smoothies...but since our family takes up to 4 servings a day...it got to be a pain to make a smoothie every time.  Plus,  my grocery bill was really going up trying to hide this in fruit.  Now,  I take it straight...after I dissolve it in an 8oz glass of water and I chase it down with a morsel of something.<br /><br />The amazing thing for me is that I cannot take vitamins or other supplements because I always have a problem with reflux.  Not anymore and I dont taste a product all day!  I make a banana/blueberry/strawberry smoothie for my 4 year old...she gulps it down...and she is less hungry all day. My 10 year old...hems and haws...eventually he will drink the smoothie just before it becomes gross and separated.  Another family member also takes wheatgrass in the triple wheatgrass/barley/alfalfa.<br /><br />At first, since wheatgrass has been so good to us...I thought that I would start to grow my own...but I am too busy with kids...and this product quality is so high...I dont see the need.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I purchased after reading many reviews.  Use on face, chest and hands.  The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic.  It took me about a week to get the impressive results.  I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look.  Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.  I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion.  Finally my hands look very nice.  I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.  I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often.  Finally a product line that works!
