review/summary: Learn To Live So Free
review/text: I had just gotten home from my weekly bowling league to find my fiancee in bed with our neighbor.  You know how they say that a mother has so much adrenaline pumping through her system when her child is in danger that she can just about lift a car off of it?  When I saw those two desecrating my queen-sized air mattress in the corner, I got so worked up that I could have taken that mother and her child, locked them up in the trunk of that car, and tossed it onto the roof of of the self-storage facility around the corner, the one with the orange hangar-style doors.  That's three stories high.  Anyway, the two fled out the back door and I went into a rage.  I broke everything in the house that reminded me of her.  The toaster-oven she used to make me pepperoni bagel-bites for breakfast each morning, the ironing board that we trimmed the legs down on so that it could double as a coffee table during that Pawn Stars marathon last July.  After about 45 minutes, I was totally drained from breaking stuff.  I took the truck down the road to the Citgo station to refuel and got a sleeve of those mini-powdered donuts and a Redbull Zero because my doctor says that too much sugar will make my Diabetes flare up.  It's a lot less syrupy than the regular Redbulls, but it definitely perked me back up.  On the way home, that Mr. Mister song about Broken Wings came on and I knew it was a sign because my heart was broken and Redbull gives you wings.  At that point, I knew I had to forgive her.  We've been happily married for 8-months now with a little one on the way, and I can honestly say that without Redbull Zero, I may have never gotten up the courage to patch things up.  I highly recommend this product to anyone going through a rough patch in their relationship.

review/text: This is a nice smooth coffee, a part of the Keurig K-cup portfolio. This is labelled "extra bold." Not sure that that is the case. This has a nice smooth, albeit rather mild (and even bland) flavor.<br /><br />However, some K-cups have a harsh, almost acidic, quality to them and are not particularly pleasant. This produces a nice cup of coffee.

review/text: Used these in a waffle recipe that said they would dissolve and make air pockets that had some sweetness, resulting in a light, crispy waffle.  They did not dissolve but became burned clusters that got stuck to the waffle iron grids.  The waffles were like lead, were sickening sweet and basically the worst ones I've ever eaten.  I certainly would not recommend this Pearl Sugar to anyone.

review/summary: Harves of creamy spices and flavors
review/text: Mayonnaise is an interesting product, cool, smooth and creamy it's the lush counter partner of the low cal mustard but it's of those things people think they don't like until they taste it in the proper way and that's all it takes for a secret love affair with luxe sauces  and recipes that can be made with it to start.<br /><br />I am a big fan of sandwiches and any new way I can spruce them up, especially with nice sauces and spices is always at the top of my new ideas to make for lunch or to fill into an interesting menu on the weekends. The Rouille is spicy, that I deducted just from looking at the angry orange color in the jar, the color of auburn harvest on a stormy night. The taste is of cream immersed in a sea of chili peppers and garlic with a peppery background. My favorite way to eat it is in a sandwich with a leftover cold coconut breaded chicken cutlet with some crisp romaine in between two toasted crusty slices of bread smeared on the inner sides with the Rouille spicy mayonnaise . The taste is a tropical rendition of a Caesar Chicken Sandwich I get at Hale and Hearty here in NYC but much easier since I made it at home and it took no effort.<br /><br />Great on bread, meat or as a condiment to any afternoon snack or smeared on some California roll for a spicy finish. There is no end to the amount of uses this product provides.<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: Perfect for Popsicles and Italian Ices
review/text: Barry Farms is known for their quality and rare, hard-to-find ingredients. Xanthan Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Amazon, right? Barry Farms to the rescue!<br /><br />Xanthan Gum is used to modify the viscosity of liquids, on a very low scale (typically 1/3 tsp per 1 gallon). Because of the difficulty in combining Xanthan Gum to a liquid evenly, you should mix this into your liquid very slowly, in a blender at full speed, and it should be one of your steps (before adding other ingredients, including Guar Gum).<br /><br />Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Xanthan Gum and sometimes Guar Gum (also available from Barry Farms: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015UC5M?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution (again, mix in slowly via blender running on high), but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is the secret to making softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice!<br /><br />Another interesting characteristic of Xanthan Gum is its ability to thin out when subjected to forces such as shaking (called shearing), which makes it great for poured sauces, as it will thicken back up after having exited the bottle. It can also prevent oils from separating from liquid-oil emulsions (think salad dressing). It is also more stable under a wider range of temperatures and pH than other gums.<br /><br />Xanthan Gum can also be used to give dough the stickiness that is needed in gluten-free baking, as gluten is usually what gives that sticky characteristic to dough. And no matter the use, Xanthan Gum will always remain colorless and flavorless, so it can be used for just about any need that suits it.

review/text: This baby food was fine. I usually make my own, but for traveling and to add variety I bought some of these packets. My son didn't seem to dislike this flavor, but I could tell it wasn't his favorite. The packets are kind of annoying. They open at the top and can be re-sealed with a zip-lock. However, it's a small pouch and my son only ate about 1/3 at a time, so we would try to pull out some of the food and reseal it, but it was messy. It's not a huge mess or inconvenience, but the other packets with the nozzle just work better for us. Even though we don't have the boon spoon.

review/text: I love most of the chips that this company makes. When I say "most", the pepper, and the garlic are a bit much for me, but if you like a big jolt of either, these would probably be for you. I'm very health conscious, and these are simply potatoes, avacado, or olive oil, and a few seasonings. So many chip brands have ingred. a mile long, and made with oils that equate to motor oil, in my book ... ugh! The "Good Health Chips" are the only ones I'll grab. They cost more that most, but worth the price, in my opinion. The Barbeque, vinegar/salt, and Chilean Lime are my favs.

I just opened up my 3rd bottle and I still haven't really noticed much of anything. The taste isn't too bad.<br /><br />The following comment is for the person who previously reviewed the product: I believe that what you were looking at was NOT the expiration date but rather the date it was made. I bought this product as well and was worried that I would have the same problem as you described until I realized that it had an expiry date as well as a production date. The production date was dated as "something/something 2011." And incidentally, the expiry date on my product was shown to be "something/something 2013" so that also prompts me to think that you probably looked at the wrong date and mistook 2011 for the expiry date.

review/summary: AMAZING RESULTS AT A GREAT PRICE!
review/text: I was told about this product a couple of months ago, but with so many "crazy products" out there, I must confess, I was not a believer, but when I saw the person who told me about it, looking not only "amazing", but her skin was glowing, her belly was gone and her hair looking better than ever. I had to order it, I read the reviews, did the basic research and ordered 2 bottles. I was amazed, glad and happy when I received them the very next morning. "WOW!", I thought, this is "great service!". I have been drinking it for 2 days and it does what it says, it suppresses your appetite, gives you energy and boost the metabolism. The one thing I have noticed, and most likely the reason it has not worked on some people is because this would not suppress your anxiety, and if you are an emotional eater as I am, you are going to have to teach yourself how to eat in smaller portions, eat healthier and control yourself. This really helps and it really works, you will get results if you follow the directions. Hope this help you make the right choice for your health and your future new self.

review/text: When it comes to weight loss, there is no such thing as one size fits all.  I don't care what the bottle looks like and I am not going to deduct points because it took an extra day or two to get to me.  What really matters is 1-Does it work? and 2-Are there any side effects?  My co-worker started taking this and based on the reviews, I figured it was another gimic. Then I tried it.  I literally felt the energy burst about 15 minutes after taking it.  As I left the office for the day, it dawned on me that I did not eat my normal morning or afternoon snack because I was not hungry.  At lunch, I only ate half of my sandwich and (believe it or not) even turned down the brownie tray.  This is huge!  I like the taste, I like the ingredients, and even after taking a shot before dinner - fell asleep at my normal time.  I'm sold and will make this a regular part of my plan.  This product does exactly what it says it does - appetite suppressant.

review/summary: Did not curb appetite, but gave me a seasonal allergy type reaction
review/text: Anyone else have seasonal allergy type reactions? This stuff, for me, is hayfever allergies in a bottle.<br /><br />I performed a little test and here are all the details:<br /><br />- after taking it Monday twice each day, I thought I suddenly had caught a cold or developed seasonal allergies... I was REALLY bad Tuesday.  I had to resort to aspirin and Benadryl to get through the day. It was truly awful and I wanted to go home early for feeling so sick. Headache, itchy eyes, watery mouth, constantly stuffed and runny nose, tired...<br /><br />- After staying up quite late and finally falling asleep with the window open and the fan on, blowing in whatever pollen or cold air was outside, I woke up today (Wed) feeling totally fine. This is when I knew something was up. No cold or seasonal allergies disappears overnight with the window open and a fan on you.<br /><br />- So, I did an experiment today. I waited until halfway through the day (2pm) to take the first dose of African Bush Mango juice... the recommended dosage of 2 tbsp. A half hour after drinking this stuff, a mild headache came on, then within the next hour my eyes began itching and my throat felt scratchy and my mouth started feeling watery and, finally, I started sneezing and blowing my nose again.<br /><br />No doubt about it, this produces a seasonal allergy type reaction for me. Only other time ingesting anything ever did something like this was when I thought I would just go ahead and throw the beet stems in my juicer to be "extra healthy." I am not allergic to beets, but beet stems made my eyes run green snot. This stuff produces almost as bad a reaction. So... throwing away the full $18 bottle when I get home.

Sometimes if I go overboard and overeat I definitely make sure I use it before I engage in a heavy meal.I now have a lot of loose body fat particularly around my waist and upper back area. I look forward to going to the gym to do my cardio and toning excercises to tighten up the loose skin. This juice has definitely made a difference in losing my ab fat. This was my most difficult area to lose. I am a size 10 at the top but wear a size 4 in skirts and pants. Obviously my most stubborn and difficult areas are my abs, back and upper body.I like the taste of this particular brand. I did try another brand but did not like the flavor as much as I like this one. That's the only reason I am able to continue using because the flavor is great. I will continue to use this brand until I reach my goal of fat loss. I've tried alot of products but this seems to be working the best for right now.

review/text: I just tried this product 2 days ago and within a few minutes of taking it, I felt a difference. I can't explain how it felt. It definitely suppresses your hunger and it's like you get a bolt of energy within a few minutes. I rated this 3 star because it's only been 2 days but I will keep updating as I go along. My aunt also started this..she didn't get "a bolt of energy" as well as I did but she says it's kept her from being hungry so I guess we will see!

review/summary: A Taste of Africa
review/text: Even though I know its supposed to be good for me, I am not a huge fan of most herb teas.  Mighty Leaf - African Nectar is THE exception.  I was first served this tea at my hair spa.  What caught my attention was the smell; flowery, sweet, a touch of herbs, then the taste, not bitter, not sweet, but refreshing.  In addition the smell doesn't fade, and the tea doesn't grow bitter if left with the tea bag in for a longer period than recommended!<br />This tea is fairly expensive as herb teas go, but it IS worth it.  I have plenty of half used packets in my pantry of other failed tea experiments.  This time I have one which is a keeper.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET5XZS">Mighty Leaf Herb Tea, African Nectar, 15-Count Whole Leaf Pouches, 1.32 Ozs. (Pack of 3)</a>

review/text: We were turned on to African Nectar by our son, who gave us a couple of bags. Now we drink it everyday. Although the Mighty Leaf brand can be a pricey, we find that we can make two or more pots of tea from a single bag. Most herbal teas only make one cup per bag before running out of flavor. African Rooibos leaves, combined with other herbs, makes a herbal tea that's very flavorful. It's hard to compare it with other herbal flavors.

review/text: I agree with all the other positive reviews here.  I too discovered this blend from a single pouch offered as part of a selection at a restaurant.  It has the flavor of black tea without the acidity.  The notes of fruit offer just a hint of sweetness, and does not dominant the flavor, which I like (I'm not a fan of fruity herbal teas). After brewing, I mix this dark, rich tea with warm milk to make a tea latte for morning tea.  I don't think I could make this a blend I drink every day but I do enjoy having it around for variety.

It is some type of cloth material which when steeped, releases all the flavors and is very good for the environment.<br /><br />I drink this tea usually after dinner because it just relaxes my mind and body. The tea doesn't need any sugar to be added because of the sweet orangy taste. I would highly recommend this tea to beginner tea drinkers and also because of the many health benefits.

review/text: This tea is awesome.  Love it's smoothness... Reminds me of the smoothness of Asaam.  It's very light in taste and comforting without hints of bitterness.  I love it plain but when the mood strikes, I've added drops of honey, grated ginger or even lemon juice and peels.  My bro happened to have it at a fine restaurant several years ago and recommended I try it - been hooked ever since.  When friends come over and choose a non-caffeinated tea, they usually choose this one; even the ones who don't usually do teas.  So imagine my grin at finding this three-pack on Amazon.<br /><br />True story:  Gave this to a good friend a couple years ago whose mom is a tea connoisseur, highly selective of her loose-leaf brews and doesn't do tea bags.  I've heard it sung she rather enjoyed this Mighty Leaf... and ended up taking my friend's whole stash.

review/text: I was recently introduced to Green Mountain's Country Blend.  A friend sent me several flavored K-cups to try, and one of these was in the package. This coffee is hard to explain exactly. All I can say is they hit it on the head with it's name. It reminds me of a diner I ate breakfast at last time I was up in Vermont. The only way I can impart how this tastes and smells to you is to say that it's like Coffee Peoples Donut Shop coffee (my standard), but made with the mineral-rich water of Vermont, so it's VERY full-bodied. Like brewing it with Dasani bottled water, if that makes any sense to you. It's a VERY pleasing cup of coffee, but maybe not for everyone as it's a touch saltier (but not salty).<br /><br />If you don't like it, I'm sure you'll find someone on the K-Cup Exchange at Yahoo Groups who will trade it for something you do like, or will buy it from you at a fair price.

review/summary: A compromising blend for the masses (i.e. your office)
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:31 Mins<br /><br /></span>Listed as one of Green Mountain Coffee's "most popular blends," the Vermont Country Blend offers a safe choice if your Keurig serves a larger audience, such as an office environment.<br /><br />The coffee has a pleasing aroma, with hints of fruit and caramel, and a gentle finish. While Green Mountain's website describes this as "an engaging blend that reveals itself in layers" but that was not my experience. It is a pleasant, middle-of-the-road blend, but not the type of K-cup I'll reach for first in the morning.<br /><br />One reason the Vermont Country Blend didn't blow my socks off was that it arrived at the same time we ordered Green Mountain Coffee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Nantucket Blend</a>.

review/summary: Suited to its purpose, if not quite its goal...
review/text: If you like the classic taste of a good margarita, it's likely you'll find Baja Bob's Margarita Mix to be an acquired taste at best and a cruel joke at worst.  Not that it tastes horrible, but like most contests between similar products that are sugar-based and sugar-free, the recipe for which you already have a preference is going to win despite the competition's particular and sometimes overwhelming merits.  Since I've decided to limit my sugar intake but not my affection for margaritas, this tequila mixer is best suited to take care of the problem, so I've decided to stick with it and learn to like it.  Over time I've at least grown accustomed to the taste (adding extra Triple Sec helps), even if I can't say it's the best improvement to margaritas since the salt rimmed glass.  Splenda certainly works better in some things than others.  In this case it's a qualified success with taste taking a subjective second place to functionality.  I don't love it or hate it, but I don't miss the sugar either.  To that end Baja Bob's Margarita Mix does what it's supposed to do very well.

review/summary: Good margarita mix - other flavors noted in review
review/text: As a type 2 diabetic I've always resigned myself to drinking just straight scotch or bourbon when imbibing on occasion as mixed drinks are loaded with carbs and the few sugar free ones either weren't so much carb free ("sugar alcohol" from maltatol or the like) or they tasted just awful. I tried the original Margarita mix from Baja Bob and was very pleasantly surprised by how great it was. I then went a little nuts and ordered 1 of just about every flavor offered off their site (not all flavors are available on Amazon but they are a few bucks cheaper here than off Baja's site directly when you order in sets of 3). Here's the short rundown on my take:<br /><br />The lime margarita mixes (both the original and the Key Lime) are fantastic - both blended with ice and on the rocks they hold their own with any Margarita mix I've tried. I prefer the original since it's a little more "tart" the way I think a lime margarita should be in my book. For folks here that complain about it being too limey they may want to try the key lime - it's a little milder.<br /><br />The strawberry margarita mix was ok - a bit sweet for my taste but to be fair I'm not really that big of a strawberry margarita guy to begin with.<br /><br />The Pina Colata mix was very good and even my wife liked that one as well and she _never_ partakes in cocktails with me. Note that there are around 4 carbs per serving with this instead of the usual zero for the rest of their mixers. The coconut cream in the mix has a few carbs - but totally worth it. Creamy and smooth blended with ice in a good blender. Very nice.<br /><br />The mojito mix is decent. I can make a pretty passable sugar free mojito myself but this is pretty good. I probably wont bother to stock up on it because it's not a must have mixer for me.<br /><br />All the martini mixes were just awful in my book. Other folks seem to like them, maybe it's just not my thing.  The apple and cranberry tasted like medicine to me and I promptly tossed the rest of the bottles after the first taste. The lemon was pretty poor and I gave it a couple shots before throwing the rest out.<br /><br />I didn't care for the hurricane mix and tossed the rest - but again, to be fair I'm not really a hurricane fan to begin with so I'm not necessarily a good judge on this one.<br /><br />The sweet and sour mix made a nice whiskey sour. Not the best I've had by any stretch but perfectly servicible in my book.<br /><br />Finally the Mai Tai was pretty good - Not my favorite drink in the world but this was as good as any I'd had.<br /><br />So they're batting around .500 give or take. Definitely worth picking up a few bottles and testing out - I think some folks that are skeptical, particularly about the margaritas and pina colatas will be pleasantly surprised.

review/text: In principle a Splenda Margarita mix sounded like a great idea. The execution was terrible. I poured both of my two bottles down the drain. You would have to be pretty desparate, or otherwise never have had a decent margarita if this was your choice. I would rather skip altogether, as one of the other reviewers had suggested as well. The market has a long way to go to support less sugar in drinks.

review/summary: Baja Bob's Drink Mixes - DON'T BOTHER
review/text: I would be the first to applaud these products if they were good.  Unfortunately, I would rather give up drinking that have to drink this tasteless slop.  There is a very nasty, artificial acrid, too citrusy, while at the same time too sweet, taste to these products. The strawberry margherita mix has a very faint taste of strawberry, but no amount of doctoring could make it drinkable.  I poured the mix out.  The Mai Tai mix -- poured it out.  I bought several bottle/dry drink mixes of all their varieties without trying them first.  BIG MISTAKE!  I am either going to pour them out or throw them out, since the folks at Baja Bob's web site have refused to even respond to my request that I return the unopened products for a refund.  You will also note that on their web site's "fan club" page, there are 0 entries.  Save your money unless you are totally desperate.  You'd be better off using Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit.  Now, that tastes pretty good mixed with Vodka.

review/summary: Excellent and versitile tea
review/text: I've been drinking Yellow Label Tea since the 80's. This is an excellent and versitile tea, makes for a good hot tea and also a refreshing iced tea. A bit stronger than regular "brisk lipton" tea typically found in the U.S. I used to have to wait until I traveled to the British Virgin Islands or the Bahamas to find this tea, but now it's on Amazon (darn, my excuses to travel are dwindling!). This is an Orange Pekoe tea in 200g bags. You can find different varieties of tea marked with the "Lipton Yellow Label" brand, usually loose leaf teas. For instance I have a Sri Lanka-packed metal tin of "Pure Ceylon," a box of "Coarse Black Tea" packed in Mumbai, and another "new bright & rich" Mumbai variety which is a blend of "Assam teas." These other varieties can be found in middle eastern, Indian, and Asian markets here in the US. All good teas, but this Orange Pekoe in the bags is the most convenient and has the smoothest flavour.

review/summary: Why this isn't a common US tea is beyond me.
review/text: Traveling world wide, I've come to much prefer good tea to bad coffee, and good teas are so much more common.<br /><br />Yellow Label is one of the most popular teas in the world because it has a rich, clean flavor without bitterness.  Its clear distinctive red color makes it also one of the prettiest.  The only supermarket teas I've found in the US that taste similar are the "English Breakfast" labels.  If you like these, or like strong black tea flavor without the bitterness or muddiness of overbrewing the usual black teas, you should try Yellow Label.

review/summary: A Favorite with Many
review/text: I first enjoyed Yellow Label in the Caribbean 20 yrs ago and have since in travels worldwide been looked at oddly at groceries as I purchased 20 boxes to take home. There it was only tea, in the US it wasn't available...or oddly in London which appears on the label.  A letter to Lipton 6 years ago gave no explanation for not marketing in the US, just "coupons to try our other brands".  Finally, Amazon has it and even better a market in Chinatown here in NYC.<br />What makes it great?  It's the only black tea that is full flavored but not bitter.  It's so smooth that you literally can make a pot of it, leave the bags in, reheat it the next day and still have no bitterness.  This is a tea lover's tea that I have turned numerous travel companions onto for life and something I would be lost without.

review/summary: The smoothest tea.......
review/text: I was first given a box of this Yellow Label from a co-worker who had traveled to China.  I instantly fell in love with the smooth flavor.  I found it in a Food Max in Stockton, Ca but then the store closed down.  I have been on a search for the last two months because my loose leaf is almost gone also.  I was brewing the tea for the staff in my office and they all love it, so when I ran out of tea bags they all wanted to know where I got the tea from.  The flavor is so smooth that you almost do not need any type of sweetner at all.  This should be made available in the states in at least one major grocery store.  I am buying enough to share with my friends.....

review/summary: Does not taste like Lipton Yellow Label tea sold in Italy, possibly stale, no expiration date on pkg.
review/text: This is a repeat of the same review I left for another Amazon listing for the same tea (but at a significantly different price).  Despite the price difference, both listings appear to be for the same item and are sold by the same Indian Grocery.  From reading the other reviews, it is clear that at least one other customer had the same bad experience as I did.<br /><br />I was initially excited to find Lipton Yellow Label Tea on Amazon, as I just got back from Italy and fell in love with it there.  The Lipton Yellow Label Tea in Italy doesn't taste anything like the weak, poor-quality Lipton we get in the U.S., but the tea I ordered on Amazon (sold by Simply Beautiful) is actually manufactured for India and tastes bitter and/or stale.  You can't see from the photo, but the writing on the packages I received is not in English and says it was manufactured in Canada for India.  It is hard to tell whether the variety sold in India just tastes different than the kind in Italy, or if the tea was in fact stale, because there is NO sell-by or expiration date on the package (very disturbing), and the bags are NOT "foil-wrapped for freshness" as described on Amazon.  I was extremely disappointed in the taste of this tea from India, having looked forward to the lovely, full-bodied Lipton Yellow Label tea bags that I brought home from Italy.  Not to mention the fact that I would never want to buy imported groceries that don't have an expiration date, so there is no way to know how long they've been sitting in the warehouse, if they are stale, or when they will go stale after opening (especially since they are not individually wrapped).  I returned both boxes of tea and hope to get an Amazon refund soon.  I am very bummed.

review/summary: good tea
review/text: I must echo the praise of Lipton Yellow Label tea.<br /><br />I don't know how this label may differ across countries, but recently I spent several month-long trips to Pakistan, where Lipton Yellow Label is pretty much all the black tea they serve, and tea is served all the time.  After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is "insipid" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan.

I had only had the "brisk" version before and wasn't such a Lipton fan, but I needed tea and bought it.<br /><br />Contrary to the rather dusty, mild (watery??) taste of the "brisk" American version, Yellow Label has a good flavor and no bitterness, even when brewing for 6 min (I brew a small pot with three bags in the morning). Not quite as rich as Assam tea when mixed with milk and sugar, but a good substitute. And you can't beat the price. A very nice, full every-day tea.

review/summary: Great tea and an even better bargain
review/text: I'm a lifetime fan of Lipton tea so, there was no risk in this purchase for me.  A 20 count box of Lipton green tea bags is $2.99 at the local Kmart which makes the 240 bags in this box, a $36 retail value, a steal at $20.  The only negative in this review is that once brewed, the tea looks nothing like a green tea.  Instead, it has a nice golden brown appearance like the normal Lipton product.  I bought a bottle of Lipton diet green tea as a comparison and found the 1.5 liter bottle to be good, but too sweet for my taste.  Instead, 6 tea bags and four packets of splenda make the same amount of tea, but much more palatable.  At six bags per bottle, I can make forty bottles of a tea that was about $2 retail for just $20.  If you're intent on having a tea that is a pale light green then this product is not for you.  However, it's a good value, if not exactly the product being advertised.

review/summary: Good Tea
review/text: My husband drinks a lot of green tea, and this is one of our preferred brands.  I also appreciate that the tea is naturally decaffeinated.  He drinks probably up to half a gallon of tea a day, and I appreciate that he doesn't have a large caffeine intake.

review/summary: Lipton Green Tea Decaff
review/text: I am so happy I switched from coffee to Lipton Decaff Green Tea.<br />Coffee had been giving me an acid build up which is secreted through my skin, causing burning rashes.<br />Not that I don't love coffee, but the Lipton Decaff Green, of which I drink sometimes 2 pots a day,<br />causes no acid build up. So join the happy tea drinkers. GO GREEN!!!!<br />AMAZON HAS THE LOWEST PRICE ON THIS ITEM......BELIEVE IT!!!!

review/summary: Easy on the stomach and doesn't keep you awake
review/text: Let it be said that I am one who absolutely LOVES my coffee, perhaps a little too much, because for awhile I was drinking about a whole pot (!) a day by myself.<br /><br />It was when I got a stomach ulcer though that I was forced by my doctor to severely cut down on my intake of coffee permanently.  I still enjoy 2-3 small cups a day but no more.<br /><br />Thank heavens Lipton Decaffeinated Green Tea was there to come to the rescue in my case for the desire to drink more beyond that.  I am a huge music fan and am usually listening to my vast CD collection when not at work and seem to always want a hot, soothing beverage to sip to pass the hours by as I listen.  Lipton Green Tea is great for that.  It's extremely easy to make, good for you, naturally decaffeinated and has that clean, pure taste that all Lipton tea has come to be known for.  I think I'm hooked for life on buying the 40-packet boxes at my local store and highly recommend it to those like me wishing to cut down on or even completely eliminate their daily dose of traditional caffeinated coffee.

review/summary: Excellent product and service
review/text: Getting this product through Amazon has been a pleasure.  The pricing is better than typical retail and it's delivered to my front door free of charge.  I selected to get it sent to me once a month and I can still monitor it and make any changes if necessary.  Again, highly recommended.

review/summary: Decaf Green Tea
review/text: I have become a Decaf Green Tea addict.  Green tea is so good for you and since I cannot stand caffinated drinks this decaf green tea is perfect.  I have to go easy on coffee as it contains too much caffine even in the decaf kind.  This green tea has really helped with my blood pressure and I found out the caffine can cause it to rise.  As long as I stay off too much salt in the diet and decaf, low fat I have been able to stay off medication for high blood pressure.  I can keep that steady with the decaf green tea, this was a bargain for a case lot.  Having the shipping free and delivery in two days it is a saving all around.

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: Lipton Decaffeinated Green Tea is the perfect thing to drink when you want a soothing hot or cold iced beverage. It works wonders to combat laryngitis as well. The tea bags contain decaffeinated tea which means you'll never lose a night's sleep from drinking this! SMILE<br /><br />Moreover, there are no additives nor are there preservatives. You can use these tea bags a very long time after you bought them in a store or here at Amazon.com online. Amazon states that this tea has antioxidants and in fact it does--but the antioxidants are in the form of flavonoids which are all natural antioxidants. Some evidence suggests that flavonoids reduce the risk for coronary heart disease at the same time that they lower your risk of several types of cancers. Tea flavonoids can also improve your body's immune system.<br /><br />I normally find this green tea most useful for those nasty winter months when I inevitably catch a miserable cold. I heat the water until it's almost at a boiling point; then I put the water and the tea bag into my cup. I let it steep for a few minutes before I add milk and one packet of "sweet and low." It's absolutely delicious!<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine quality green tea that will not over stimulate you with caffeine. It is an aromatic hot beverage for when you have a cold and it also makes a delicious iced tea drink on a baking--hot summer's day. Pick some up and try it--you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />SMILE
