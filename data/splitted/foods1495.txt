review/summary: Very small tin - not worth the price!
review/text: I was very disappointed when my pack of cocoa tins arrived. They are a lot smaller than I thought they would be. I would never have paid $2 a tin for these, and that is half of the original price! I was buying these as Christmas gifts, but they are too small for individual gifts. Just thought I would give everyone a heads up. The cocoa does taste good. Also it is not eligible for returns.

review/summary: A delicious Christmas gift; perfect for care packages & distant friends
review/text: McSteven's cocoa makes an excellent Christmas gift. We send a holiday care package to our friends living overseas each year. Each package includes an assortment of gifts and treats, which we try to buy from local companies here in the Northwest (McSteven's is based in Vancouver, Washington).<br /><br />The cocoa is rich and creamy. While you can make your hot chocolate with just hot water, we recommend using hot milk instead for a more decadent cup.<br /><br />McSteven's Olde English Toffee Cocoa is packaged in 14-ounce tins, a nostalgic metal canister with a pry top plug. The size is 3.2"W x 8"H. Each order includes three tins.<br /><br />Each tin holds 11 servings. The ingredients are: sugar, nonfat dry milk, whey (milk), cocoa powder (Dutch Process), canola oil, corn syrup solids, natural and artificial flavors, guar gum and salt. According to the company, no hydrogenated oils are used, so your cocoa is transfat free, too.<br /><br />The back of the canister also includes a number of recipes.<br /><br />In summary, this is delicious cocoa. We purchased both McSteven's Olde English Toffee Cocoa and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPY7Y">McSteven's Jolly Blend Cocoa</a>. The price is reasonable and the charming packaging makes these cocoa blends an attractive Christmas gift, one that is easy to ship to distant friends.<br /><br />BTW: In addition to these cocoas, we also purchased and recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKUY78">Chocolove Premium Chocolate Bars, Raspberries in Dark Chocolate</a> as a Christmas gift.<br /><br />Last year, we bought truffle collections from Seattle Chocolates to send overseas. Each order -- Blackberry Cr&egrave;me Truffles, White Chocolate Orange Truffles and Pink Polka Dot Assorted Truffles - included three boxes of individually wrapped truffles. These chocolates are no longer available on Amazon but keep an eye out should they return.

review/summary: Dim Chocolate
review/text: I have an absolute passion for deep, dark hot chocolate. I want chocolate which tastes like *chocolate*, rich and flavorful, with a hint of a bite. You can savor chocolate like that.<br />What I have an aversion to is hot sugar. And, most hot mixes taste just like that; you might as well suck on a cube of sugar with a sprinkling of coca on top than drink a cup.<br />Regrettably, McSteven's Dark Chocolate European Coca Mix fell into the latter category. It had a bit more chocolate than, say, Nestles mini marshmallow or Swiss Miss Yodel, but all in all...sugar cube. Nicht goot.

review/summary: Still the best
review/text: The Orville Redenbacher brand has meant premium quality for decades, and today is no different.  This popping corn is designed for use in air poppers, but can be used with oil as well.  Of course, the advantage of an air popper is that the popped corn leaves the heating chamber and can't burn - unlike popped corn trapped in a microwave bag or in an oiled popper or stovepot.<br /><br />With Orville, you get consistently large popcorn that stands up to whatever toppings you prefer.  You won't do better with off-brands, and you don't have to deal with the continually shrinking sizes of microwave bags (which cause you to burn the first bag or two until you figure out what time setting you really need every time the size changes).  Even if Orville costs more than what you can get elsewhere, it's worth it.

review/summary: Overpriced, with less flavor than some brands
review/text: I've popped gallons of Orville Redenbacher popcorn both in oil and in my Presto PowerPop and it always comes up big and fluffy as expected with few unpopped kernels. One day, just for the heck of it I decided to buy a bag of Great Value (Walmart brand) popcorn and see if it could compare in the PowerPop. It took a little longer to pop, but after filling the PowerPop full and 2-3 minutes in the microwave I only had 6 unpopped kernels. What also struck me is the flavor was more like CORN! It makes me wonder if Orville is GMO and Great Value is not, and if genetic modification reduces the flavor. At any rate, I will definitely be looking at other brands, perhaps organic, etc. to bring back more of that old-time popcorn flavor.

review/summary: Best Popcorn Ever!
review/text: This is the best popping corn ever. It pops up light and fluffy, and when properly made, you have few kernels. The popcorn tastes great, and the jar packages it so it stays fresh and has a long shelf life.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way, the art of making fine popcorn has been lost, and everyone just pops the popcorn in the microwave. When you make microwave popcorn, you lose the ability to assure the freshness and healthiness of the popping oil. So, here is the way to make good old fashioned stove top popping corn.<br /><br />Get a large sauce pan and lid. Place two tablespoons of heart healthy oil. Let the oil warm up (medium high), and then pour in 1/3 cup of Orville Redenbacher popcorn kernels. Put the lid on and shake vigorously. In a few moments the popcorn will begin to pop. Once the popping slows down to a trickle pour the popped corn into a bowl. Salt to taste with buttery movie popcorn salt.<br /><br />On the oils to use . . . I like to use Olive Oil because of the health benefits, but olive oil smokes at a lower temperature, so making the popcorn is tricky in olive oil. Start by using corn oil. When you have gotten good with corn oil, then try using the more heart healthy olive oil.<br /><br />Assure you this will be the best popcorn ever, and you will never go back to the microwave.

review/summary: Healthy Chews
review/text: My dog loves to chew, doesn't yours? These rawhide dog chews are an all USA product. Why does that matter?<br />The Whole Dog Journal did an article about how many other rawhide dog chews are treated with an amazing list of chemicals when they are shipped to China or Mexico for processing. Some get so rotten looking they are bleached or dyed or sometimes painted with a whitening agent to cover this up.<br /><br />The Wholesome Hides are from US cattle and do not leave the country. They are rolled from a single piece of hide that also maintains its collagen. Cheaper rawhide chews can be made of multiple small pieces that are loosened as the dog chews and can become a choking hazard or are made from split hides creating such thin brittle pieces they can tear the gut.<br /><br />It's good to find something to make my dog happy that I can also feel good about.<br /><br />It would be nice if they were within the Prime program for shipping and if the middle size was offered here.

review/text: I love this little tree.  My husband got it for his birthday about 3 years ago, and it's traveled with us from Boston to California.  We do NOT have green thumbs, and the tree has had to struggle back from drought and drastic climate change and overpruning and inexpert attempts at wiring, and there were times I confess I thought I'd killed it for good, but each time it's magically brought back all its leaves and continued being one of the most beautiful green things I own.  The shape is lovely, and I remember it arrived packaged incredibly well.

review/summary: A Great Buy For Beginners!
review/text: I recently became interested in becoming a practitioner in the art of bonsai, so I went out and bought a book about indoor bonsai for beginners. After reading the book throughly, I decided to go with the Chinese Elm, since it looks great and can stand the hard tap water in the area where I live. The tree also is capable of withstanding most pests, with the exception of spider mites, but I got a humidifying tray to aide with that. I literally just received this tree and it is just great! It took approximately four days to arrive and only lost about fifteen leaves, which in my book, is just fine for four days without sun, only about of three leaves were yellowed. The coloring and branch placement are exceptional and it looks like this is the start of a great relationship. :)

review/summary: Great Trees Great Prices
review/text: I've been a Bonsai hobbist for more than 10 years.  I have personally visted the Brussel's Bonsai Nursery in Alabama.  IT's about 40 minutes away from Memphis Tn and well worth the drive.  I've purchased LOTS of trees from Brussel's (at the nursery, by mail and at bonsai shows) and have always been satisfied.  You get great trees at really resonable prices.  Pay particular attention to if the tree is rated for indoor or outdoors.  Outdoor bonsais that are brought indoors for more than a few days will die.  I love the Chinese Elm variety.  It has tiny vergated leaves just like the mamouth elm trees that used to blanket Chicago neighborhoods.  The Chinese Elm can be kept inside during the winter. but ALL bonsai's will do much better if you let them enjoy the summer weather outside.  If you fertilize them, they will grow profusely, thickening the trunk and developing more character and allow to enjoy your had at shaping your tree to what you define as Cool.  Dive in and Enjoy!

review/summary: A fine little tree
review/text: I received the tree three or four days after I ordered it.  It arrived in perfect shape, with plastic over the soil which was still damp!  There was no way it was going to be damaged in shipping, but it was SO well packed I was worried about hurting it while taking it out of the box.  It seemed perfectly healthy, all of the leaves being green, anyway.  Its bent form was not identical but equivalent to that shown in the picture, and with that I was pleased.<br /><br />Never having dealt with bonsai before, I approached my caretaking with some trepidation.  I read a couple of books (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065B9TA">101 Essential Tips- Harry Tomlinson</a>, for one), and another one picked at random from Amazon's wide selection.  The most important thing I got out of the books was the importance of watering.  The soil must be kept damp.  It seemed like water just flowed through the soil into the evaporation tray without any staying in the pot, but there was nothing I could do about that.  Still, I water it daily (as directed) and so far (two months), somewhat to my surprise it has thrived.<br /><br />In fact, although it is Fall, there is actually new growth--tiny little leaves popping out at the end of some branches!  I guess whatever watering I am doing is sufficient.  It will be interesting to see how it will survive the Winter.  It is an outdoor tree (and it is important to know when you are considering getting a bonsai plant whether it is indoor or outdoor) and requires the dormant period of cold and short days.  It should be watered as often as possible even then (obviously if the soil is solid ice that won't be possible).<br /><br />If it dies anytime from here on out, it is on me; the plant itself as delivered was healthy and happy. I do not hesitate giving the tree five stars, and would buy bonsai from Amazon again.

review/text: As the title says, this is my first bonsai (just received in the mail today). I'm sure somebody will be as confused as I was with this little guy about whether or not this is indoor (as amazon sells it as) or if it's outdoor (as the seller has it). After much research the general answer I found I was BOTH, you can keep it indoors year round and it will be a semi-evergreen tree or you can keep it outside. I am keeping mine as an indoor tree in which I have it set up with a 23 watt CFL bulb (about 100 watt regular bulb) at the 6400k spectrum range. This is the information that I found online so hopefully I can save somebody the hours that I spent into researching this. I will add to my review as time goes on if anybody cares.

This tree was just a chop job of trimming and there were a few scars on the trunk where wire had been left on too long and too tightly during the training process. I would invite others to think twice before buying this tree.

review/summary: Fast shipping, good price for mediocre tree
review/text: Pros:<br />-FAST delivery, I ordered this with the free shipping on a Monday morning and it arrived Wednesday afternoon of the same week<br />-The packaging was well designed as the tree experienced no physical signs of trauma (despite dents in the box)<br />-Already looks like a bonsai if you aren't familiar with them<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Lots of scaring<br />-Positions of branches will need work<br />-Poor grooming<br /><br />In summary, if you know nothing about bonsai but want to own one, this tree is perfect for you!  If, however, you have an eye for the art, you may be disappointed; you get what you pay for.

review/summary: Great little bonsai
review/text: EDIT: I am now getting Junk Mail from Brussel's, had a few catalogs come in that I didn't ask for. Buyer beware. (No minus of a star, just wanted to let people know you might be put on a mailing list)<br /><br />The bonsai I got is in great shape with only a few dead leaves from the shipping experience, it comes in a nice blue pot and has very sturdy roots. The only problem is that the instructions say it is an OUTDOOR bonsai, which I didn't realize it would be. No problem for me however, because the bonsai is doing fine in my home. It requires a drip tray and didn't come with one, and the instructions for care are very lacking. I would pick up a bonsai care guide along with this plant because if you are a beginner like me this doesn't come with adequate instructions for care.<br /><br />Overall I am happy and am looking forward to caring for this nice bonsai!

review/text: I bought this for my girlfriend after some squirrels destroyer her bonsai tree.  My biggest concern is what condition the tree would be in after shipping across the country.  The tree arrived in a well packaged box, and it appeared quite healthy.  2 months later, it is doing fine.  Just another example of how well things can be shipped these days.<br /><br />On the down side, having a bonsai tree has not helped my girlfriend attain any new "zen", so she is just as stressed out as before.  She should stick to drinking wine to relax.

review/summary: dying. I'll update any changes.
review/text: Hey, I've had this tree for about a month and at first all the leaves started to turn yellow, then they started to fall off.  It was BEAUTIFUL when it got here and then it immediately started dying.  There are still a few leaves which look alive, but all of the leaves are brittle and if you touch them they fall from the branch.  I think its dead, and I don't think its my fault.  I'm not a "green thumb" but I have plenty of plants, including a jade bonsai which i got from a friends cutting and grew all by myself (so I thought this one which was prepotted and pregrown would be no problem).  Although this is my first bonsai, its definitely not my first plant, and its not like I didn't go into this totally unprepared, I read all about it and followed all the directions.  Indoors.  It gets a whole days worth of moderate sun. I  water it enough to lightly soak the soil every day ten days.  The first time I did it, I watered it more than that, and I was afraid that's what hurt it (but its not like I watered it a LOT, the soil was just very damp - besides it has such a good drainage system I didn't think overwatering would be as much of a problem).  Anyways, I'm very disappointed.  Maybe it was a bit shocked from the travel but it should have recovered by now?  I'll update if I can nurse it back to health but winter is coming and I'm worried for its health and although I still treat it as if it is alive, I'm pretty sure its dead.

review/summary: Great little tree.
review/text: I can't believe what a great deal this was for this tree. Only $25 and it is probably around a 5-8 year old tree with a good size trunk and plenty of branches to prune/train. The only thing I need to determine is the nebari or surface roots because as of now they are non-existant but it should hopefully improve when I repot it in the spring. I would definately buy bonsai from Brussel's again.

review/text: My girlfriend and I were adjusting to the first months of a long distance relationship so I bought her a Bonsai.  Having something to care for and nurture can be very therapeutic exercise.  It arrived early and was expertly packed, it came in perfect shape with a beautiful pot and instructions for care.  She immediately dubbed it her "Love Tree" and I was immediately the greatest, most creative boyfriend in the world.  Some variations of Bonsai can live to be a few hundred years old if cared for correctly, we're a young couple but the thought of having our great, great, great grandkids having to take care of this miniature tree is amusing and fun.

review/summary: Pretty good, but not pest free.
review/text: The tree came very well packaged and in fair condition considering it had just been in a box for a few days. However, after further inspection, I discovered that it not only had sow bugs and a baby millipede in the soil, it also had a minor case of spider mites. Although I took care of this fairly easily with some soapy water and a spray bottle, I felt a little ripped off that I just bought a tree with that many pests crawling around. It took a little longer to get rid of the bugs in the soil, since i had to just grab and kill them when I saw them. However, the tree still fared well and is still going very nicely 5 months later. I would say it was definitely worth it even considering the bugs.

review/summary: Nice starter tree
review/text: I got interested in purchasing and caring for a bonsai after reading an article from my local bonsai society. The article pointed out that many beginners to bonsai fail to realize that these are primarily outdoor plants, requiring the same environmental conditions as their full sized counterparts. I had received a bonsai as a gift several years ago, a juniper, and, bringing it inside for the winter, I killed it. I have a nice outdoor garden, though, and, since urban gardeners don't command a lot of space, I decided that bonsai trees would be a great way for me to cultivate species that I would never otherwise have the room for.<br /><br />I purchased this bonsai Chinese Elm on a whim to be a companion plant to the first bonsai I ordered: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XR6IVK">A Full Japanese Juniper Bonsai Tree in an AUTHENTIC Japanese Stoneware Container</a>. I figured, for the price, which was only $19.99 plus a nominal shipping, I could start the bonsai hobby with two plants instead of one. Great!<br /><br />The Chinese Elm arrived first, so here are my comments:<br /><br />The tree arrived by USPS Priority Mail. It shipped from California on a Wednesday and arrived on my doorstep by Friday. The tree was listed by the seller has having shipped on Tuesday, however, so that set my expectation: I would recommend that the seller mark items as shipped when they are actually shipped rather than when they are processed.<br /><br />The tree was packed well, with Styrofoam peanuts protecting the branches and plastic wrap containing the pot and soil. The soil was still moist, and the tree had lost only about three leaves, so no significant defoliation at all. Again, great. I found it odd that the tree was packed in a horizontal box. The tree must have spent the last few days lying down, though it seems none the worse for wear.<br /><br />Upon unwrapping the base of the tree, I found a slug attached to one of the drainage holes on the pot. Ugg. The tree also appears to be newly transplanted. I noticed that you can still see where the soil has been pressed into the pot, and the tree is a bit loose in its soil, so not firmly rooted in. The tree is not wired into its pot.<br /><br />It's a nice overcast day at the beginning of June, and we're getting a gentle, steady rain, so I have placed the Chinese Elm bonsai into its place in my garden. It will be displayed on a nice brownstone slab that I rescued from a neighbor's lot. I hope it likes it there and gets some good strong root development. I plan to update this review later in the summer after the tree has had a chance to acclimate.

review/summary: Good start
review/text: Well, This was my first EVER bonsai tree, and I liked it. I was reading other reviews, and I red about bugs. This freeked  me out, but when I got mine , The first two days were good. I got a little aluminum pan to be my water catcher thing, and around the 3rd day, I noticed ants. So then I looked online for ways to get rid of them. I tried soaking the roots for 10 minuets (like 4 different times) I didnt buy anything, or look to hard around my house for anything, I just realized. the best thing to do was just cut the roots (since you need to anywyas for repotting). That got rid of them.<br />One thing that I wish i knew ahead of time was Pruning. They say give it one growing season before re-potting, But my pot was nothing but roots. It was overflowing with roots, hardly any soil. and I got it in the winter, So i cut the roots, Re-potted, right before spring, and Man did it do amazing.<br />The ant problem was gone, but then I noticed I had Aphids. Soo, I started researching that too. So what I ended up doing was just mixing some spices I had around my house. I found the most dryest-spiciest-most fine seasonings I had, mixed it with water, and sprayd the plant.<br />That got rid of them, and didnt harm the plant at all.<br /><br />I rate this a 4 out of 5 Because, It came to me in about 6 or so days, (from Cali to Ohio) which was fine with me, but the ammount of work I needed to put in.<br />Took to long figuring out how to get rid of the ants, and aphids.<br />They had ants and aphids in the first place. But Cant really blame them. Its a plant, no bigdeal, I cought them before they could really wreck the plant.<br />Just besure for when you prune the roots.<br /><br />I tried to get better soil, and re-cut the roots right before May 1st, and now its Dead, I think I cut tomany roots.<br />But the bug problem was long gone, so I know it wasnt that. I waterd it daily, It had sun. So my guess would be the root pruning.<br /><br />But hey, I learnd alot since then, Did even more research, So<br />I recomend this Tree to anyone, Just besure you check the roots, and look for Aphids (mine were white tiny bugs, died if you touched them because theyre so soft, and I just shook the tree, and some of them fell off. Thats how I knew I even had them)<br /><br />Pardon my spelling and or grammer.

review/text: Fastest shipping I've ever experienced.  In 36 hours I went from worried that it wouldn't make it in time for Mother's day, to worried that I would kill it in the two weeks before I presented it to my mom.  Very carefully packaged, not even Ace Ventura could have broken this pot.  Came with basic instructions.  It does grow very quickly though, in a matter of days this "tree" will look more like a shrub, so it does require routine maintenance.  Which is good if you really butcher it while you're teaching yourself to properly trim your bonsai, a few days and you can have another go.

review/text: This was given to me at Christmas.  It arrived packaged well and included a short instruction pamplet.  I was weary about placing it outside in the cold, but so far it has done well.  I do move it into my garage if it stays below freezing for several days.  Otherwise, I take some pinestraw and sort of "box it in" to provide some insulation.  The weather here has been crazy lately; 40 one day, 70 two days later, so my tree has been steadily putting on new leaves.  So far, no pests that I can see.  I think that this tree will be easy to maintain and will bring enjoyment for many years.

review/text: I was a bit anxious after reading so many reveiws about have some bonsai trees arrived dead or looking like charlie browns pitiful chirstmas twig. This was a pleasant surprise. It was exactly as promised, and arrived in a timely manner and in great shape. Beautiful. Have had it less than a day and already gotten compliments. Thanks.

review/summary: Great value for beginner bonsai
review/text: I recently purchased this bonsai for myself because learning this ancient art is something I have always been interested in. I have nothing but good things to say about the seller and this product. First, the shipping was very quick, and was easily one of the most well packaged items I have recieved to date. The soil was still moist upon arrival and the trees leave were still vibrant and green. The tree itselt is stunning! A near perfect representation of the product photo in size, and styling. I was also impressed with the quality of the bonsai pot. I expected cheap plastic, or a temporary pot, inwhich I would need to invest further in a proper bonsai pot, but the pot was a beautiful glazed pot, with proper irrigation holes in the bottom and a nice blue/green color. Overall I would recommend this to anyone on the fence about a bonsai purchase online. You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Gorgeous Tree. Better than pictures
review/text: I bought both this Elm, and a Juniper from 9Greenbox as my first 2 bonsai. The Juniper was a little underwhelming, but this tree is absolutely wonderful. It arrived in great condition, no missing leaves, with some really interesting branching patterns. Ths S bend in the trunk looks natural, and not forced. It came in a beautiful cream colored rectangle pot, with a brilliant green moss top layer. The shape and colors all compliment each other very well, providing a very serene looking, very calming little tree. Couldnt have asked for a better starter.

review/summary: Chinese Elm
review/text: This is one of 2 of my first bonsai and I couldnt b happier. My fiance' and lil girl got me this one as an early bday present, and its way better than I anticipated. The overall shape of the tree is great. Mine came in a "s" kinda shape, informal upright, and the foliage was and still is the dark green its supposed to be. Mine even has an awesome root system growing above ground. Im hoping with in a month or so i can start to train it in the "root-over-rock" style. It would be great to do that with it because of the way the roots are growing but even if not, its still a great tree. I give it a 5 because of the great quality the plant came in. The only problem to me was that it dont have the netting over the drainage holes and the packageing wasnt like my other. My other was packaged nice and sturdy so it wouldnt topple over or anything and this one was just put in the box and filled with enough foam peanuts to keep it from moving. Which suprisingly didnt mess up any of the leaves or branches. The box was handed to me laying on its side and didnt even say which side was up. I was kinda disappointed with the packaging from how great my P. afra was packaged just 2 days b4 I recieved this one. But this is a product review and not a packageing review. All in all, a very good buy. I would recomend this Chinese Elm to anyone wanting to start a new hobby or even as a gift. Im very happy with it.

review/text: My Bonsai was shipped the morning after I bought it and I received it a day later. It came perfectly packed, there was not even a single leaf or soil residue inside the box. The Bonsai looks EXACTLY like the picture, the only difference was the pot; mine was rectangular, although it is the same color as the one pictured. It has tiny leaves growing and it looks perfectly healthy. I'm really happy with this purchase, I will be buying again from this seller and I encourage you to buy from them as well.

It was in pristine condition.  The plant arrived earlier than I anticipated, which was great.  The soil was still moist.

review/text: I bought this about a month ago for my boyfriend's birthday.  I was a bit skeptical about ordering a living plant online, but this little Bonsai blew me away.<br /><br />The packaging was so secure and well contained -- I was truly impressed.  Also, the plant looks much better than the one in the picture. Within a couple of weeks, the plant was already sprouting a lot of visible new growths. At about a month in, it is thriving -- neither myself nor my boyfriend have any experience in bonsai.<br /><br />This plant just looks fabulous, straight out of the box, and it will continue to provide enjoyment without much hassle.

review/text: Plant showed up about a week after ordering and was covered in a white fungus or mold.. I don't know what to do about it and I don't want to put it near my other plants. I bought it from 9greenbox and I contacted them but am waiting to hear back from them.. The tree does not look like the photo at all and is in a pot that seems way too small for the tree. The tree seems rather weak looking in terms of health and beauty..  I was looking forward to it and was hoping I would get the brussels tree from brussels because the last bonsai I had bought was actually from them and was a great plant.. Do not buy from this seller if you are looking to get the brussels tree..

review/summary: Easy-to-Prepare Pad Thai that Tastes Great.
review/text: Annie Chun's Classic Pad Thai Meal Kit provides the basic ingredients (rice noodles and sauce) for stir-fried pad thai. You need to add vegetable oil, tofu, chicken or shrimp, eggs, bean sprouts,  green onions, and (not essential) lime, peanuts, and fresh cilantro from your own kitchen. Choose tofu for a vegetarian pad thai or combine with shrimp or chicken as you like. Of course, it would be less expensive to make pad thai from scratch. But the pre-packaged sauce is convenient, and this ranks high among the pad thais that I've tasted. The box says that preparation takes 10 minutes, but 20 minutes is more realistic. No MSG or preservatives. All natural ingredients.<br /><br />There are 2 sets of instructions on the box, which is confusing. On the side panel, there are instructions for boiling the noodles. Those are for people who want to eat the noodles with sauce only. The instructions for stir-fried pad thai "with all the trimmings" are on the back of the box. This recipe instructs you to soak the rice noodles in hot water for 10 minutes. It helps if the water is boiling hot, and you will probably need to soak them longer to get the noodles soft enough. The noodles will soften a little after they are added to the other ingredients, but not much. Apart from the problem of undercooked noodles, the recipe on the box works well and tastes great.<br /><br />Ingredients: Noodles: rice flour, water. Sauce: brown sugar, water, tamarind, soy sauce (water, wheat, soybeans, salt), onion and shallot puree, fish sauce (anchovy, salt, water), canola oil, tomato paste, rice vinegar, garlic, corn starch, lime juice concentrate, spices, onion powder. (Manufactured in a facility that uses peanuts.) Nutritional facts per serving (3 servings per box): 230 calories, 1g total fat, 780mg sodium, 53g carbohydrates, 9g sugars, 3g protein.

review/text: After trying the 6 "Meal Kits" contained in this item, I've concluded the following:<br /><br /> o The sauce is a tad "brackish" and doesn't leave me satisfied; I prefer a smoother, less salty taste<br /><br /> o The name "meal kit" is misleading, since one must (as others have noted) add the other 80% of what makes a true Pad Thai<br /><br /> o The noodles never seem fully cooked if you merely follow the directions -- rather surprising, since the noodles otherwise look the same as those I buy (for home-made Pad Thai) from the Asian Market<br /><br /> o Home-made Pad Thai is infinitely better, so find a good recipe, and you'll understand that Annie Chun isn't saving you much time (or money) after all<br /><br />Hope this helps a potential buyer.  We tried this item sight-unseen (it's not available at our local Whole Foods store), and kinda slogged through all six boxes over the course of a year.  Had we enjoyed them at all, they'd have disappeared quickly!

review/summary: So-So Thai Food
review/text: Prepared this dish with vegetables, tofu, egg and chicken, etc...trimmed with green onion and crushed peanuts. It was very meh - a perfectly functional dinner for two, but nothing spectacular. The sauce was very bland and it lacked that distinctive Thai kick provided by the sweet chili and fish sauce used in so many Thai recipes. Honestly, this tasted like it had been "watered down" to suit a presumed "American" palate. If you want a reasonably quick and easy packaged Asian meal, this is your one. Just don't expect it to taste like restaurant Thai food. I will be making my own pad thai sauce from scratch in the future.

review/summary: i buy this in bulk
review/text: i tried this after i spent 9 days in jamacia.<br /><br />i feel in love with the carribian jerk and this is the closest i have found in the states. of course, it depends on how you cook it, but if you start with this spice, you will finish with a winner either way.

review/summary: Makes a super easy jerk marinade
review/text: McCormick used to make a jerk marinade mix, which they sold in packets for a fast and flavorful alternative to more complex recipes.  They stopped making this a few years ago, replacing it with the PERFECT PINCH CARIBBEAN JERK SEASONING, found in the spice aisle of the super market (or here on Amazon, of course!).  The label on the jar suggests using this seasoning as a "rub" for chicken, pork, and other meats.  But it works even better as a marinade.  Here's the recipe:<br /><br />3 tbsp McCormick Caribbean Jerk Seasoning<br />3 tbsp salad oil<br />2 tbsp soy sauce<br />1 tbsp cider vinegar<br /><br />Combine ingredients in a plastic food storage bag and mix until well blended.  Add chicken or tuna (the absolute best!) and let marinate.  The longer you marinate your protein, the spicier the end result will be.  Grill the chicken or tuna, basting with remaining marinade.<br /><br />This really is a terrific product which makes great jerk marinade.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: A great change for those who love rice.
review/text: At a chinese food store I bought one of those rice cookers that looks like a silver spitoon with a grass funnel shaped basket on top.  This type of rice has a flavor and texture totally different when you steam it instead of boiling. And I find that using my new rice cooker there is a wonderful grain type flaver added. I soak the rice during the day (OR for an hour using boiling water)and then dump it into the grass basket.  I have a lid from one of my pans I plop onto the top.  Then just let it steam for about 20 minutes.  It sticks together without being overcooked.  I like rolling it into a bite size ball, dip it into my soup or sauce and then pop it into my mouth.<br />I LOVE IT and am glad to have finaly found a place to buy it.

review/summary: white rice
review/text: I generally only eat my white rice with milk and sugar.  This rice is very sweet and tastes good.  It should always be a pantry staple.  I like it.
