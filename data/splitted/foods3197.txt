review/summary: Unique and delicious
review/text: I am a person who doesn't like soda because it's too sweet.  I am also a big fan of pomegranates.  Consequently, I found this drink to be very delicious.  It is a bit sweet, mostly tart, and very refreshing.  It's really a melody of a lot of fruits, but the flavour is definitely pomegranate-ish.  Best of all, I can drink a lot of this without remorse, since it's way better for you than soda.

review/summary: Perfect light refreshment with pucker-power!
review/text: Izze Sparkling Pomegranite Soda is a mix of apple, grape, pineapple, lemon and pomegranite, and packs quite a tart and sweet punch! It's not a sugar-free beverage, but it is just enough to give you a little lift when you need a little something to get you through your day.<br /><br />Izze is more a juice drink than a soda, and it contains no caffeine or preservatives. Even though it is made from a recipe of blended fruits, it does have an outstanding pomegranite flavor -- very much like tasting the real fruit. It's the perfect beverage to bring with you to work or school and avoid the usual feast of chemicals available at the vending machines or fast food joints!

review/summary: Puts Standard Fruit-Flavored Sodas To Shame.
review/text: The Izze sodas/fruit juices are quite good. They're a bit more expensive but put the standard fruit sodas to shame. They are, after all, 70% fruit juice and shouldn't even be compared to conventional fruit-flavored sodas. I've now tried two, the first was Blackberry and the present is Pomegranate. Personally, I like the Blackberry a slight bit better but the Pomegranate is outstanding. It's tart. I like than. No sickly-sweet sodas for me! The taste is good and nowhere near the taste of pure pomegranate juice. That's okay. It's a nice refreshing drink with a little bite to it and no added sugar. This stuff is excellent. I think I have two more flavors to try.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Izze Sparkling Pomegranate Soda
review/text: Out of all the sparkling sodas that I have ever taste natural and not natural this has to be the most delicous of the bunch.  Everything about this soda is refreashing and you get a serving of fruit in each one, what more could you ask for.  This is my favorite flavor out of the flavors, it just has such a wonderful tart sweet flavor that leaves you feeling so wonderful and relaxed.

review/summary: Healthy Soda---Not an Oxymoron!
review/text: *****<br />This Izze Pomegranate Sparkling Soda isn't exactly a soda and isn't a really a juice---it's a healthy alternative drink that's a bit of a combination of the two. It comes in small cans (8.4 oz) and these bottles, which I much prefer.<br /><br />Some pomegranate juices are sour, but this one is tasty and sweeter than most...actually it tastes like real pomegranate pieces (arils) do---perfect! It is a sparkling juice, and sweetened just with real fruit. It contains sparkling water (30%) and a mixture of many different types of fruit juice concentrates for sweeteners---no sugar or sugar substitutes---yay!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Peter Pan Peanut Butter Rocks!
review/text: I'm glad to see that Amazon sells PETER PAN Peanut Butter in a 28 ounce size that can be ordered individually, especially since stores dont seem to carry PETER PAN in a 28 OZ or 40 OZ jar anymore and haven't in years for some reason, even though most people, including myself seem to prefer PETER PAN to both JIFF and SKIPPY, but perhaps it may be due to SKIPPY and JIFF outselling PETER PAN along with the fact that I haven't even seen a PETER PAN Peanut Butter commercial in years, plus you can only find PETER PAN peanut butter in a 16 ounce jar at the stores, unlike JIFF and SKIPPY which are also sold in both 28 OZ and 40 OZ jars at most grocery stores and even some retail stores like WAL-MART and TARGET.<br /><br />I also have a hard time comprehending why Amazon doesn't sell PETER PAN Peanut Butter in a 40 OZ jar size individually either since Amazon only sells them in a 3-pack, but I just love PETER PAN Peanut Butter along with the fact that PETER PAN was my favorite Walt Disney character and story during my childhood days.

review/summary: WEIRD!!
review/text: O.k., am I an idiot? I am thinking that maybe I made my cake the wrong way. The mousse was so thick and hard to work with that I couldn't even beat it with the beater. It got all stuck all over the beater wands, and then when I tried to spread it on my completely cooled cake, it ripped the cake apart because it was so thick. After I made it I started to think that maybe I should have only mixed one of the two bags of mousse mix included in the package with the milk and used the other bag in the actual cake (which I thought was very dry). I read the directions over and over and nowhere did it say to use one of the bags in the cake so who knows. I don't usually have problems in the kitchen though, so this one has me baffled!!

After looking around, I finally found these on amazon. I have already gifted these to friends/family a few times.<br />The minty flavor isn't overpowering like other mints in the US (eclipse mints etc). Its just a hint of flavor and very hard. Don't try to bit into it - you might break your teeth.<br />I will buy this product again for sure!

review/text: I bought these in NYC during the great blizzard of 12/26/10, to take with me on Amtrak, as my flight home was canceled.  I shared them with my seat mates, and we all thought they were delicious.  Different from regular Nature Valley granola bars, sort of a cross between a granola bar and a candy bar.  As I was packing up to get off the train (after a 9 hour trip!) I still had one pack of 2 bars left, and heard a woman with a french accent ask the snack bar operator if he had any chocolate left.  He said "no", and I handed her my last pack, told her it was as good as a chocolate bar, and left feeling good about sharing something so delicious.

review/summary: Great, But the Price Used to Be Much Better
review/text: I got addicted to these at the supermarket, as they're relatively healthy and fill my chocolate need. About a year or so ago, I signed up for these via Subscribe and Save, as I found the price wound up being cheaper than getting them at the supermarket -- that was when it was around $15 w/the discount. Now the price basically $25 w/the discount, and it's simply not worth it. Save your money, and buy them on sale at the supermarket for $2-$2.50/box. $4+/box is insane, especially when this is supposed to be a 'bulk' item that saves you money when buying in large quantities.

When I arrived back in Canada, I was so disappointed to find out that we had chocolate ones, here but not this exact kind.  They are still good, but not as good as these little bars full of goodness.  The other flavours are good, too, but nothing comes close to this flavour.

review/summary: Great product, but it is difficult to compare value
review/text: These bars are my favorite, and Amazon has three sources. World Wide Sales it turns out is the best value. In all cases, the bars come 2 to a foil pack. World Wide Solutions offering has 6 foil packs per box. Here is where the confusion begins. The box is labeled "12 bars" in the lower left corner and a cartoon bubble on the upper right in the ad says "6 pack". I learned after recieving the order that "12 bars" means 6 servings since I consume the entire foil pack of two thin bars. Furthermore, "6 pack" means 6 boxes each containing 6 foil packs for a total of 36 servings for $28.05. Ordering a quantity of 1 yields 6 boxs, each containing 6 foil packs for $28.05 plus shipping.<br /><br />Cosmetic Solutions sells 9 servings (foil packs) for $14 and Amazon sells 30 servings (foil packs) for $30.

review/text: These bars taste fine, and the ingredients are okay too.  However, they are VERY crumbly which makes it extremely difficult to eat on the go without getting chocolaty crumbs all over the place.  The second you open it, crumbs fall.  If you want a quick snack at a "designated" eating area or something for an outdoor excursion, these may be fine.  If you have a habit of eating in your car or at your desk you may want which is less messy, or a large napkin to eat over.

Great for emergency snack to at 190 calories for 2 bars(2bars in one envelope).<br /><br />These bars taste great as most of the reviews agree.<br /><br />Great taste. I love chocolate but these are not overly chocolate flavored.<br /><br />GREAT VALUE: 6 Boxes for $16.5 with subscribe and save. Each box has 6 packets with 2 bars. So, 6 boxes of 6 packets per box = 36 packets = 46cents per pack of 2 bars. Delivered to your door!<br /><br />Basic Nutrition (1 packet of 2 bars): Total fat 8 of 42 grams. Zero cholesterol. 12 of 42grams are sugar. 140mg sodium.  Protein 4 of 42grams. Dietary fiber 3 of 42grams. Protein 4 of 42grams. These won't hurt you and they do not replace a good well balanced meal.<br /><br />Crunchy: These are a messy to eat. When you take a bar out of the packets, crumbs fall out. I solved this by pulling both bars out of the packet over a sink or trash can. Shake loose all the crumbs then put them back in the packet. Problem solved.<br /><br />For those that think these are too crunchy. Try: break off a piece and leave it in your mouth less than one minute then chew. I do this and it works great!<br /><br />I have had these for about a month now and I have just ordered the variety pack and the cinnamon flavor pack from amazon.<br /><br />Enjoy, I do.

review/summary: Tasty if it is not Stale
review/text: When I originally ordered these bars I thought I was ordering a different product.  I have had Nature Valley before and never really cared for it.  I found the bars to be exceptionally stale and dull.<br /><br />When the product arrived I decided to give it another chance.  It was the Oats 'n Dark Chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised with what I found.  The bars were not rock hard like the ones I had before.  The product also had a nice light taste to it.  It comes with two bars per packaging so you will have six in each box.  I found that I could eat one, set the other down for a bit, and then finish it later.  I realized that all the bars I had previously were stale.  These bars from Amazon were fresh and new.<br /><br />I am having these bars in conjunction with a slimfast, and working out.  This has allowed me to lose 14 pounds so far.<br /><br />I would recommend these bars to people who can eat bars that have light flavor and like oats.  I am definitely happy with them

review/text: I was traveling last week and happened to drop in a convenience store that had these.  Had never seen them before, so I grabbed a few.  Glad I did, because they're delicious!!<br /><br />The best way I can describe them is like an oatmeal cookie with dark chocolate chips.  Same crunchy texture as the other Nature Valley granola bars.<br /><br />Have looked for them in my local store and can't find them.  Glad to see them here and plan to place an order very soon.  This is possible the best granola bar I've ever had!

review/summary: DISGUSTING
review/text: These are probably the worst of the product flavor line. I would suggest any other ones besides this one. Though I am not necessarily a proponent for overly sweet treats, these have a very strange flavor to compensate for the "less" sugar added. Though, if you research these, you find that they are full of bad things and that there are much healthier, better tasting options available (Kashi products, etc.). Though if you are loyal to Nature Valley, I suggest the Apple Crisp flavor instead.<br /><br />Don't eat these!

review/summary: Tastes like Cocoa Pebbles in a bar form.
review/text: I had tried these a long time ago when I purchased them in the store. The ones I purchased online didn't taste the same to me. These taste more like a granola bar form of Cocoa Pebbles. I don't know if they changed the original formula or what, but I did not like the flavor of these at all. They do have a nice crunch to them, but I'd rather of ordered the plain flavor. I did not like the cocoa flavor in these at all. I dislike them to the point I won't eat them and you can't return grocery items, so I'd recommend trying a box at the store before buying in bulk.

review/text: Seriously, this is a very good granola bar--taste, texture, size, etc. I would only suggest that the crumbs be retrained at the factory so that they can restrain themselves from raining down within the package, from the package to the plate, from the plate to the lips, but rather dive happily down upon my taste buds, which, after all, belong to the person who purchased the entire bar for that purpose.

review/text: This dispenser is exactly what you think it is and should be. My girlfriend always wanted one of the soy sauce dispensers they use in restaurants so as a surprise gift i searched for one and found this, the EXACT same dispenser they use one of our local restaurants. If that is the kind of dispenser you had in mind then this is the product for you. However, I would like to note that a month or two after buying this I saw the same dispenser in a supermarket for $2-$3 so I would recommend looking at your local stores if your only buying one of these and not in bulk. All in all though I am satisfied with this product.

review/summary: Good things come in small bottles!
review/text: I have been a Kikkoman soy sauce fan since living in Taiwan. It is the soy sauce of choice even in the pop-up night restaurants that would not pass a U.S. sanitation rating but produce scrumptious food.The small bottles require filling frequently, even here at home in the USA. But even with the large bottles we never refrigerated it. Maybe some little loss from evaporation but no problem. I don't notice any taste loss as some say. The 5 ounce bottles are just right for the table, flow smoothly without dripping, and are very stable when bumped. I'm glad I bought two!<br />Not to leave out the fact that the Kikkoman dispensers evoke fond and tasty memories.

review/summary: Misled
review/text: I was extremely happy to see that the sellers package was sent quickly and came the 2nd day of the estimated delivery interval they provided. I was unhappy with the product itself. The product was shipped with 30 .625 oz Tic Tac boxes and 18 .5 oz packs. It's not that big of a deal to me, because I still got 48 packs of Tic Tacs which I love. I wasn't aware that the half oz packs were still made so I assume they have been sitting in the warehouse for a while, but it makes a difference in the amount of Tic Tacs you get. Replacing 18 of the .625 oz with the half oz reduces the amount of Tic Tacs by about 3 .625 ounces which is upsetting. You'll get your Tic Tacs but I was cheated out of a few more precious boxes.

review/summary: the best beef jerky I've ever had
review/text: I'm a salty-snack fiend. I've always liked the dry, salty strips of jerky. I'm a little odd in my tastes in that I like stuff typically dry and crunchy, so sometimes I'll even leave a bag of jerky open and leave it in my glovebox for weeks to get it just right. I am not a big fan of marinated jerky - it's usually just slimy, and you nearly rip your head off biting a piece from it and then your jaw is sore for hours from all the chewing to get the gristle-filled lube-fest masticated enough to swallow safely.<br /><br />During a road trip, I stopped at a gas station and picked up some staples. I knew from experience that the other brands available at this pitstop were jerky's I was not fond of, and so I gave this one a go.<br /><br />This stuff practically melts in your mouth. Marinated, but not greasy. Easy to chew, and no noticable gristle or fat globules. It's not the type of jerky I would have normally gone for, but I'm so glad I did. On the way back from my road trip, I stopped at the same gas station and bought all the packets they had.<br /><br />Beef jerky has gotten so expensive over the years, you'd think they were marinating it in super-unleaded gasoline. This is one bag of beef jerky that you will not think is over-priced once you try it. If jerky were served at gourmet restaurants, this would be the brand to serve. My hat is off to Golden Island Cuisine for re-inventing the ancient art of drying meat to preserve it and making it taste good without pumping it full of MSG and formaldehyde.

review/text: Years ago I worked at the company here in California that makes this product. I really loved the flavors of jerky and would always buy the defect bags (misprints, etc.) from the outlet and give them out to friends and they loved the flavors too. The owners of this company have great relationships with their employees and vendors and were extremely picky about the ingredients they used to make their products.

review/summary: Different, yet fantastic
review/text: I'll keep this short... this is very different from most brands of jerky, but it's actually quite excellent. It's heavily marinated, but not slimy, and the flavor is sublime. It actually tastes more like high-quality chinese food than standard issue truck-stop jerky, and that seems to be what it's aiming for. It's probably not for everyone, but i'm a full-on convert! I plan to try all their other flavors as soon as I get the chance.<br /><br />To the reviewer who had a freakout about all the so-called chemicals... well, there's nothing in here that's not in most commercial brands of jerky (sodium nitrate, etc), and it's made in california, not "some country where they don't regulate chemical additives" as you'd have us believe.<br /><br />Give it a shot if you're an open-minded jerky fan!

review/summary: Strange Texture, OK flavor
review/text: I was very exited to try this flavor, but was a bit disappointed with the experience.  First was the texture; it was a bit off.  Granted, anything cured in sugar is gonna be a bit sticky, but the meat had this "unnaturally" soft texture to it as well(maybe to much preservative and/or texture enhancer).  The flavor was ok, kinda like panda express Orange Chicken.  I was definitely sweet, but beyond that the flavor was bit muddy. Both me and my GF came to the same consensus, which that in itself is a feat.  I definitely like the direction Golden island is taking with their jerky products, and loved their BBQ pork jerky.  But this needs a bit more refining.

review/summary: Simply the best (almost)
review/text: I have tried every piece of chocolate sweetened with Stevia known to humankind. I was on a quest to find the best. This milk chocolate gives you 100% of the pleasure without the sugar and without nasty sugar substitutes like Maltitol. The only problem with this guilt free chocolate is stopping before you have devoured an entire bar and start in on second. It is expensive but if you have a sweet tooth for chocolate and value your health, it's a small premium to pay. This milk chocolate is highly recommended. I would give this chocolate six stars if I could.... and the customer service is GREAT!<br /><br />UPDATE: I realized these bars are NOT sweetened with just stevia. I looked at the label and wondered what in the world is erythritol... A little work on google gave me my answer. Erythritol is Maltitol-lite. Needless to say I am disappointed and changed my five star rating to four. For me Erythritol is about 50% better than Maltitol with regard to digestive issues. So I can eat more of this chocolate than I could Maltitol sweetened chocolate but eating more than a few bites is not good for me. Your personal mileage will vary :-)) My quest to find the best stevia sweetened chocolate bar is not over.

review/summary: Beware...this stuff is OVER RATED!!!
review/text: I got this because of the reviews but let me just say that after having my first bag...this stuff is definitely overrated.<br /><br />I'm going to compare this with the Orville Redenbacher (OR) light/98% fat free kettle popcorn that I usually get. This pops great and has very few unpopped kernels, so in that aspect they're about even. But the taste is way different. The Jolly Time doesn't taste as good and it is way too salty for kettle corn flavor. It's like they took normal salted butter corn and sprinkled some splenda into it. Half way through, I was on salt overload. Texture wise, the Jolly Time is not as fluffly either. So there is less fluffy white and more hard bits.<br /><br />I'm sure if you have never eaten microwave popcorn before, then this would be quite acceptable. But in comparison to other brands, it lacks. This was definitely a disappointing purchase that I will have to slowly eat...for many many many months. Since there is a plethera of selection out there, I doubt I would buy Jolly Time again.<br /><br />Also, it took Amazon 10 days from date of purchase to get it to my door. What is up with that?<br /><br />I think this product deserves 3 stars but I'm going to give it 2 because of the slow shipping and because the average rating should come down a bit. 4.5 stars is too misleading.

review/text: I bought this first because it was so much healthier (less sugar, calories, etc) than my normal grocery store's other kettle corn brand. I keep buying it because it is probably the most delicious popcorn I've ever had. It's very sweet but not overdone. The popcorn pieces themselves seem to be larger than most other brands I've seen (kettle corn or otherwise) and this makes the small package surprisingly filling. There were times when a bag of popcorn substituted for a rushed meal and I felt just as full.<br /><br />Other reviewers state that they like Orville Redenbacher's kettle corn better, but I bought their smart-pop option and for me Jolly Pop wins hands down. The Redenbacher felt like a chore to eat because I felt compelled to use up the box before buying something else.

review/text: I really like this popcorn and go through it so fast, although Orville Redibacker's smartpop version is better. If you're looking for the tradional kettle corn however, don't order it. It's not as sweet and does not have all that oil that makes the true kettle corn flavor so it may not be what you're looking for.

review/summary: THE best kettle corn!
review/text: I am bit of a popcorn junkie and this is, hands down, the best kettle corn (health or otherwise) I have tasted.  It's the perfect blend of sweet and salty and there are no packaging gimmicks here (while the pop-up bowl is a nice idea, in execution it's rather messy).  This popcorn is not greasy at all and still jam-packed with flavor.  Try this for a great, satisfying snack that will satisfy both your cravings for salty snacks and your sweet tooth in one perfect package!  It has never let me down.

It is very good popcorn and I was glad that I could find it for the stores no longer handle this popcorn.  I have ordered from amazon.com before and have always been more than happy about the way they handle their orders.

review/summary: Lost treasure of MAYPO!!!
review/text: I can relate to EVERYONE here that commented on this product except the bugs in box person.  Sorry to hear that! I got the shipment two days ahead of expected delivery estimates.  My entire family [From my GrandMother on down to my own children] grew up on this and it is the best instant hot cereal on planet Earth!  I think this cereal is either being discontinued or going to another part of the country.  Either way I hope and pray that does not happen.  I live in the north Bronx area of NYC and I had to order this from Amazon.com because I couldn't find it in Pathmark, Target, Big K, Walmart, Sam's, Super Stop N Shop, Met's Food,Keyfood, The Finefare two blocks down from me, The Hispanic  stores [everywhere] don't carry it, BJ's and Costco do not have it either.  I was looking for this like a crackhead speedwalking with a couch on his/her back in the winter would after selling a $10 DVD player for a fix. I was like Maypo, Maypo, I gotta get my Maypo! I had a family relative go back down to the south Bronx and get two boxes from a store there that still carries it. Also I found one Stop N Shop in New Jersey that carries it. [That's why I chose Amazon!] Even though it is cheaper to get it from That store.  I will keep Amazon in mind if it should vanish completely.  Again, Amazon RULES!!! Oh and I do not work for Amazon.com or the makers of MAYPO either for all the haters out there. I just love this stuff :)

review/summary: Hard to get
review/text: What a deal, Some walmart stores sell it. But I know if I see it, I buy the whole shelf out. But with the price of gas and your Day wasted in pushy stores and traffic. This is a steal. I been eating Maypo for over 50 years when I can find it. I really love it with fresh blueberries, or slightly cooked apples in it. Just like the old 1955 commercial on youtube, it's a 1000 times better than oatmeal, still to. It doesn't overcook and slime and glue up like Oatmeal. I like to make it a little more solid with the blueberries mixed in, but don't get me wrong, it doesn't turn to glue like real oatmeal. Then I add some Wheat Germ on top and make a puddle of 2% milk in the corner of my bowl to grab a little of each with my spoon. Pure healthy heaven. And it's not as hard to mix as it sounds. Sides Maypo is so instant I never measured, just sprinkle on some more in the pot till I get it thick enough if I'm off.<br /> I just can't understand why all the stores don't carry such a fine healthy product. I think it all has to do with the BP slogan.

review/summary: Maypo Instant Maple Oatmeal
review/text: purchased for alternative cooked cereal for elderly mom.  Now, also for myself with pending multiple uppper teeth extractions (ready for the fake chompers here). so, made it tonight to see whats up.  It was lightly maple flavored and very easy, quick to cook.  2c water to 1c Maypo done in 1 min. i added some maple syrup to enhance.  quite good and now comfortable in knowing i will have another food to enjoy by the end of the month.  once again i have a Majic Bullet which i use to be creative with cooked cereal to make it easier to add more difficult to chew foods ie: sausage patties, smoked sausage or even smuckers fruit spreads like blueberry or elderberry.  i'm REALLY glad i purchased it.

review/summary: The best hot breakfast cereal ever!
review/text: If you don't know about Maypo, then you're in for a real treat.  I grew up in mid-state New York with this cereal, and it's always been available in select grocery stores in my current area (Chicago) until recently.  The last remaining store removed it from their shelves with no explanation.  I gave them a piece of my mind, then started hunting on-line.  I hit the jackpot here on Amazon.  I was a little apprehensive about buying 12 boxes all at once, but my fears have proven groundless.  I like seeing a row of boxes in the cupboard.  Gives me a warm sense of security.  If you haven't tried Maypo, I recommend you have a go.  It's more than just "maple flavored oatmeal".  It has a very distinct flavor and texture.  Once you try it, you'll be hooked.  I guarantee.

review/text: The blueberry is very tasty but watch out when you open a bottle. We have now had 3 bottles that were bad. Usually when you open a bottle it smells nice, on those 3 occasions (in 3 different orders)the juice smelled sour, kind of vinegary, and there was a large odd clump in the bottle. We, of course, threw them out and I am trying to contact the company and let them know about this because we really enjoy the product when it's not spoiled. We have not encountered this problem with any other flavor.

review/summary: Better than Coffee, still gets expensive though
review/text: This is definitely a better price than buying red bulls at the gas stations, much better price.  I've been off of coffee for a few months now and traded my coffee addiction for red bull, maybe not the best trade but hey I'm no longer drinking coffee so I need to get my energy from somewhere.  So, the price is better but I found that drinking one or two of these day starts to add up over time.  My friend makes her own energy drinks which I thought was a pretty cool idea, using something called an Energy Stack, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0095D28JE">Energy Booster Stack - 90 Day Servings!</a>.  I'll give credit to her because for the price and amount of time it lasts, it's actually even cheaper than coffee.  If you don't mind mixing your own energy drinks, try getting some crystal light mix (if you're looking for the no-calorie thing) and then shaking it up in a water bottle.  Tastes pretty good, for the price tastes REALLY good!
