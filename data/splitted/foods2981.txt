review/summary: Hard to find but worth it
review/text: I see K-cups everywhere but not these. Found them once a while ago and haven't been able to replenish till now. I love these because although i am a coffee fiend (they did a blood test a while ago and found 90% coffee) I want to have these when I only need one cup and really don't want to be anything more than semi-concious. They are great for people who get the shakes from coffee also. I prefer really brewed pots of coffee but these are a great substitute when I only have time for a cup and really need to get back to sleep in a couple of hours. Great taste, expensive like all K cups but not bad if you only drink a couple of cups. Well worth keeping on hand.

review/text: Got for my fiance and she loves the taste, and the half calf is much easier for her to handle than a full caff, and it doesn't make her fall back to sleep like the decaf does.<br /><br />Before switching to half caff she was drinking Dark Magic, so if you want so switch to half caff from that, this might be a good one to try.

review/summary: Tastes good and the caffeine content serves a purpose...
review/text: I've been drinking this coffee for a few months now and it's not my first choice in terms of taste but it still tastes good and it's helped lower my caffeine intake which is what I am mainly concerned with.  I switched to this coffee after I found out I was pregnant and was told to have no more than 200mg of caffeine a day.  I emailed the company directly at the time and was told that "The relative caffeine content in a 6oz brewed cup of Half Caff is 48-53mg" so it met my needs perfectly! I would recommend this product if you're not looking to give up coffee altogether but still want to reduce your intake.

review/summary: Great Buy and the Price is Right!
review/text: we've been devout Folgers coffee drinkers for over 35 years and never thought we'd switch brands. after my husband had a bout of heart problems, he was told to go to decaf coffee or stop drinking it, which wasn't an option. we started buying the Folgers half caff and he cut back to 2 cups a day. when i bought the keurig coffee maker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System</a> i switched to the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I29E">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend, 24-Count K-Cup for Keurig Brewers</a> (love it) and bought the ekobrew refillable k-cup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064A7SRS">Ekobrew Cup,Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers 2-Pack - BROWN $ GREEN</a> for him and his Folgers half-caff.<br /><br />on a whim, i decided to buy a small box of the Green Mountain half-caff k cups for him to try. i was very nervous about it because he's such a die-hard Folgers kind of guy. since i don't care for decaff coffee i didn't want to have to drink it if he didn't like it. he took a couple big drinks of the coffee and i finally asked him how he liked it. he said he liked it a lot, and thought it was much better than the Folgers half-caff, it seemed to have a lot more flavor. phew!<br /><br />in fairness to Folgers half-caff ground coffee, the reason he may think the Green Mountain half-caff has more flavor could be because of how much of the Folgers he used to make a cup. with these refillable k-cups it doesn't seem to be an exact science, so one cup could be a bit stronger or weaker than the next. i think this is what he was saying. because the Green Mountain k-cups are accurately pre-measured, you get the same taste in every cup.<br /><br />the bottom line is, he loves the Green Mountain half-caff coffee, and we will definitely be buying more of it. i asked him if he wanted to try the Folgers half-caff keurig coffee and he said, "ummm, i don't know". for a hard-core coffee drinker to be ok with that kind of change says a lot about the GM half-caff coffee. as least it speaks to me of how great this coffee is.

review/text: I have a sensitive stomach and can't take those fire-blasted, carbonized roastings that a lot of coffee has been subjected to, so when I saw a medium roast, I wondered if it would be a true, flavorful medium roast or charred beans with a toasted outside.  I also am trying to cut back on caffeine.  So it seems that this coffee is tailor made for me!<br /><br />I have a cup of this every morning and I love it!  Great flavor, not much acid, clean aftertaste and enough of a jolt to get going without so much caffeine I get the jitters.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering this in the 50-pack boxes!

While in the brewing process, the aroma fills the air leading a person to anticipate the reward at the end of the brewing cycle.  If a person does not want the caffeine, this is the coffee for them.

review/text: I am not allowed to have too much caffeine as it sets my heart arrythmias off . However, no matter what decaf I tried I hated the taste. I have been using this for a month now, and not only is it fantastic tasting, there are no jitters or no caffeine effects like with pure coffee. This tastes so delicious and I can have several cups in the morning. Also Amazons price cannot be beat.

Upon opening, instead of receiving the usual, expected k- cups in wrapped boxes of 2 or 3 containing the individual k-cups, there were 50 individual servings thrown in the box. I counted them, so I did receive the amount ordered. But these cups look like they were discarded samples, all of them wrinkled, twisted, some with top punctured. Would you drink any of these? Highly disappointed, will not do further business with this vendor again. Time to order direct from Keurig.

Since the sticks where too wide to use as a skewer for shrimp I had to cut them down to size.  But that doesn't warrant a star less rating.  Just a little FYI if you plan on using these for skewers.  I also used these sticks in my mixed drink pitcher and it added a nice flavor and decorative touch.

review/text: Purchased four types of nuts from Bergin simultaneously to make large batch of trail mix for several of my brothers who frequently hike/mountain bike with a group. I do the easy work by making their trail mix; they do the hard work - the hiking and biking!<br /><br />First time purchase of these Bergin cashews, filberts (hazelnuts) and pecans; second attempt at their almonds. (First purchase of Bergin almonds was horrible; stale, sticky, gummy & chewy even though the 'flavor' seemed ok. They were just terrible. But that was months ago so I thought I give it another try).<br /><br />So far, the filberts, almonds (this time around) and the pecans are terrifically yummy. It is the cashews this time that are useless. Waste of money. All packages were sealed by folded over cellophane bags (like those cheap, holiday treat bags) and closed with an adhesive label listing nutritional values. Could not determine reason for stale cashews, but then again, I couldn't determine reason for stale almonds months ago either.<br /><br />So, some good; some not so good. Unsure if I'd purchase from this company again, even if on sale. Guess it is the luck of the draw.

review/text: Hazelnuts were one of the foundational foods of paleolithic and neolithic communities in western Eurasia, from the British isles to Turkey and the Caucasus. There are hazelnut shell mounds, comparable to the sea-shell mounds of Mayan and other New World cultures, still being discovered in Europe and Turkey and being excavated. Their bulk testifies to the nutritional importance of hazelnuts in prehistoric cultures. One such mound on the Isle of Man has been dated as 9000 years old; other mounds are mentioned in the wikipedia article devoted to hazelnuts.<br /><br />Hazelnuts and filberts are not precisely synonymous, though most of the nuts grown in Oregon and Washington are hybrids or cultivars of the two. Genuine hazelnuts from Turkey and Italy are far more flavorful than the Oregon 'filbazelnuts', but the time-lag between the nut grove in Anatolia and the supermarket in your neighborhood may impact the quality and freshness of imported hazels. The Bergin Company, with headquarters in Minnesota, packages Turkish hazelnuts but labels them filberts. Go figure!<br /><br />There seems to be a surge in popularity of hazelnuts in the USA and Canada these days, with Italian gelato/ice cream becoming a standard flavor. Hazelnuts blend well with chocolate, both in ice cream and in candy. The whole nuts can be eaten raw or roasted, and their nutritional value is high. Hazelnut-milk is a very tasty substitute for cow's milk, with a far more agreeable flavor than soya-milk. On the other hand, hazelnut-flavored coffee is (to my tastebuds) an abomination. Hazelnut oil is wonderful in salad dressings, but expensive; it should never be used for cooking, especially not for frying.<br /><br />No, I don't own a hazelnut grove, nor am I connected in any way to hazelnut marketing. I just like the things a lot, and hope to see high-quality hazels more widely available in markets everywhere.

review/summary: These do not taste like the normal hazelnuts I am used to
review/text: I wish I could purchase normal salted and roasted hazelnuts (filberts).  But I could not find any in market, so I bought these (raw).  These just did not taste right as another 3-star poster mentioned.  I found these nuts fresh, good looking, but tasteless.  Had none of the flavor of the hazelnuts that I am used to.  Maybe it is because these are raw, but I tried to roast them, but to no avail, they still do not taste that good.  I would normally rate these 2 stars, but maybe I am wrong about the taste of raw hazelnuts so I also gave them 3 stars, being generous.<br /><br />If there is a huge difference in taste between roasted and raw hazelnuts (or brands), please ignore this review.  But I eat some nuts raw (almonds), and do not find that big of a difference.  And again, I did roast these with no change in taste.<br /><br />I will not purchase these again.

review/text: It stinks, it's sticky-gooey-awful, and my cat loves it!<br /><br />My vet recommended "baby food" for my cat when he was having trouble digesting his normal fare.  I tried several varieties but Gerber Beef & Gravy was the clear winner.  My cat likes it so much that he insists on a jar of it to start each day.<br /><br />More expensive than "cat food", it beats the heck out of having to deal with kitty vomit!  Since Gerber doesn't vitaminize its foods for cats, I add 50-100mg of Taurine to every plate.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are the best!

review/summary: You Ladies Don't Get It
review/text: Come on now, how much of this stuff actually DOES taste and smell good to adults.  The last time I bought it at Safeway, it tasted and smelled exactly the same--it's not Amazon's fault that grown-ups would rather eat pot roast with potatoes and gravy on the side.  So, if you don't like it, fire up the blender, and whizz up your unseasoned hunk of meat (which is why it smells so intolerable to our tastes and smells,btw) into a goopy smelly jelly (very much like the jar you're commenting on here). Walk through the market trying to convince your other kids to keep their hands inside the basket everyone's riding in, you stand in line at the end of the day with your feet killing you in those do-me heels guarding the gum and chocolate bars from the other day-care escapees (now busily reaching OUTside the basket for the gum and chocolate), and then embarassingly survive (you hope) the wet (or otherwise and getting smelly) diaper aroma.  Now, pay more for it than at Amazon,lug it all home while balancing tons of paper towels on your head (vs. waiting for the nice-looking UPS guy to set it inside the door where all you have to do is open it and put it on the shelf.)<br /><br />I like shopping in the quiet of my cleaned up kitchen after everyone's gone to bed, paying less for it (with a Prime Membership), and just putting it away when it arrives two days later.  I think that's what we're supposed to be rating and commenting on.  This works for me and rates five stars.

The walnuts, almonds and pistachios seem to have been affected in the last three months. Previously I have been totally satisfied with the Sun Ridge products.

review/text: I have been feeding Fromm Four Star Beef Frittata for the last month to my bichons and chihuahua.<br />The ingredients are healthful, no byproducts, grains or artificial anything. It's a family run company with its own production mill and has never had a recall, which is reassuring in today's day and age with all the recalls and sick pets!<br /><br />The kibble size is quite small, which is great for my 4 pound Chihuahua.  The other dogs don't seem to mind the kibble size at all.<br /><br />Coats are looking beautiful. I have one super sensitive bichon whose skin has stayed in good shape on this food, thankfully.  She gets yeast infections on her skin (ears, toes, face/muzzle) that can make her quite miserable.  Fromm has kept her in great shape!<br /><br />Back yard clean-up is good.  Initially when I switched the girls to Fromm, they had a little gas but once acclimated have not been gassy at all.<br /><br />Great food!  Transitioning/rotating to the Game Bird recipe now and will report on that too!

review/summary: The best quality grain-free dog food available!
review/text: I have been feeding my Puggle and Pug Fromm grain-free dog food for three months and it has really improved their coats.  Shedding has dramatically decreased to that of a 'normal' dog. (Pugs are notorious shedders.)  Their coats are now so shiny and soft!  I don't get a big cloud of dog hair from petting them anymore.  I haven't had to use the Furminator in . . . 6 weeks, and I may not need it anymore at all.  Their coats are beautifull and glossy and hardly shed now.  Before Fromm, there was always a ton of hair on my dark leather sofa and I just realized that there is hardly a hair on it now!  Wow!<br />My dogs LOVE Fromm and gobble it down.  We only feed our dogs Fromm dry food and use it for training treats -- they love it that much. (Okay, we also give our dogs natural chews like Bully Sticks, Pizzle Sticks, and dried cow esophagus, but they are all natural, too.  No grains, no sugar, no coloring.)<br />I like that it has a natural ingredient in it that reduces feces odor --- and it REALLY works!  If they get an 'outside' treat (all we feed them is Fromm, and use it for treats) I can always tell by the horrible (regular/bad) smell of their feces the next day.  When they don't get any unathorized treats, the smell is greatly reduced.<br />Also, Fromm doesn't have any fillers, it's a 'rich' dog food, in that you probably won't need to feed your dog the same amount that you were feeding them if you were using a dog food filled with corn and other fillers.  The good thing about that is that you get LESS poop.  (And that's always a good thing!)  My dogs generally poop 2-3 times a day and it is well formed and not overly malodorous.<br />Go slow in transitioning your dog over from regular (corny) dry food, because Fromm is a very rich diet.  Check the back of the bag for how much you should feed your dog and also calculate in treats or you will wind up with weight gain.<br />Fromm has never had a dog food recall.  That's awesome!  They are very careful about their ingredients.<br />I truly believe that spending my money wisely on such a high quality, grain-free dog food like Fromm Beef Frittata will provide my dogs with a long healthy life and that they will be less likely to have diseases or cancer.  I can already see a great difference in their coats.<br />I don't feed my family 'Frankenfoods' like corn syrup, sugar, 'flavorings', by-products and grains, and I wouldn't feed my dogs any of that either.

review/text: If you like the taste of cocoa powder you'll love these.  As much as I love chocolate I could only take one bite of these.  I guess I'll have to give up chocolate if all gluten free chocolate taste like these brownies.  They're also very dry.  My five year old grandson wouldn't take a second bite.

review/text: I buy these locally at Whole foods and they are very fresh, chew and chocolatey! I can't believe they re GF. My friends who are not GF love these too. I like them better than gluten brownies I ate before learning I needed to be GF. The choc. chip are soft and taste, too.  The ginger are not very strong in ginger but nice and soft with real ginger pieces in them.<br />You can't eat just one- one box maybe!

review/summary: Taste like real coffee
review/text: They should have provided more description for the product.<br /><br />I just had it yesterday while shopping at a local grocery and seeing Bob Marley's face I had to buy it.  After coming home I started looking more closely and here are 2 things that made me happy about my purchase:<br /><br />1) the shortness of ingredient list - it's really just Jamaican coffee, milk, sugar, natural flavor, and pectin (not sure what the last ones are for, and I'm typing this from memory so I could be off)<br /><br />2) a portion of the profit from the sale of this product is going to non-profit<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, it's a little bit on the mellow side (that's what Jamaican Blue Mountains are, right?), not too sweet, but other than that, it tasted like real coffee (that's a big one for me).  It's not something I'll drink for pulling all-nighters, but it's something to enjoy on a hot summer afternoon.<br /><br />I can imagine the palm tree and the sea breeze brushing through my face.

review/summary: The best Rosehip Tea in US
review/text: Do not waste your money buying any other brands of the Rosehip Tea available in the US market. I've tried all of them, from Whole Foods, Fresh Market, GNC, Organic/Not organic from any possible grocery stores and had total disappointment. Once you've tried the real rosehip tea, your search for a good one will be endless, as it was for me.  I was wondering how is possible to sell a product under the name of "Rosehip Tea" with no even closest flavor of the rosehip, or even worth, no flavor at all, like having a sewer water boiled and served. Well, maybe these manufacturers hope that the majority don't know the true flavor of a good tea and will buy their misleading product. Don't trash your money! Stop your search and buy this one, the only "Rosehip Tea" that taste as rosehips. Enjoy!

review/text: Thank You EuroGrocer- You deliver Happiness!!!  Onno Behrends is ABSOLUTELY in their own League!!!  After buying my 1st box three years ago on a whim at Big Lots, I was hooked. Returning to find the tea discontinued, I started a daunting year-long replacement task.  I tried several other brands along the way, which became both expensive and disappointing (most are mixed tea blends).  Having found it at Amazon, my husband surprised me with a case of 10 boxes & I was in Tea Heaven!!!  Due to my bragging, friends & family became curious and soon I was handing out little gifts of Rose Hip Magic.  Now even the guys are on board: my nephews make it year round- daily iced tea & during flu season, hot tea added (these guys are athletic & military- not your usual herbal tea guys)!  This is a well-balanced tea, but the key is to steep it for the FULL 10 minutes.  Many people are worried about bitterness, so they drink it too soon.  This tea is not bitter, and only tastes watered-down if not steeped properly.  I add a tsp of honey & a splash of lemon to mine.  For iced tea, we like to mix it with Onno Behrend's Peppermint & sweeten it with Agave, as it mixes so well!  How will you drink yours?

review/text: I love Rose Hips tea. It is my favorite herbal tea to drink. I was so excited to get this brand of Rose Hips tea because of all the glowing reviews. I opened up the package and looked at the box of tea and saw that it also contained Hibiscus Flowers!!! I love Traditional Medicinals Rose Hip tea because it is just Rose Hips and nothing else. I made a cup of this new tea and was not impressed. I steeped it for 10 minutes, then added lemon and Agave just like I do with my other teas. There was hardly any taste! With my other Rose Hips tea, the flavor is strong. I think it is the Hibiscus flowers that change the flavor. I am upset that I paid this much for tea that I doubt I will use. In the future I will stick with the brands that I know and love.

review/text: This brand of ground coffee definitely lives up to its name! I used to think that Eight O'clock was the right time to wake up...but not anymore. When you pop the lid, you're immediately overcome with the rich aroma of dark roast. Seriously, you're tempted to eat it straight from the tin! Moreover, if you've grown weary of grinding beans just to get the magic brew, relax...just pop-a-top my friend and prepare to enjoy! I highly recommend the Melitta drip coffee method for the preparation, since this coffee will only be as good and pure as the water you start out with.

review/text: I am a colombian, born in Bogota. I used to go to a Colombian grocer in Silver Spring MD just to get my hands on 10% imported Colombian (cafe sello rojo). I tried this coffee today..and wow! I can't tell the difference. For once someone who claims it is 100% Colombian not only spelled Colombia right (they spell it with a U sometimes and it drives me crazy) but it really IS 100% Colombian. This is nice and strong, with a bit of bitterness that lets you know this was ground from some mean beans.

review/summary: Cheap, bad tasting coffee...
review/text: I ordered this coffee after reading reviews on Amazon, usually those reviews are really helpful, but not in this case. The coffee does not have a nice taste, it is not better than any grocery store brand. It's flavor is strong, but not in a good way, rather like badly roasted coffee. I know some people like fruity (acidic) flavor and some like nutty flavor (like me) in their coffee, but Melitta coffee has neither, it is more like coffee flavored mud. On top of all, I wasn't able to return the coffee because it turns out Amazon does not allow returns on some grocery items.<br /><br />If you doubt my review because of all other glorifying reviews, well, when I ordered this coffee there was not even a single negative review. That's the way I was fooled. However, if you don't care much about the quality of coffee but just need caffeine this coffee may be right choice for you. If you care about the taste of your coffee at all, avoid Melitta even for this price. Trust me it doesn't worth.

If they hear the treats move inside the case at all, they will come running, even if you're just putting the treats up.  They beg for them and will become your new best friend if you have them in your hand.  My older (who isn't really a people person) will even befriend you long enough to get a few treats out of you.  She even finds them sitting on the counter or bedside table and will knock them in the floor and try to open the lid. (thank goodness its cat proof)  I love these treats because they make my babies happy!

review/summary: Not the best cat treat in my opinion, but they are cat approved at first
review/text: The only good comment I can give on these treats is that my cat liked them when they were fresh, and they are really inexpensive! I can usually find these treats for under two dollars at the grocery or pet store, and even on occasion at the dollar store. As this treat proves, often with a low price, comes a cheap product.  It would be nice if these pounce treats had healthier ingredients, maybe some vitamins or a dental cleanser, but no, its just junk food and a long list of filler ingredients. They smell really gross to me but my cat seemed to enjoy them. My biggest reason for not liking this treat, aside from the terrible ingredients and smell, is the fact that it is soft and chewy and not crunchy texture. Soft treats reek havoc on pet teeth as the sticky particles just sit on their teeth and gums and just rot there. Crunchy treats at least crunch off and don't stick to their teeth- hopefully crunching off some tarter with it. For a really good dental product, I recommend Crunch N' Clean brand with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have as many beneficial dental ingredients, but they are pretty good as well as they contain vitamins and a little bit of breath freshening ingredients in them, so they are much better than these. Any crunchy treat would be better than these. Even other Pounce varieties are MUCH better than these, such as the Tarter & Plaque control varieties. The Pounce Tarter & Plaque control are a bit more pricey, but still relatively inexpensive and they contain vitamins and are crunchy. Another strange thing about these treats is that the recommended daily allotment is 6-8 treats per day, which is just crazy to me. I only give my cats no more than 1-2 a day of these while I had them. I eventually threw them out as they got hard as rocks and my cats didn't like them anymore anyhow.<br /><br />Pros: cat approved taste while fresh; and very fair price<br />Cons: bad smell, lack of nutrition, terrible texture for teeth

They do tend to dry out by the time I near the end of the bottle, however. The flip-top lid is very handy. Very nice, inexpensive kitty treats.
