review/summary: All the goodness of a mud puddle.
review/text: Perhaps I purchased a bad batch, but the flavor of Jana water is more reminiscent of a swamp than anything I would care to drink. The bottles are in fine condition, looks like any other bottled water, but there is a musty aroma upon opening. They are well within their "expiration" date, so I'm unsure what the issue would be other than Jana's Natural European Artesian taste. I did not purchase the water off of Amazon, so perhaps Nutricity's stock is of higher quality.

review/summary: Not your typical "green" olive
review/text: Let me first say that I am not a fan of green olives but these are more like the creamy, buttery goodness of a black olive. I remember the first time I had experienced this type of olive years ago at a place I had worked. If you like black olives I think you will really enjoy these.

review/text: I love black olives but the sodium content is usually through the roof.  I discovered these on Amazon and won't purchase any other brand.<br />Low in sodium, but still has plenty of flavor (you taste the olives, not the salt).  A little pricey, but buying in bulk helps.  Definitely worth it!

review/summary: *****Five Star Olives From California*****
review/text: I am always pleased when I spend money on something that turns out to be a great value. These olives are one of those purchases. They taste fresh; are consistent from can to can; have a smooth, bright surface; a solid texture, firm shape, pitted well; color is deep, appetizing, and untreated. If you taste one can you'll never purchase any other. They're addictive. And no disgusting chemicals.

review/text: These are black but not as ink black we're used to seeing with canned black olives.  I assume that's because they don't contain preservatives.  These taste so good I have to restrain myself or I'll eat half the can immediately upon opening!  I love them as is for a snack and hubby whines if he doesn't see these olives in his salad.  We go through a case quickly, they're a staple in my pantry.

review/summary: Flaxseed is very tasty and wonderful for health benefit only if you get the good quality one!
review/text: I have been using flaxseed meal over the past three years; I would use them on almost everything from salad, soup to baking good. And, among several different suppliers on the market, I like Bob's Red Mill best for its reasonable price and trusty brand name.<br /><br />However, the latest batches I ordered were not nearly as good as before. They are dark, coarse (most is barely gridded), and BITTER!!!<br /><br />Check if yours with sell-by date later than 10/2008.

review/summary: Unfamiliar yet satisfying taste
review/text: I originally bought a bag of this at the local grocery store because of the health claims on the packaging. Since then I've bought a bunch of it from Amazon grocery.<br /><br />I use it mostly on my breakfast cereal, but have also used it in baking, including the muffin recipe on the package. I can't recommend that recipe because the muffins have too much stuff in them (carrot and apple shavings, nuts, raisins, etc.) and the muffins wouldn't hold together except for the gooey consistency of the baked product. Yuck.<br /><br />However, in a pizza crust it's great, adding extra flavor and texture that is both unfamiliar and satisfying. I like having taste in the pizza crust as much as in the toppings, and adding some flaxseed meal helps add flavor.<br /><br />It also goes well in other baked goods, and I've used it in cookie recipes, quick breads, etc.

review/text: I love Bob's Red Mill products and the flaxseed meal is no exception.  I eat this nearly everyday in a hot breakfast cereal.  The nutritional content is incredible and the flavor can be easily modified for sweet or more bread-like recipes.  I bought this 4-Pack of 32 oz. bags from Amazon, thinking about what a great value it was with free shipping and all, but found a better deal elsewhere (VitaCost sells it for less, even with shipping).  Although I will continue to purchase Bob's Red Mill Flaxseed Meal, it probably will not be through Amazon.

review/summary: Moist bread!
review/text: I have read about the wonderful benefits of flaxseed and after trying the seeds with little success (you have to toast, then grind then incorporate), I decided to try the pre-ground meal.  I love Bob's Red Mill products, so that part was a no-brainer.  I used the meal for the first time in a recipe for homemade pumpkin bread.  I have never had pumpkin bread so moist!  It was almost cake-like.  I will decrease the amount I add next time (it says you can use it in place of some oils or butters in recipes, but I added it to the flour), but I'm impressed.  I expected a strong oaty, grainy taste (like Buckwheat), but found none.  It seems to have blended perfectly in the bread.  This morning, I added some to oatmeal -- just a pinch or so -- and I could taste a tiny difference, but not much.  My 3-year-old didn't notice at all.  As always, great product from a great brand!

review/text: Bob's Red Mill is a high quality food company.  The Organic Flaxseed Meal is a versatile, easy to use food for healthy consumption of Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Lignans.  I have used several different brands of flaxseeds.  Bob's Red Mill Organic is by far the most flavorful and is ground to a consistancy that is perfect as a flour (substitute about 1/4 of the flour in muffin and bread recipes) or add the meal to homemade peanut butter or sprinkle on yogurt or cereal.  I keep the flaxseed meal frozen and use as much as needed out of the bag straight from the freezer.  My kitchen is never without this naturally wonderful organic food.  [..]

I like it because it not only provides important omega 3 fatty acids, but it also adds protein and fiber.  This brand is pretty good too, and I can get it much cheaper here on Amazon than in my local health food store.

review/summary: Health promoting product, organic per label, good price per ounce
review/text: I like this flaxfeed product for a few reasons. I use it for omega-3 and fiber. It is organic per label on the bag, so no harmful chemicals.  It is plant-based (ie. environmentally friendier way) to get omega-3 for heart health. In this larger quantity, the price per ounce is very reasonable, compared with grocery store products that delivery a lot of packaging for little flaxseed. Thus this product allows me to get the benefits at a reasonable price, without potentially harmful supplements that have concentrated content whose origin, quality and long-term effects maybe unknown.  Also, Amazon itself being the seller ensures authentic product and inexpensive timely delivery with proper packaging.

review/text: I absolutely love this flaxseed meal by Bob's Red Mill. I actually found this at Market Basket for $2.99, what a great price, I do think that was the sale price though. Although I think some of Bob's other products are over-priced, especially the quinoa, this one is worth more than what I paid for it!  The health benefits are tremendous, and also it adds a richer flavor to foods, breads, stews, soups, gravies, and THICKENS them almost like flour does.  So now I am leaving out the calories, gluten, and sometimes gluey taste when making a roux for my stews and gravies, and adding in health benefits and also richer flavor. I will not be without this product in my home!

review/summary: Tasty Omega 3s!
review/text: This Flaxseed meal is a very tasty and easy way to get more Omega 3 oils  and fiber in your diet. It's much less messy to use than flaxseed oil, and tastes better. It is great on foods like yogurt, apples, and cottage cheese, and it's even surprisingly good added to pancake, cookie, and muffin batters.<br /><br />My cattledog (Red Heeler) even likes flaxseed meal on her food, and it has improved the condition of her skin and coat tremendously. She used to shed constantly, and scratched and chewed herself raw. Now she doesn't itch nearly so much, her coat is thick and soft, and she only sheds twice a year. (My vet recommended a short tablespoon of flax meal per 10 pounds of body weight every day for the itching.) If you use dry dog food you have to mix a little water in so the flax meal sticks to the food.

review/summary: SAVED OUR SANITY ON A 4-HOUR PLANE RIDE!
review/text: YUM! Our 17 month old daughter loves them. When we heard about these new pouches, they were a _must try_. We couldnt decide on a fruit combination, so we ordered a case of each. This worked out well, because the order qualified for amazons free shipping. They arrived very quickly in easy to open cases.<br /><br />We consolidated them to a box in the pantry so we could get to them faster and because those pouches can kind of slide around. :) Our daughter is all about choices right now and so we let her decide which one she'd like to try first. She looked carefully at each of them then said "NANA! ARN! BUH-NEE! HOP! HOP!" and so chose the Mango, Banana and Orange...and it remains her favorite of the three (although, she would never give up the others if offered).<br /><br />Now, the plane ride...we recently took a trip to visit grandma from San Jose to Austin - a 4+ hour airflight that we were somewhat nervous about. We packed our fruit pouches and other goodies. It became a special treat as we rolled out to the tarmac and then took off into the sky. She happily ate and when she was done, sat quietly and contently looking at the pouch...pointing at the bunny and the orange and the banana, (we told/showed her there was a mango too).<br /><br />When we ran out of pouches, we went to the whole foods - but they were not yet available there. They did have another brand, which we reluctantly purchased because unlike the peter rabbit pouches - the cap was so tiny, it could be a serious choking hazzard should it get into the hands (or mouth) of our little lady. The combination was also different and she didnt really care for the other kind as much.<br /><br />Though she cant say alot of words, she does sign quite a few and she runs to the pantry, points and signs "more, please...more please!! please!!" Which is pretty funny to see.<br /><br />We took some video the day they arrived, I'll have to see if I can find it and post as part of the review.

review/text: We recently gave these a try after seeing them displayed at Starbucks.  I thought it would be handy to toss in the diaper bag for a just-in-case snack.  We pulled one out during a long day out with our 14 month old, and she sucked it down!  She even figured out rather quickly how to squeeze the bag and feed it to herself (with a little help when she reaches the end, of course), so we have ordered them by the case and will keep a few in the bag at all times!  A real lifesaver for those times we are stuck out without quick access to healthy snacks (these are entirely fruit - nothing else).  Great find, and slightly cheaper through Amazon.

review/summary: A little spendy, but worth it for convenience
review/text: My 9 month old loves these.  They are so great to stash in a bag or have on the airplane etc...i sometimes even bring a spoon to serve with b/c at her age it can still get messy, but I love the ease of it all.  And they are are tons of great fruit and vegi combinations.  Much more than you get with regular baby food.  These are more expensive, but I like them better in general for this stage.

review/summary: My daughter now loves mango!
review/text: I think a large part of my daughter's love of mango is because of these fruit snacks. She now will eat chunks of fresh or frozen mango along with mango smoothies. Still, she comes back to her Mango, Banana, Orange snack. I appreciate that these are organic with no added sugar, and that the fruit listed on the front is what is contained in the pouch - no pear or apple tossed in for good measure. This is a wonderful treat for my preschooler.

review/summary: Loose 'English Breakfast' style Tea (assam), at a good price
review/text: If, like my wife and I, you're blessed with soft tap water, and like a good robust "English Breakfast Tea", I've found that this blend (mostly dark assam) is a pretty decent choice, and a good value.  I believe it's packaged by the same company that makes "PG-Tips" in the handy pyramid bags.  The quality is comparable.  I generally buy the brooke bond loose for making everyday tea by the pot, and I buy pg tips pyramid bags for travelling.<br /><br />Anyway, I buy the Brooke Bond loose on a regular basis - either online, or at a local indo-pakistani grocer.  I've also bought the Taj Mahal label by the same company, but they appear to be interchangeable, and differ only by the art on the box.  The loose tea is in small granule form, and comes sealed in a foil pouch, for freshness ... it's not flushed with neutral gas, and they dont vaccum pack it because they dont want to crush the tea, but otherwise the quality is pretty decent.  It comes in a variety of sizes, buy the most common size I buy is 900 grams (2 lbs) or 1800 gr (4lbs).<br /><br />The resulting tea is not quite as floral as some assams I've had (hey, it's bulk tea), and there's often a modest amount of tea dust in the bottom of the pouch, but the dust is easily removed by pouring the dry tea into a fine strainer, and tapping the strainer over the garbage (to winnow it), before brewing it.<br /><br />In my household, I generally buy loose tea in bulk, de-dust it, then repackage it in one or more 40 fl oz glass jars using a univeral vaccum sealing lid (see Tilia Food Saver), and then I use those to periodically refill a smaller 16-24 oz convenience container that I keep near my stove, for whenever I want to brew a fresh pot of tea.<br /><br />I've found that 1/4 cup of loose tea is sufficient for a 6 cup pot, and 1/4 - 1/3 cup is sufficient for 8 cups.  After brewing is done (3-5 mins), I pour the brewed tea through a fine tea strainer into serving cups, and the surplus goes into a lidded glass carafe that gets stored in the fridge (after it cools) for subsequent reheating by the cup (re: microwave), or for use in iced tea by the jug (just add some simple syrup and fresh lemon juice to taste, and some optional bruised mint leaves, and you're good to go).<br /><br />Bottom line - for an inexpensive loose bulk tea, this brand is very decent all purpose choice, suitable for both hot and iced tea.  Recommended.

You are supposed to mix it with 6oz. of hot water, but that is really rich and sweet for me. I am not a big fan of sweets though. My husband always think my hot chocolate tastes watered down so others would probably like it better with less water. It has a nutmeg and cinnamon flavor to it with a bit of ginger mixed in. I try to buy a lot of it at the end of season when it is onn sale so I have it on hand year round.

review/text: If we're out and I buy coffee, I buy a latte. I'm a big fan. These are the best HOME made lattes that we have tried. I generally make the milk disc first, then the espresso one, and it's foamy and frothy (Just the way I like it!). I'm not saying this will be the best latte you've ever had, but it will be the best one you can make at home on a Tassimo. I buy them in bulk, it's the only kind of coffee I drink. It's definitely worth the price, it's much cheaper than buying a latte every day. I definitely would recommend this for anyone who loves lattes, but doesn't love spending 5 bucks to have a small one every day. It's worth making them at home, whenever you want :)

I tried, but it is really bad.<br /><br />My advice, buy this from a whole foods store in your city.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Good news:  Amazon was kind enough to efund me the purchase price.  So while Bengalla gets 0 stars, Amazon gets 5 stars!  THANKS AMAZON.

Due to working 12 hours shifts, I have been drinking these on a regular basis and they are very effective in giving you a boost when you are starting to crash. Due to the extremely low price at the dollar store, I am drinking these over red bull and five hour energy. Even if they were the same price, I would still buy these due to their delicious taste.

review/summary: best ice coffee in a can
review/text: 4 stars only because of the price. At 75 cents a can, I'd probably have one at breakfast every day. There's not enough nitrous to affect any mouth feel, just enough for a bit of foam if you poured it into a glass. It's a tad too sweet for me. It has no corn syrup and I don't have to worry if I'm getting enough B12. A good tasting convenient way to get a cup of wake-up coffee in the AM.<br /><br />The fact that this product, which is mostly water, was shipped all the way from the Netherlands to a store near me, demonstrates the insane profit margin Monster must build into every $2.63 can (priced in 30 can lots).<br /><br />39 cents per fluid ounce!

review/text: It's really hard to find healthy treats for my dog.  I have started feeding him an organic, homemade diet to help him with his kidneys and overall health.  He's 15 years old and has become quite picky.  I've looked around a lot for a healthy cookie for him that is crunchy and organic and not too high protein for his weaker kidneys.  These cookies fit the bill.  He loves them and I feel good about giving them to him.  My super picky boy practically snatches these out of my hand!

review/text: It's hard to find a good quality dog treat at the grocery stores and even most pet stores.  Many have added sugars and artificial ingredients as well as harmful chemicals.  But these have nothing but natural ingredients you can recognize, rice, fruits, vegetables, cheese etc.  Made in Canada, grown in North America.  Natural.  My dogs love them, the treats are not too large as some other brands are, just right for a special treat.

Because they are small-sized and easy to break with your finger tips, I use those to train my new puppy, too. They are USDA-certified organic. My 18-month Lab/Hound mix has been crazy about these cookies, and now my 3-month Lab/Pit mix puppy has found there's more yummy stuff than the dog food he's fed everyday.<br /><br />I always bring handful of those cookies when we go out for walk. When we visit a dog run, without fail, I become the instant star owner in the park, as all other dogs run toward me, asking for something in my pocket. These cookies must smell so-o-o good to all the dogs, I bet!

review/summary: A most amazing blended tea in a bag
review/text: For some time I have been looking for a tea that uses sage as one of the key ingredients. I have been to many Greek restaurants that use sage in tea but never found something on the shelf. When I saw Meditative Time on the shelf at Whole Foods it was more curiosity than anything else, but when I smelled and tasted it that was a whole different story. The tea is sage infused with lavender - this is what gets you first - and puts you in a relaxed state before you even drink it. The tricky thing is that most lavender teas are overdone - but Yogi tea managed to get the smell just right and then taste, well its amazing. This tea is really relaxation in a cup and if Yogi was able to market it correctly, could be as well known as Sleepy Time - it has just the right blend of nettle, skullcap, chrysanthemum, blackberry leaf, gotu kola, helichysum, pushpi, lemon myrtle and setiva. Pretty amazing - with a teaspoon of sage honey in it, you relax almost instantly after drinking this tea. If you suffer from insomnia, this could be a very pleasurable tool for you. ENJOY :)

review/text: My dog has lots of food allergies and she is able to eat these because they don't contain anything she is allergic to which by the way, can cause ear infections as well as scratching (such as yeast which is found in lots of dog food for God knows what reason). They are nice and crunchy which she likes. You don't have any idea how hard it is to find a crunchy treat that she is not allergic to. Most of the treats are soft and chewy which is okay but I wanted her to have some crunchy ones to help keep her teeth clean. I called the company because I wanted to make sure that all the ingredients were listed accurately on the box(you'd be surprised how many are not)and they were very nice and answered all my questions.

I've tried a variety of recipes and have eaten scramblers from many restaurants, but this is still my favorite.
