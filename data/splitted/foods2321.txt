review/summary: Perfect Post Workout Shake!!  Delicious!  High Protein!
review/text: I tried chocolate and am normally not a vanilla person but since the taste and quality was exceptional, I figured I'd give it a try.  This drink is simply incredible.  They pack so much organic nutrition in 11 ounces and the taste is out of this world for a protein shake.  My only request is give us another flavor!!  My whole family is hooked.

Orgain is part of my diet twice a day and I'm always running out.  It is also sometimes VERY hard to find.<br /><br />Now all we need you to do is add a once/week or once/2weeks option, keep it in stock and do the same for Chocolate Fudge.<br /><br />Merry Christmas to us, huh?

review/summary: Absolute best protein drink ever!
review/text: I love these drinks! They are made of real ingredients, all organic,very healthy & taste marvelous. Really. I have tried everything, trust me, and nothing compares. I drink 2-3 daily, either as a snack or part of a meal. They have helped me to feel better, have longer lasting energy & lose weight- a total bonus! The one thing I wish is that they'd use glucose instead of sugar, but at least they use organic cane sugar. Vanilla is my fave, but the chocolate is yummy, too. It tastes like a rich hot chocolate that's been chilled<br />BUT...  Amazon is totally flaky about keeping these available. I've been ordering 2-4 cases regularly & they're often out of stock so prepare ahead. I ordered on Nov. 18 & now they don't even show them as available. VERY ANNOYING!

review/summary: Wonderful product from a wonderful company
review/text: I really love these shakes. They taste reasonably good (very good for a protein shake), are healthy and do not have the additives that most other shakes have. If you have lots of allergies or are looking for a "clean" protein shake without sugar substitutes, this is a fantastic option. I have bought  these many times. However, there was a problem with this order and Amazon said they would not fix it. I contacted Orgain directly and they responded immediately and fixed it immediately. I am so grateful that now I have found a good tasting protein shake without soy, artificial sugar substitutes, or stevia.I cannot recommend this product and company enough! Like some other reviews said, it tastes best cold and out of a glass, but I also take it on the road with me.

review/summary: Very Good, But the Chocolate is better.
review/text: I'm not a meat eater therefore I need extra protein and found these Orgain products during a trip to Whole Foods. The clerk there described them to me as a completely balanced portion of Carbs/Protein/Fat using all natural food products and nothing artifical.  She said, on top of that, they actually taste GOOD!  She was right!  I love these things.  I have only briefly read up on her claims, but from what I can tell, it's all true.<br /><br />The only cons I have found to this product is 1)Cost.  They are pretty expensive to use on a regular basis.  2) The serving is 255 calories and it doesn't quite keep me satisfied as a "meal" but has too many calories to consider it a snack. I'm not too fond of the vanilla.  It's got a good flavor, but the few times I've had it, I've gotten "clumps" at the bottom of the container.  That grosses me out.  Never happened with the Mocha or Chocolate flavors though.  The chocolate is my favorite but the mocha is good too.  I have one of these every morning with breakfast along with a small spoon of peanut butter for a little more protein and calories to sustain me a little longer than these do on their own.

review/summary: Did not like the vanilla bean...
review/text: I purchased both the vanilla bean and chocolate based on all the 5 star reviews, protein, organic, and nutritionally equivalent to 10 servings of fruits/veggies.  The chocolate was okay, but the vanilla bean had a strange after-taste....still not sure how to describe it - reminded me of cornbread and soybeans.  Adding frozen fruit and blending it helped a little, but didn't completely mask the weird after-taste.  Maybe it was a 'bad batch,' but the expiration date was March 2012, so I don't believe that was the probem.  Unfortunately, taste is a HUGE factor for me, so even though I like everything else about these shakes, I won't be buying again.

review/summary: Vanilla has odd note in the flavor and is pretty "watery"...just okay
review/text: I bought this in the vanilla cause the nutritional profile seemed good for hubby (who has trouble keeping weight on since we ditched most starches). He's not much into chocolate-milk type things. I got the case today, chilled a few, and tasted it.<br /><br />There's that weird aspect to the taste--first kinda like bacon, then sorta green. It's really unpleasant in the first sip. Fortunately, after a few more sips, you start to get used to it and can get the vanilla vibe better. I'm assuming it's the veggie component in there making me cringe at first--since I don't normally have veggie smoothies masquerading as vanilla shakes. I like my veggie smoothies overtly, unapologetically veggie-green. I like the taste of the Green Magma or Green Goddess type smoothies  that have spinach, celery, cucumber, parsley, etc. :) (Don't know why my first sip of Orgain hollered, "bacon!" at me, but there it is. Offputting.)<br /><br />The shake is thin--watery even. NOT creamy or thick.<br /><br />I could drink this if I needed unto. I've had some protein shakes that made me gag. This did not, it went down easily, no weird slimy texture, no weird chalkiness, just that odd smoky/then/green vibe. It's not something I could say was tasty.<br /><br />Maybe the chocolate flavor hides that weird taste thing going on better than the vanilla. I like the Amazing Grass that has the cocoa, so I could see that working. Still,  I doubt I'll order it to find out. I hope hubby likes this flavor. I don't really want to finish this case.

review/summary: PLEASE READ EDIT BELOW! If you like whey based supplements...
review/text: If you like whey based supplements, and are used to that kind of taste, you might like this. Otherwise, stay away, FAR away. Do not expect a delicious, refreshing smoothie or an 'Ensure' type of meal replacement product. This is nicely organic, but unless shaken hard and chugged in a few seconds, there is a bunch of sludge at the bottom. I myself do not like to drink it, it is a bit too sweet, and the sludge factor is kinda creepy. Adding a frozen banana and blending is fine, and I even cook with it. I made a fresh fruit cobbler using this instead of milk and cutting back on the sugar.<br />EDIT....Above is my original review. It was too late to call Amazon so I was just going to let it go, long story short, I tried it again, and it is DELICIOUS! Even the color was different, an off white instead of deep tan. I suspect Amazon stored it near a heater. NO goop at the bottom, and it tastes fresh and sweet, totally fine without anything added. I emailed the company, they responded and sent coupons, wooHOO! So great taste, attentive customer service...I'll be buying more.

review/summary: Sorry to disagree but........
review/text: Seems most people love these Orgain shakes.  This fact really, really makes me wonder.  I don't normally like to leave negative reviews of anything, but I feel it's my duty to express my difference of opinion.  I have tried only the "chocolate", and I use quotation marks because it tastes like no chocolate I have ever tasted in my entire life, and I'm a girl who knows her way around chocolate.  It was absolutely the most disgusting protein drink I have ever tasted.  If you put bark mulch, lawn clippings and a little bit of manure in a blender with milk and drank it - that might be a close comparison to the taste of this stuff, in my humble opinion.  I can't even believe I spent money on these, or that anyone else does.  Maybe if you're one of those people who drinks wheatgrass or eats carob like it's really chocolate, or one of those other "healthy" and a way too earthy concoctions, you'll like it.  If you have normal tastebuds, run - don't walk -  the other way from this stuff.

review/summary: Surprisingly Tasty!!
review/text: I first discovered Orgain (chocolate flavor) at Farm to Market. Although very skeptical, I found the high protein content to be appealing, so I purchased it, and cautiously tried it a couple days later, room temperature.  I was delighted at its great taste!  And after reading the nutrition label, I realized this could be an extremely healthy and great-tasting solution to being too busy (or too lazy) to prepare food.  I ordered a case from Amazon, and chilled them... even better, IMO.  Now, not only do I feel healthier, less hungry, and have more energy, but I also broke through the pound plateau and have lost weight since I started drinking Orgain.  I've recommended it to family members, and I continue to drink it myself.  I'm so glad I took an uncharacteristic risk and tried it.

review/summary: Thanks for ruining a great product
review/text: This shake was one of the last shakes I could find that was both energizing, good for me (especially the non-gluten part), and helped me gain weight. I recently had 2 surgeries, and was looking forward to using orgain to get better. Had I known they were going to completely botch the formula, I would've ordered 10 cases beforehand.<br /><br />But I order 3 cases a month ago... and they were so undrinkable i assumed we got a bad batch of spoiled ones. But there were 3 separate cases like this... with the individual drinks inside tasting 'spoiled'. The expiration date seemed okay.<br /><br />Well, now its clear that the product wasn't spoiled... the formula was spoiled.<br /><br />I'm just so, so disappointed. Orgain had become a major supplement towards my health and recovery process after an injury I sustained last year and was hoping it would continue to be so during my recovery phase after the surgery.<br /><br />That's the type of mindset this drink was created for, right? A doctor made it because he knew the need for healthy, essential amino acids, antioxidants, minerals, and organic blends to help someone gain weight, especially if they're been sick? A formula he concocted after beating cancer? Why not stick that??<br /><br />Am very disappointed to see this cheap change destroy the product that the brand was about.<br />Why should anyone prefer this over any other pre-made drink other than its hypoallergenic aspects? Many of the younger, healthier guys who're drinking this because it was simply better for you ounce for ounce than other mixes... well, good luck keeping them now. Especially with the huge change in taste. Just... augh. You can't even get it down.<br /><br />Am very sad to see such an amazing product be gutted without warning to its loyal consumers. If there really is a Doctor out there in charge of this company... well, I hope you still have a say in it, that you're reading these reviews, and hopefully that you'll evaluate your altered product for yourself and decide whether or not its something you would've preferred to the old orgain when you were recovering and rebuilding healthy mass. I imagine you would say - "no" - the old orgain was far more beneficial.<br /><br />I'm now looking for a new supplement shake. Very sad to see the old Orgain go.<br /><br />Anyone have any suggestions for other similar brands?

review/text: As other reviewers have pointed out, I am also disappointed in the reformulation of this product and in the fact that the company didn't properly disclose this information. I buy this in bulk for personal use and, as others, also thought for a minute that I got a shipment of expired or spoiled product. To clarify, both the taste and the consistency have changed from before. The product is now thicker and overall tastes closer to typical protein drinks which for my personal taste is a letdown. There are dozens of other protein drinks on the market and this one had a distinctive taste and consistency that are now both gone. I will look for a replacement, since this is part of my daily diet.

review/text: As someone with digestive issues, I was so happy to find Orgain to help me gain and maintain my weight.  The ingredients are superior to most products out there and could serve as a meal on the go.  The new formula change, however, was not for the better.  It leaves a chalky aftertaste and just does not taste as good as the original.  As someone who does not have cancer, I also liked that I was getting additional anti-oxidants in the original formula. I am not sure who they used as taste testers, but the original was far better than the new stuff.  I seriously hope they consider going back to the original formula or making some changes to improve the new formula.

review/summary: You can't find a better product than this!
review/text: I first tried this product at my local Whole Foods grocery store and loved it!  What I really enjoy about it is that I'm not drinking junk, no chemicals, no additives, no food coloring...  Nothing bad!  Both flavors, the chocolate and vanilla, are tasty!  I'm also vegetarian and a majorly picky eater, so this product really suited my problems of not intaking enough protein.<br /><br />What made me a believer in this product is that I was given a suggestion to drink a protein shake, ala Orgain, about 15-60 minutes after working out at the gym.  I've given this a test trial for a week and noticed dramatic results.  I recover faster, easier, and I'm energized after the fact.  I sleep better at night too.  I missed dinner the day that Disneyland was open for 24 hours for Leap Day and took one of these along.  I felt great the whole night, only had three hours of sleep, and absolutely no fatigue when I went to work plus no ill-effects the following day.<br /><br />My boyfriend would scrunch up his face seeing me drink these.  He also is now a supporter of the product by caving into one of these yesterday night.  He came back home after playing a 1 1/2 hour match of ping pong, was really sleepy and tired, but wanted to go back out to play badminton.  He drank one of these and about 20 minutes later, felt good enough to go play badminton.  He said it felt like he was never tired initially and was still feeling good after playing for an hour.<br /><br />Instead of reaching for a Red Bull, soda, coffee, or something else with a ton of caffeine for a boost, drink this.

review/summary: I bought 14 cases of Orgain....
review/text: Was looking for an organic, pre-made protein shake.  Years of drinking my own concoctions left much to be desired.<br /><br />I stumbled across Orgain at Whole Foods; bought 1 of chocolate and 1 of vanilla, was instantly hooked.  I then went to Amazon and was able to buy them for &lt; $2/container, which is the cheapest price anywhere!  Did I mention I purchased 14 cases worth?  That should tell you how much I love Orgain.  Too bad Amazon doesn't offer the iced mocha flavor for Prime shipping and subscribe & save.

review/summary: Great protein alternative
review/text: I used to drink these daily as a meal replacement while feeling very poorly.  I was able to maintain a level of energy that I would not have had otherwise.  They are also delicious-tasting when cold.  I found I couldn't really drink them at room temperature.  They're convenient on the go and I feel good about the ingredient list.  I prefer the chocolate but actually found the vanilla very pleasant as well, almost like melted vanilla ice cream or rich vanilla soymilk.  The chocolate is a bit chalky, but more in a cocoa powder sort of way, so not bad.<br /><br />As someone who doesn't eat much meat or dairy, these are a great alternative for me once in a while.  I was nearly living off of them for several weeks last summer, and feeling reasonably good while doing so, but then sort of went cold turkey.  The bottom line is that real, whole foods are always going to be better for you but if that isn't an option, these are a better alternative than junk food or nothing.  I still have a case and a half left and will probably consume them here and there, sparingly.  I do recommend them, especially in place of typical protein supplements.

review/summary: Highly Disappointed in Sudden Flavor Change & Store Unavailability
review/text: I've been researching Orgain online trying to figure out what happened considering I used to live on it but now can no longer even FIND it. Like many of the other reviews mention - I lived on this stuff for breakfast and would purchase it by the case for months. I immediately noticed the flavor change that other reviews have mentioned (I always ordered the chocolate flavor) and agree the new ingredient flavor change was NOT for the better. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Then I suddenly realized that Orgain was no longer available at ALL in my local Whole Foods where I used to find it in both the shelf and chilled sections of the store. I then noticed that my 'subscribe & save' case shipping from Amazon quit shipping entirely after a years on-going subscription. I mentioned this to the friend who first introduced me to Orgain only to hear her tell me that our very popular and local vegetarian grocery store, Rainbow Grocery, has also quit selling it. I assumed that Orgain went out of business but I am still finding it online here at Amazon (just no longer with subscribe & save option) - and the official website appears to be up and running (with Whole Foods still quite confusingly being listed as a retail provider). I checked another Whole Foods retail store in another city and they, too, have quit selling this product which leads me to believe that Whole Foods has backed out entirely.<br /><br />Super frustrated and really disappointed on all counts. I am actively seeking, like other customers, a new replacement. I tried Muscle Milk the other day -- GROSS!

review/summary: HORRIBLE change to the original orgain
review/text: I had my whole family hooked on Orgain. I made my kids drink one every morning with their breakfast. It was my breakfast every morning as well as my husbands. We loved Orgain so much that we had several cases auto shipped to us every month. Then a couple months ago, we thought we got a bad batch of the iced mocha and so we returned them and tried getting them locally in a store by us. Same horrific taste. At the same time, we were dropped from the auto ship program and it was getting harder to find it in the local stores in that flavor so we assumed they changed the formula but the Vitamin Shoppe had no idea and there was no indication on the packaging saying that there were any changes made. So, we tried switching to the chocolate fudge. It was delicious so we just changed our auto ship to the new flavor and for a couple months got by with the chocolate fudge. Then, we got dropped from the auto ship again and had a harder time finding it in the stores. Apparently, they changed the chocolate fudge formula also. I just got 2 new cases and they have that same DISGUSTING taste that the iced mocha had. Needless to say we can't drink it anymore, will be returning what we have and actively trying to find a replacement drink. I can't tell you how disappointed we are. All I can say is that unless they change the formula back, I'll never buy it again. It isn't even drinkable. It's absolutely revolting!

review/text: Let me join my voice to the chorus of people upset with Amazon for the price increase for Orgain drinks.  As others have mentioned, the price has gone up from $28. to $44.  Even though this is an excellent product, I will no longer be buying Orgain from Amazon.<br /><br />Perhaps when enough people have stopped buying Orgain, Amazon and the makers of this product will come to their senses and bring down the price to former levels.  I can already hear readers of this review saying, "Nice try!"<br /><br />Does anyone have recommendations for products that do the same thing as Orgain, but for a reasonable price?

review/text: This is a staple in my house at all times. I use it as a meal replacement since i try to eat 4-5 small meals a day at about 250 calories, which is what Orgain has. It also has an antioxidant berry blend and a greens blend mixed in which is unlike any other protein drink. But the best part is it tastes like chocolate milk and i always want to drink it. AMAZING!! Chocolate fudge is the best flavor by the way. No need to even go to the vanilla or mocha since the chocolate is so delish!

review/text: I am on medications for cancer and among the many side effects of the treatment is loss of taste and appetite with a resultant weight loss. Orgain was recommended as a food supplement although I had been using Ensure. I found Orgain to be not only delicious but it has had a very positive effect in terms of halting weight loss and providing excellent nutrients. Since there is no lactose content it is also far more tolerable. Recommend highly.

review/summary: Love this newest flavor
review/text: What can I say? Orgain is the best protein shake I've ever had, and I've tried many of them over the years. Out of the three flavors, this newest flavor is definitely the best. I have used and continue to use Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save' option for all of the Orgain shakes, as I drink them at least four to five times per week and don't have to worry about searching for them all over town. In my area, the Whole Foods by me sells out often and generally only has the Vanilla Bean flavor in stock (my least favorite). The local health food store, hardly ever has them as well. So, I was quite happy after finding the Orgain shakes on Amazon, over a year ago.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, I can honestly say that there is definitely an increase in energy after consistently drinking these, but not in that unnatural, over stimulated way that caffeinated or chemical laden products can sometimes leave you feeling. I use them as meal replacements when pressed for time, when my appetite is light, and/or an hour before working out...for the energy boost.<br /><br />Cost wise, if you're on a tight budget, this product might be a bit of a splurge, but is still less per shake, than the average latte, or fast food meal. Which is obviously, not as healthy for you.<br /><br />Currently, I switch between drinking the Cafe Mocha and Chocolate Fudge and would highly recommend this product. For those like myself, who work in an office setting, these are a great option to keep in the work fridge, in order to steer clear of that office snacking area (the vending machine, that co-worker who loves to bake, the Friday doughnut day, etc.).

review/text: I saw this in a wellness email I get and checked out their website and was impressed. I was able to locate this at my local grocery store and tried the chocolate, vanilla and the coffee mocha. I only liked the chocolate the other two flavors were doable but I would not buy again but that is just me as I typically find that drinks with these flavors do not suit me. I really enjoy the chocolate and can drink it cold out of the carton without having to add/blend anything with it which makes it a great grab and go meal/snack. The price from Amazon is cheaper then the grocery store and the subscribe and save / auto delivery make it that much better. This will remain as a go to item in my pantry.

review/summary: FINALLY, Amazon offers Prime Shipping for the Mocha Flavor
review/text: I am a huge fan of Orgain; stumbled upon it a few months ago accidentally, when I was looking for an organic, high quality meal replacement/protein drink with no artificial sweeteners.  I don't like stevia either.  I love the ingredients list on Orgain- organic whey & milk proteins!!, brown rice syrup to avoid that sugar crash, and a great blend of vegetables and fruits.  I can't even tell from drinking that it contains kale, beet, spinach, carrots, and tomatoes.  The 16g of protein per asceptic container is perfect and ideally sized.<br /><br />I purchase at least 5-6 cases of Orgain a month, because I drink 2-3 a day.  At least 1 as a post-workout shake, and the others as meal supplements.  Orgain also helps me stay awake at night for evening classes, and are more preferable to consuming Red Bull or 5-hour energy drinks.  I credit Orgain (along with a healthy diet) for helping me lose weight and pursue my fitness goals.<br /><br />Big fan of the sweet vanilla and chocolate flavors, was hoping to try the Cafe Mocha flavor, but Amazon didn't offer any with Prime shipping...until now!  The coffee flavor is delicious; there's a slight coffee-ish aftertaste, but I like it.  Its flavor profile lies somewhere between the more neutral vanilla and the stronger chocolate flavors.  There's also no caffeine in the Mocha varieties.  Unlike the vanilla flavor, I'm happy to report that the Mocha flavors do not seem prone to  whey protein aggregation.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and grab a Cafe Mocha Orgain!  Pop it in the fridge, and it'll be like drinking a nice iced coffee from Starbucks, but much healthier.  Just a final caveat; the Cafe Mocha flavor seems very popular, and frequently goes out of stock.  Buy it when you can!

review/summary: Great product and outstanding Orgain customer service
review/text: I have been a fan of Orgain for over a year now. I recently subscribed-and-saved so I get a shipment of the Vanilla Bean flavor monthly. I have delayed gastric emptying and the Orgain drinks are helpful on bad days. They are way better all around than the alternatives for meal replacement drinks. I recently had an unexpected quality issue with the most recent carton she received, so I contacted Orgain about the problem. They replied promptly, offered a replacement, and followed up thoroughly. The quality of customer service I received was great--you don't get that very often. The company really seems to care about putting a quality product out there and keeping their customers happy. Orgain: Keep up the good work. Amazon: Keep offering good deals on this awesome product. Everyone else: Try Orgain, you'll be glad you did.

review/text: Best protein drink out there. I've been drinking protein shakes for over 10 years and have tried every single brand available. The powdered, the ready made, the big jugs, the protein water, etc. This tastes so good it should not be healthy! And on top of the great protein, there is nothing bad in it! Even my two boys love them. The chocolate is the best, in my opinion, but the vanilla and mocha are still better than anything out there. I travel all the time for work and now that I've discovered these great drinks, I have to figure out a way to get 5 of them in my checked luggage for every week that I'm gone from home! That's how much I love them!

review/summary: Amazing!!!
review/text: I absolutely love these shakes!  Previously, I was mixing my own protein shakes (chocolate whey protein with unsweetened diluted coconut milk, and a banana blended) every morning for breakfast.  Since I found Orgain, I no longer have to clean my hand blender every day and waste five plastic cups a week or carry around a dirty cup until I get home from work.  The taste is amazing (the vanilla is decent, but not nearly as good as the chocolate) and the nutritional content and organic ingredients are exactly what I was looking for.  It's smooth and creamy (not gritty) and, don't worry, you only taste chocolate, not the vegetable extracts, vitamins and minerals (the vanilla tastes significantly more mineral-and-protein-powder-like, that's why I wouldn't recommend it).  I have a degree in nutrition, I am a semi-professional chef, I'm active, and I'm very picky with what I eat, so I'm impressed that I like a product like this so much.  Usually there's something I would want to change (like removing artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols, etc).<br /><br />I live near Los Angeles and the only place I can find Orgain now is at Ralph's for $2.99/ea + tax and they do not offer any sort of discount for bulk purchases.  They used to carry it at Whole Foods for a month or two and would offer 10% off if you bought 10 or more, but they have recently stopped carrying it.  If you like this product as much as I do, the cheapest way to get it is to subscribe to have it regularly delivered through Amazon, giving you an additional 15% savings from the already low price and you will also receive free shipping!

review/summary: Not As Good As Chocolate, but Still An Excellent Choice!
review/text: I've been searching since the days that Kashi stopped producing their meal replacement shake mix for something that tastes just as good and is just as good for you. I've tried both available flavors of Orgain, and the Vanilla flavor I find to have some whey protein taste...I don't enjoy tasting whey protein but still find the drink palatable.  The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled. I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too.<br /><br />Potential downsides:<br />It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that... So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich. The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix. The shakes are expensive too. The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources). The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for. There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term. I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend.

review/summary: Best meal replacement I have ever had
review/text: Over the years I have tried many meal replacements.  Becasue of my need to have no preservatives and no junk I can not pronounce in my drinks it got pretty inconvenient and messy so I went to bars.  With Orgain I get everything I want and more.  Most of all it sustains me for about 4 hours.  The taste is fantastic both chocolate and vanilla.  I feel healthy when I drink it.  I have been on weight watchers for 6 weeks now and with the help of Orgain I have lost 13 pounds and am nearing the 190's which I have not been in over 6 months.  If you are wondering the point value it is 5 which seems a bit high for a small drink but most meals at this point value will sustain you for this long and if you have no time to cook, prepare and need the best alternative on the market grab an Orgain!!!! you won't be sorry

This stuff not only tastes AMAZING, but it's also the healthiest ready to go drink on the market.  Digests well, tastes amazing, very nutritious.<br /><br />My ONLY problem with this formulation is the use of Cane Sugar as the sweetener.  This formulation, if it's supposed to be truly healthy, should replace the cane sugar with brown rice syrup, or some other sweetener with nutritive properties.  Cane sugar is damaging to the body, even when "organic".

review/summary: Light & Yummy Meal Replacement
review/text: I drink it as a meal replacement for lunch as my lower calorie diet. It's the quickest and easiest lunch, I just take it out of the fridge, chug one and I'm back to work. Probably not the "healthiest" method to losing weight but I find that it keeps me pretty full. Although, I do miss the feeling of chewing something..<br /><br />I'm not a health nut but I'm glad this stuff is made with organic ingredients. Makes me feel better knowing that I'm not drinking artificial junk because who knows what that artificial stuff does to my body.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that it increases my energy but it keeps it stable. And I don't get that food coma feeling afterwards, like I would after eating a heavy lunch.<br /><br />I'd say the Chocolate Fudge is the best flavor. I've tried the Vanilla and Mocha and both of them leave a weird after taste. Honestly, I think the Vanilla tastes like the smell of a butcher shop. =X I went through a whole case of Vanilla and I just couldn't get used to the flavor. The chocolate is creamy with a light fudgey taste and I swear it tastes better the more I drink it.. I must be getting used to the flavor. I've already gone through 3 cases of the Chocolate Fudge and will continue to buy more.

review/summary: Awesome Orgain!
review/text: I saw the Orgain promo at my local vitamin store and asked the sales person about it. After reading the ingredients I decided to try the chocolate. I really liked the taste, the consistency and realized later on that I had no negative side effects afterwards. Sometimes I have difficulty with digestion, burping, bloated feeling. Not with Orgain. I decided to buy a few 12 packs and have my husband try it too.  He's 63 years old, I'm 56. If he's in a rush in the morning, he now drinks his Orgain in the car on the way to the city.  He's a big guy, 6'3" and 275 lbs. He agrees that Orgain is a great way to start the day, replace a snack with Orgain, and feel great. I love the 16 grams of protein. I can go for 4 hours and not feel hungry or like I'm running on empty. I know I'm not missing out on important nutrients that can sustain my aging body. Thanks Orgain!

review/text: I came across Orgain at a local market, and bought one to try it out.  It was delicious, and the the whole idea about being organically healthy was a big turn on for me!<br /><br />I ended up buying a case from Amazon, and drink one every morning on my way to work.  Still need to try the other flavors, but Chocolate is good!

review/summary: Worth it
review/text: I don't normally write reviews but for Orgain I felt compelled to. I can't stand most meal replacement shakes or protein shakes, because the texture usually seems off to me. When I have the time I use unflavored protein powder in a smoothie, but for days where that's just not possible Orgain has been an excellent substitute. I have tried chocolate and mocha, and both are great tasting. I prefer the mocha because I feel like I'm getting my coffee fix for the day--and though this stuff is caffiene free I feel energized without the jitters! It's a good breakfast, though occassionally I get an upset stomach after drinking it. I haven't been able to pinpoint why, but it's something to keep in mind if you have a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />I also drink orgain on my workout days, half a shake beforehand and the other half afterward. Even though it's expensive, I don't drink it every day, and my monthly subscription for just a 12-pack has done me well for a while now. For me, it's worth the money to have meal replacement that is easy and tasty.

The other reviewers aren't kidding when they say it tastes just like chocolate milk. Very tasty, much better than any other protein drink I've tried. Sweet but not too sweet, and very chocolatey. I want to try the vanilla flavor, but I like chocolate so much I'm going to wait until I get sick of these first. TRY THIS! You won't regret it.

review/text: 4/16/12, Monday, New York City<br /><br />Orgain has fit in to my lifelong effort to stay out of doctors' offices. At over 88 I think now I've been doing the job right.  I was health conscious back as early as 1938.  My friends thought I was a health fiend. But I don't care about labels.  Except, of course, superior labels like Orgain's labels that informs us all that this product will help us through life's daily hurdles.  Chill it, taste it and then tell me what you think,  Here's what I think:  It's not a substitute for real food that you eat with a knife, fork, and spoons.  But, it sure does fill the gap between meals and keeps me going both physically and mentally -- knowing that I'm taking care of my health.  Try it, you'll like it enough to be hooked as I am.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FDG4K4">Orgain Creamy Chocolate Fudge, 11-Ounce Container (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: I recently started dragging myself out of bed at 5 am weekdays to exercise. Since I'm a night owl, this is no easy feat! After my workout, I need something to 'refuel' while getting ready for work. I eat only organic food and tried several types of organic breakfast bars but none gave me the boost I needed. My goal was to find something with a high protein content AND great taste AND no early-morning stomach upset. I found Orgain while searching amazon.com and after reading only a few of the 5 star reviews, I ordered the Creamy Chocolate Fudge.<br /><br />Well, this is IT. Orgain covers all the bases - organic, high protein, balanced nutrition, convenient, gentle on my stomach, and it tastes GREAT. I'm stocking up and will use it post-exercise and also to keep me energized during 50 mile endurance rides on my horse.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how wonderful Orgain is but writing this review has made my mouth water enough that I'm signing off to go have one!

review/summary: A lot to like
review/text: What's really important about Orgain is the fast infusion of protein it gives you when you are really in need of a boost.  It goes to work within a minute.  If you're famished or feel hypo-glycemic, you'll really appreciate having one.<br /><br />The new Mocha flavor is far and away my favorite.  It tastes less sweet and has a subtle coffee taste. It is a pleasure to drink.<br /><br />The only reason I give Orgain 4 instead of 5 stars is because I'd prefer it didn't rely on the 13 grams of sugar it contains.  Sugar just isn't a nutritional plus, and nowadays, with alternatives like xylitol available, there is room to improve this very good product.<br /><br />I've tried other "smoothies" and supplement powders that you add to water, and none of them cut it.  Orgain is the best product of its kind out there.

She commented that they are more than a recovery drink, truly leaving her satisfied like eating a meal. We have tried several organic whey protein shake brands and some of them have such contrived flavors and are a hassle for her as they need shaking with blender ball and then go bad in the clinic fridge if she doesn't have time to eat (very busy doctoral student). She can just leave one or two in the clinic's fridge and she knows she has something instantly available that will sustain her.

I went on a hunt for a nutrition shake with fiber and more natural ingredients in it.  I finally found this one. I have so much more energy on this shake. I'm nursing now and very happy with the amount of protein in the drink.  And on top of it I get my chocolate fix off of the fudge flavor while still losing postpartum weight.  The taste is just okay to me, similar to what other chocolate milk drinks taste like but I am amazed that they cram so many fruits and vegetables into it. You really can't taste them.

review/summary: Best in Blender with Fruit
review/text: Orgain Vanilla just about beats all the competition with one exception: the taste. For a high protein drink that is organic, whey-based, and contains the equivalent of 10 fruits & vegetables, this should be no big deal. I would describe the taste as a mildly sweet drink that has the body of 1% milk. It also contains solids that tend to pool near the bottom of the container (great looking packaging, BTW). However, if you put the drink in a blender and throw in a few raspberries or strawberries, it really improves dramatically. Try it and see!

review/text: I don't frequently manage breakfast during the week. I had been going to a work cafeteria with food of dubious nutritional value and marginal taste. I did not want to use the sugar loaded mainstream meal replacement shakes. Enter Orgain. Yes they are more expensive but to me they are worth it. Super easy to use, great tasting (does not taste sweet at all and after the 2nd or 3rd one taste really good), feeling, and they leave me with good energy.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of though, and I have tried the chocolate fudge and the vanilla is that 2 different packages of vanilla were very lumpy. I contacted Orgain and they said the protein can become somewhat seperated. My wife and I ended up not liking the vanilla. So this is 5 stars on the chocolate fudge only. But Orgain had great customer service. Super fast response time and they said they would send me out a new pack of my flavor choice. We are on our 3rd carton of the chocolate fudge and none of the vanilla problem at all. Just smooth, good tasting, and I feel good about having one.

review/text: I have been drinking Protein drinks for many years. I was always looking for one that was healthy. The problem was that most had too many chemicals and sugar substitutes. About a year ago I found this drink. The taste is excellent and it is the healthiest protein / vitamin / mineral drink I have ever found. You do not taste the vitamins or minerals. The drink is so good, I use it as a milk replacement in my cereal and on top of fruit such as blueberries. It also makes a great smoothy mixed with fruit and ice. My who family enjoys this product. I strongly recommend this product to family friends, and even my local gym.

review/text: There use to be this great "meal in a box" energy shake called Sustagen Gold in Australia that I could never find the equivalent of until discovering Orgain.<br />You can tell it's made of good stuff because it doesn't leave that classic High Fructose Corn Syrup aftertaste in your mouth that most packaged drinks do.  And it's instantly satisfying, like all good food is.<br />I use it as my pre-yoga teaching meal - I bounce into Wholefoods next door, grab a vanilla or chocolate fudge Orgain (usually the vanilla) and suck it down as I bolt upstairs to my class.<br />It's utterly perfect for that - when you need fast nutrition sans a lot of digesting!<br />I buy it by the case to save money - and with Amazon and the occasional coupon it works out well under $3.<br />The only problem is restraining myself from drinking more than 1 a day.<br />More than that would require intervention, right?<br />I'd love them to come up with a "Pro" version in a less fancy box, that we can ideally buy by the cartonload for even less (so that yes, I can drink more than 1 a day and legitimize my addiction.) And, as I ride a bike, a powdered version would be great too - although sadly powders never seem live up to the pre-made item, even if you have an industrial blender ...<br />They should also sell this at raves and nightclubs instead of alcohol - you'll dance all night and live longer (my mother and I use to do just that downunder).<br />In short, perfect nutrition in a box.<br />http://galfromdownunder.com/yoga

review/summary: vanilla disguise
review/text: Hidden behind the creamy vanilla flavor is a healthy organic list of veggies and fruit.  The protein curbs the urge to gag down junk food at work.  Often there is no time for lunch so I enjoy my Orgain and feel good about fueling my body well.  I have even used this one as a base for smoothies and it works great.  My favorite is the creamy fudge, but the sweet vanilla bean is delicious when I don't want chocolate.  Thanks for getting it home for free!

review/summary: Delicious alternative to liquid meals
review/text: I'm an on-the go person, who has never liked breakfast.  Years ago I used Slim-Fast to lose some weight, and developed the habit of a liquid breakfast.  Actually continued Slim fast (or sometimes Ensure) for breakfast for years.  But honestly, recently when I began to think those product really don't fit with my nutrition plan, which is about 99% organic.  I went looking for a better alternative and found this.  Oh my goodness, compared to slimfast, just tastes so much more 'real".  Still fills you up, but also seems to have a better vitamin profile.  This is my breakfast every day!

review/text: I was a little worried since this shake is so healthy that it might taste gross, but wow I was wrong!!  This is the best tasting and healthiest drink I have found.  The only downside is they are pretty expensive, but the quality is #1.

review/summary: Orgain Chocolate Fudge
review/text: I really like the taste of this drink over any other drink I have had like this since it does not have the synthetic taste of muscle milk or other post workout drinks. The fact that its organic makes it a healthier choice and so far I have no complaints about it. Only downside is the price but thats to be expected I suppose.

review/summary: Great product, highly reccomended!
review/text: I have been drinking Orgain pretty much since it was released on the market a couple of years ago and have really enjoyed it. Its a great alternative to all the other nutritional/protein shakes out there since it is all organic. About 4 months ago I started to have one every morning for breakfast since I am always in a rush in the morning. Since then, I have lost over 25 pounds! It is a great way to jump start my metabolism in the morning and has what seem to be the perfect ratio of fat/carbs/protein along with all the vitamins and minerals. Before I started drinking it for breakfast I would be super hungry by lunch time, but now, it holds me over really well and I can be more reasonable with my lunch portions. Overall, great product, highly recommended!

review/text: This has no hint whatsoever of chicken flavor. I've tried it with and without salt substitute and it made no difference. The most it has is a hint of celery flavor. If all you want is a celery taste, I am sure you can do it cheaper than this. I'll keep looking.

review/summary: Makes a DELICIOUS pie!
review/text: In a bowl, I mixed an 8oz. package of cream cheese, a few Tbsp. of butter, and the mix....then folded in an 8 oz. tub of cool whip and turned the mixture into a store bought graham cracker crust.  Sprinkled the crunchy chocolate topping that is included on top.  Put it in the fridge for a little bit.  And my family actually argued and bargained with each other over who got the last piece.  Heavenly!  Super easy to make!  So light and creamy, and with a lovely coffee and chocolate flavor.  A great dessert that will impress anyone that will take you minutes to prepare.  I will try the dip method next, maybe serve with graham crackers, ladyfingers, pound cake....some sort of sliced fruit?  This product is a winner!

review/summary: Very good and hottest wasabi so far
review/text: This is the third different type I've tried(Schnucks and Hapi).  They are very good, but a little crunchier/harder than the others I've had. That is the only dislike.  The hottest wasabi, but still manageable.  I like the Hapi brand a little better since they are not as hard, but these are a little cheaper so they are both great.

review/text: Great stuff!  I've had many different brands of wasabi peas, and JR is by far my favorite.  Fresh, crunchy, green and very hot (I've tried other brands that were the exact opposite of that).  Only tiny gripe is that I ordered two 5 pound bags, and was going to give one as a gift, but they sent me one humorously large 10 lb bag.  Not a big deal though, I just divided it up.  Anyway, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Yummy, Sweet and Hot, Hot, Hot!
review/text: I love wasabi peas, plain and simple, and these are absolutely wonderful. They are good sized, nice and crunchy, tangy sweet with that bite of HOT that wasabi is known for. The price is good for the amount you receive, and they taste fresh and yummy. I like the 'no MSG' aspect, because MSG gives me a headache (always has), and there are some I've seen that do have MSG in them, so it's nice to know these don't. When compared to other snacks, like chips or cookies, wasabi peas offer a kick pick-me-up snack that's much more healthful for you. Dr. Oz even said on one of his shows that they help boost metabolism, so you can't beat that! My son will even eat these peas, and he doesn't like anything green!<br /><br />These came in a bag, but it was the crinkly type of bag, that was stiff and it broke and tore, so the bag opened and spilled peas out. Fortunately, they were packed in another bag and twist-tied, and so they didn't spell out and were kept fresh.<br /><br />These are a LOT of peas in a 2lb bag... so know that you're getting a lot, and I do mean, a lot of peas. I found them flavorful, not overly hot, with just a touch of sweetness to them. I will definitely be buying these again.

review/text: I don't know if all these wonderful reviews are from people who work for this company, but I would never recommend these! I love Hapi Snack's Wasabi Peas, but they're expensive and hard to find. I was thrilled when I saw these. However, they have a strange "fake" taste and worst of all, they are like eating rocks - LITERALLY! Every fourth or fifth pea I tried to eat was a solid rock. I actually chipped my tooth. My dental work is going to cost me a lot more than what I saved on these. They're not that hot, either. If you like Wasabi Peas try some other brand. These are not worth the $11+ shipping. I've never left a negative review like this before. But buyer beware.

I recently rediscovered Instant Breakfast after having my tonsils removed as an adult and a difficult recovery period.  Even now, two years later, I have it every morning for breakfast and sometimes as lunch or a snack.  The 30 packet box is much more economical than buying at the grocery store.  Great product!!
