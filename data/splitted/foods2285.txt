review/summary: Oh my God the SALT SALT SALT! And NOT RETURNABLE!
review/text: Bought this due to a writeup in Readers' Digest plus the other reviews. But on arrival, I noticed on the package that it contains 2400 milligrams of salt! Jeez, that's even way more than Cup O Noodles, my blood pressure rose just reading that.<br /><br />To top it off, Amazon says it's not returnable, although the policy that leads to does not explain why  :-(

review/text: First you put in the frother, then the coffee.  Shouldn't it be the other way around?<br /> I tried to put the coffee in first but the machine wouldn't let me on the cafe setting.  You end up with an overly sweet cup of a milkly yucky substance.  Stay away.

review/summary: My favorite flavor so far!
review/text: This tastes very good in my opinion. I've tried a few different flavors of vue cups already. So far my favorites are the two Cafe flavors. One being the Vanilla Latte and the other being the Cappuccino. Keep in mind the cafe drinks cost twice as much, as you need to use 2 vue cups, first the frother and then the coffee. It is correct to add the frother first, as when you add the coffee the frother will float to the top. This is pretty standard (I see another user complaining about this.)<br /><br />The Vanilla flavor is very milky/sweet, which I like. If you want something that's not as sweet, try the cappuccino. The online pricing is more expensive so far (may, 2012). I got mine from BedBathBeyond and you can use the 20% off coupon that they mail you all the time, those coupons don't expire (even though it has an expiration date).

review/summary: Delicious tiny taco shells
review/text: I am so happy to find La Tiara Taco shells on Amazon! They are not available in my area and I used to buy them on ebay. While they are not considered a reduced carb product, their small size and super thin profile make them ideal for those trying to control their carbohydrate intake. 4 carbs and only 40 calories per shell. Because they are so thin they can be hard to eat without breakage, so they are not a recommended choice to serve on a first date or to impress company! But they are very tasty and a great way to add mexican food for those who are watching blood sugars or on restricted carb diet.

review/summary: Anniversary Gift
review/text: My wife loves Dubble Bubble. Things are a little tight this year so we decided not to get each other anything for our anniversay and that we'd go out for dinner and a movie instead.<br /><br />Since our anniversary is around Halloween, there's always bags of candy in every store around that time. On our day, I was picking up some office supplies at the local discount store and saw a bag of DB in with the other Halloween candy. I grabbed it cause I knew she'd like it. Just to be weird, I also picked up a little glass decorative kitchen jar and when I got home, I put 6 or 7 pieces of gum in the jar and hid the rest of the bag.<br /><br />I gave her the jar and told her that it was the bottomless Dubble Bubble Candy Dish. She thought that was kind of funny but didn't pursue the reasoning. She took a couple of pieces with her and we went out to our dinner and movie.<br /><br />She only eats a couple pieces a day, so I watched the jar and when it got down to 2 or 3 pieces, I added 4 or 5 more while she wasn't around.<br /><br />Well, the bag lasted for about a month but then I needed to replenish the supply. So I found this giant tub of 380 pieces that should last until the end of April and then I'll get another one. The bucket is great. When sealed, it keeps the bubble gum scent in and hopefully the gum fresh for 6 months.<br /><br />By the way, she's never said a word about the bottomless bubble gum jar but she eats 2 pieces a day. I've never mentioned it again either but every couple of days I add a few more pieces.<br /><br />Dubble Bubble Tub Original Flavor 380 Ct - 5 Stars!

review/summary: This is the best!
review/text: Ok, so I'm addicted to bubble gum.  I like this the best. Each piece is a decent size so I don't have to chew like a cow because there is too much gum in my kisser. It doesn't stick to my teeth like many other chewing gums do and when I'm in the mood (oh, and all alone) I can blow the greatest bubbles! Makes me feel young at heart again. Oh, did I mention I'm old??? Like almost 57  :)<br /><br />11/12/10 - back for more. Just for kicks, 2 weeks ago I decided to try that sugarless gum The Biggest Loser tv show raves about so I got both the bubble gum and the watermelon flavor. Must admit the flavors are excellent and last a long, long time. I just didn't like the texture of the gum or the way it stuck to my teeth when I tried blowing bubbles with the bubble gum. I gave it to the neighborhood kids (with their parents' permission of course) so now I'm back to order more of my favorite, never to stray again.

review/summary: Not original flavor as advertised
review/text: I recently visited a Cracker Barrel and bought a box or Dubble Bubble Original Flavor bubble gum. I remember chewing this gum as a kid, it was my favorite gum because of its great flavor. After I had a taste for the gum again, I wanted more and I am 100 miles away from the nearest Cracker Barrel, so I checked on Amazon, my go to place. I was excited to see they had it and two separate listings. One for "original" and a regular flavor. The tub that I received is not the original flavor bubble gum, even though it specifically states that it is on the product listing. This is the plain, old, gross, generic flavor they changed to a couple of years ago.<br /><br />If you are looking for the cinnamon/clove flavor you remember growing up, this is NOT the gum you are looking for, you will be disappointed.

review/summary: This is not the Fleer Dubble Bubble of old
review/text: I bought this tub expecting the nostalgic Dubble Bubble smell and taste I loved as a kid. That gum was packed in the old Fleer Baseball Card wax-packs. Concord Confections bought the rights to the name from Fleer. (Subsequently Tootsie Roll bought Concord.) Anyway, The flavor formula was changed by Concord. It's now just generic bubblegum. Not only that, the size of the gum has been reduced. With clever packaging, it looks about the same size wrapped, but the gum is no longer a solid "barrel" shape. It is now a smaller barrel with gear-like teeth around it which holds the packaging out so it seems like a substantial piece than it is. The logo is misleading too. It says, "America's Original". Well the name is the same but the product is completely different.

review/summary: Great dubble bubble if your addicted to chewing it every single day
review/text: This is an AWSOME dubble bubble gum. I order 6 dubble bubble gums. When i first got the first one in the mail, and when i opened it i was like HOLY COW WHAT A BIG TUB. No lie i literlly said that. and also my mom said WOW THATS A BIG TUB. So when i opened it was sealed like it was said. And now when i opened it, i can smell this STRONG sweet scent. It smelt AWSOME. As i opened it my mom says oooooo that smells good. I wanted to be the very first person to take two pieces and chew them. So my mom tried it, and she liked it and i LOVED IT. But after a while it does loses its taste and it goes into rubbery chew. But i dont care i really do like it. I like the taste AND the rubbery feeling too. So i chew gum constanly like i chew 6 pieces then in half hour i chew another 6 pieces or 10 and spit it out. I go over and over again. So to be honest i LOVE THIS DUBBLE BUBBLE GUM. I do really do HIGHLY recommend this to ANYONE who likes the taste and rubbery chewy gum. And to people who are addticed to gum like i am.

review/text: I decided to buy some Dubble Bubble after seeing a tub of it in the Red Sox dugout on TV.  For some reason I always thought they chewed Bazooka since that was just about all there was growing up as a kid here.  I ran out and got a couple of packs of each for my own taste test.  I gotta admit I like the DB better.  Like the other reviewer here I noticed that its not as sticky on the teeth as Bazooka.  And I actually thought it was sweeter and lasted a tad longer.  Its sorta like comparing Coke to Pepsi for their both good and very similar.  But I do have to give the final nod to DB. (Even considering you still get the Bazooka Joe comic with Bazooka.) Besides, if Dubble Bubble is good enough for the Red Sox, its good enough for me!...

review/text: Learning to cook GF has been a big adjustment.  It takes time and patience to find solutions that work.  With my wife as a Celiac it has required diligent searching for good options.  On a recent trip to Utah we picked up several New Grains GF breads and found them the best GF breads we have ever had.  I decided to pick up some of this flour and use it to see how baking some of our favorite recipes would turn out.<br /><br />The flour works well as a GF substitute for regular baking flour.  I've used it in many recipes and have been happy with the results.  As is typical for GF cooking, there's a little less of a rise in the cooking process.  I'll upload a picture from a recent Pineapple Upside down cake we cooked in a 12" Dutch oven that turned out really great as a GF desert.<br /><br />5 stars, we love having a GF flour to cook and bake with.

As usual, Numi has delievered a beautiful package and the teas are a nice selection to choose from.  I like that the box can be reused to store more tea or it may even make a good crafts storage box for buttons, beads, etc.  I will be ordering plenty more for the Holidays!

review/text: I first tried Numi at a cafe I was at in Portland and fell in love with my selection. It was their jasmine green tea. I wanted to try more flavors so decided to buy some stuff from their website. I didn't buy the portfolio on Amazon but since their site doesn't have a reviews section and I am so happy with my purchase, I thought i'd write a review on here.<br /><br />The tea portfolio comes with 30 tea bags and a variety of flavors. If you're new to tea or new to Numi, I would recommend this item. So far I like all of the flavors I've tried but my faves are the jasmine green, moroccan mint and breakfast blend.<br /><br />What's even more amazing about the portfolio is you can reuse the portfolio itself! Perfect compartments for my earrings and rings :)

review/summary: Numi  Tea Portfolio Assortment
review/text: I love this variety box of Numi Teas, especially for my bridge group or anytime I have company.  The box itself is a perfect size,lightweight and has a great snap-close lid.  My friends and I adore Numi Teas. The only thing that could be better would be a variety box with all caffeine free and low caffeine teas for the over 50 crowd.

review/summary: You Won't Be Disappointed
review/text: I've always been a fan of Numi Tea after a cousin of mine introduced me to it. Although I like all the flavors, my favorite is still Earl Gray Tea. Just love it with creamer and sugar. Whenever I try other teas, I just gotta compare them with numi tea, and the non-numi-tea falls flat and not up to par. Their teas smells so great that as soon as the tea bag dips into hot water, it's an experience by itself already.<br /><br />About the Numi Tea Portfolio - I thought it to be a good Christmas present when I saw it online, but I wanted to get a sample first before giving it as gift. Love the box that came with it. I took out the teas, put it in another container, and used the box as a jewelry box. Voila - instant organized jewelries and watches. It's really great. Whoever will get this for Christmas will surely not be disappointed.

review/text: Been giving away Numi tea products as Christmas presents for the past three years.  Glad to see the new packaging - very elegant!  The portfolio contains three of my favorite tea flavors - earl grey, jasmine green, and chamomile.  The big difference between Numi's organic teas is that they don't taste like you're drinking boiled sand like the other brands I've tried.  Thank you, Numi and Amazon for making it very convenient for me to do my Christmas shopping!

review/summary: My Favorite Things Gift
review/text: Last year I was the winner of a great Secret Santa gift of a Numi Tea sampler kit that looked similar to this item. After digging into the goods, I fell head over heels for their tea and am now absolutely addicted. I now buy their tea regularly at the store, but haven't seen this cool gift item anywhere except on Amazon.<br />I just received a personal order of this new Tea Portfolio from Amazon and have decided that this will be "the gift" that I get all my friends and extended family this year. I love having something small and simple to send out with a card; and it truly is one of my favorite things, which is always fun to share. Since everyone's knows I am a tea lover, this feels like the perfect gift from me.

review/summary: A perfect cup on a rainy day or any day
review/text: I recently bought this Numi tea portfolio because I frequent cafes and coffee shops in Oakland and have been exposed to Numi tea. My cousin was gifted a box of Mint Puerh tea from her work and upon visiting with her I have enjoyed this mint tea. I finally decided I needed my own!<br />The thing that I like most about this product is the variety. I am traditionally a black or white tea drinker and buy from tea shops such as Tevana and Lupicia for loose leaf varieties, but every so often I like the convenience and ease of a good 'ole tea in a teabag.<br />After my tea portfolio came in, I tried one tea a night for six consecutive nights. I was pleasantly suprised  and delighted by the green jasmine tea because I always was under the impression that green teas are too mild with not enough tannin. The combination of the jasmine with the green tea made it flavorful even without honey or milk.<br />My favorite tea of the assortment is the earl grey tea. It has robust flavor and the bergamot adds a calming quality.<br />Another great thing about this tea portfolio is that it can be refilled. If you so desire, you could put other selections. I think that Numi even sells tea sampler boxes.<br />This product would make the perfect gift for that favorite aunt or uncle, or for a well liked co-worker who was leaving the department on a promotion.

review/summary: Numi assortment in time for the holidays
review/text: Last year for Christmas I sent Numi tea in the wooden box to friends and family and I love that there is a new packaging option this year.  Numi is a brand that I am always proud to bring to the table after dinner.  Not only is it fair trade and organic, but Numi is a socially responsible company, giving back to the community both around the world and in Oakland.  But most of all, it is excellent tea.  When I had surgery last year the only thing that tasted good was Numi's Moroccan Mint Tea.  It is my comfort "food," especially good for a queasy stomach (or one too full of holiday goodies).  I also discovered after dozing off that it still tasted good at room temperature, and even better on ice!  I love the idea of giving a gift that also "gives back."  Buy it for yourself or as a gift...Numi is expensive tea but worth it.  This gift box is at a super price point and you get free shipping with Amazon Prime!

It's a good, high quality product, but the jar may be more than most people would use in a year or so.  If you use a lot of celery seed, it's still the best price around, and I would certainly recommend it.

review/summary: Golden Chai Must Be Experienced!
review/text: *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Golden Chai Spiced Assam Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Assam black tea, organic cinnamon, organic Chinese ginger, organic green cardamom, and organic Turkish anise. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Throughout India, chai stalls are a meeting place for provocative tea and conversation. From its homeland in China, chai has journeyed as chai, th&eacute;, and tea, recreating itself in every land. Numi's golden brewed, organic Chai fuses rich cultures in a complex and hearty Assam black tea. Indian cinnamon and mild green cardamom evoke a warm balance with the vitality of Chinese ginger. The peaked, sweet aroma of Turkish anise exhilarates memories. Reminisce in aged tradition with an inspiring cup of Golden Chai."<br /><br />Although this is a "chai", note that it contains no sweeteners...I prefer this, and the anise gives a certain type of mild sweetness, but commercial chais often have sugar added, so be prepared for a wonderful no-calorie indulgence that is beautifully flavored but not "sweet" in the same way that sugar is. Golden Chai is also caffeinated; if you want a caffeine-free chai, try Numi Tea's Ruby Chai Spiced Rooibos Herbal Teasan instead.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love chai, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****

review/text: Trying not to drink too much cappuccino, I tried Tazo chai and loved it. Bought another brand of chai and it had a strong anise(licorice) taste, which I don't like. Saw a review that Numi was better than Tazo, so had to try. Bought this Golden chai and their Rooibos chai. Both are great, not a strong anise flavor in the Golden Chai. It is not presweetened so I add stevia.  Haven't decided if I like Numi better or Tazo better but both definitely better than other chai's I have tried.

Well golly gee willikers - sign me up!<br /><br />Pretty much the only people buying this item are people who like Reese's and believe deep down that a naked Reese's cup is a happy Reese's cup. Why go and sully such delicious peanut butter by covering it in milk, dark, and white chocolates? Enter this product, which had such huge potential to make me so very fat and happy. Alas, for it has gone and made me of a sadder type of person. When I opened the box, I wasted no time in unscrewing the lid and peeling off the safety film, and in I dove with a spoon fit for a king. Unfortunately that spoon had the gall not to warn me it wasn't true Reese's peanut butter, but standard peanut butter, and in it went.<br /><br />I frantically turned to the ingredients looking for that one special ingredient that would have made it all right... There's Roasted Peanuts, Sugar, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Salt, Peanut Oil, Monoglycerides, Molasses, Cornstarch, and ... um ... nothing else. -sigh- My taste buds were right; That one ingredient that I was looking for wasn't there: Magic.<br /><br />As peanut butter goes, it's average creamy peanut butter. Good on toast with grape preserves, on crackers with honey, and on thighs. That's about it. For its' averageness I will give it 1 stars where I would otherwise give it 0. But oh... how there was such wasted potential in that jar.

review/summary: Better than Starbucks!
review/text: I love this stuff! I add sugar and half and half and get a drink that is very much like Starbucks Chai Latte. The price on the product has gone up since I ordered it on Jan. 7th 2011 -- so, I ordered the CS Indian Spice Chai tea bags instead. I put 2 teabags in MY K-Cup and it tastes exactly the same. You get 6 boxes of 20, so that is 60 servings for me (2 bags at a time) for the 13.95 (subscribe and save) these cups used to be. If I want the tea a bit stronger, I will remove the tea bags after brewing from the my k-cup and throw them in my mug. Let is steep a bit longer and it is wonderful!

review/summary: Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai
review/text: What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake.

review/summary: Delicious with 5 spice aromas, not full of sugar and cream
review/text: This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend.  There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a>.  Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea.  This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea.  You can add what you want after the fact.  I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend.

review/summary: Converted me to tea over coffee - it's that good
review/text: Before buying my Keurig brewer, I never really like black tea.  I would drink herbal tea from tme to time but black tea always seemed too bitter.  After trying Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Tea, I was instantly converted.  There is no bitter taste and it's so much less acidic than coffee and therefore much easier on my stomach.  It has a mild, slightly fruity taste that is perfect with breakfast or really anytime of day.  I've tried it plain and with a bit of milk and sugar as well.  I honestly have become more of a tea drinker than coffee drinker since trying this delicious tea.

Another plus is that you don't have to wait for the tea to brew. Using the 10oz setting is just right for me. If you want a stronger brew then use the 8oz setting.

review/summary: Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!
review/text: If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you.  If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is "this is NOT chai tea."  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called "spicy clove tea."  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.<br /><br />I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a "traditional" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.  For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the "chai" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original.

review/summary: Great for regular chai or latte
review/text: I love this chai, and it makes a much better chai latte than I've tried in any k-cup before.  To be clear, this doesn't come with powdered milk or cream, so you have to add your own cream in order to make it a latte.<br /><br />I have disliked all of the pre-mixed latte k-cups I've tried because of a combination of artificial sweatener (which they all seem to insist on adding) and the powdered creamer (which is worse than fresh).  I add my own sugar and cream to this chai, and it is delicious!<br /><br />When I tried this without cream and sugar, it tasted slightly heavy on the clove.  With the cream and sugar, though, I don't have any complaints.

review/text: I love Chai Tea.  I don't even put sugar or honey in my Chai Tea.  This was just not right.  Tasted burnt out of the keurig and the cloves are overpowering.  No amount of honey and milk could make this right for me.  I am suffering through my 24-pack and may just throw it out.  Very disappointing.  I've had this brand/flavor in the bags before (although not recently) and liked it just fine.  Even bought it multiple times.  Not sure what is not working right with the k-cup formula.

You may not prefer as weak a tea, but that can be solved by running it through only once.  It has a clean, refreshing flavor.

But this herbal tea is missing something, especially with a name like 'Authentic Green Tea'. It's pretty disappointing for the price of these things, but I'll continue to drink it until I run out.
