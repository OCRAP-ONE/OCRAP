review/summary: Cytomax Pomegranate Berry
review/text: I love the Pomegranate Berry Cytomax.  At the Death Ride, they served this drink, and I tried it for the first time.  The drink worked great and was easy to digest.  I drank it for 13+ hours while riding 129 miles and climbing 15,000 feet.

review/summary: Tastes Ok...works well
review/text: I usually carry a bottle of Cytomax when running in the hot Hawaiian sun...does a great job at replenishing fluids and electrolytes.  Works well as a recovery drink too.  Cool citrus isn't a bad flavor.  I can't say that Cytomax would stand on its own as a tasty beverage.  Nevertheless, it's a decent taste that's palatable.

review/summary: Great until they added Stevia
review/text: As a marathoner, century cyclist, and half-ironman triathlete, I've used my fair share of sports mixes.  I've been a faithful Cytomax user for several years and find that it helps me feel less sore after hard training and is easy on my stomach.  However, I noticed that my most recent bottle of Cytomax states that it includes "Stevia".  Stevia has only recently been approved by the FDA and is still not approved in Europe, and is not, as it is frequently marketed, always a natural product.  The plant itself is natural, but when used as a sweetener it needs to be treated and "messed with" to make it sweet and mask it's bitterness.  It's safety has also been debated, and given the large quantities of sports drink that I consume, that's enough for me to switch products.

review/summary: Cytomax drink good, cranberry grapefruit flavor taste like medicine
review/text: Cytomax is a good recovery drink that doesn't have as much sugar as Gatorade.  I like the fact that it reduces the lactic acid build up.  I ran the San Francisco marathon and they gave out Cytomax.  After the marathon, I was not as sore as I usually am the day after.  I think it was due to the Cytomax.  The bottled form is better than the powdered form.  I don't like the cranberry grapefruit flavor.  Try the tropical punch or the bottled form of orange or citris is better.

I went further than I had ever gone, and felt like I could just keep going (but had to stop because I ran out of daylight). This is a great product! I would highly recommend purchasing it to use for any athletic activities!

review/summary: Best Flavor, little Salt
review/text: There is a misunderstanding of what drinks should include and that can be best answered by choosing the drink that best suits your sport.  Long distance, high intensity sports need calories, salts and proteins. Weekenders rarely need calories and salts, unless they live in a high humidity area and sweat considerably.  Salts should include potassium, calcium but little sodium.  Sugars in the form of glucose or sucrose should be added but not to excess.  Stay away from corn syrups and corn additives. Having said all that, most drinks that are low in sodium salts, and neutral on calories (sugars/proteins) will provide enough nutritive additions to you while you exercise.  Keep in mind that one of the reasons you exercise is to loose weight.  If you add a bunch of calories while your exercising, your weight loss will be for naught. Stay away from sugar bars and  caffeine unless your a long distance runner and or cyclist. This CytoSport drink is a good choice for the average sportive  who does not need to supplement their diet on a routine basis.  It is also good for the high intensity sportive when they also supplement their diets with high energy food while they exercise.

review/summary: THE sports drink
review/text: I have been using this product for several years since I discovered it on Amazon.  I have GERD (esophageal reflux disease) and I can't drink formulations that either have too much sugar or too much acid.  This drink does not set me off like some of the other flavors do.  I has a very pleasant apple flavor, that you swear is real apple juice.  I usually mix two measuring cups (included) into a 70oz Camelback and place it into the fridge for my next day's ride.  The drink will stay cool for two hours.  This product does have sugars, although not much.  It has about 90 calories per measure, which is enough for a good ride around town.  If you are a marathoner, then you will need more calories and may need to suppliment your drink with power bars.  But this is enough for us casual riders.  If you don't want the calories, then you can decrease your measurements accordingly.  This is the only drink for me and I hope they never take it off the market.

review/summary: Cytomax is a great product.
review/text: I have used every energy drink and mix, every refreshing drink and mix, every replacement of salts and minerals drinks and mixes I have been able to find.  I have searched the Internet and found many drinks and mixes that claim they can replace what your body used while exercising and or in some hot athletic endeavor.  I get cramps throughout my body when I exercise, play racquetball, or am exercising on a 100+ degree day. All other products have failed in different degrees and I would still cramp up at some time. Cytomax is the only product I have used that will keep the cramps away and keep me active and playing. For me, there is no other product to use.

review/summary: How To Not Cramp
review/text: PROS:<br />- Works to prevent cramps from lactic acid.<br />- Tastes good.<br />- Dissolves easily.<br />- Lower sodium than other electrolyte products.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- More expensive than water.<br />- Heavier to carry than electrolyte pills.<br /><br />As an avid athlete for the past 30 years (mountain biker, long distance trail runner, backpacker), I didn't need an electrolyte replacement supplement until I was diagnosed with congenital hypertension and had to take a diuretic along with BP meds. The diuretic did me in on hot, sunny days during a long run or long mountain bike ride. U suffered cramps from built-up lactic acid in my muscles, a new experience for me. I could no longer run 10 miles or mountain bike 20-25 miles without replenishing my electrolytes. Even eating every half hour with water didn't cut it.<br /><br />Enter CytoMax, which I initially received as a freebie at triathlons and races. What a difference! It works great! During the summer, I'll bring along a water bottle filled with CytoMax. Its sodium content is lower than other electrolyte drinks. Its taste is easy to swallow and refreshing, unlike some of the others, too. I haven't suffered another cramp since I started using CytoMax. As recommended by the manufacturer, I drink it 30 min into my activity, and then sip it every so often till it's gone.<br /><br />I've not have a single problem with dissolving or clumping using this technique. The night before, I add about 1/4 cup of chilled water to my water bottle. I add 2 scoops Cytomax. I add more chilled water to make 14 oz fluid. Shake ~30 sec. Refrigerate overnight. The CytoMax granules completely dissolve, leaving no residue using this method. The next morning, if it's hot & sunny, I might add a few ice cubes before I hit the trails.<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE: It works. It tastes good. I'd buy it again.

I don't really know if the product is more effective than gatorade, but the large bottle is convenient for me.  I try to drink a 20oz bottle (2 scoops of mix) for every 25 miles of cycling.  The grape flavor is pleasant and dissolves easily.  Much better than the citrus I tried previously.  I will continue to try other flavors, but likely will buy the grape again.

review/summary: Solution for new formula
review/text: I debated how to rate cytomax.  I used the product in the 90's and loved it.  When I went back to it I did not like the new taste, but it does work.  I give it a 1 star for taste and 5 stars for how it works.  If they wanted to introduce a low calorie option then they should have created a new product and not change the old product.<br /><br />My solution for the taste is to add some sugar... tastes great.  Every 32oz of water I use 3 scoops of cytomax and then I ad 1 TBSP of sugar (2 if you want it super sweet).  Hope it helps you too.

Cytomax has ruined a good product with the "remake" it has imposed on its product line. It is now made with an artificial sweetener (Stevia) and has a quite different taste and different nutritional values. I will not buy this new version.

review/summary: Really helps me - 42 year old weekend warrior
review/text: I'm a bit out of shape and getting back into shape hasn't been easy with all the soreness. A friend recommended Cytomax and it has really helped. While exercising I can do more reps than in the past and when I get 6 or 7 sets deep into my workout my reps only fall off slightly compared to before I was trying Cytomax. The other day I did a workout that I'd done 2 weeks before but this time I did not use Cytomax and the soreness that I am experiencing today is unpleasant to say the least. My experiment showed me that without using Cytomax I get considerable soreness the following day(s) whereas when I did use Cytomax I had relatively little soreness. Until I get back in shape I think I'm going to need this crutch. I'm 42 years old so that means that I experience a lot more soreness than a younger athlete. Someone younger and in better shape may not notice such a difference.

review/text: I'm not an endurance cyclist/runner, but I was pointed to this by one. I was looking for a carbohydrate/electrolyte product more effective than Gatorade, mainly for lifting, and occasionally cardio-intensive sports.<br /><br />I don't have any grand insight to offer, but can vouch that it does what it's supposed to do. I'm able to work out longer (~2 hours on a consistent basis) without experiencing symptoms of dehydration now, than when I didn't take this and either drank only water, or water and Gatorade (feeling mild nausea + dizziness past ~1.5 hours).<br /><br />It should also be noted that there's drastically less sugar/sodium per gram of carbs in this than Gatorade. This might not be important to everybody, but another of the reasons I wanted an alternative to Gatorade is that sodium is a migraine trigger for me.<br /><br />Cool Citrus tastes like soap, Tropical Fruit tastes like shampoo. Both of these tastes are mild, and between them I prefer the Tropical Fruit.

review/summary: Great Product ... poor followthrough by Seller
review/text: I have used several energy/recovery/hydration drinks in the past (Gatorade, Heed, etc.), and Cytomax seems to provide the best solution for me.  I play soccer regularly and am older (in my 50's).  Since moving to Phoenix I have found that I am pretty much nutrient starved and dehydrated by the end of play and suffer from lactic acid build up.  The night I play and the next day take their toll on me.  I've found that these effects are greatly reduced if I drink Cytomax during and shortly after play.  For post recovery I usually take in 30 to 40 grams of protein (muscle milk or protein powders) and find this definitely reduces post-exercise "pain."  I believe in this product. It also keeps my energy level up as I play.<br /><br />However, I recently purchased Cytomax from Direct Supercenter.  I made the purchase on May 2.  On May 9, I received a note from Amazon that no shipment had yet been made.  I contacted the seller through Amazon asking about shipment and an expected delivery date, only to get a request asking about my experience in purchasing the product.  Okay ... two-and-a-half  weeks later, still no word from the seller about shipping, so I finally cancelled the order (May 18). This is a common product.  I am greatly dissatisfied with the seller and will no longer conduct business with them.  As for Cytomax, I think it's a great product.

The GoGrape is a little less present.  They're both tasty though.  With the orange I use 1 scoop for training and the recommended 2 scoops for races and flavor is great - 1 scoop doesn't taste weak or watered down (despite actually being watered down).  With grape, unless I use 2 scoops it tastes weak.

It's one of the better tasting powders and it allows me to drink coffee (which I like), for caffeine, and then rely on this Cytomax for energy throughout the workout, plus ease the acid build-up in the muscles that can make you want to puke. Make leg and intense workouts easier. I don't see the point in having the caffeine in the drink when the caffeine will not really get into the system until your workout is almost done. I tend to drink some caffeine half an hour before the workout and then use the Cytomax during the workout.

review/summary: Taste Good, Not Filling
review/text: The one thing that I look for in a drink is that it tastes good.  I know you take that for granted when you buy anything that has flavor, but I have purchased some drinks that taste like swamp water, or worse.  All of the Cytomax drinks that I have tried taste good.  Now some exercise aficionado's will swear that you need this ingredient or that protein in your drinks.  For most weekend warriors and part-time athletes all you need is a good replacement drink without a lot of salt.  Being a heart patient, I need to restrict salt in my diet. While there is still quite a bit of sodium in this drink, it is not overpowering and doesn't stay with you when you stop exercising. A little bit of salt in your drinks goes a long ways.  The Cytomax company may not be as famous as some of the big boy's, but I have used they're products for 20 years and swear by them.  And I think you will too. The other great flavor is apple.  I really like that one.

review/summary: Cytomax Performance Drink
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G72384">CytoSport Cytomax Performance  Drink Mix, Cool Citrus, 4.5-Pound Jar</a> Cytomax performance drink is a good multi purpose sports drink for before, during and after excercise. It provides electrolytes without adding a lot of sugar. There are other drinks that may be better at energy or recovery but the cytomax is a good value. It's cheap enough to drink everyday; mix it in a gallon water container and leave in the refrigerator. It doesn't break down or get sticky.

review/summary: Acid buffering works wonders
review/text: I'm 6'7 with a very short torso, mostly legs. When doing weight training on leg days, I would literally get sick to my stomach after heavy leg presses. I suspected it was do to acidification of the muscles moving into the blood stream. I did some research and found cytomax. I don't think it tastes very bad at all, if you don't like it, try a different flavor. I start drinking it about 30 minutes before workout on an empty stomach, and it seems to assimilate into the blood quickly.<br /><br />I've definitely noticed that workouts are less painful, more productive and I don't get sick to my stomach anymore. This is one product that delivers on it's promises and then some.

review/text: I started drinking cytomax at a friend's recommendation and I've never gone back to gatorade or the similar drinks.  The first thing I noticed is that its not packed with the high fructose corn syrup that's found in so many popular drinks.  Keeps me going through hours of workout or basketball with the same hydration as gatorade, if not better.  And as you're mixing it yourself at home, it ends up costing a lot less as well.

Other flavor tried was orange which did nothing for me.  If you use cytomax you will not need to wash down those clumpy gels.  Try mixing two bottles and freezing one of them.  It is a tasty treat about one hour into a long bike ride.

review/text: I have used this product for about 9 months now. I got it originally for high-altitude hikes in the backcountry during the winter months. It allowed me to ride and hike longer than originally.<br /><br />In the gym it works very well too. I am in the gym around 6am and it will help you get through a hard workout and even maybe let you work harder than you want at times because the lactic acid isn't building up as quick.<br /><br />I believe it is a wonderful product. I have tried both the tangy orange and lemonade. Both taste great but prefer the lemonade because it's a bit more subtle in taste.

Cytomax does exactly what it says it does, it does cut the burn, and definately helps you even out your peformance in those longer workouts.  Best of all it tastes pretty good.  I have no complaints in the taste, and I love the boost to the performance I receive.

review/summary: Cytomax is very misleading in stating and not stating ingredients
review/text: I just canceled an order for Cytomax because after researching it more on various sites, including their own, I find Cytomax to be very misleading concerning ingredients in their product.  I contacted their customer service department and the words "herbal lift" mean caffeine.  Why don't they just say what it is....caffeine?  Why do they hide the fact that certain flavors have caffeine in them?  Reason:  Some people won't buy sports drinks with caffeine in them.....me being one of those people.  Some flavors contain guarana extract.  Look it up...it has a very high caffeine content.  In summary, I simply don't trust Cytomax as a company.  If I have to search for the truth, it's the same as them not telling the truth to me.  To try to bring my impressions to conclusion, I called Cytomax on the number listed on their website and their customer service people are very evasive or not able to address my questions about what is in their product to back up their anecdotal evidence listed on their website.  They transferred me to their sales manager who is an "avid cyclist", got voicemail and no return phone call.  If you want to know what you're really putting in your body, don't buy Cytomax.

review/summary: Dissatisfied with New ACS Additive
review/text: Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now.  Tried Accelerade 4 years ago, but whey, a dairy product in Accelerade, caused stomach cramping, which was why I preferred Cytomax.  Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax.  Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.  Who knows?<br /><br />I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula.  As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon.

review/summary: Great Grape!
review/text: First I have to say that I have tried many products before Cytomax. But coming out of the gate, it was hands down a good value and a product that could keep me going for hours on my bicycle. I ride around 3500-4000 miles a year, and that isn't always easy at my age. I found this product kept me going throughout the ride and also helps with leg pains more than any other product I have tried. This summer I went on a 100 mile charity ride in 90 degree southern US temperatures and I was amazed at how well I felt at the end of the ride. My long quest for an energy supplement is done. I am about to order my third 4.5 pd jug of Cytomax. I prefer the grape above the other two I have tried (Lemonade, Tropical). I smell the grape before I drink and it makes me smile I think. I certainly drink more water because I enjoy the flavor and anything that helps to remind you to drink more while on the road is a good thing. One last thing that makes Cytomax a good value is that you can dilute the product on the not so hot days, like below 80, when you do not sweat as much. Thereby saving 50% costs of the product and still feel energized. Hope this helps!

review/text: I've been using Cytomax for a very long time now and still love it.  I mainly use it for weightlifting and it keeps my hydrated and reducing lactic acid burn to allow for a better workout.  The taste of the different flavors is good enough since you're not using this for taste.  By no means is it bad or just tolerable, but if you want taste go for the more mainstream products out there (Gatorade).  I highly recommend this for weight training as it makes a significant different for me.

review/summary: Just try it- you'll never work out agian with out it!!
review/text: I tried this stuff oh 15 years ago when I was hiking, biking, climbing, anything outdoors all the time. I thought it was a great way to stay hydrated and avoid the soreness the day after a good work out.<br /><br />But now that I am in my mid 30's and 5 kids later...I HAVE TO HAVE it!! I make a bowl of oatmeal (using water) before my rides 3 x's a week and instead of adding more water or milk I just put a squirt of the lime citrus in with my water bottle (that is going with me on my ride) and enjoy my pre work out snack. Then I drink it on my 20 mile ride and I have yet to be sore. Not that my muscles aren't "tight" I can tell that I took on some hills, but not sore so I can't use my legs the next day.<br /><br />Just try it. You can always send it back, but if you are serious about working out, sweating, pushing past the burn and tired of FEELING the burn the next day. Just get some. YOu'll be a lifer like me!<br /><br />I ran a relay race last year with 11 other woman who I have hooked on the stuff. Yeah. 11 new Cytomax groupies:)<br /><br />I mix up two scoops in my 24 oz water bottle every ride. I don't like it cold, but my sister (who like the pomegrante something) likes it chilled. To each their own.  Read up on it. It's gooooood stuff and this is the best price I've found for the 4.5 lbs size!<br /><br />Enjoy your work out!!

review/summary: One of the best tahini's
review/text: I have had tried about a million brands of tahini over the years and this is probably the best I have tried. Most tahini's are bitter but this one isn't. It almost has a lightly salty taste, but it is 100% sesame seed. It is even good enough to eat straight on toast, which I never liked before. I don't know what they do to make it taste better than most, maybe the ground the seeds are grown in?!<br /><br />When I was trying to turn my family on to tahini I made sure I gave them some of the Roland brand because I didn't want them to get turned off by tahini forever by giving them a more bitter brand.<br /><br />This brand does not exactly get oil settling on the top but it does have thicker tahini settle a little on the bottom. It ends up being a little runny in comparison to most tahini's because of this. You might try shaking it or even better stirring it a little to balance out the tahini and add the thickness from the bottom.<br /><br />I have ordered this brand and other tahini's here, from Amazon, and have yet to have the mess others have claimed. But, I have had one or 2 issues with other products here and Amazon was always really quick to resolve the problem.<br /><br />I have a feeling by the taste that this tahini is roasted even though there is no mention of that. So, if you prefer raw tahini you might not want this one. If you don't mind that it might not be raw then I highly recommend you give this brand a try!

review/summary: Made from ROASTED sesame seeds, not raw, poor packaging, great Amazon service
review/text: This Tahini is ok.  I would've given it 3.5 stars if that was an option.  That said, nothing amazing about it.  Like some other reviewers, I had a cracked bottle that leaked the stuff all over.  Went on chat with Amazon support and got an overnight replacement.<br /><br />The stuff itself is ok, pretty liquidy, so it has to to be fresh--old stuff usually settles and appears dry on the bottom with oil on top.<br /><br />The taste was alright, not great, not bad, and not bitter.  But I wish they had mentioned that it was made from roasted sesame seeds.  I much prefer it raw as it is both healthier and tastier.  There is a brand they sell at a local Wholefoods, but that's $10 for a 1 pound jar.<br /><br />Overall, a decent product and great Amazon service, but I will not be buying this brand anymore unless they start producing the tahini made from raw sesame seeds.

review/summary: Fresh/Not settled & great price!
review/text: I usually purchase Roland Tahini in one of two stores nearby.  Neither had it in stock for a month+, so I decided to turn to Amazon, which had it priced more competitively anyway.  Store bought Tahini was always settled with a very thick (impossible to stir) clump at the bottom.  The shipment from Amazon arrived fresh & stirred - no clump!  Excellent product & great price!

review/summary: For making Humus
review/text: I love Humus. I have made my own for a long time. But where I llive it is hard to find the Tahini in the stores. I have in the past had to get my daughter to buy it for me because she lives in a larger city. I was very pleased when I got this. It is very tasty straight from the container. Makes delicious Humus! The container is plastic so no chance of it breaking in transit. A worth while purchase without a doubt! I highly recommend.

review/summary: wonderful tahini
review/text: You know the drill: you come back from the store with a brand new jar of tahini, you pop the lid open, have a taste of the precious tahini paste, anticipating creamy goodness... only to be greeted by bitter sesame flavor. Well, not with Roland tahini. I have been through 6 jars so far and not one has tasted bitter yet. Roland tahini is almost sweet (try it on toast with maple sugar flakes, delicious!), a little thinner than other brands, but consistent with the texture I experimented in Turkey. Bonus points: the jar is not filled completely so it is easy to mix the paste when it separated. The price is excellent on Amazon, especially when you combine "subscribe and save" discount with seasonal Roland discounts. Oh, and as far as packaging is concerned, my latest delivery came safely, no sesame paste spill on my carpet :)

review/summary: Good Flavor-Thinner than paste...
review/text: Product has great flavor. Came seperated in jar so requires good stirring to mix back to orig consitancy.  Once mixed thoroughly, it is about consistancy of warm loose peanut butter.  Used it in Teryaki chicken rice bowl.  Really gave a nice mellow sesame fragrance.  Like it better than using toasted sesame oil for this dish. Simple stripped chicken from grocery store roatiserie chicken, Gen Tso sauce, Teryaki Gormet Stir Fry sauce and a heaping teaspoon of Roland Tahini.  served over Coconut Jasmine rice.  Excellent light and quick meal.

review/summary: Horribly bitter
review/text: I bought this to defeat my sweet tooth (advice from Victoria Buchenko) and I found this tahini to be completely unpalatable due to its strong bitter taste. I had hoped to use tahini to replace dairy in recipes (by making sesame milk with it of course) but that will be impossible with this particular brand. For now I'll have to find ways to use it look for a better tasting tahini.

review/text: I didn't have the bad experience with my bottles: they've arrive VERY WELL WRAPPED, with SEALED BOTTLES, no leaks at all. I was curious about the product, once it is so much less expensive than the ONLY BRAND COMPETITOR around here. It TASTES MUCH BETTER THAN THE more expensive!!! Yes!!! It tastes a little MORE TOASTED and it makes the taste GREAT!!! I've bought RAW seeds and the package has instructions to place them in the oven and toast them before making the tahini with the oil. The person who wants raw seed probably never read the package instructions. Your tahini has THE GREATEST TASTE ON THE MARKET!!!! Thanks for such good quality!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOUR PRODUCT!!!!

review/summary: Shipping is a challenge
review/text: I bought this along with some arborio rice. The rice and the tahini were placed in a box and an airpack placed on top. So there was lots of room inside the box and the packing wasn't secure. During shipping, one of the jar tops of the tahini came off, soaking the box and its contents in tahini. I contacted customer service and they sent another shipment of tahini. It was apparently packed the same way and arrived in the same condition, leaking tahini. I did not open the box and refused to accept it and FedEx sent it back. I again contacted customer service, told them I was done with the exercise and they issued a credit. The tahini itself is acceptable but buying this from Amazon is not worth the effort.

review/text: I have been purchasing these acai scoops for over a year now and I am still as pleased as day 1.  I will estimate that I have ordered at least 6 jars.  I have to take with a good juice or fresh veggie juice from my Jack L. juicer; I would never even think about taking with just plain water, it's a pretty rich powder.  This acai gives me a natural boost of energy plus the antioxidant benefits.  I truly am a fan of this product and will continue to buy as long as I see the benefits.

review/text: I don't know that I noticed more energy, but probably more focus... especially when it came time for sleep. I found myself getting some deep sleep as opposed to my typical tossing and turning. Perhaps because of a day being more focused? Dunno... but that was only taking one dose a day. I'll try one in the morning and at night to see how that works.<br />As far as the taste goes... I'd take mine with yogurt and couldn't taste anything other than the yogurt. I think people complaining about it having a "dirt taste" are probably the rare case or thinking about it a bit too much.

review/summary: Doesn't mix well, tastes bad, notice no benefits
review/text: I went into this product with high hopes, but came out feeling like I was duped.  First off, if you put this just in water, it tastes absolutely terrible.  Might as well throw some stevia in there.  Also, this stuff will cake on the sides of any glass or water bottle you put it into.  Doesn't mix well at all.<br /><br />Lastly, all this "ORAC" hype, yet I noticed absolutely zero benefits of taking it.  I noticed about the same effects I would get if I ate a strawberry.  ONE strawberry.<br /><br />Overhyped, overpriced product.  Spend your money elsewhere.<br /><br />Update: 2/24/12: Sambazon must've changed the formulation.  The powder dissolves A LOT better than it used to. I got my hands on this product again after my original review, and I find that it mixes pretty well now.  It's still a little gritty, but not terribly bad.  Almost unnoticeable in a protein shake.  Problem is, this formula is only a 3g serving size.  That's 1 scoop.  When you use the frozen Acai packs, it's 25g.  Yes, a lot of that 25g is water, so you have to subtract some, but let's say it's 50% water, for arguments sake.  That will means 1 frozen pack is equivalent to 4 scoops of this Acai powder.  Since I realized that, I've been using 2-4 scoops of this stuff in a smoothie. NOW I feel the benefits.  1 scoop is nothing, and shouldn't be the serving size.  I recommend people start with 2 and work up to 4 scoops in their smoothies.  Then you'll notice the Acai benefits, if you didn't feel them before.

review/summary: Surprisingly ineffective compared to cheaper brands...
review/text: It tastes allright, but that's not why we use it.  Acai berries are famous for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect.  I was used to Acai and its effects--I started with MonaVie Active Juice, and it changed my and my husband's lives.  The recession hit and we started looking around for a substitute.  The supermarket liquid brands were worthless and tasted awful.  Then we found Vitamin World Acai powder, which tasted fine, and amazingly we felt even better than we had on MonaVie!  But Vitamin World discontinued it and we were crushed.  We tried the Sambazon, which has been hyped tremendously, figuring it should be at least as good as the VW version.  But no--it doesn't mix well, the flavor isn't quite as good, and worst of all, my pain was back!  I have found a supply of the VW type, but it appears to be limited.  I don't know how I'll get by after that.  Homeopathic Arnica <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020HTTS">Hyland's - Arnica Montana 30x, 250 tablets</a> helps.

review/summary: A Bit Bitter, But Great Overall
review/text: I was a bit wary when buying this product because I heard how nasty this stuff was, but it wasn't as bad as I expected. The main reason why I purchased this, however, was because of all the scientific articles published in the past about Acai Berry. With a simple search (on google scholar for example), there is a sufficient amount of evidence published indicating the high amount of antioxidants in Acai Berry extract. For those of you who don't know, antioxidants are extremely helpful in reducing various forms of cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, the nutrition label indicates that it contains omega 3 and 9, which are also found in fish oil, an extremely useful supplement to reduce cardiovascular disease as well. The following are a few recommendations to summarize:<br /><br />Recommendations:<br />-DO NOT mix with cold water, it won't dissolve fully. Furthermore, don't mix with water in general, it tastes really nasty. I'd recommend adding it as a supplement to a yogurt or smoothie, it tended to drown the taste away while getting the full benefits.<br />-Make sure to refrigerate after opening, the statement was not very large when I first opened it.<br />-Take between a half to full scoop (provided in jar) rather than the recommended 1-2 scoops. Adding more than 1 scoop will really drown away the taste of what ever liquid you are adding to.

If you are looking for a miracle potion, it doesn't exist. However, I highly recommend acai powder with sensible diet/exercise. I have been using the Sambazon brand because it's not overpriced like Monavie, and is easy to add to my smoothie. The slightly bitter taste doesn't bother me and is not even noticable when mixed w/ fresh spinach, banana, mango, blueberry, strawberry, and rasberry.<br /><br />Results speak for themself: it is now early august...in 7 months I went from 165lbs to 140lbs of lean muscle. My skin has cleared up completely and I feel great. Remember, gradual change will come with patience and lifestyle change.

review/summary: More powder sticks to the cup than goes into my body
review/text: The powder does not dissolve at all in milk or water.  More powder is lost sticking to the sides of the cup than what is actually consumed.  I could probably do better eating the powder dry.  Very disappointing, both practically, and physically.

review/summary: Taste horrible. Only 50% is soluble.
review/text: Luckily I bought it when the price on Amazon was $5.25. It taste horrible. It's only drinkable when I mixed it with Gatorade. Only half of the powder dissolves while the other half cannot. I would give it one star, extra star is for the assumed health benefits.

review/summary: Orac Amazing Acai
review/text: This is the top of the Acai products. I really noticed a difference in my inflammation! It was very reduced! I heal quicker and it managed to add to my already great diet. I mix this in with my blueberry smoothie to boost it. My daughter and husband drink it. Knowing my kid is getting her anti oxidents regardless is great! This is the best product at the best price!

review/summary: Sleeping problems? Gone!
review/text: I heard some amazing things about this particular product on a forum website so I decided to purchase it.<br /><br />Weight loss? I am already a healthy eater and dieter, so I'm losing weight regardless. But this product completely took away my sleeping problems. I wake up about 4-5 times a night. After the first day of using this product in my morning drink I slept soundly the whole night, and continued to sleep wonderfully as I used it.<br /><br />Energy? It replaced coffee for me. It keeps me energized and I'm surprised. I haven't felt this good since high school.<br /><br />Texture? It doesn't dissolve. It's definitely kind of gritty in a sense, but I like the texture to be honest. It tastes pretty interesting. I add two scoops to 4 ounces of unsweetened plain soy milk and a small amount of artificial sweetener and drink it like a long shot.<br /><br />Would buy over and over and over again.

review/summary: Delicious Acai bowl recipe
review/text: When I first bought this, I would use it to mix into blended protein drinks. It worked well, but I couldn't really taste it. Then my husband created a simple recipe that's really delicious and he has one for "dessert" every night. Greek yogurt (we use low fat or non-fat), one scoop of Acai, a handful of frozen blueberries, a handful of almonds (roasted, but not salted), a little bit of granola, a little bit of muesli, a splash of juice (we use either grapefruit), and then a splash of milk. Stir gently by hand, and then you have an amazingly delicious Acai bowl that's low fat, high in protein, and full of vitamins and antioxidants. Delicious!
