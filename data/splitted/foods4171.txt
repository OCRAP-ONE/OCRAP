review/summary: Ecstasy for cats
review/text: My cat didn't take to most of the catnip sold at petsmart and petco, so I tried this one, and she still just doesn't care for catnip I guess. But my friend's cat rolls around like hes in ecstasy and cant stop meowing. Guess it all depends on the cat. Smells better than the non organic stuff too.

review/summary: Good Stuff, but OVERPRICED
review/text: I was surprised when the catnip arrived to find it was only a one ounce tin.  The listing did not say how much was in the tin (my fault I guess). I just found the same size tin of this same catnip at a high end natural food store for only $4.95.  This is good stuff, but overpriced and can probably be found locally for a lot less.

review/text: Whew! This stuff is potent! You will smell the herb as soon as you open the can. I sprinkled a few pinches on the rug for my cat and she rolled in it all week. So a neater alternative is to stuff a tablespoon or two of it in an old sock and tie it off with a small zip tie. Great toy, lasts a very long time. Four stars instead of five because it's a little more expensive than what I would normally spend.

review/summary: This Catnip Has Rendered My Cat Helpless
review/text: My cat has become hopelessly addicted. First she sniffs it, then she nibbles some, then she rolls in it while drooling the entire time.<br /><br />Pro: This is hilarious to watch<br /><br />Con: My cat drools so much over it she leaves a small puddle<br /><br />Overall: Definitely worth a try. And it's organic, so that's an even better reason to try it.

review/summary: Sojos Certified Organic Catnip
review/text: Sojos Certified Organic Catnip:<br /><br />I've been using catnip as a treat for my cats for years, but I never really paid much attention to the quality until I started using the Sojos Brand.  All catnip looks relatively the same to me, but I should have really paid more attention to what my cats were telling me.  What I do is put a little amount inside a zip-lock plastic bag, then place the cat toys inside with the catnip and shake the bag.  This gets the odor-flavor-scent of the catnip on the cat toys and the cats play with their toys more aggressively and for a longer time.  They use more of that pent-up energy.<br /><br />What I did notice from using just a generic brand that the cats soon lost interest in the toys that they were playing with after the catnip shake-up in the plastic bag.  This cycle of play continued until I decided to try another catnip brand.  Sojos Certified Organic Catnip is only slightly more expensive, but it was worth the shot.  I wanted my cats to enjoy their toys and to use some of that hunting instinct that's in all cats, in a more constructive manner.  By using this hunting instinct a cat feels more like a cat and is a happier cat.  One of a cat's purposes in life has been fulfilled.  They feel more confident, their tails are up in the air, and they don't use you for their hunting instinct.  Which mean less scratches to you and your cat opens up for petting, especially when they expose their underside to you for a quick petting.<br /><br />When you own a cat you have to have things around the house that makes your cat a confident, well balanced mentally, playful, and wanting to be around you as your protector.  The Sojos Catnip works very well to help give your cat a feeling of confidence.  Thus, your relationship with your cat is better for you and definitely better for your cat.  This catnip works well for a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Addendum:  9/17/11  I've ordered this catnip several times and when the package arrives at the door, my cats let me know the catnip has arrived.  My cats will pace at the door and make a figure 8 and their tails will be straight up in the air, noses sniffing at the door, with a specific cheerful speech announcing to me that I need to open the door.  After I open the shipping package, they play for hours with the box.  This catnip is that good.  I've never seen that type of response to a catnip product as I do with Sojos Certified Organic Catnip.  For playful, cheerful, energetic cats all I can say is the proof is in the cats response.

review/text: Wow, this is the best catnip I bought and I just bought it to qualify for free shipping. My cats absolutely love it, more than any catnip I ever bought before. Even the fresh one i had growing in a planter. My male cat will chase me as soon as I open the bag. He can smell it all the way from upstairs. A little goes a long way. Normally we'll refill their catnip toys about every two months and about every week or to I will rub just a little pinch on the toys and cat tree. Wouldn't buy another one ever again. Kitties give it 20 paws.

review/summary: Great Quality, Somewhat Pricy
review/text: I have two cats, and they seem to like this catnip better than any other I have tried (including Whole Food catnip).  The herb looks and feels very nice and does not have sharp bits that can hurt your fingers when you crush them or the cats when they eat them.  I only wish it was a bit less expensive--it comes in a fancy can, which looks great but cats don't care about the can and it is not particularly useful to keep after using up the herb.  It would be good if there was an option to buy this product in bulk at a cheaper price.

review/text: I purchased this catnip for my cat's Christmas stocking (I guess I am one of "those" people) and my cats were able to smell it through the SHIPPING box it came in! The second I got it in the house, they were all over the box, rubbing and rolling. Once the catnip was actually out of the box, they couldn't get enough. I actually have to store it on the top shelf in a closed cupboard so they can't get to it.

review/summary: WAS great, but no longer
review/text: This is a new review - the stuff i ordered last Christmas was WONDERFUL, so I ordered two cans to make catnip toys for the 12 or so cats I know. I opened this up, and my cat who loved the last tin had no reaction. The new stuff has a difference color and appearance. Putting them right next to each other, they only show interest in the old stuff. The catnip toys also have no affect on them, which means I wasted my time making them and there will be a lot of bored cats this year when they open their presents. Rubbing it between my fingers didn't make it fragrant enough for them to care either.<br /><br />I am leaving some out on a little tray for them and I've seen them walk up and munch it a couple of times now over a week, but it's more like when you go browse in the fridge cause you're bored so you put something in your mouth, not eating something because you're hungry and it's really appealing, if you know what I mean. So what I have will last a very very long time, I will probably order it one more time when I run out to see if next year's crop is closer to the original tins I purchased.<br /><br />(note: my MIL claims her cats are into the toys I made them, so I don't know if they aren't as picky as my cats or she said that to spare my feelings)<br /><br />Old Review: When they stopped selling cosmic catnip at Petco I went in search of a new catnip. I have three cats, and one of them is a fiend, the other two don't care so much. We tried one that I ended up finding bugs in several months later :(. I got some of this for my MIL's cats last Christmas, and a tin for us, and the fiend loves it, and one of the cats that only ate catnip if I spent a lot of time smooshing it between my fingers for him to increase the smell actively eats this catnip without me trying to coerce him, so I am really happy and impressed with this brand.

review/summary: Kitties love Sojos!
review/text: I have been working on toilet training my two cats.  I have been using cat nip to allure them to the litter in the toilet training seat.  I started by using Sojos at first and they LOVED it.. and they were successfully attracted to going in the toilet.  When I ran out, I switched to a different brand not thinking it would make any difference.  However, my cat, Gypsy, started going not in the toilet, but around the house in places that were quite unpleasant to find kitty pee.  So I switched back to the Sojos cat nip and they are loving it still and doing great with training! I definitely recommend this product for any cat looking to have a wild time (and hopefully end up with a litter free house!)

review/text: Since I learned what an excellent tea this steeps, I've been delighted by the painless new way to subdue excitable houseguests, burdensome blood relatives, and overzealous Girl Scouts (not so for all door-to-door salesmen, as the Mormons I've tried this on have promptly but politely refused).  As far as my cat Klaus is concerned, he, like me, is just relieved no longer to have to wait for shipments of the "medicinal" stuff from our friends in post-Totalitarian Eastern Bloc countries, where you can get it without the fancy packaging for just a few zloty (and far more potent).  Regardless, it has done the inconquerable task of keeping Klaus's anxiety to a manageable level, and I am enjoying it with two lumps and just a splash of almond milk.  Cheers.

review/summary: Best catnip I have ever used...
review/text: Picked this up for our cats and amazingly all four have gone nuts for it. I gave our cat Moe a whiff of the can and and he proceeded to follow me around until I rubbed a small amount on a small soft toy which he then made out with for twenty minutes! Lilly one of our other cats rolled around in bliss with her toy for about ten minutes! :)<br /><br />One little tip for catnip is pinch a little between your fingers and mash it between them a little (like you do with dried spices) it helps release some of the nature oils and scent. Then rub it on a toy and watch the cuteness!<br /><br />Also I seen someone complain about volume of the catnip, I think they may have been using the catnip themselves as my can came filled to the top with catnip. It's a terrific price to volume product as a small vial of catnip costs around $2 at the local store, And unlike that cheap store bought catnip the Sojos looks fresh has a strong smell and drives our cats crazy!

review/text: Delivery was on time. This catnip actually works and my cats cant get enough. I have bought all types of catnip at dollar stores and grocery stores and none of it worked. I didnt have high hopes for this product to work because i thought my cats werent responsive to nip, but boy was i wrong. This is a must buy for cats that have not been responsive to other brands of catnip. I beleive that Sojos may be the strongest and best catnip to buy and if your cat does not respond to this catnip, chances are that your cat may not be responsive to catnip. This is some good stuff and my cats love it.... Puff Puff Pass kitties. 5outof5

review/text: This is a smallish can with fluffy catnip that seems to be pretty potent. Judging from my uptight Siamese rolling around on the floor, I give this four stars. Be careful opening up the can. The stuff is in a plastic baggy with a twist tie. You will want to keep the stuff in the plastic bag until at least its half gone. You really need to pack it back in the can carefully the first few uses. A little pricey for the amount, it is still good stuff, gift worthy for the tin as it can be reused. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>

review/summary: My cats were un responsive
review/text: I've had cats my whole life and Catnip is a mysterious thing that I sure don't understand.  They say not all cats are affected (which could be a made up lie someone in the catnip industry created) so you never know if its the cat or the catnip brand or maybe the cat just needs to be in the mood.  All I can tell you is this:  My neighbor bought some catnip and gave me some for my cats.  My cats went crazy! The female rolled in it over and over.  So I ordered some of my own. Only I couldn't remember what my neighbor brought so I ordered this one, the sojos. the Sojos did nothing at all for my cat. Sure, it was fragrant, but the cat wasn't interested.  I have ordered the exact same brand my neighbor brought over (frontier) and when it comes I will update this after the kitties try it.  I will find out if kitties are particular to brand or if they need to be in a catnip mood.

review/text: I bought a bag of the Sojos dog food for my golden retriever on Amazon recently, and on a whim, picked up a tin of catnip for some friends who were visiting from out of town.  Their cats are seniors and have tried many types of catnip over the years.  This is an excerpt of the e-mail I received from my friend when they got home and gave their cats the Sojos catnip:<br /><br />"I have *never* seen the cats respond to catnip the way they did to the tin you gave me!  They were fighting over it like I had just laid out a tray of mice and still-wriggling tuna.  I had to get out a second plate just to keep the yowling down.  And after, they went outside and rolled in the dirt for several hours, purring and completely stoned.  I brought a plate out with a little left, and the picture of &lt;names omitted> shows how much she liked rolling all over that as well."<br /><br />Now I'm trying to think of who else I know with cats that I could give this to at Christmas!

review/text: First took a chance on Sojos to help fill a minimum order with Amazon and found it's definately the cats favorite catnip. They just go crazy for it, and the airtight can keeps it nice and fresh. I haven't seen it at any of my local stores, so I will keep ordering it from Amazon.

review/text: I've ordered this a few times, and the cats loved it. It used to be a nice green color, with plenty of buds, basically very good quality. Unfortunately, the last one I ordered was of completely different quality. It was dark green, and finely ground up, and basically looked like dust. I'm returning my last order. Not sure if it was a fluke or if the product has been changed. I'd buy it again if it was the same stuff as before..

review/summary: As noted by someone else: PRIMO CAT WEED!!
review/text: I have one cat.  I've bought him cat nip toys, and a variety of other loose nip products.  The toys always wear out fast.  Loose leaf cat nip has always been the best of the bunch and this is far and away at the top of the charts of what I've seen.<br /><br />This comes in its own little tin, when you open it there is a plastic baggy which looks for all the world like marijuana.  At first glance, I was somewhat disappointed, it looks exactly like all the other dried catnip I've purchased except for it was a lighter, brighter hue of green, and I thought I was getting more than what I did.<br /><br />However, I had my initial impression quickly reversed.  I have a strategy for nip, where I have an old cardboard box and I pull out a pinch or two and grind it between my fingers letting it rain down in the box (an old LCD/HDTV monitor box, so it's big, shallow, and flat) evenly like feeding a gold fish.<br /><br />My cat was on it immediately, began rolling around in it, licking it off his fur etc, and then going nuts.  He was so high on this stuff he can actually get distracted and will chase a laser pointer like it's a stray in heat until something shiny catches his eye and then he has all the adhd of a 10 year old anime addict.<br /><br />Despite my thoughts that I didn't get much, I've had this stuff since around Christmas '09.  I haven't even used half of it yet and I regularly treat him to it.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!!!

We Love it so much she gets it for a special treat once a week or so on her scratcher. I have tried other kind of organic catnip even from other local specialty pet stores but she just ignores them and I end up returning them. Wayyy worth $10 every few months!!!

review/text: This is an excellent quality store bought catnip. My cat (who is quite fussy about his catnip) immediately went for the Sojo. It is not as potent as freshly dried homegrown, but it is one of the better catnips out there and it's organic. This catnip is not as stalky as some store bought catnip can be, nor is it colored to make it appear darker in color.<br /><br />May only complaint is that I wish I could buy this in a larger tin!

review/summary: at this price point, shouldn't it work as advertised?
review/text: I am new to being a cat-mom but not so new that I haven't figured out a cat will often/likely behave exactly the *opposite* of how you might expect. I guess my kitty is trying to tick-off the folks at Sojos by feigning complete indifference to their hand-harvested catnip product.<br /><br />I *swear* I heard this cat laughing at me from his litter box when he found out that I bought one organic brand here on Amazon for about $13 a pound, another package at just under $10 for three ounces, and then this tiny little can at what comes to well *over* a HUNDRED dollars a pound! And comes with special instructions to ration it out once or twice a week??? Yup, I'm pretty sure I was hearing mlol, mlol, mlol instead of meow, meow, meow.....<br /><br />Let him laugh - I'm okay with the trial and error thing - with a cat involved I'm actually getting VERY used to it, and being out eight bucks is not exactly going to ruin my day. Just I thought I would mention this lackluster experience with Sojos since this is the *only* brand that I purchased to state unequivocally in their product description that it induces a "euphoric state" and no such state was forthcoming. Unless this cat is REALLY good at faking sober.<br /><br />Maybe Sojos should go with a description more like "your mileage may vary"?

Of my two 'children' - you know us "cat people" - our pets become our children for empty nesters.  13 year old Max and Mary, brother and sister, were the recipients of this product.  However, Mary loved it and Max could care less.  But for Mary to like anything new is an awesome deed.  The only thing is that she remembers each day that she wants it and will not leave me alone until I give her some.  She rolls around in it and eats it and sometimes, wants more.  It has not helped her nervousness or her other odd behaviors, but since she loves it, so do I.

review/summary: Bought on Recommendation
review/text: I bought this Organic catnip because it came up as one of Amazon's RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU options. Without looking at reviews or checking any other prices, I got it immediately because I was out of Catnip and are the proud owner of 4 felines.<br /><br />I put this on the kidders' favorite toys and pieces of kitty furniture as soon as it arrived. No one was very impressed, but I thought they just might be having an off day. I had just acquired 2 new kittens and tempers were a bit thin with some fur persons. Then I went to PetCo one afternoon and found a wonderful toy for the kitter who was most annoyed. It was a huge markdown and had a huge pad where this one could play alone (just the thing in her case). The toy even provided a small scratching area made of carboard. So I took it home and put it together for "Miss Annoyed With The New Kittens". Then I got the tin of Sojos organic catnip out and put it on th scratching area. Miss Annoyed usually goes ape for catnip. She likes to eat it and then enjoy the side effects of this happy candy. She went to the new  toy and was very interested in playing, but ate a mouthful of nip, shook her head and walked away. That was my clue that something was quite amiss.<br /><br />Since I needed to get these 4 guys to bond, I went back to Amazon and began looking for catnip again. I found Yeowww! catnip (in a huge tub) AND DID READ THE REVIEWS. This product got great reviews, so I ordered it immediately. I needed HELP!!!!![<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FDD1NQ">Yeowww! Catnip Tub 4 oz</a>[ASIN:B0002O0126 Yeowww! 100% Organic Loose Catnip, Leaf and Bud Blend, 1 Ounce Pouch]] It arrived the next day. As soon as I had the tub open, I applied this catnip to the scratching area of "Miss Annoyed's" toy and sat back to see what would happen when I showed her the new catnip. She began to munch away and became "Miss Agreeable."<br /><br />Perhaps my Sojos Catnip was old or stale, but it should have been fine in its tin. But my cats just did not like it. "The Other Brand" made a huge impression on all of them though. So, I am leaning towards feeling that something MAY have bee Off in the Sojos that I got. Therefore, I will give it 3 stars. Sorry it was not accepted more readily at my home, but then the facts are the facts and the kitters like the Other.<br /><br />It happens to be December as I write, so:<br /><br />Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year:<br /><br />SIGNED:<br /><br />Gabriella (age 3); Trinity (3 1/2); Wisdom, sometimes known as Black Majic (5 mo); and Mercy (5 mo).

review/summary: Organic is better somehow
review/text: I bought this catnip online along with a toy that also came with catnip. Well I tried the catnip that came with the toy and my cat didn't even notice it. Then I pulled out the organc stuff and my cat tried to claw the bag open. This is when I realized organic truly does make a difference.

review/text: I was surprised that my kitty-boy was not very excited by this product, especially considering the cost, and the fact that this is "organic" catnip.  I expected that I was ordering something that would be an irresistible treat, but he's not crazy about it.  Personally, I think that the catnip looks and smells very good: fresh, aromatic and high-quality.  I just wish that my cat was as impressed as I am.  I also love the tin, by the way.

review/summary: Tastes great!  Packaging left me feeling risky.
review/text: Taste:  The taste of the mustard itself is quite nice.  Very similar to a normal yellow mustard you would normally put on a hotdog, but with tiny bits of jalapeno throughout.  This is definitely not a "Grey Poupon" sort of flavor, but more of a spicy yellow mustard.  The heat is not extreme, but you'll definitely feel it; I've found it works very well on sandwiches, and complements chicken quite well.<br /><br />Packaging:  The packaging is the reason for the worry...  While the outside box was sealed and in great shape, what worried me was the safety seal on the mustard.  Upon opening the cap, the foil was stuck to the roof of the red cap rather than being stuck to the bottle itself.  I have no way of knowing whether this bottle has been tampered with.  Of course I ate it anyway because I had been anxiously awaiting it, but it definitely was an uneasy feeling.

review/text: It smells like cat urine. It also has a really oily taste which I can't explain. I think it is from the coffee oil. So the oil has been exposed to the CO2. Which makes that scent. I also think the coffee oil gives it that oil like flavor.

review/summary: Absolutely amazing
review/text: This tea is wonderful. I drink it every morning, and occasionally in the evenings as well. The strawberry essence is noticeable in aroma, but much more subtle in taste, and it pairs nicely with creamer. I would say they greatest shortcoming here is in Iced Tea. If you are an avid iced tea drinking you might with to try a different blend, as without the heat, the subtle strawberry flavor and scents tend to be nearly unnoticeable. It has a rich, dark, nearly red color possibly lent to it by the hibiscus, and it simply looks divine, but the flavor doesn't go well chilled. The price is astonishing given the quality of the leaves. But, do remember, it is a loose leaf tea, so you will need some kind of strainer or reusable tea bag (muslin works brilliantly) to make it. Do be careful not to oversteep. Anything beyond 5 minutes, and it does become noticeably bitter.

review/text: I have to say that I was a little disappointed when I tasted this tea because I didn't have a distinct strawberry flavor as I imagined, but I have started to like it more and more for what it its: Black tea!. If this tea is prepared very light, the flavor is good, if it is prepare a bit strong, it tastes very bitter. So just gotta be careful on the amount of tea you add. I would recommend this tea for someone who likes black tea, but if you are looking for strong strawberry flavor, this is not the tea you want.

review/text: If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally.

review/summary: Worth Every Penny - Wellness CORE dry and Wellness Grain Free canned
review/text: Over the last two years, our older cat (now 11 years old) had ongoing issues with diarrhea and vomiting.  After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach.  We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering.<br /><br />She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic.  At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her.<br /><br />Last month I decided I didn't have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms.  I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had.  Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to "getting older" or her "hairball sensitivity" since none of the test had pinpointed a problem.<br /><br />After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food.  I didn't bother to transition her, just started her on it right away.  Besides, she wasn't keeping down much of the other food anyway.  She took to it right away, and she's a picky one.<br />Within two days, the diarrhea was gone.  Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat.  It's been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I'd found this food sooner.  No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box.  My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true.  A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor.  I didn't believe it until I...well...didn't smell it.<br /><br />I'm transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it.  The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food.  You'll also want to note that it doesn't have preservatives, so it's bound to have a stronger smell.  The wet food actually smells good, for cat food.  We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken.  I'm sure our experiences will vary, but I've watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit.  So I'd say she gives her claw of approval.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's pricy, sure.  But it's worth it for us.  Considering the money we're saving in paper towel clean up expenses alone, we're probably saving a buck or two.  I should also thank Amazon for making it Prime eligible, so it's easier to buy it here than to find it in the store.  So now, instead of begging me to feed them, our cats can start mauling the UPS man.

review/summary: Amazing results with this food!
review/text: We tried this food after our 1-year-old Bengal kitten began to develop symptoms of food allergies (gas, bloating, constipation, vomiting).<br />We've been feeding Core for about 4 months now, and she has been symptom-free since the end of the first week!<br /><br />In addition, our 7-year-old cat has also had remarkable and unexpected results.  She has dropped weight, her eyes are bright, kitty acne on her chin has cleared, and she acts like a playful kitten again!<br /><br />Other notes about this food:<br />-Core costs more than our previous food (Pet Promise), but they don't scarf it down like the old food.  They get excited and eat for a few minutes any time the bowl is filled, but then they just return to nibble from time to time.  So, a bag of Core lasts longer.  Perhaps this is because they are getting the protein they need without having to eat pounds of food!<br />-This food smells like fish meal, and tends to give them slightly stinky breath, but it is not overpowering.<br />-Small, round kibble is crunchy, but not as hard and dry as most commercial dry foods. Our picky eater had no problem with the transition.<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend this food.  I'm in awe of the truly priceless health changes we have seen in our cats, and only wish we had made the switch years ago!

review/summary: Cats can't get enough!
review/text: As soon as I brought the bag inside, my cats were swarming all over it like flies, meowing and sniffing and scratching trying to get it open, something they've never done with other dry foods! I barely got it into the kitchen cabinet without the cats. Needless to say, they HEARTILY APPROVE of the flavor and size of the kibble and scarf this stuff down. Cats are happy, I'm happy! I can also feel good about feeding them one of the few very high protein dry cat foods on the market with premium, wholesome ingredients. As soon as I switched them to CORE, their coats got much softer and silkier and their eyes cleared up, and I know it's not my imagination. They have had ZERO vomiting or stool problems as well. My cats are on their second bag of CORE and will be happily eating CORE for the forseeable future.<br /><br />Cons: The bag's plastic seal is hard to re-seal, it's expensive, and it has a strong fishy odor which my cats love and I don't mind, but it may bother some humans.

review/summary: Start gradually
review/text: My 11-year-old cat is very pioky. She will allow nothing to pass her lips except dry cat food and water...no canned cat food, milk, meat, cheese, treats...nada.  So it is almost impossible to give her any kind of medication.  She had developed a cough and showed some other signs of aging.  After reading about the benefits of a grain-free diet I got Wellness Core for her, which she enjoyed right from the beginning .  But I got too enthusiasitic about finding something she enjoyed so much, and increased the percentage of the new food too fast.  She got the first stomach upset of her life with diarrhea and vomiting and feeling bad for a day, but recovered after a 24-hour fast.  I backed up with the new food, and now, after about six weeks, I am up to about half the Wellness and the rest her old dry food.  She is doing fantasticly!  Her coat is lovely and silky, and she plays more than ever.  The coughing has stopped.  Her stools are great and there has been no vomiting except for two fur balls.  I am delighted with the results of the change to Wellness Core.

She definitely liked this much than the other Wellness brand options.<br /><br />Since this is a very unique, extremely high protein food, you might want to talk to your vet about contraindications (kidney problems, old age?) before making the switch.<br /><br />You might also want to check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X96YIK">Spa Select Indoor Cat Food, 7 lbs.</a>, the only other food my cat goes bananas for.

review/summary: Wellness Core adult and kitten food
review/text: This is indeed a much better alternative to the mainstream dry cat food. No dyes, (which is more and more the cause of vomiting in cats), no significant carbs-a key cause of feline diabetes which is on the rise also. That said, the reaction of our family's cats to this was mixed, a couple  really liked it, others who are not fond of fish only nibbled at it. It has a significant fishy, meat odor when opened which luckily isn't as pervasive as cooked onions or bacon. However since it is high in protein your cats will use the litter box more often.<br />Lastly, yes, it is more expensive, but how much do you spend on yourself every month for food? You made a commitment when you got your pet, so if you love your cat and want your companion to be healthy and around for a longer time then buy this food, or Innova. This is not a cure, just a healthier more natural diet for your cat.

review/summary: Blocked Bladder
review/text: I switched to this food from Innova. I have a male and a female cat. They've been eating it for about a year. They're 2 years old. The pet store we were buying Innova from started replacing Innova with Innova EVO, and my cats would eat it-- but they were breaking out on their chin from it. They offered other things, but I ended up using this. It was a special order, but I'd sampled the bag and the cat acne disappeared.<br /><br />This past month, my male cat started peeing on the floor. We thought it was due to the stress of moving and our new baby and ignored it. Then he started to meow a ton. We thought he wanted more attention. He was still playing with our other cat. We ignored it. Then he started shaking while trying to walk to the litter box. We took him to the vet at 4a. He had a blocked bladder. Per our vet, he'd been hearing this a lot from male cats who are eating Wellness core. Honestly, I think the only reason he didn't have symptoms sooner is that I was giving him Innova EVO wet food for awhile in addition to the dry food. The other cat didn't eat it, so I didn't want to get food that both of them couldn't enjoy.<br /><br />Fixing a blocked bladder is VERY expensive. Also, there is no guarantee that your cat will be completely unblocked after treatment. Thus far, our guy is doing well. We still crate him to make sure he's peeing, eating, and drinking. It's hard to monitor this with two cats otherwise.<br /><br />Our male cat is now on a Prescription diet from the vet recommended brand that I'm not too fond of... He seems okay. We've switched our other cat onto the same diet.<br /><br />I will never purchase Wellness CORE again.

review/summary: Wellness is More than a Brand Name
review/text: I did a lot of research about cat food before I adopted a new kitten last year. Guess what? Surprise! A lot of major brands of cat food are the equivalent of deep-fried chicken and fast-food cheeseburgers for humans.  Many of the brands that advertise a lot and sponsor cat shows are the worst offenders.<br /><br />Cats are predators, and predator = high meat-based protein diet.  Grain-based protein sources are high in carbohydrates and gluten.  You'll never see see wild tigers in animal documentaries eating white bread and corn on the cob, even if they knew where to get them.<br /><br />I feed my adolescent cat a combination of wet Wellness canned food and Wellness Core dry food.  I did try another brand of dry cat food before purchasing Wellness Core, but she would just beg for more wet food and only eat enough of the dry to stop her hunger pangs. No problem with Wellness Core.  She seems to like it.<br /><br />I trust the Wellness brand.  All I have to do is look at my cat and see why:  her coat is glossy, her eyes are clear and bright, and she has a lot of energy (maybe too much)!<br /><br />Here's another tip:  Read the list of ingredients of dry cat foods.  If you see a lot of sulphur and sulfate compounds, be prepared for VERY unpleasant number two cat box odor.  These compounds are guaranteed to turn the smell dial all the way up to maximum.  You can't totally avoid sulfates - they're necessary for cat health, but Wellness has them in moderation.  The dry food I tried before buying Wellness Core had LOTS of sulphates - and LOTS of bad odor. Don't blame your cat when you're the one feeding her/him.<br /><br />So Wellness products cost more...so what?  If you eat well, your cat should too.  Health problems caused by cheap cat food are expensive, painful - and avoidable.  Save your vet dollars for things you can't control.  You can economize by shopping for the best price and/or buying in larger quantities.  Save your nose too!

review/summary: Best catfood brand
review/text: Wellness Core is a really terrific brand of cat food.  It's one of the highest rated cat foods I've found.  I love that it's made from natural ingredients and is grain-free.  I do like to supplement this with a little canned food (Wellness of course).  My cat's fur is really soft and luxurious.  Plus the cat loves the food so much so that she ripped open the bag and started stealing the food because I unknowingly did not stash the food in a sealed container.  All open cat food and treats are stashed in a weighted down sealed container to prevent more cat burglar activity.<br /><br />I'm a new cat owner as you can tell.<br /><br />The only Con is it's pretty expensive, but it's well worth it to have a healthy pet.

review/summary: 2.5 lb. sickly cat doubled weight in 2 days!
review/text: It has been two weeks and now she weighs 6 pounds.  I am amazed & so happy.  Angel is a 12 year old Siamese.  She had been 2.5 pounds for at least 2 months.<br /><br />  The vet's diagnose was mostly "Old age". He gave her some iron & okayed some online liver support pills I had bought when I saw that her poo had turned yellow, or sometimes beige.  I also switched her diet to grain free with daily raw hamburger (frozen for 3 days to kill parasites), tuna & sardines.  She ate all that all the time but still never gained weight & her poo stayed the same too.<br /><br />I went to a prayer forum about her as a last ditch effort and someone there who used to work for a vet recommended Wellness Core food.<br /><br />Angel & a younger cat, Jet, loved the new food right away! The yellow looking poo turned dark over night.  In fact even Jet's poo darkened.  Now I can't tell which is whose.  I have not been giving anything but this food for over a week and they are thriving.  The only problem is that Jet is starting to look a bit like a puff ball - Lol - since I have to leave the food available all the time for now so Angel can always get to it and keep gaining.

review/summary: Kitty LOVES this food; too bad it's so expensive!
review/text: I bought a small bag of this food for my Savannah cat when his normal food ran out (Taste of the Wild - green bag) and the local pet store didn't have it in stock. I was worried that he would reject the food or it would make him sick because I've heard horror stories of trying to switch cat food too quickly. My cat, however, LOVES this stuff. He never begs for food and doesn't try to get into the cat food bag, but with this stuff, he was trying to get his head into the bag before I had a chance to pour some into his dish. He ate it all up, much more quickly than his other food, which is also high-quality, high-protein dry food. He had no bathroom or vomit problems and seems to like it at least as much as his "green bag" food. It's expensive, though, so I'm only using it as a supplement to his normal food, plus I leave some kibble hidden in his cat condo as "cat treats" for him to find when we're at work. He ALWAYS finds it. If I ever make enough money to spend $$$ on cat food, I'm definitely switching him to this stuff.

review/summary: my cat goes crazy for this food--- might want to talk your vet to be sure it's right for your cat
review/text: My 5 year old cat adores the food. She scarfed down as much as I put in her bowl, so I had to be careful not to overfeed. She definitely liked this much than the other Wellness brand options.<br /><br />Since this is a very unique, extremely high protein food, you might want to talk to your vet about contraindications (kidney problems, old age?) before making the switch.<br /><br />You might also want to check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X96YIK">Spa Select Indoor Cat Food, 7 lbs.</a>, the only other food my cat goes bananas for. It's a holistic food with human quality ingredients-- another great choice. We've settled on it because I haven't made up my mind about the ultra high protein approach of CORE.

review/text: 0 stars if I could!<br /><br />Do your research before you buy! I thought this food was the BEST for my spoiled cat- but after a complete urinary blockage in my cat, costing him almost his life and me out $900.00 at the vet- the food was determined to be the culprit. If you google this food and "Urinary Blockage", ect in the same line- you will find an ENOURMOUS amount of people who went through the same thing with there feline pal after giving this food.<br /><br />SHAME ON WELLNESS!!!

review/summary: Grain free Core cured runny eyes in my two cats
review/text: Both my cats, siblings I brought home together, have feline herpes, or so I thought?  Since I brought them home, I've been giving them doses of l-lysine twice a day to try to clear runny eyes, and it didn't help, especially with my boy.<br /><br />I was feeding greain free wet but not dry. Then I read another review here on amazon where another cat owner talked about feeding grain free and seeing her cats eyes clearing up. I had to give it a try!<br /><br />I can say they are the healthiest they've ever been.  Core is awesome, and feeding grain free will be for life in my house.

review/summary: my cats wont touch this
review/text: Doesn't matter how good it is for your cat, if Wellness can't make the taste appealing enough for cats to try it!  I have two adult cats, one very picky and one that eats everything put in front of him. Neither one would touch this very expensive dry food. The non picky cat just sat and looked at the bowl full of the Core dry food. He never even approached the dish to sniff it. Can Wellness make some samples of this for us to try? Oh, by the way, both my cats love the Wellness canned cat food.

review/summary: I love it and my kittens do too.
review/text: I asked my vet what to feed my two eight week old kittens. He recommended feeding them a grain free diet. I switched my kittens to Wellness Core mixed equally with EVO Turkey and Chicken Formula Dry (and canned) Cat and Kitten Food and they love both. Their coats look great and they seem to be thriving.<br /><br />I decided to mix the two brands since EVO has a higher protein and fat percentage, which is good for kittens. I've kept Wellness because I applaud their natural philosophy and their use of naturally-occurring micro-organisms to aid in a healthy digestive tract. I've also noticed that the kittens poop doesn't smell as strongly with Wellness as it does when they're on a full EVO diet.<br /><br />My kittens have not had diarrhea or any problems digesting the food since I started them on it a few weeks ago.<br /><br />FYI, I had heard that cats eat less on a grain-free diet. I didn't believe it until I witnessed it myself. They truly eat less.

review/summary: Wellness CORE Grain-Free, Fish and Fowl Adult Cat and Kitten Food, 2-Pound Bag
review/text: Well, I tried this because I wanted my cat to eat more healthy.  He is used to Fancy Feast and Friskies.  He is a male, 13 yrs old.  When he smelled it he started to seem reluctant, like "what the heck is this?"  Then he decided to try it.  He ate a little and walked away.  Just enough to vomit it back up on my carpet.  It came up just like it went down, in little balls.  I don't know what the problem is, but he definitely won't eat it.  I will try to mix it with some wet food, hopefully he will eat it.

review/summary: Great food
review/text: Well worth the price. I have two kittens and one was pretty lethargic and was a bit overweight, and the other one was an active, really skinny kitten. I decided to get this and they both loved it! Probably more than the treats they get. They don't over-eat anymore. And nothing bad happened with the diet change, but both kittens became equally became as active, with the one losing his little extra weight, and it even helped the other fill out a bit more, so this food works great for any cat seemingly.

review/summary: outstanding formula, not best tasting
review/text: I really love Wellness and really want my cats to eat it, but with the exception of two flavors of the regular wet food, they just do not like it. When one of my cats was a kitten, she loved the Wellness kitten formula, but that was it. I can't get either of them to touch CORE canned or dry food, even with their old food mixed. This has resulted in a number of returns, which really made me appreciate the company's guaranteed satisfaction promise!  I'm trying to narrow it down, but I think they both don't like either the smell or taste of potatoes, rosemary extract, or cranberries. Obviously, very cat has their own taste preferences just like us humans, but I just wanted to caution other owners to try a sample before buying a large, expensive supply...

review/summary: Grain-free cat food
review/text: My eight year old cat is indoor/outdoor and likes dry food. Occasionally, we would feed him some canned food. For at least two years we noticed symptoms of diarrhea. The vet de-wormed the cat several times, but the diarrhea persisted. We decided to check the listed ingredients on the labels of the dry and canned food our cat eats. We were quite surprised that most protein in the popular brands comes from wheat and corn gluten, a protein that is known to cause intestinal problems in some people.  Grains and grain gluten are also listed as ingredients of most brands of cat canned food.<br /><br />I just got the Wellness Core Grain-free Fish & Fowl food today, so it is too early to see if it will cure our cat from diarrhea. Nevertheless, our cat was very happy with this new food and devoured all that we gave him.
