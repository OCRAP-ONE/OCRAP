review/summary: There are a great gluten free snack!
review/text: My daughter does not always want to eat the "same ol' same ol' " in her lunch bag and was looking for a cracker of some sort to have at snack time. Being a Celiac patient at 7 years old cannot be easy--but we try to always find something to substitute so she will not feel different from her peers. These are a great snack for her to have! Since we are also a healthy eating family I try and keep away from most overly processed snacks and I feel these are a pretty good comprises to crackers or her cheese stick standby. I will be trying the other flavors now!

review/summary: Salty and a tad boring
review/text: I like the single-serving bags, and this is the second batch of JtC rounds I've bought, but they certainly aren't my favorite snack.<br /><br />They are crunchy, and have a decent texture, but they're saltier than I'd prefer.  They're what I reach for when I want something salty, or when I'm just bored with the rest of the snacks on hand.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can tell a difference between the Nacho flavor rounds and the "plain" ones.

review/text: I was kind of excited about this product before it came in.  I found them in a little Atkins carb counter brochure, and thought I'd give it a shot.  I was very disappointed to find out that they do NOT taste like cheese crust. They taste like salted cardboard, but being I am sticking to this low carb thing, I do find myself eating them just for the crunch and the fact that I have already wasted $17 bucks on them.

review/text: These are small and very salty. The taste is good, but very strong, so it's a good thing the package contains a small amount. It only takes a few little crisps to cure my salty/crunchy craving. I can snack on one package for an entire day. Of course these would not be a good snack if you're very hungry, because there isn't enough there to fill you up. For less than $1 per pack it's an okay deal.

review/text: I love that the snacks are good in protein, low carbohydrates, but the amount of sodium is too much.  I hope my letter to the company will help them develop a low sodium product.  In the meantime, I only eat one of the packages every two weeks of less.  I am looking forward to the more healthy product. If you are not concerned about the sodium content, then this is the snack to eat.

review/summary: Weird and gritty
review/text: They are hard and crunchy, very salty, and with a hint of a burnt taste. They are gritty after chewing and need to be washed down with some water. I was hoping for something more like cheetos, but that's probably not possible with pure cheese. I prefer my own chips made by microwaving slices of cheddar. A positive is that these are a low carb snack that doesn't need refrigeration and you can eat on the run.

I purchased the Wisconsin Cheddar, and I couldn't even eat all of one of the little bags, it was such an OD of sodium that I literally made a pucker face.  I'm not shy about salt, but these are pretty much unpalatable...and I have 15 more packs!  Maybe the other flavors don't taste as salty, but buyer beware.

review/text: We ordererd Just the Cheese Crispy Cool Ranch Cheese snacks. They arrived on time and we tried them the next day. Finding snacks that you can incorporate into a low carb diet is difficult sometimes. This is a very good low carbohydrate snack. These have No MSG, wheat and are gluten free as well. They would be good for any type of diet. Only 75 calories and 1/2 carb per serving. They taste quite good. I've made cheese chips at home and these taste very much like them. We are looking forward to trying another flavor next time.

review/summary: I love them, Great Low Carb Snack
review/text: When I ordered was somewhat nervous, because of other ratings that were negative.  So relieved when they got here and I tried them.  They taste like oven baked cheddar bites-which I really like.  If you ordered them thinking they were going to be exactly like potato chips, you would be disappointed.  I have been on a low carb diet since Feb now and look for snack type items, with crunchy being a big plus-these are very tasty and I will definitely be getting them again.  (as well as trying some of the other flavors!)  They are salty, which I like.  I have to disclose however that my DH is not as happy with them as I am -we do have a tendancy to like opposite flavors.  So for me that just means more for my lunch pail.  But if you are like me and scrape the cheese off the cookie sheet when your baking has some overflow-you will probably really like these.  Only rated them 4 star because of DH -who still ate them by the by and said he would rate them as ok, so since I would say 5 star.  Compromise, right?

review/summary: They are a great crunchy, salty, low carb snack!
review/text: These things are great if you're on a low carb diet, and I find them really satisfying.  If you're looking for some kind of gourmet cheese item, this isn't it; its a potato chip replacement that's more about crunch and a salty, tangy taste to satisfy an urge. However, I personally would eat them even if I wasn't on a diet! As for the amounts; each bag is only 75 calories!  So if you really want more, then open another one, but when you're on a diet, usually just one does the trick (see "urges" above)! They are more expensive than potato chips, but at less than a dollar a bag, you could do a whole lot worse! I've only had the "classic white cheddar" flavor and am trying a new flavor this week.  I'll let you know how it goes.

review/text: I have had some of the other cheese snacks, and liked the nacho flavored.  If you have not had these before, they are literally cheese formed into a small disk and baked until hard like a cracker.  Being a low carb guy, I like them because they are easy to pack along, and are reminiscent of the crunch you get from crackers.  This particular flavor though, is underwhelming, there is not enough jalapeno flavor, and the whole thing tastes a bit like bland cheese.  Still, they are ok, and I will eat them, but not as tasty as some of the other offerings.....

review/text: I love Chef Paul's Seafood Magic Seasoning! Though I don't eat seafood, I prefer this seasoning over their Poultry Magic blend. It is really good on other foods. I use it on ground meats (turkey, chicken and beef) to make seriously delicious burgers! I also use this to season chicken (whether baking, grilling, deep frying or pan-frying). And I love this seasoning on French fries (frozen and homemade). It is amazing!<br /><br />My local supermarket stopped selling the small containers...I saw it available on Amazon in large canisters and I was in heaven! As of November 2011 (when I ordered), the large canisters didn't have the top "shaker holes" like some, so I kept a small container to scoop this seasoning into. Just pop the "shaker holes" cap off, fill up the container using a teaspoon and replace cap. It's simple.<br /><br />I recommend that you buy Chef Paul's Seafood Magic. You will not regret it!<br /><br />Lastly, I suggest using 4 staple seasonings that I alternate depending on my mood: McCormick Old Bay Seasoning, Chef Paul's Seafood Magic Seasoning, Chef Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning (not if you're Gluten Free) and any brand of Italian Seasoning (I use McCormick or Spice Islands). You will never go wrong if you use one of those seasonings or even combine a few.

review/summary: BEST sugar substitute there is!
review/text: I have tried every sugar substitute there is and this is by FAR the best.  No after taste, and because it is in a liquid form there is no unwanted carbs found in the powdered form.  For a large thermal mug of coffee that I would normally sweeten with 2 packets of Splenda, just 2 drops does the trick.<br /><br />A little goes a very long way.<br /><br />I have a friend who uses a minimum of 20 packets of Splenda a day. He tried EZ-Sweetz and it is now all he uses.<br /><br />I carry a bottle with me when I travel and feel good knowing I am cutting carbs and calories and not sacrificing taste.<br /><br />Give it a try, and I promise, it will not let you down.  It is a great value too!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Amazing.  How have people never heard of this?
review/text: I have never seen this product in any store, and it's a shame.  It's absolutely amazing.  It does just what it says... makes things sweeter with just a drop or two.  I make a cup of unsweetened tea and one or two drops is as effective as a packet of Splenda.  I look for creative ways to use this to lower our calories, like when I make pancakes.  It's really amazing stuff, how has no one heard of it and why isn't it sold in groceries??

review/text: I've tried a bunch of liquid sucrulose brands as I love iced coffee and tea and it's a pain getting packets of powder to dissolve.  The sizes are perfect (I have different ones for different places) and it only takes 1-3 drops to make *anything* taste sweet as candy.<br /><br />I use it in smoothies, yogurt, whipped cream and pretty much anything I'd use sugar for normally.  No weird aftertaste.<br /><br />No idea why these guys haven't gotten themselves on the shelves of every major supermarket and on the counter at the big chain coffee shops.

review/summary: No carbs, loving my Ketostix!
review/text: I can tell such a difference in the performance of a low carb diet when using this product instead of powdered packet sweeteners!  Using Ketostix, I get a much faster, darker purple result, and return to purple quicker after deviating from low carb, when I used these drops instead of blue or pink packets.  I love my coffee and tea to be sweeeet, and several packets of sweeteners add several carbs per cup/glass.  Also, I keep a bottle in my makeup bag, and always have good sweetener with me when all the restaurants have is the pink stuff.  I like to mix sweeteners, and wish this type was available with aspartame, but I haven't been able to find it here.  Of course, saccharin drops have been around for decades, and are readily available in stores.  This is a great product, and I'm glad to have found it.  I use it in my coffee, tea, and almond milk.

review/text: I love this stuff!  A small box that has the same sweetness as 1350 Splenda packets?  How can you beat that?  I can't eat much sugar, but I still get a sweet tooth sometimes.  Sure, I could buy a bulk box of Splenda packets, but why?  This liquid sweetener works just as well without taking up a lot of space.  As a bonus, I don't feel like I'm harming the environment by throwing away hundreds of empty paper packets.  Each box has three small bottles (each one about the size of an eye drop bottle).  The product description is right on.  One drop is about the sweetness of one packet.  I'll definitely be using this from now on.  Packets, we had a nice run, but it's time for us to part ways.

I use about 18 drops for 3 quarts of tea, but I am from the south and like my tea really strong and sweet.  The bottles are tiny and would be great to carry in purse or pocket. The only complaint is the price, which could be lower in my estimation considering the huge amount of servings being purchased. Seems like there should be some volume discount. Not much if any cheaper than buying 400 count packets at Wally world.

review/text: As a casual user of Splenda, the aftertaste seemed very pronounced, so I was skeptical about this products hype about being much better in that regard.  I am happy to report that there is virtually no aftertaste.  What I do notice is that the sweetness still seems "too sweet" if that makes any sense.  I'm not just talking about the amount used.  When I taste something sweetened with the product, it seems the proper sweetness initially, but it lingers.  Not a complaint, but might be the source of the remaining aftertaste some people report.  I couldn't be happier with this product as it has not carbs, which I am trying to avoid.  I am still unsure about artificial sweeteners in general, and will only use a drop or two of this product for favorite drinks.

review/summary: Simple and Convenient
review/text: A one thousand (sometimes 1200) packets of Splenda is $20.88 at Sam's Club as of this review.  I was diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic four months ago and opted to treat cause not symptom and no longer require oral or injection insulin and my diabetes status was upgraded to managed with diet (Low Carb - Paleo).  You really can substitute neutral-tasting vegetables for tortillas, rice, grits, oat meal (not oat fiber), flour and pasta!  It is cheaper to make your own "Liquid Splenda" but it will take a bit of work figuring out the strength of the solution relative to a 0.5 oz bottle of Ez-Sweetz which in my research short of making it yourself is the strongest solution out there at a factor of 300 times sweeter than sugar where most other products come in at the standard 192 times sugar.  As many reviewers have stated, it is important to read the label of EZ-Sweetz other sizes; they are not the same strength though often they are cheaper.  I plan to make my own but not before I have enough of the bottles which for the moment are incredibly simple and convenient and I can confirm what other reviewers have said about one for work, the coffee maker, the book bag, the car and a couple bottles for backup should you lose one.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't think it's quite as sweet as another sweetener I tried (sorry, I can't remember what it was). I actually have to put two drops in my coffee to make it taste like two teaspoons of sugar - but this is normal, I think. It's just that the other one I used only took one drop.  I'd buy this again, though.

review/summary: Amazing product.
review/text: I have been a daily user of Splenda for many years.  I could not drink coffee without it.  I realized that the maltodetrin and other additives in Splenda packets give each pack 1 g of carbs, as well as necessitating the ingestion of more worthless food additives.  I am on Medifast and would go nuts without this product, as my Splenda Pkts. would have been limited to 3 per day tops.  Well, that is a cup and a half of coffee for me, and I drink A LOT of coffee.  This was a perfect solution.<br /><br />It is accurate in stating 1 drop is equal to 1 pkt of Splenda or 1 tsp of sugar.  The bottle allows for easy drop count - a gentle squeeze and you get perfect drops.  It is small enough to carry a bottle in you attache to work for use on the go or at your desk (about the size of a bottle of eye drops.  Yet, they last forever - I've not counted drops per bottle, but I wouldn't doubt that it is 450, which is a lot of sweetening.<br /><br />This will be a regular purchase for me.  Even after transistioning from Medifast, I will never go back to Splenda Packets.  If you compare that a 3 bottle pack of these bottles is equal to 1350 packets, the cost is similar and well worth it.  Don't hesitate to buy this - it's great!

review/summary: Great sweetener, though overpriced and hard to dispense
review/text: I first tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MO765O">EZ-Sweetz 2-ounce bottle)</a>, and I loved the convenience and carb savings over Splenda.  But to make a pitcher of lemonade (which is what I use it for most often), I had to use 60 drops, which got tedious.  So I decided to try this version, since it is twice as concentrated.  This has made it a lot more convenient for me, plus, with the 2-ounce bottle, I was always taken by surprise when it suddenly ran out.  With this three-pack, I know to order another box when I'm down to my last bottle.  Both versions are great, but based on those two advantages, I will probably buy this one from now on.<br /><br />In my experience, the conversion ratio for EZ-Sweetz versus sugar or Splenda in a recipe is not quite as described.  I've always had to use more Splenda than what its manufacturer says is the sugar equivalent, and with EZ-Sweetz, I have to use a little more than what they claim as the Splenda equivalent (I haven't noticed any problem with the claim of this EZ-Sweetz being twice as concentrated as the 2-ounce version; I use 30 drops now).  But still, it's such a huge savings of carbs (and even calories), it's a good product to get.<br /><br />Update 8/27/12 - The first several packages I got were very easy to dispense.  However, the past two packages I've purchased have required a much tighter squeeze to get them to drip.  If you only need one or two drops, it's not a big deal.  But when you're counting out 30 for a big pitcher of lemonade, it becomes downright *painful*.  I thought the first batch was a fluke (though it was all three bottles).  But now this batch (ordered more than a month later) is just as bad.  I've dropped my star rating as a result, and I'll be looking for different product to switch to.

No aftertaste and when you are counting carbs, every partial carb counts.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about 'how sweet' this was before I purchased but now I know that I use two drops in my huge coffee mug, versus three packets of the 'other stuff'...so I save three carbs per cup. I found these much easier to get the product out of than the large bottle.

review/text: Wow. A product that is EXACTLY what the label says. One drop of EZ-SWEETS really does sweeten as much as one packet of Splenda. It has no aftertaste at all. No carbs. No calories. I keep one in my purse and one in my kitchen. This is my second order. I am a big fan of EZ-SWEETS. Great for hot or cold drinks and recipes. I hate chemical tasting sweeteners but this product is great. No funky flavors. All good. Recommend.

review/summary: This stuff is fantastic
review/text: 2 or 3 tiny drops in my (large) mug of tea, and I'm good to go (I take my coffee black, so N/A there). I also use it in my homemade low-carb ice cream or whipped cream, and it works great. I assume the quantity of the end result is significantly less; but since that extra quantity is only due to the fillers in Splenda (a small but significant amount of which is carbs), this doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Naturally, it _will_bother you if you are using it for cooking or baking (which I haven't yet); the balance is liable to be wrong. In that case, you may be better off with Splenda's fiber-based granulated product (no Net Carbs).

review/summary: Sodium Benzoate is Dangerous- It's in EZ sweetz
review/text: I was disappointed to find out EZ-sweet uses Sodium Benzoate as one of it's preservatives. This ingredient, when combined with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) creates Benzene which is carcinogenic (cancer causing).<br /><br />I used to use Splenda or generic sucralose packets, but they made a mess on the counter, took up too much room in our pantry when purchased in bulk, and took up alot of space near the coffee maker when compared with concentrated sweeteners. EZ sweet would be the easy alternative if it weren't toxic. I had to find a better option. I find that the only super easy way around using EZ sweet but also save on space/mess is to use the splenda mini tablets. They are pricey and will cost a lot more than the packets, so I've recently found another option. I can now purchase 1 oz of pure sucralose powder form from the Splendex site and mix it with 3 oz of water to make the equivalent of 2,500 packets of Splenda. The cost of the 1oz powder is only $24.95. I found that other companies sell sucralose powder and if you buy a lot of it, it's even cheaper. I don't know how I would measure out 1oz to make a 4 oz bottle of sweetener solution so, for me, it's just easier to get 1oz, it will last us a while and the 4oz bottle on the coffee counter doesn't take up much space at all. I'm going to experiment with different natural preservatives (colloidal silver, GSE, natural salts, citric acid) to keep the solution from becoming contaminated with bacteria or fungus. If you're going to go this route, do some research on natural preservatives and if you find one you love, please leave a comment to this review.<br /><br />Note: I was lucky that the splendex company agreed to give me a 4oz bottle to use for my sucralose solution, I'm not sure if they would do that for everyone. If not, just keep your old EZ squeeze bottle or find a nice dropper bottle that will do the job without making a mess. Oh and finding the powder wasn't easy. It is not an option on their home/default web page. I had to go to order products and on the right side was an option for the powder.

review/summary: The best iced tea.
review/text: I came looking for this at Amazon because the price at Walmart is $4.92 per 4.4 oz jar, which seems high for a jar of iced tea mix.  Kroger has decaf, raspberry, peach, etc., but not this plain diet lemon version.  I've been buying it for years, but don't remember how much the price was in the past.<br /><br />The only problem with mixing it is that it foams, and little bits of the powder get in the foam, so you have to do a little extra mixing, in a container that won't be full when you're done, because, if it was full, the foam would be over the top.<br /><br />It tastes especially good if you leave it in the fridge overnight after mixing it.

review/text: Lipton Diet Iced Tea with Lemon use to be my favorite.  We went thru jars ans jars of it, but about a year or so ago they changed from Sweet and Low (saccharin) to aspartame. When this happened the price went up and the servings per jars decreased dramatically from 35 quarts to 15 quarts for the same size jar at a higher price. In addition the tea now seems to have a bit of a metalic taste to it. At more than twice the price I'm not anywhere near as inclined to spend my money on Lipton products

review/text: After reading the previous reviews I had high hopes for this product.  Unfortunately it fell way short.  I knew it would be foamy upon mixing and that it would be better aftering sitting in the fridge over night.  But even after contant mixing and being refridgerated for a couple days I can still taste a chalkiness in the tea which is just terribly off-putting.  I'll try to make some more and see if it gets better, but when compared to properly brewed-fresh tea, it's not even close.  I like a nice crisp taste to my tea, not the chalky after taste this gives.

But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

review/summary: $13.60 for organic and pinhead
review/text: From reading reviews of all the stash green teas, I decided to get the organic pinhead version for better quality.  I think it is excellent though it is not cheap.  The leaves look in excellent shape and only a spoonful is needed in a teapot.  I made the mistake of using too much tea for my first pot but this is a tasty tea.

review/summary: Excellent breakfast tea!
review/text: I buy all my loose tea from Stash, and Kopili Assam is one of the best Assams I've tasted.  It's a bold, dark red, tea that tastes good any time of day.  If you only have a little left in the tin, it blends well with any other black tea.

review/summary: This is not premium quality tea
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

review/text: tangy ginger flavor - very pleasing to the senses; only takes a small amount to make a delicious cup of hot tea or iced tea in a pitcher for the refrigerator

review/summary: My favorite Stash tea!
review/text: I love this tea.  It is like the coffee of teas!  Strong brew, it has a malty taste I love. I've tried other Irish Breakfast teas and keep coming back to this one, other brands seem weak in comparison.
