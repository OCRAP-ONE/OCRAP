review/summary: Cracker NIRVANA!!!
review/text: I was perusing the "Manager's Sale", and luckily for me I came across these AMAZING crackers. With it's list of simple, and wonderful organic ingredients, starting with whole grain spelt flour and millet  as the grains (instead of wheat flour), good balance of healthy (source) carbs, healthy (source) fats, non animal protein, and fiber, without a horrible amount of sodium (though at 220mg/oz it is higher than I would prefer), and a reasonable sale price, I had to give these a try.<br /><br />First off, they were shipped right away, and came snugly packed in a box, that was then put in to a larger Amazon box with some plastic air filled pillows to help keep them from getting banged up. The use-by date is 7/6/10, a full 3 months away.<br /><br />OK, let me just say - Wow! - These fantastic crackers are truly amazing! Substantial, dense and very crunchy. The flavor is incredible, I could happily live on them for a long time!<br /><br />I always say when it comes to cooking, the ingredients speak for themselves, and their quality was evident here. The only thing I was concerned about, was the possibility that the moisture from the seeds, might make the crackers lose their fresh crunchiness. I had previously tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDKRFK">Ryvita Whole Grain Rye Crispbread, Sunflower Seeds & Oats, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>, which had that unfortunate problem (though they weren't stale, they just didn't seem at their peak). Though I did enjoy them, they pale in comparison (both literally & figuratively) to these Doctor Kracker Seedlander crackers. I like Ryvita's short list of simple ingredients, but they are much lighter in weight and texture, and they make slightly messy crumbs when you break them, although you might prefer the Ryvita if you have an objection to yeast (which is in these).<br /><br />I love how these "Snackers" come in pre-cut little 1.5" bite-sized squares with no mess. It's also easy to count out 8 for a 1oz serving size. Despite being sweetened with agave syrup (which I like because it doesn't spike your blood sugar), they are not too sweet. It's just the right touch, and the small amount of molasses adds to their delicious flavor. They would also be good crumbled onto a salad or as a soup (like butternut squash soup) topping.<br /><br />Many thanks to Amazon for helping me to discover these heavenly treats!

review/summary: Best buy
review/text: Capers in brine cannot compare.  These are high quality capers in salt at a good price from Agostino Recca.  You can find them in 2.2 oz. jars for about five dollars.  This one is twenty-four oz.  So I could have given this five stars on best buy basis.<br /><br />I gave it four stars considering only a few in brine get three stars.  Most get one star as weak and adulterated by things other than salt in the brine.  So most pure salt brine still get only two stars.  Not worth the low quality since these are available.<br /><br />This is my everyday old reliable.  Do not cook them.  Rinse out the salt if you do not need it, and use them after cooking is over, even in a caper sauce.  They need only warm to blossom.  They respond well to mortar and pestle.<br /><br />I saved five stars for the ones from Pantalleria which go with caviar.

review/summary: Much more for the money and a good product
review/text: These selections of Apple Jacks are the best value that I have found on Amazon. The reason is that you get 2 big boxes of this cereal for a low price. To put the point in it is like getting 2 boxes of other cereals in one box of this Apples Jacks. They are fresh and are just like the ones that we remember as when we where kids. The receipts has not changed and they have just the right about of crush in the chewing that make it a joy to eat them. You get more for the buck with these two boxes of Apple Jacks than if you by sets that have 4 boxes in them plus the price is lower than the 4 boxes sets. If you like Apple Jacks and to save money get this product.

review/text: I don't know what it is about Apple Jacks. They are like a blend of cereals: cinnamon, fruit loops, and cheerios all mixed into one.<br /><br />These are surprisingly filling, but not the most filling. For reference, I tend to prefer wheaty cereals. Honestly, I will likely just get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X8T8DK">Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites Chocolate Cereal, 15.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> next time, as those are awesome.<br /><br />The boxes are of a fairly large size, and with subscribe and save, they are relatively cheap. The boxes I got "expire" a year from now, so no worries there.

review/text: I purchased a bag of the Back to Nature California Almonds in the Green Wise section of my local Publix.  They were a bit pricey, but they are certainly worth it.<br /><br />The nuts are raw and have therefore not been roasted or salted. The nuts were is excellent condition--very few broken pieces with the exception of those broken during my trip from market to home.<br /><br />The 11 oz. package was filled with whole almonds.  The package was also easy to open and easy to reseal for freshness.<br /><br />The nuts were super fresh and super tasty. The package contains about 11 servings (1 oz - 24 nuts).<br /><br />Each serving is 160 cal., 14 g fat, 1 g sat. fat, 3.5 g poly fat, 9 g mono fat, 200 mg potassium, 6 g carbs, 3 g fiber, and 1 g sugar.<br /><br />The nuts are 100% natural California almonds that contain no artificial perservatives or artificial ingredients.  The nuts are distributed by the Back to Nature Food Company in Madison, WI.<br /><br />The package offers an expiration date,  a clear warning for parents, and a safety website:  Do not give nuts to children under 6; chocking hazard.

review/text: Just yummy, yummy almonds - nothing more, nothing less.  Nicely portioned packs that don't have the time to dry out before you finish them.  The almonds themselves are fantastic, great flavor and texture.  I eat them plain as a snack and I greatly appreciate that they're not coated in oil or salt.  They are a great addition to hot oatmeal, I toss a small handful in with some dried fruit and let them sit for a few minutes to soften up.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Now I can't wait for morning so I can have some!  If I'm feeling exceedingly charitable I might toss a couple to the squirrels that live in my yard while snacking on the front porch.<br /><br />Let us not forget that being part of the Subscribe & Save program makes them even more of a value!  Brought right to my door by the smiling deliveryman, I may just give him a bag the next time I see him.  I love managing my regularly-purchased dry goods through Amazon.  Talk about a time-saver and I get access to products that I can't find in my local grocery.

review/text: Discovered this sauce on a trip to Belize.  It was on every table at the resort restaurant and with good reason.  As opposed to many sauces that simply add heat to a dish, Marie Sharp's Belizean Heat adds a great flavor.  There are many products in her line, but Belizean Heat has become a staple on our table at home.  There are hotter products available, but none combine the all the aspects as well.

review/summary: Totonac Sugar Free Syrups
review/text: I ordered the complete set of Totonac sugar free syrups and tested them out with my morning Kellogg's Eggo waffles.<br /><br />Some of the syrups are pretty good; others are really not my thing and I threw them out. My verdict/opinion is: Almond, Maple Syrup and Vanilla are pretty good; the Raspberry is okay (if you crave some fruit taste); but I couldn't handle the taste of the Blueberry, Butter Pecan, Caramel, Hazelnut and Vanilla Cinnamon.<br /><br />The syrup is not thick like most syrups on the market; it's more runny and I find myself pouring some syrup out on to a plate and then dipping pieces of torn waffles.

review/summary: Needs Modification
review/text: The reviewers who said the cake is flavorless or doesn't Taste good are right. Unfortunately I had already bought this sat the store and hadn't checked out the reviews and was loathed to return them.<br /><br />I like it because it is organic but if you are looking to impress guests this needs some modification to have the rich chocolate indulgent flavor.<br /><br />This is what I did and turned out tasting decadent and rich.<br /><br />Add an extra egg.<br />Substitute vege oil with melted butter.<br />Add 2-3 heapful tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder. (the more you add the richer it gets)<br /><br />I also baked at 25 degrees lower but for at least 25 mins longer in my shiny Kaiser 9" round. Cake was very moist.

review/summary: decent, but not as "dental" as I expected
review/text: I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. Also the only breath freshening ingredients- rosemary and chlorophyll, are at the very tail end of the ingredient list as dead last and third to last. I am glad that these ingredients are present, but they are in such small quantities, that they can't be helping much. From personal experience, I have not noticed and breath freshening results. I think the only reason why they are "dental" treats is because of the small amount of rosemary and chlorophyll as well as the fact that they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would recommend Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. However, this is still a MUCH better treat than Pounce brand or Meow Mix or any soft treat that can have soft sticky particles that will stay stuck to your cats teeth and smell bad and cause dental problems. This treat may not help teeth significantly, but they definitely won't hurt them and probably do some good; just not as much as I expected for the price. Also there are tuns of vitamin in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 5 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as "dental," they really should have enzymes or more prevalent dental ingredient.

review/summary: Kitty Crack
review/text: My cat, Oliver, is discerning.  Sure, that sounds like finicky but he puts polish on the concept of finicky.  He maintains his dignity at all costs and cat treats have always created a dignified stand at attention followed by a delicate consumption.... or a snobby refusal.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />The cat has lost his ever-loving mind.  The first time I opened a package of Feline Greenies (I can't even remember the actual flavor) he became a lunatic.  He put his paws on me and begged ike a common alley cat.  He salivated.  He pranced.  He did everything but cartwheels.<br /><br />He has this reaction every time I open any of the flavored packs.  They certainly have a stronger and more natural smell to them.  They seem to contain crunchy goodness.  And they turn my dignified british shorthair into a trolling cat addict.  Awesome stuff!  It now simply has the nickname "Kitty Crack"

But a year ago my vet told me Luna might have dental issues in the future. Also, Titan gained a lot of weight.... I decided to look into something that would help Luna... I found these and bc of all the positive reviews i decided to give it a try... It's only been a couple of weeks but all i know is that they LOVE it...

review/summary: Roland: King among noodle cups
review/text: Roland's chicken-flavor Noodles Cup is one of the best instant noodle products I've eaten. What makes it so good is the savory taste the chicken flavor packet imparts to the noodles. Additionally, I like it because it contains a minimum of ingredients. The only remotely "controversial" components are yeast extract and hydrolyzed soy protein, which some people have likened to MSG, as they are chemically similar. They add great flavor, though.<br /><br />I would like to point out that when I make these, I never use the little packet of dried vegetables. They don't rehydrate very well. However, the ramen is excellent without them.<br /><br />Additionally, Amazon has a great deal on this 12-pack; it's definitely less than I would pay for 12 of these in a store.

I added about 75% of the flavor packet to reduce salt.<br />An easy way to have a cup of noodles with broth depending on water added. I ate out of the cup which stayed sturdy.

review/summary: All Cascadian Farm Granolas
review/text: I have tried a  majority of the organic packaged foods on the market. Cascadian Farms does offer a pretty good price compared to the others, but the quality reflects that unfortunately. I guess if you are trying to buy organic and are on a tight budget, this would be a good option.<br /><br />This granola [and the two others I tried] tastes like it has been soaked in syrup and then coated in sugar. It was so sweet, I couldn't taste anything else. Not that there was much else to taste because there were about five raisins in the whole box and a only a sprinkling of cranberry bits. There were so few almonds and sunflower seeds that a person with a nut allergy could probably still eat this. Just buy a bag of organic oats and a jug of organic maple syrup, pour the whole jug over the oats along with some oil and bake it. You'll get this granola and it will cost even less money.

review/summary: Magic Breath Chews for your dog
review/text: I highly recommend these chews for your dog. They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's breath!<br /><br />I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.<br /><br />I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here!

review/summary: Greenies for Seniors
review/text: I have always used Greenies for my dogs. THese for seniors are wonderful. I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath. She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her. She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells. Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores.

review/summary: Kinda Pricy but good!
review/text: If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the 'brushing' aspect -- they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product.

review/summary: DOG LOVES THESE
review/text: I tried Greenies on my dog about 8 years ago and he won't eat them.  So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth.

review/summary: Great treat and good for dental health
review/text: This is a fabulous treat for my little cavalier king charles. He looks forward to it after his daily dental cleaning. I cut each greenie into smaller pieces, because JB (for James Bond) has long ears and he chews on the smaller pieces without letting anything fall on the floor and sticking to his ears.

review/text: I am the lucky parent of three dogs. I alternate their teeth cleaning chews and they love the Greenies and the Checkups best. Thanks to Amazon, I don't have to pay for S&H, which living in Alaska, usually costs a fortune!! Thank you Amazon!! I prefer to purchase from our local pet store, but they aren't able to get the Greenies or the Checkups, so I'm very happy that I can order them through Amazon.

review/summary: My cat loves the dog greenies
review/text: I was looking for a way to help clean my cat's teeth so at first I tried the feline greenies,but he wouldn't have anything to do with those. I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up. Oh well, it has become the only treat he likes so I will keep buying bulk boxes. I give him one every day, occasionally two, if I need to bribe him to stay inside when I open the door.

review/summary: Dogs love them - Owners hate paying for them!
review/text: My dogs are addicted to these things and it's my fault.  Whether or not they are good for my dog's teeth and digestive health is up in the air. All I know is that it keeps them quiet and they will do anything for them.<br /><br />I would lower the star ratings based on the fact that the manufacturer knows they have, some what, of a monopoly and charge an inordinate amount for these treats; yet, I am dumb enough to buy them so it's basically my fault.<br /><br />At least by buying on Amazon you are saving some dollar bills as compared to a traditional brick and mortar.<br /><br />My only gripe is that by the time you get to the end of the box, even if you seal the bag, they get significantly harder and I am somewhat concerned that they will splinter.<br /><br />Also, be sure to watch over your dog when he eats them, just to be safe.

I am not able to find these really small Greenies elsewhere; the smallest I can find in the stores are "petites" which are too large for these little dogs to chew.  So, thank you for making these available.  I was very pleased with the service; these arrived here quickly and in excellent condition!  I will order from this website again!

review/summary: Expensive treats but my dogs LOVE them!
review/text: I have two Airedales.  They aren't fussy eaters - or snackers - but each gets a Greenie at bedtime.  We let them out in the yard for a bit before they go to bed and all I have to do is say "Time for your Greenies!" to make them race for the house and dance around until they get that bedtime snack.  It's their special treat and I love the fact that they actually have to chew them moderately slowly instead of just inhaling them!  The only drawback is that they're expensive.

review/summary: My dog LOVES these
review/text: Ok, can I just express how much my dog loves Greenies.  I know that there have been reports of problems with dogs inhaling them without chewing them well and thus having digestion problems, but my dog savors them.  She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them.  She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other.  She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it.  The only downfall is the price.  I can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on Amazon and so I'll stock up on them when I can.  If I can't, she has to wait and substitute with something else.

review/summary: Dogs love them, but I don't think they love dogs
review/text: I will continue to give these to my dogs. They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from "green." It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product.

review/text: i bought this for my dog - he loved it.  however, i noticed that he stopped pooping and came to realize (after googling) that it caused him to be constipated.  His stomach was very bloated and I could feel that his colon was obstructed by something -- a piece of undigested greenies treat.  I gave him all some olive oil and mineral oil and massaged his colon and eventually he started pooping again.  I did notice that the greenie came out undigested!  This product is really dangerous and I would love to join in on a class action lawsuit against this unethical company.  They have made greenies 'tasty' but that is all it is.  a tasty but dangerous product.

The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out--- what a waste!
