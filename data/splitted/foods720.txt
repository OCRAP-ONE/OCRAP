Is there dairy in the product?  I would love to try this product, but must know what is in it before I make a purchase of six boxes. Therefore, I am unqualified to rate the product since I have not tried it.<br />Many thanks!

review/summary: A great substitute for alcoholic wine
review/text: While all my co-workers were drinking alcohol, I would feel badly that because of my blood pressure, I could not. Then at Walmart, I found this non-alcoholic wine, but could not get it shipped home. I went on Amazon.com, found it very close in price, and I am very pleased, because now while everyone else is drinking, I drink something healthy for my pressure, which tastes very good and makes me feel sociable. Thank you for stocking all the right stuff for any tastes.

Shipping to AK can be tricky, but the bottles and box were in good shape, no leaks and the soda was a hit!  Just a side note: add limes to the drink and it enhances the flavor, yum.

review/text: Mrs. Spudman picked these up at a pet shop boutique in Cape May, but in her enthusiasm failed to read the ingredients carefully. Our bichon suffers from food allergies, one of which is to wheat. To my chagrin I noticed that unbleached wheat flour is one of the ingredients of these treats. I'm happy to say that because these treats are so small, Evie had no adverse reactions to them. Both of our dogs loved them and immediately were excited by the intense bacon smell. Piper, who recently had four teeth extracted, especially appreciated these tasty, small, soft and chewy treats.

review/summary: The Real Thing
review/text: When it comes to sardines, Portugal is the center of the world - those that hail from its territorial waters are known to be the best and command a higher price as a result of their status as the real thing. But are they really better than their Spanish cousins, or those scooped out of adjacent waters by the Moroccan fleet?<br /><br />A recent flurry of studies on the inconsistencies of professional blind tastings of wine calls things into question. If highly trained experts can't routinely get it right when rating expensive vintages, how much credence should anyone be placing on the sardine selections of Amazon reviewers?<br /><br />It's up to you. Now, having issued this disclaimer I'll jump right in.<br /><br />These fish just taste great.<br /><br />Their flesh is both fat and firm, with a delicate aroma (though my daughter would argue they stink), and a fine lingering finish.<br /><br />Presentation is impeccable. The plump pilchards are tightly packed into a heavy-duty rip top tin. You'll be amazed at the metallic sheen of their delicate skin. It attests to the freshness of these bad boys at the moment of their canning.<br /><br />Does this seem over the top as it relates to lowly sardines?<br /><br />Not at all. In fact this is a case where the last will indeed be first. Being at the bottom of the food chain sardines are free from concentrations of all manner of toxins. At the same time, they score high in their content of Omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />What could be better?<br /><br />But are these any better than all the rest?<br /><br />You bet. I eat `em every day.<br /><br />How's that for hubris?

review/summary: Very Salty Sardines
review/text: As someone who enjoys eating fish and sardines, I was very disappointed in these sardines.  I have tried most brands of sardines and eat about 5-6 cans of sardines a week.  These sardines were extremely salty and the fish had a slightly off taste to them.  The sardines were almost as salty as anchovies.  I looked at the sodium content and noticed that it was same as some other tins of sardines that I had on the shelf but for some reason these were much more saltier than the other cans.<br /><br />I tried two tins thinking that it could have been a tin of sardines that were over salted.  The can was also difficult to open but I've noticed this problem with other sardines from Portugal.  A difficult can does not bother me as long as the sardines are worth the effort to get the can open.<br /><br />I had read a review online about these sardines and wanted to try them.  I usually do not write reviews but wanted to warn others.  I would suggest buying one can and trying it before buying anymore.<br /><br />One of my favorite sardines for the price is the Matiz Gallego Sardines in Olive Oil [...]  The Matiz sardines are nice and plump and have an excellent flavor with great texture.  The quality to price is excellent for these sardines.<br /><br />Da Morgada sardines are my favorite as this current time, but Amazon does not carry these and they are expensive at other online retailers.  I would suggest trying a can of Da Morgada, if you have a chance to pick up a can.

The difference is that the Matiz sardines in olive oil can be ordered in five-packs with free shipping (as of the time of this writing), and the Matiz product is every bit as good as this and a little easier on the salt.

review/summary: Not too bad!
review/text: I bought this together with the skinless and boneless sardines (105g) made by the same company - Angelo Parodi because the other one was supposed the best sardine in the list of a sardine lover.  I found that is simply not the case.  Strangely, this sardines is actually better than the skinless/boneless one.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />(1) More substance - this can of sardine weighs 120g, only slightly more than the boneless/skinless (105g), however, they actually have a lot more sardines than the other one because the other one only have a few sardines floating in a lot of olive oil.  This one actually have more "meat" and at a price of $ 2.89 comparing to the $ 3.69 for the boneless/skinless version, this one is a better buy.<br /><br />(2) Taste - it has a really good and firm texture.  The sizes of the sardines are a little big.  They remind me of the Delmonte sardines in tomato sauce I used to eat when I was young.  They did not have any fishy taste. (*I cannot stand any fishes that have fishy taste) It is just a little bit too salty for me but really not bad.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Like the can of the boneless/skinless sardines, it is very difficult to open the can by pulling the ring.  It is very easy to cut yourself if you are not careful.

review/text: This is my first experience with eating millet.  I decided to try it because it is one (of just a very few grains/seeds) that is acceptable on a low acid diet.  I was pleasantly surprised with the nice flavor of this seed.  I cooked it like I would oatmeal, for a hot cereal and I also used it to make a pudding like rice pudding.  I added cinnamon, raisins, and stevia (for a little bit of sweetness) and the pudding was delicious, as was the hot cereal style also.  I used the hulled millet because I wasn't sure if the unhulled would cook as nicely.  I think I made the right choice.  And, as always, Bob's Red Mill hulled millet was nice and fresh, as has been the other Red Mill products that I have purchased.

review/summary: Something we can all enjoy
review/text: First of all, I'm not a big Tea drinker. I'm far less than an aficionado. I'm 24 years old and hopelessly addicted to coffee and energy drinks. I've always entertained the idea of switching to Tea for health reasons, but have never made the transition mainly due to the taste of tea. I enjoy feeling healthy and coffee made me too jittery, energy drinks offer too much in a can and 5 hour energy shots work but are expensive. On top of it all, coffee, energy drinks and 5 hour energy shots devastated my intestinal track. (I drink all without sugar and use nondairy fat free creamer due to lactose intolerance)<br /><br />I tried various Green and Black Teas, but I couldn't get past the taste. However, the trouble was finding a balance between something I could enjoy drinking with no additives, but still get a decent amount of caffeine and ECGC. Then I came across Celestial's Honey Lemon Ginseng Green Tea. I know Ginseng is one of few "natural" roots scientifically proven to improve alertness, so that was an added bonus. The first time I tried it, I instantly enjoyed it. Although the caffeine and ECGC levels aren't as high as other brands, taste comes first and foremost for me. Now it is all I drink, besides Celestial's Sleepy Time blend.<br /><br />I don't work for Celestial, but I kinda wish I did, because I am so happy to have finally found a tea I actually ENJOY drinking.<br /><br />Since I'm not a huge tea drinker, I'd recommend it to first time tea drinkers and casual tea drinkers alike.

review/summary: Great Refreshing Lemony-Lime Drink - Either Hot or Cold!
review/text: I'm buying more of this tea today. I usually drink it hot and it's delicious that way. The weather has turned unseasonably hot though. I've been out planting plants and trees, and discovered that nothing is as refreshing as pouring this 'hot' tea over some ice. To me it tastes more like lime than lemon, but whatever it is, I like it! I plan on drinking more of it every day, because it's much healthier than most other options.<br /><br />ETA that it's even better if I brew another cup of white tea and mix it. It tastes fuller and richer, but you still get the lemon-lime taste. It's very cool and refreshing over ice.

review/text: I had minimal expectations for this tea. I've had low energy for months and have resorted to drinking ridiculous amounts of coffee. Not only have I felt jittery afterward, but I found myself downing more and more caffeine to achieve even a bit of a jolt. I tried two cups of this tea earlier tonight and am a little shocked by how good I feel. No jitters or anxiety - just lots of energy. Plus it tastes good. Highly recommended, especially for the price.

review/summary: Ginseng energy BOOST!
review/text: Woah!This is what I have been looking for. The ginseng lift off! So so hyper. So here is my review.<br /><br />So I have been looking for a tea that has ginger & grants energy. My first experience was Yogi brand Ginseng tea. It was too strong and gave me a headache for some reason. Next I tried lipton lemon ginseng. I was ok, in fact it goes really well with another tea that helps with mens health. Its didn't give me any energy. Last but definitely not least,Celestial Green Tea Honey Lemon Ginseng. Now as far as the taste I have to agree I don't really taste much green tea but im ok with that. I will admit it has a quite overpowering taste. But I do only add 1 cup of water so yeah. The cool thing is that I can actually taste the ginseng, that is all that really matters to me. Maybe if you mix a siberian tea it might balance out the zest,not sure. But the thing that really makes me happy about the tea is that the ginseng actually works at least for me that is. It all depends on the person for everyones body is different.

review/summary: Tasty, but quite overpriced...
review/text: I enjoy this item very much. If you're not a true "tea consumer" try the green tea with white tea. The taste is mild and a tad sweet. My only gripe is the price. I purchased this product at my local herbal food store paying a mere $3.29 compared to the whopping $15.00 listed here. Great substitute for coffee drinkers, which I am :), who desire less crash and more sass throughout the day. Caution: Not ideal for those who suffer from insomnia or other sleep related disorders, however, moderation is key so this product can still be enjoyed by all.

review/summary: Octopus snack
review/text: I'm not rating this because I've had this particular product, but I've had octopus before in a can and it was just the arms and they were very small and skinny. It was in olive oil and it tasted to me like sardines which I like. I didn't know a whole octopi is sold. There's only a picture and no real product description. Wish I had the bucks because I'd buy this and there are directions online how to cook a whole one. You can boil them, you can deep fry pre-cooked octopus, you can saute pre-cooked octopus and you can pickle them. Just look up how to eat 'em. I don't even know if the canned octopus I had was pre-cooked.<br /><br />I personally adore octopi as a species. They're super smart and they're not the crazed sea monsters horror movies make them out to be. Some are quite shy in the wild while others are just as curious about you. I've seen documentaries where the octopus is having a field day exploring the diver, then swims away.  I've seen an angry one and I've seen a scared one. All they do is just change color and I think there's only one octopus that's poisonious but it has blue rings on it as a warning. But of course I wouldn't want to be a hapless crab then it'd be lights out for good.<br /><br />And to that first reviewer, they're not legs, they're arms and you'd be squishy too if you had no bones. Octopi don't have a single bone in their bodies and they're not mean at all. Wouldn't know about giant squid though because no one has ever found one alive.<br /><br />I'd eat an octopus any time as long as it's dead. Eating a live one can get caught in your throat and you suffocate. Now that is the stuff of nightmares.&lt;g>

review/summary: Your kitties will thank you
review/text: I have had my three cats on Innova dry food almost from day one, the only exception being our 12-year old tabby who started his life on premium brands such as Nutro, Iams, Science Diet, and Eukanuba. Even before the great pet food scare of 2007, I learned that those brands, sad to say, do have by-products and fillers, and thrive primarily on their marketing and distribution momentum, and the recommendations of vets who are unfamiliar with many of the newer all-natural brands. Since discovering Innova in 2002, I've been a vocal advocate of this brand among all our friends with pet families, as the company's focus on healthful nutrition without deleterious additives and preservatives is key to their philosophy. Last winter, I tried samples of Innova EVO on both the kitties and our miniature schnauzer (whom we have since switched to Timberwolf Organics, another superb brand, just because of lower fat content), and found them even more excited about mealtime when they saw me approaching their food bowls. With regular Innova, they've all had robust growth, excellent muscle tone, supple skin, clear eyes and shiny full coats. After a few months on EVO, they're even more energetic and look better than I thought possible. The product is sold at natural pet product stores - listed on Natura's website (not the big chains) - at a better price and without the shipping costs associated with Amazon's partner. How do you put a price on your family's wellbeing? This is well worth the investment, and your kitties will be satisfied with less, as they're consuming no empty calories.  Besides the health benefits to them, there's the added benefit to you of easier litterbox maintenance, with smaller, more compact stools.  (On that score, we've found The World's Best Cat Litter to be the best alternative to clay litter.)

review/summary: Obvious improvement in our cats' health
review/text: UPDATE 11/17/2011:<br /><br />I'm dropping my rating to 3 stars. After months on this food with great results, our smaller cat started gradually losing the weight he'd gained when we switched to it, losing appetite, vomiting, and even refusing to eat. This prompted a trip to the vet, and as she's suggested that although EVO is very high quality food, the protein content is too high even for many cats. She did a kidney examination and checked for other signs of renal failure (thankfully none). Her feedback was that EVO is hit/miss from cat to cat, and when her clinic used to sell EVO they had many customers complaining of cats vomiting.<br /><br />It still seems to have worked wonders with my bigger fatter cat, but with the little guy it just upsets his stomach too much. I'd probably only switch to this food by a vet's recommendation.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />In my quest to buy more things online and save money I started looking at cat food and investigating what really makes good cat food. The two big discoveries were (I am not a vet):<br /><br />1. Cats are obligate carnivores. They are designed to essentially eat nothing but meat.<br />2. Dry cat food is often made of mostly grains in order to get the moisture level down to make them shelf stable.<br /><br />These two things are at odds with each other. A carb heavy diet is not easily processed by house cats, may not<br /><br />have enough protein, and can be tough on their kidneys. If you've read the other reviews here for this cat food, you know that it's highly recommended for cats with renal (kidney) failure, and there are some miracle stories of diabetic cats no longer needing insulin shots after changing to this food.<br /><br />The EVO dry food uses some patented process that I don't understand, but I can only imagine it involves a combination of wizards and magnets. The end result is a dry, shelf stable food that has much more protein than other dry cat foods, with fewer grains/carbohydrates.<br /><br />Both of our cats were healthy, but one was a bit on the skinny side, and the other was fat and lazy. Within weeks of changing over to this food, the fat/lazy one has noticeably more energy. His weight fluctuates a lot so it's a bit early to say if this has had an effect. The skinny one has definitely filled out and looks much healthier. He rarely begged for food before, but he does now.<br /><br />The food turned out to be more expensive than the Nutro stuff I was feeding them before, but given the immediately visible change in our cats I feel pretty comfortable saying that this food is healthier, and might extend their lives. If it prevents my fat cat from becoming diabetic, I'd say a few hundred bucks over the next ten or so years is well worth it.

review/summary: There Must Be Catnip Hidden In These Kibbles
review/text: Imagine this....two cats living the life of noblesse oblige. Six different bowls of dry food surround these felines on a daily basis. Thus, the cats are never close to being near the realm of famine.<br /><br />Then, I realize that Creampuff the Nasty is urinating more and generally being lazy. Elfie the Toothless vomits all the dry food after she eats, not unusual given her lack of teeth. Thus, I resolved to free my kitties of the tyranny of commercial, supermarket, dry food. It was an experiment that would have scared Dr. Frankenstein. Would my beloved brethren of puttygatos take their revenge in ways I had not yet considered after I took away their much loved food?<br /><br />Bowl by bowl, I stealthily switched to expensive, specially formulated cat kibbles. You name it. Every brand ever created. I was proud, I was broke.<br /><br />Alas, the Spoiled Ones disdained the new food ever so loudly. Nay Nay, they meowed, we shall not eat this expensive food! We are above it all, we are Felines.<br /><br />Then, EVO Dry Cat Food appeared in my vision. It was like stumbling out of Death valley and looking at the Pacific for the first time. I tried the standard version. The cats went wild. They sang and purred with joy, they slept next to the food. IT'S ALIVE!!!!<br /><br />Then, EVO's Herring Dry Cat Food was released. Yes, Yes, now there would be TWO versions. The cats sang and purred with joy again.<br /><br />Now Creampuff the Nasty is Creampuff the Contented and Elfie the Toothless is...well, still toothless, but she has gained 6 much needed pounds and her day now revolves around the dry food rather than her canned food.<br /><br />So, EVO is the greatest dried cat food ever created. Period. Check the ingredients, these cats eat better than we do.

review/text: Having nine felines..this is a great alternative to the more junk filled brands such as IAMS and Science Diet.<br /><br />If you are interested in a meat/grain/veggie mix dry food instead of the commerical brands with high quantities of artificial/unhealthy fillers that are routinely added to the everyday brands ..try this as great healthy alternative.

review/summary: Seems nutritious but switching to another premium food
review/text: I bought this food for my first kitten after learning about how horrible the better-known brands of dry cat food are.  I switched from initially feeding my seven month-old kitten Purina One.  It was amazing how quickly the change in her diet was evinced in an increased shininess and softness in her coat and activity-level.  She seems much happier.  However, there are a few things that prevent me from giving five stars:<br /><br />1.  It doesn't seem as palatable as the other food I was giving her, Purina One.  Maybe that's just because of all the additives in Purina, but I've read this elsewhere as well.  When I was transitioning, I noticed that she always ate up the Purina first.<br /><br />2.  Digestive problems and recurrent diarrhea.  I'm not sure, but I read that the extremely high protein content by weight of Innova Evo may cause digestive and/or kidney problems in some cats.  (I think the percentage is close to 50% when most other dry cat foods are closer to 30%.)  My cat seems to fall in this category.  I'm not sure, but I'm going to switch to Wellness (also grain-free) or Natural Balance for a while to see if this helps her.<br /><br />So in conclusion, great food if your cat's digestive system can get used to it.

I have to feed my cat three times a day, small amounts because she throws up when she gets  too much.

review/summary: Cats like it, but, oh, the SMELL!
review/text: The shelter from which I adopted my two kittens recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VTFIWK">Wellness Kitten Health Dry Cat Food</a>, but I didn't want to have those cats who refuse to eat any but one brand of food (have you seen the opening scene of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HZU">The Long Goodbye</a>," starring Elliott Gould? if not, look for it on YouTube), so I got this as an alternate, and I switch them every few days. I also feed them a small amount of wet food--some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7A5XA">Innova EVO Cat and Kitten Canned Cat Food</a>, some Merrick--every two or three days, to help them stay hydrated and because they delight in it. I'm considering getting them a fountain.<br /><br />They're energetic kittens and willing eaters, and I've never noticed their showing any preference for either of the dry foods I serve them. What I have noticed, however, is that whenever I've given them this Evo dry food, their poop for the next day or so smells horrible. HORRIBLE. Like something very wild, very nutritious, and perhaps a bit garlicky got overheated and died in the litterbox. The covered litterbox, with the charcoal filter in the top.<br /><br />Maybe the awful stench occurs because they don't eat this noble kibble all the time, and it takes some adjusting to? I don't know; I'm still experimenting. But it sure does make me reluctant to continue feeding this to the boys. I'd hate to sacrifice their health to my convenience, but I do have to live here, too.

review/summary: Healthier cats
review/text: I recently obtained a young stray in shabby condition. Being my first cat, I asked the vet for a recommendation on cat food and her first pick was Innova EVO. There are three other cats in the house I live in and I put them all on Innova. The stray now looks like a brand new cat with shiny coat, LOTS of energy, and good muscle tone. He won't TOUCH other "junk food" brands now and even passes up wet food for his Innova. The other cats had no problems switching either. Their coats improved as well and they lost their dandruff problems. One of the three is 14 years old, very obese, and barfed daily; she lost the weight and no longer throws up.<br /><br />The vet warned that the food should be supplimented with an appropriate wet food if the cats do not drink enough water (the stray drinks plenty but the others do not) because the extra protein can further dehydrate a cat. Contrary to most recommendations that cats be put soley on wet food, I was told dry food helps keep their teeth in shape. So I guess at the very least, as far as dry food goes, this is the best I have heard of and the results show it for me. :)

review/summary: Cats Who Seem Sensitive to Evo Cat and Kitten Food
review/text: We adopted a rescued 4 month old Siamese kitten (Cosmo)in May 2008. He was really scared after being dumped at the local animal shelter with his 3 siblings, and was a reluctant eater.  After 3 weeks trying dry and canned kitten food, I bought NuVet Plus supplement and sprinkled 1/4 teaspoon on his cat food.  He began to eat better.  Then we found EVO Ancestral Diet Kitten and Cat food.  He thinks he died and went to Heaven and will not eat anything but Evo (not even treats).<br /><br />We now have four rescued cats (Cosmo the Seal Point Siamese, Missy the Tiger Tortoise, Jennie the black DSH, and Buddy the Black Bombay) and they all love EVO and thrive on it.  None of the 4 cats is overweight, and they DO NOT overeat on Evo. Velva sometimes puts down more than 2 ounces, and the excess is left in their bowls at the next feeding time.  Since Evo is very nutritious, I now sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of NuVet on 8 ounces of Evo for the 4 cats at each twice a day feeding.<br /><br />As we adopted each cat and started it on Evo, we had some diarrhea and gas.  I sprinkled a smidgen of Coleus Forskohlii and Milk Thistle on the Evo every other morning to cleanse their liver.  I pulled open the casule and used these human grade herbs that we both take each day.  Every other day, I sprinkle Soil Based Organisms (a mix of 13 probiotics) from [...] on their Evo.  Walla! No more loose stools and almost NO litter box odor!  I think it helps that we switched to Swheat Scoop natural litter earlier this year.<br /><br />All 4 of our cats are healthy and active and have soft shiny coats and beautiful eyes.  We play with them at least twice a day. We got a Drinkwell 360 water fountain about 6 months ago to make sure they have plenty of water.  They were all fascinated with the running water when we brushed our teeth and we got tired of holding our hand under the faucett for them.<br /><br />I have gone over the Innova web site in detail and they seem to be truly concerned about cat nutrition and health.<br /><br />Jess and Velva Crawford

review/text: My cats loved this dry food. For me, it's a toss up between this brand and Merrick's Before Grain. They are both extremely high in protein with no additives and added calories. My obese cat definitely doesn't need that in his life. When I fed this to them as a treat, they took to it right away. Even my finicky cat came up to me when it was time to give them some of this food. They both ran, meowing, and circled my legs until I was done pulling the contents out of the bag. I was amazed to see my finicky one react that way. He has only reacted that was with Merrick brand foods, both wet and dry, and Innova Evo.

review/summary: The best of dry, but dry may not be enough.
review/text: My cats have eaten Evo dry for several years, and I've always taken pride in their energy and shiny coats. Sometime last year, however, I watched my large male cat's health start to decline. He lost muscle mass, whiskers, and his coat was growing duller. Much more alarmingly, his nose began running and he began to have occasional seizures.<br /><br />After tests at the vet ruled out any obvious problems, I switched him over to a high-quality canned food and began supplementing taurine. It's too early to say if this is the end of his troubles, but his health has visibly improved.<br /><br />If you ever see your cat begin to suffer and do any reading on nutrition, you will quickly learn that virtually every respected unbiased cat authority strongly recommends that cats be fed a quality canned food. Now, my cats adore Evo dry. Clearly, it's a good product and I hoped it would be a fine substitute for canned, given the convenience factor, but it appears that even grain-free dry food isn't enough, at least for some large, active and muscular cats.

review/text: I adopted a cat from the Humane Society that spent about a year in a cage hiding from prospective owners.  When I took her to the vet for her check up within a month of adopting her, I was told she needed her teeth cleaned.  (that was probably why she was only eating a few bites at a time of the Purina I was given with her adoption kit.)  Now she eats Innova cat food exclusively (now and then she gets a little bit of Merrick canned dog food as a treat when I feed the dog a little canned food as a treat).  I have to say that her appetite is terrific, her coat feels and looks a lot better and her stools are firmer when I scoop the "potty" box.

review/summary: I like good, wholesome, healthy food and so does my cat
review/text: I recently had a bit of a cat food crisis.<br /><br />I've cared for cats for most of my life and have always fed them a decent, mid-priced, grocery store dry cat food.  Until I tamed Gus, a little feral fuzzball who I found outside of my apartment.  I started him out on the cheapo, no name cat food because I didn't know if he'd take to taming but once I realized that he was going to be an indoor cat, I switched him over to an indoor formula.  As a formal feral, he'll eat pretty much anything so he didn't have any problem with the indoor formula stuff but I did.  He had such soft, smelly poos that the stench would wake me up at night.  Something had to change.<br /><br />After one particularly bad weekend, I took Gus to the vet and explained the situation and he suggested that I try feeding Mr Poopy Butt a grain free diet as he might have an intolerance to grains since he grew up without them.  As someone who avoids processed foods in my own diet, I realized that I should expect the same of my cat food.  I tried to find something at the grocery store but was shocked reading the ingredients to find that they were mostly cheap fillers that didn't serve much of a nutritional benefit to kitty.  So after some web searching, I bought a small bag of Evo to see if Gus would successfully make the switch (who was I kidding.  Remember, he'll eat almost anything) and litterbox time got better almost immediately.  He has more energy and is actually eating less than he used to of the cheaper stuff - well worth the higher cost.<br /><br />Now, I'm getting a full night sleep and I'm looking for a new nickname for Mr Poopy Butt.  Any suggestions?

review/summary: Yes they were bought by P&G, but it's still a good quality food!
review/text: A few months ago I got a new kitten (Hermes).  I already have 2 cats (Kelsey 14 and Joe 5 years old), and they were on Blue Buffalo.  But of course I was wanting to get the BEST cat food for my babies (Blue Buffalo is good, but Hermes didn't seem to like that one.  Darn picky baby!)  So I went over to Pet People (since they have more selections on grain free foods), and the very helpful person there suggested Orijen.  I got the sample size, and took it home.  Hermes, wouldn't touch it, and neither would Kelsey or Joe.  I have never had picky cats, so I was totally frustrated by this.  Luckily it was just a sample bag.  Apparently Orijen changed their formula, and cats have NOT been accepting it.  I digress though!<br /><br />I remembered the different brands that were on display at Pet People, and Evo was one of them.  I have researched all the other brands, and Evo seems to be the best option.  Okay, YES, they were bought by P&G.  Am I really not happy with that?  YES.  But, it won't prevent me from buying the food so long as the formula stays the same.<br /><br />Why did I choose Evo over the other grain free options (Still really po'ed about them nixing Orijen)?  The first ingredients!<br />Turkey, Chicken Meal, Chicken, Herring Meal, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols, a Natural Source of Vitamin E)<br /><br />Almost all the other grain free formulas I have looked into, all have a meat as the first ingredient followed by peas or potatoes.  Not the thing you want to see.  The first ingredients make up the bulk of the food.  So, I got a bag of Evo Turkey & Chicken Formula Dry Cat and Kitten Food, and VOILA!  Everyone ate it, and seems to really enjoy it.  Hermes is growing like a little weed, and his coat has improved dramatically.  Kelsey and Joe even seem to have more energy.  Everyone is happy at this home!<br /><br />One final thing I want to add.  If you have a cat like me (Joe is 16 pounds atm), you really do need to portion out food.  1/4-1/2 cup per day, is ideal.  Because of the higher protein content and no fillers, your baby(ies) will need to eat less.  For a long time I free fed because my cats were in the country and got to run around 8 acres.  They now live in an apartment, and get significantly less exercise.  Which means portion control!

review/summary: Affordable low-carb food
review/text: EVO Turkey and Chicken Dry Cat Food is an affordable, low carb food with balanced nutrition.  It even has probiotics added to it!  I appreciate the fact that Evo has replaced the potato flour that used to be in their dry foods with chicken meal.  Kitties don't need any extra starch.  I feed my cat 5/16-6/16 cup per day (depending on his weight), split between two meals.  I add 1/4 cup of water to each meal to ensure that he is properly hydrated; he drinks the water off the top and then eats the food.  If he seems to crave fiber (which he demonstrates by escaping and eating lots of crab grass), I supplement his food with green beans, which he loves.<br /><br />By feeding him EVO dry food and supplementing with water and vegetable fiber, I feel confident that he is getting a diet which has a macromolecule and water content that is similar to what his wild ancestors would have eaten (mice, birds, insects, grass, and other plant matter)--and at a relatively low cost.  One 6.6 lb bag lasts 1.5-2 months.

review/summary: Evo dry food is very good quality
review/text: My cat loves this food; One can tell that is well made product. Evo dry food is very good quality and must be very testy since my kitten loves it. It is a high with protein and has no junk stuff, chemicals, fillers and other harmful elements. Many vets highly recommend Innova Evo so I tried it and did not regret it at all. It is superior to the pet-garbage-food sold in the regular food stores.

review/summary: Was great by Natura - but NO to P&G
review/text: Used to buy this product - no longer do.  Expect recalls and problems with this product being made by P&G.  Please read article below found on: [...]<br />As we know, many of these big companies end up having the product made in China - we will not give food products from China to our three pets.<br /><br />May 5, 2010<br />Procter and Gamble to Acquire Natura Pet Products<br /><br />Indeed, this is very sad and unwelcome news!<br /><br />Procter & Gamble (P&G), the manufacturer of Iams and Eukanuba dog and cat food, has signed a deal to purchase the privately held company, Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />Natura's holistic dog food brands include Innova, Evo, Healthwise, California Naturals, Mother Nature and Karma, and are sold only in pet specialty stores and veterinary clinics, mainly in the US and Canada. We included three Natura dog food brands on our List of 10 Best Dog Foods.<br /><br />P&G says the move allows it to "expand into the attractive holistic and naturals segment of the pet food category", complementing the company's current pet food brands and helping advance an overall growth strategy of "reaching more consumers in more parts of the world more completely."<br /><br />Procter and Gamble says it plans to close the acquisition of Natura in a month or so. Natura has about 140 employees, located mainly at its production sites in Fremont and San Leandro, Calif. Specific terms of the deal were not disclosed.<br /><br />Natura was founded in 1989 by John and Ann Rademakers (now in their 70's), and Peter Atkins.<br /><br />John Rademakers says, "Its time for the right company to take our brands to the next level of growth. P&G is that company. We know that P&G will honor our history as they capitalize on their strengths to build these brands."<br /><br />Press Release: P&G Acquires Natura Pet Products.

review/summary: A great grain-free choice
review/text: I recently adopted two kittens after the death of my 16 year old cat from kidney failure.  Like many cat owners, I knew nothing about cat nutrition, and I assumed if I bought food from my vet, or if I stayed away from the "bottom shelf" brands at the grocery store, I was doing well by my cat.  I don't think I'd ever bothered to read the ingredients on a bag of food, and I certainly knew nothing about the issues of feeding cats corn, brewer's rice, by-products, etc.  But a volunteer at the shelter recommended that I feed the kittens a mixture of dry <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X49XC">Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul Dry Food, Chicken Formula, 15 Pound Bag</a> and canned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKI82">Wellness Canned Cat Food, Kitten Recipe, 24-Pack of 3 oz. Cans</a>, and she encouraged me to read Pet Food Ratings (Google it - it's the first result) for information on nutrition and dry food recommendations.  After research on that site, as well as others, I decided to switch from Chicken Soup to Evo, in order to keep my cats on a grain-free diet.  They made the transition to Evo with no problem, and I'm continuing to mix it with Wellness canned, and they seem to really enjoy it.<br /><br />I know that not everyone can afford to feed their cats these high-end brands, and it's really unfortunate that the cheapest brands are absolute garbage.  But I do hope that others who are just unaware of the vast nutritional differences in these products will see the light as I have!<br /><br />To hopefully save others the time on some research, I'll suggest a few other highly recommended, nutritious options you may want to consider:<br /><br />Grain-free dry:<br />1) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019QIXW6">Orijen Regional Poultry and Fish Grain-Free Dry Cat & Kitten Food, 5.5lb</a><br />2) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O2APH2">Wellness CORE Grain-Free, Original Formula Adult Cat and Kitten Food, 5lb.14oz</a><br />3) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001709GF2">Merrick Before Grain #1 Chicken Dry Cat Food, 11.1 Pound Bag</a><br /><br />Grain-free canned:<br />1) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFS442">EVO Cat & Kitten Canned Cat Food</a><br />2) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKWDI">Wellness Canned Cat Food, Chicken Recipe, 24-Pack of 5.5 oz. Cans</a><br />3) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P8JNG0">Merrick Before Grain #1 Chicken Pat&eacute; Style Cat Food, 5.5 Ounce Can (24 Count Case)</a>

review/summary: the best dry cat food hands down
review/text: I was glad to find this high-protein low-carb dry cat food here on Amazon.  It is conspicuously absent from the shelves of many big box pet food stores.  maybe some mom-and-pop's carry this brand.  I have some finicky eaters who have their days when they decide they don't want to eat the homemade Food.  It is likely due to years of eating popular brand foods with high carb content,  mostly corn.  no doubt it can taste yummy but it's the same prescription for fattening livestock before the slaughter.  not exactly the goals I have for my cats.  they are made to have a high protein diet.  when was the last time you saw a wildcat chewing down on some corn?  by going to high  protein  I have noticed  am marked increase in my cats activity level.  also  their litter boxes smell much better.  high-protein wet food is the best day to day choice for my pets.  Evo makes a great supplement.  I can add some  to the wet food on those finicky days  without compromising on quality.  Evo can even be used  as a fun treat.  I recommend it,  and  my cats love it.

review/text: Our cats eat only grain free cat food and have varying nutritional and developmental needs. As such, this proved mostly desirable to the pickier of the clan (aged 3-17. there was no ill effects and they digested the food well. they look fabulous and are very healthy. a good choice when added to other similarly high quality premuim cat foods.

review/summary: My otherwise disinterested cat CLAMORS for this!
review/text: This is a preliminary review; we only switched from an all-dry Purina diet to a half-wet/half-dry EVO regimen a couple of weeks ago.<br /><br />This food is not as expensive as it looks at first glance. Feeding instructions printed on the bags dictate that the daily serving of this food is HALF as much as that of PurinaOne Urinary Tract Formula.<br /><br />There are two cats in my house. Anabel has always seemed pretty disinterested in her food. She'll eat when she gets hungry enough, but will often stop after just a few pieces. Treats make her sick. However, the first time I opened the bag of EVO, Anabel started crying and milling about at my feet. She absolutely gobbled the first few pieces I gave her, then cried for more.<br /><br />Unlike other brands we've tried, which make both cats sick unless we coordinate a very slow transition, neither cat has had a problem with this dry food. We could have fed them solely EVO after just a few days, but I don't want to waste what remains of the old food. . . although, the cats are enjoying EVO so much that I'm getting more and more comfortable with that idea!<br /><br />UPDATE 2/18/12: We finished up the old food and began using EVO exclusively about two months into our experiment, and at the same time Anabel developed chronic diarrhea. We switched her over to another premium dry food, and the diarrhea promptly stopped. (Unfortunately, she is not as enthusiastic about the new food!) The other cat is still doing fine on an EVO-only diet, but we will be transitioning both cats for simplicity's sake. Interestingly, neither has any problem digesting the EVO wet food.

review/summary: Wonderful cat food
review/text: My last cat became diabetic because I didn't understand the damage that most commercial dry foods inflict. By switching that cat to a canned food diet and monitoring his carbohydrates, I got him off insulin and he lived another five years after his diagnosis.<br /><br />When I got my current cat I was determined to never go through that again. Imagine my dismay upon realizing that this new cat gives a whole new meaning to the word "fussy"...and that he'd cheerfully starve to death rather than eat something just because I decided it would be good for him. Unfortunately, most canned foods were on the list.<br /><br />I eventually did find some excellent canned foods that he would eat, but I also discovered this dry food. As others have mentioned, it's grain-free, which is my highest priority in a cat food - canned or dry. After researching the other dry foods out there, I've come to the conclusion that this is the ONLY one I'll feed my cat. (It's a good thing he likes it!)<br /><br />I hope others get to the same place I did and realize that too many of the foods on the market today are downright toxic. I also hope others realize this before their cat's diet turns into a chronic health problem. Because sure, this food is more expensive than Meow Mix and even the "premium" foods like Iams and Science Diet...but it's still far, far cheaper to choose a more expensive food than it is to battle a chronic health problem.<br /><br />(That said, I would recommend doing some comparison shopping and find places where it's on sale. You may be able to find it cheaper elsewhere.)

review/summary: Cats like the food, but the weight of the bag listed was MISLEADING
review/text: In reading the product details, I thought the bag of Evo dry cat food was going to be 8 pounds.  In double checking today, after the bag of food arrived, two weights are listed, 8 pounds and also 6 pounds 6 ounces.  Very misleading.  I thought I was paying $25. for 8 pounds, not 6 pounds plus.  As they say, buyer beware,

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I have been feeding my cat Innova Evo Cat & Kitten (dry) from the moment I adopted her from the Humane Society. It's twice as expensive (depending on where you buy it) but it will last twice as long. To feed my one cat, who is a full-time indoor cat, I only buy food once every 4.5 to 5 months. Another plus is that I save on litter!! :] The food is so nutritionally dense, and less filler in the food means less filler in the litter box. The feeding directions on the side of the bag recommend feeding about twice as much as I need to; for the past two years I have feed her 1/4h of a cup per day (1/8th in the morning and 1/8th at night), and she has maintains a very steady 11.5 lbs.<br /><br />One complaint: she needs to be feed on a schedule, there is no way around it. If I free-feed she will eat a lot more than she needs to; she'll gain weight fast and use the litter box a lot more. I guess its not really a complaint because I'm happy to do it since it's good for her to not over-eat, and it's nice to not have my cat poop out half of the money I spend on feeding her.<br /><br />I have never had an issue with her getting loose stools related to the food itself, however she seems to be hungry a lot and sometimes (even though I never willingly give her any) she gets into people-food which may give her the squirts.<br /><br />Considering the great ingredients, and that the cost adds up to less than $10 a month, plus the money I save on litter, it's definitely worth it.

review/text: I gave this 4 stars because of the price and the fact that none of my cats would eat it. The food seems to be quality food, but the cost is outrageous for cat food. Even the cats outside would not touch this stuff. If you can buy a small bag first to see if your cat will eat it.

review/summary: Innovo Evo Dry Cat Food
review/text: My cat loves this food. It's the only food she'll eat. I've tried some other dry foods, just to give her some variety, but she refuses to eat them. She won't touch wet food, either. I like the fact that it's grain-free, too. Cats don't eat grain. They're carnivores. It does have greens and fiber, which is good for them, especially since my cat is strictly indoors.

review/summary: Best Dry Cat Food I've Come Across
review/text: Now that we've moved to a more remote area, we can't find quality cat food in the local shops. I was fortunate to find this cat food on Amazon. We have 4 kitties. One doesn't digest fish well (she must be part Maine Coon--I hear "Coons" have trouble with fish) but handles this product just fine. I like that Innova EVO doesn't use corn, which is just empty filler in cat food that leads to excess weight gain and chronic ailments. I will continue to buy this product from the seller.
