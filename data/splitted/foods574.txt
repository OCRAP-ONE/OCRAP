review/text: I bought this product in a store.<br /><br />Obviously, it isn't vegan since it has dairy. But I don't think anyone can convince me it is vegetarian. It tastes dangerously close to beef boullion. I'm not vegetarian, so I use them interchangably.<br /><br />Having said that, though, it tastes fabulous, even compared to beef boullion. I enjoy having it in the kitchen and it dissolves within seconds in hot water. The price is wonderful, too, in my opinion.

review/summary: Mighty Good
review/text: So delicious that even though I really don't need an entire case of the stuff, I'm going to pop for one unless I can find it by the jar again.<br /><br />Seriously *yum*. I'd been using other brands of vegetable broth for years when I unexpectedly ran out right in the middle of a batch of soup and had to scramble around in the back of the cupboard, only to come up with a truly ancient jar of Herb-ox Vegetable Bouillon Cubes. What the heck, no guts no glory, so I added one, and after tasting, another, and was instantly head over heels. Best soup I ever had.<br /><br />It's true that the ingredient list contains some questionable items such as salt, soy, whey, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and some close cousins to MSG, so if you're a strict vegan or sensitive to microscopic amounts (we're talking two small cubes to six cups of soup) to things that haven't actually been proven to adversely affect your health, run as fast as you can! Me? After looking more closely at the ingredient lists on the other vegetable broths I've tried, this one was little worse than the others and tasted lots better.<br /><br />And who knows? Maybe the extra couple hundred cubes that I couldn't possibly use up in a lifetime will make a great craft project one day. I do have a glue gun, after all. Meanwhile, I'll be enjoying the great taste that this product lends to my own version of vegetable soup.

These are multi-grain, lightly salted, triangle-shaped chips.<br /><br />They are:<br />* Non-GMO<br />* 100% Organic<br />* Loaded with Omega 3's<br />* No synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers<br />* No trans fats or high fructose corn syrup<br />* No artifical flavors, colors or preservatives<br />* Because they're vegan they naturally have No Cholesterol (cholesterol only comes from animal products)<br /><br />They have a wonderful crunch. And unlike many snacks, after you eat a handful of them, you feel satiated. With 18 whole grains per serving, I encourage the entire family to snack on these chips often. This is by far the best tasting snack chip on the market. I don't know how they managed to make a chip that takes so good and is so good for you at the same time.

review/summary: Strange...
review/text: Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say "man I can sure go for some raman", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars.

I am a fan of natural coconut water, and this is a tasty candy coated variation that makes a nice treat. It's good, but not $4.79 a bottle good. Even organic, fair trade, macrobiotic, super magical coconut water horn-picked by unicorns and poured by the tiny hands of endangered squirrel monkeys, sold at the overpriced trendy boutique health food store is less than $4.79 a bottle. Not sure who came up with the pricing here, but my local Mass Retailer store has it on sale for $0.80 a bottle at the moment, so I'll probably just continue to buy it there instead.

review/summary: My view in a Coconut!
review/text: So I bought this wanting to try it, I cracked it open and at first taste I was at the "This is mediocre" stage.  However, after buying another I have to say I think this tastes pretty good a bit sweet, but I will get into that later.<br /><br />Those saying it tastes like diluted Coconut Water, well obviously if you would actually read the bottle it contains: 10% Coconut Water...  Not only that, it's concentrated and guess what it's printed right on the bottle!  No way you say?  Yes way, read folks your concept and debate went out the window comparing it to 100% REAL coconut water.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />*Contains Sodium, Potassium and Sea Salt all three are a huge plus ^_^.  These 3 act as electrolytes which we all know by now, help you stay hydrated!  Even drinking a ton of water throughout the day I still feel a bit dehydrated.  After drinking 1 bottle of this I feel satisfied battling dehydration to nothing!<br /><br />*Introduces you to Coconut Water! (I myself am one of those people who likes to get the real thing after experiencing a diluted form of said beverage or food.)<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />*It is sweet, it has about 5 Tablespoons of Sugar and Stevia Extract making the flavor come out more than usual.  Unfortunately I have to ding a star for this as well, it does taste sweet as people have already stated and I feel they could minimize the sweetness if they lowered the amount of overall sugar.  Stevia is 300 times sweeter than sugar, so really the use of sugar should be pretty low.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />To sum it all up, if you want something that tastes of coconut and keeps you hydrated go for this.  In my opinion it tastes good!

I bought this and did note that is said coconut water "beverage"..., still I thought for less than half the price I pay for coconut water that doesn't need to be labeled as a beverage, I could stand to have a somewhat diluted product.<br /><br />Was totally not expecting it to taste exactly like something I would pay two to four dollars for.  And still, at the first sip, my gag reflex kicked in.<br /><br />Caution: This stuff is sweeter than your lucky charms from your childhood after you donated all the cereal parts to the dog and doused the already overly sweet marshmellows in gallons of sugar.  Without all the sweetness, the flavor itself may have been satisfactory.  I say may have been, because other than what had to be the entire sugar supply for the western United States, I couldn't really taste anything.

review/summary: Horrible taste!
review/text: First let me clear two things:<br />1. I like pure coconut water, and coconut products in general<br />2. This is not about the price<br /><br />This was the worst tasting drink I've had in recent times. It has a very strong artificial coconut flavor which almost makes you gag. If you have had real coconut water, this is nothing like it, but has more of cheap coconut rum flavor. It has an after taste like a dried out coconut that has gone bad. It also has regular sugar as well as a stevia extract which probably makes it overly sweet with a bitter aftertaste. There is nothing right with this drink. Save your money and pick something else.

review/summary: Tastes like a pina colada, not a sports drink
review/text: This tastes like artificial coconut flavor, like you would get in a pina colada mix or coconut candy. Real coconut is very mild and subtle and does not taste like this. This product is overly sweet and the taste was not at all like the coconut waters I've had from Vita Coco, Zico, or canned ones from Asia. There's only 10% coconut water in here, from concentrate. The rest is water, sugar, stevia, and some other ingredients like potassium chloride and gum arabic. Fortunately, all of it's natural.<br /><br />Unlike real coconut water, you also don't get any of the potassium kick. It's only 5% of your daily value. I got this at my local drugstore for less than $1. Don't order it from the current seller. That price is ridiculous.<br /><br />Glad I tried it once, but won't be buying this again.

review/summary: Coconut Jolly Rancher drink - Yuck
review/text: Anyone that likes this must have never had coconut water.  Imagine a lovely chilled chunk of watermelon on a hot day, nice and refreshing and slightly sweet - real, fresh coconut water is like that.  Now take a watermelon jolly rancher, drop it in a water bottle, and let it dissolve for a while - that's what Sobe Coconut Water drink is like, just with a sickly sweet coconut taste.  To be fair, it says it's "with" coconut water but I think they decided they could cut cost by adding artificial flavors.  Save your money and go to your local asian supermarket and under a $1 a pop, you can find a brand that suites your dietary needs and taste buds.

First, the ingredients are listed by weight, not by content so there is not as much chicken in the product as you might think. To make matters worse, there is only chicken and chicken meal in this product for protein. Soy meal is only a filler for dogs so they get no nutritional value out of it. If there were more meats and less fillers I would be more pleased with this product. I have a beagle puppy who chows this product down, however, this really means nothing. Just because your dog eats it doesn't make it good for them. Make sure the first few ingredients are meat, and the product has little to no grain (rice, oats, barley are GOOD; corn, wheat, soy, etc are NOT).

review/text: This is a great tasting and quick to prepare kung pao sauce.  Normally, the sauce is what takes the longest when making kung pao, or many other Chinese dishes, and this makes it easy.  We like this with cubed chicken, and then add the veggies you prefer.  Sprinkle on some roasted peanuts at the end and it's a very easy to make, very tasty dish.  Plus it's one of the only sauces I've found that doesn't have High Fructose Corn Syrup.  Getting it in a 6 pack at this price is a pretty good deal compared to my local options, so it's a win all around.<br /><br />Check out the uploaded pics for a full ingredient list (not in the Amazon description at the time of this posting).

I've also been throwing in a few dried Japon chile peppers for a little extra heat. It's about a dollar less per bottle than the Chinese sauces at my local grocer and it's the best I've tasted yet. I'll definitely be buying more...

review/text: As the title states, I love Steaz green tea (esp. the Peach flavor), however, the last time Amazon sent me my order (from their Subscribe & Save program), the tea had a very bad aftertaste to it. It was metallic tasting and very bitter. It wasn't expired, so I'm not sure what was the problem. I couldn't return the item (since I guess you can't return food and beverages, even if it's defective), so I ended up throwing it all away. It made me mad because I wasted money. Just an FYI - I have had several similar issues with other food items from Amazon, so I'd be careful to order food and beverages from Amazon. I guess the items stay in their warehouses for long periods or something because I've gotten melted gummy bears, stale crackers, and more bad tasting tea (Celestial Seasonings). I am now very cautious and hesitant to order food and beverages from Amazon.

I don't understand how adding more sugar to a drink makes it cheaper... it's suspicious and probably evident of either one group is either ripping us off, or the other group is masking low grade products with 56 Grams of sugar. It's probably both or that not enough volume is sold of these products making it a higher price. I drink my tea two ways unsweetened with lemon, or lightly sweetened (not with artificial sweeteners) with a fruit flavor and steaz covers both those desires. Theres a few alternatives, but their peach is definitely the best tasting of the lightly sweetened variety I've ever had.<br /><br />You guys gotta market your self better, I need to see cases of these things at local stores so I can buy them bulk. buying individual cans is making me broke.

review/summary: Steez w/ only 10g of Sugar
review/text: I drink Steaz b/ I have been trying to lose weight recently. I gained 20 lb in my first year of law school and am slowly losing due to a changed diet with no candy or soft drinks. I wish I could drink only water but drinking a beverage without any particular flavor makes me feel thirstier and I am never satisfied until I drink something sugary. I like Hint water at 0 calories and 0 sugar per bottle but they are pretty expensive for my student income. That's why I drink Steaz instead.<br /><br />My local whole foods sells steez for $1 a bottle but I have to take the time away from my studies to go there and carry them back. The slight premium for buying it here is worth it. As my review title mentions, there are only 10g sugar per serving. (that's less sugar than an 8 oz glass of milk!)  I end up only consuming 20 g of sugar in 16 oz of beverage. So far, I've lost 5 lb cutting high calorie snacks and drinks from my diet. I definitely credit steez and similar beverages as contributors to my weight loss. Steaz's flavor is subtle but delicious. I like it despite my crazy sweet tooth. I really only like their peach tea though. It's a healthy and tasty alternative to juice.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious, low calorie and organic...
review/text: The Steaz line of iced teas are all absolutely delicious and thankfully not loaded with insane amounts of sugar and calories. This flavor in particular had a great hint of peach to it and I could gulp down a case of these a day if I really wanted to.<br /><br />In stores these should be about a dollar each, so as of this review date, Amazon's pricing is significantly higher, but then they are also shipping cases of ice tea for you for free. Enjoy locally until Amazon's pricing comes down again.

review/summary: I really like Steaz, and this flavor in particular.
review/text: I'm a chef at a hospital, and we purchase these for the doctors there. I of course sample a few myself. The subscription price here on Amazon is the same as our preferred vendor price there, which makes it a great deal, and far cheaper than buying these at Whole Paycheck (i mean Foods).<br />As far as the drink itself, the peach flavor is fairly pronounced, but not overwhelming. It is also not crazy sweet. It has some sweetness, but not nearly as much as beverages such as Arizona or Xing Teas, for example. Add to that the organic ingredients and an eye towards healthy consumption, and this drink is a definite winner. I enjoy it immensely.

review/text: I found Steaz in my local co-op and I've tried all of the sweetened flavors and peach is my absolute favorite.  I'm trying to cut out soda, and this is the perfect replacement.  I think the peach flavor is the sweetest-tasting of them all, though it's still very lightly sweetened at 20g of sugar for a 16oz container -- an equivalent amount of Coke would be 55g of sugar.  And, it's naturally sweetened with organic evaporated cane juice and not high fructose corn syrup.  A very good choice!

review/text: I finally kicked my addiction to soda three months ago, but still want to enjoy beverages with flavor.  I love that it has just a tiny bit of sugar (and calories), but it has boatloads of antioxidants!  I've only tried the Peach so far, but I really like it.  It's a bit hard to find in most chain grocery stores, so I appreciate that I can get it through "subscribe and save".

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: Packaging was a bubble envelope with 2 clear flimsy plastic bags with the top twisted and knotted. Reminded me of a heavy ounce of weed you scored on the corner. Trying to say packaging was like amateur home made quality. I never bought coral calcium before and had no idea what to expect. It leaves you wondering just what this stuff really is.  I did hope for some directions (but no) as to dosage or tips to use, as the taste of this stuff is really strong and nasty. I guess I expected a tasteless white powder similar to the C itrical tablets I'm used to, only ground up. I guess Ill go to my local health food store and buy something to compare this "product" to to see if there is any resemblance at all before I ingest this unknown substance.  This stuff might be the best ever, but you would not know it from the presentation.  20 minutes after opening the package, and my fingers smell like I've been toking blunts all day. Is that what the good stuff does? I tasted some and even after eating dinner the taste of this crap lingers 8 hours later. My tongue is swollen.  I just licked the army green colored powder off my finger to taste it. I do hope it was not some sort of poison. I plan to return this as it seems unsafe.

review/text: Nice flavor - tastes and smells fresh. My only gripe would be that there is no grinder built-in (which would be convenient), but I simply transferred these white peppercorns to an old grinder that I had and it worked just fine.<br /><br />For those curious as to the flavor of white pepper vs black - I must say that they are very similar. The white is perhaps a little more 'tame', but really the difference is just the color.

review/summary: WOW!  Take a look at the nutritional facts.....
review/text: Yes, these gluten free cookies are absolutely delicious!  There's just no getting around that.  As I was munching my absolutely delicious cookie I had a look-see at the Nutrition Facts printed on the wrapper - that's when I had my second "WOW!".<br />ONE cookie is TWO servings - when was the last time you cut a cookie in half?  So....if you are glutinous enough to eat your entire cookie at one time, you have consumed 340 calories (100 are fat calories)and 40 mg. of cholesterol.  I was astounded to say the least.  As someone with a gluten allergy, I can tell you that there are other really good cookies out there without these kinds of overloads.  Try the Glutino sandwich cookies, for example.

review/text: I picked my tin of this at an Italian market here in Salt Lake City. The ingredients are the best. Just pure licorice and natural anise flavor. No sugar, no fake sugar. The flavor reminds me of sen sen, only I think this is smoother. It stays with me for a long time with a pleasant lingering aftertaste. Since I have cleaned up my diet, this is the perfect replacement for that little sumpin sumpin that I occasionally want to keep my mouth entertained.

review/summary: They're good... But charging over $3.32 per bar is pushing it
review/text: For those of you not familiar with the cherry ripe, the filling is a dried and slightly candied mince of cherries and coconut. This is coated with a thin outer layer of dark chocolate. They are extremely popular in Australia, where I live, and are in fact one of the classic candy bars we all grew up with.<br /><br />On the plus side, these things are delicious. So if they don't sell them where you are and you have a yen to try another culture's junk food, let me say cherry ripes are a pretty good choice.<br /><br />On the other hand, at the current price this pack of six works out at over $3.32 per bar. That is a little rich for a chocolate bar, which is the main reason I gave this product only three stars. If I'd felt it to be more reasonably priced I would've gone up to four.<br /><br />Unusually, on a per gram basis I'm pretty sure <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002X1831C">Cadbury Cherrry Ripe Multipack</a> offers better value. But hey, amazon's prices do fluctuate considerably over time, so it might be worth your while to check my figures. They may well be out of date by the time you're reading this.<br /><br />Theo.

The coconut and cherry filling is super-yummy and the outer coating of dark chocolate make it a total taste treat. How great that one can get them now in the U.S. through Amazon. It has been years since I've had one, and I still remember the lovely taste of a Cherry Ripe.

review/text: So, my Jelly Belly order arrived today. First, as the other reviewer said, it arrived in a nondescript plastic bag with red tape to seal the top. The seal was half off and the bag open. I don't know where they've been, but they smell and taste as if they've been soaked in patchouli. It's as if i've walked into a head shop and licked the walls. Very disappointing...

review/summary: Yum.
review/text: The fruit flavors are my favorite jelly belly flavors.  I never buy the regular jelly belly mix, because it has too many flavors that I don't like, and that I continually accidentally eat.  Like the awful buttered popcorn flavor (WHY?) and black licorice.  I was happy to see that there is a fruit bowl mix.  The only flavor that I do not like in this mix is coconut, and since those are the only white ones I can just avoid those.  No more accidentally eating a flavor that I hate!<br /><br />I was a bit surprised when my order arrived in bulk packaging, in just a regular bag that was closed with a piece of red tape.  I would have liked if the description made that more clear.  It never said that it would arrive in official jelly belly packaging, but I just assumed it would anyway.  It made me a little nervous at first, but all the positive reviews of the seller (in my case, it was The Candy/Cosmetic Depot) convinced me that it was safe.  It did arrive very quickly, at least.  That's not relevant to the actual product review though, just thought I'd mention it in case someone else is also expecting it to come in an official jelly belly bag.  I'll still give the fruit bowl mix 5 stars.  Even though (or possibly because of the fact that) I keep finding myself unable to stop eating them until after I feel sick from too much sugar!
