review/text: Regular salted almonds are okay but tend to be boring after awhile.  But Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds are just amazing.  I could eat an entire can in one sitting no problem, probably two cans.  I was tempted to give these nuts just 1 star because I'm afraid they're going to make me fat and broke!  FYI, I also tried the Wasabi & Soy Sauce almonds--absolutely no comparison, the Jalapeno Smokehouse blow them out of the water (at least to my taste buds).

review/text: These almonds are delicious. When you first start chewing, they taste like the plain Smokehouse brand. After a few seconds the Jalapeno heat kicks in. Not overwhelming but just enough to make the snack wanting you to eat a few more. Only bad part is that they are not available in the 38oz tub or jar like the Habanero BBQ flavor that is a better value. If you like them as I do, you can go through a 6oz can very quickly.

review/summary: Delicious with a punch!
review/text: I became hooked on these tasty tidbits, but after a while, I couldn't find them at my local stores anymore.  I tried Amazon and found I could order them in packs of six.  While the price is a little higher than I'd like, that is overridden by the fact that I can indeed get them, and they are delivered right to my door.  Ordering two packs gives me free shipping, too. These almonds are delicious by themselves, but when mixed with dark chocolate, they become irresistible.  The yummy recipe goes like this: take two almonds and one Hershey's dark chocolate kiss.  Pop the two almonds in your mouth and chew a little. Then pop in the chocolate kiss and chew, mixing the two together.  Sheer bliss!  I've become addicted and don't know what I'd do if these flavored almonds ever become unavailable.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

review/text: I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi.

The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value.

review/summary: Great Nuts with a KICK
review/text: I purchased these Blue Diamond Wasabi Almonds to try out for a snack and they are GREAT.  They are good as a snack between meals and they are quite filling.  My husband really loves the flavor of these Almonds.  I have already purchased another supply.  The price is so much less than at the grocery store and I get them right at my door step.

review/summary: Full of flavor
review/text: To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.

review/summary: Wasabi Soy Flavor is too salty!
review/text: I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, "hey that happens, no big deal..." A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, "hey that happens, it's hot out..." But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, "hey these are really salty" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.

review/summary: addicted to ... Lime and Chili Almonds
review/text: I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought "When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too.

review/summary: Great travel snack!
review/text: We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.  They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here.

review/summary: A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word "Bold" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a "Bold" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!

review/summary: Insanely powerful
review/text: I bought this oil after reading all of the reviews that mentioned just how strong it is.  However, it can't be understated just how powerful it is.  I have been using it for making cinnamon hard candy.<br /><br />I put a half teaspoon of the cinnamon oil in a blue, Kitchenaid measuring spoon and set it aside for a few moments.  When I picked up the spoon again, I noticed that the oil was blue colored.  Upon further inspection, I discovered that the oil had actually eaten away at the plastic--it was like I had put nail polish remover (acetone) in the spoon.  Do not use this product with plastic measuring spoons!<br /><br />If you're planning to make hard candy with this as well, I'd also recommend that you let the sugar mixture cool quite a bit before adding the cinnamon oil.  Adding it at the 300 degrees F needed for the hard crack stage just leads to an overpowering cloud of cinnamon in your kitchen and flavorless candy.<br /><br />This product is good stuff; just be very careful when using it.

review/summary: Awsome Cinnamon Oil
review/text: I ordered this because as a teenager I used to make cinnamon toothpicks. I have tried others and they were not the same, so I purchased this in hopes it would be different, and oh yes, my prayer answered. I used this oil with toothpicks to help me stop smoking, this is one great product. I have to slightly lick the toothpick befor placing the whole thing in my mouth or my mouth would be "on fire". After that it is just perfect, the oil takes the nicotine bleeding through my gums and it covers the taste so I can go about my business and not think about smoking. You are asking, has it worked? And my answer is "YES", it's working and going on 8 weeks now. Thanks to this oil it has helped ease the pain and cover up tasted I was hoping it would. As another poster stated, it is very potent so you may want to dilute this. Thanks for a 100% quality product.

It VASTLY improves the taste of the tea, also<br />helped me overcome a diet coke habit and with all the studies about<br />the benefits of tea and cinnamon, I feel good about drinking it.<br />Try it.  You won't be sorry (and since there are 2400 drops in<br />the 4 ounce bottle of cinnamon oil, it ends up costing you only<br />1 or 2 pennies per cup to drink the tea!

review/summary: Great cinnamon oil
review/text: This stuff is great.  It might be more expensive than the "cinnamon flavor" or "cinnamon extract" you get in the grocery store, but it is so much more concentrated that it works out to be cheaper in the long run.  I made cinnamon hard candy.  To 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup corn syrup I used 1 teaspoon (see update below) cinnamon oil.  That made a strong cinnamon flavor without being really hot.  Yum.<br /><br />Update:  The first time I made this I added the cinnamon oil when the candy was still 290F.  I got a cloud of cinnamon steam in my face and perfectly flavored candy.  I just tried it again but I let the candy cool slightly before adding the cinnamon.  I got less steam (but still a lot) and candy that was WAY too spicy.  I assume that the first time a bunch of the cinnamon oil evaporated, so the amount you need depends on the temperature of the candy when you add it.  Next time I am going to add 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon to the slightly cooled candy.

review/summary: Great Product - Brings Back Memories
review/text: I've been retired for a little over 4 years now. When I was in grade school, we used to go down to the local pharmacy and buy "Pure cinnamon Oil" and would soak toothpicks in it overnight. These "Hot Toothpicks" got hotter as you sucked on them. I saw a write-up recently where some folks were using them to control smoking and for weight loss. Well, I quit smoking 17 years ago, but I sure could use some help with weight loss. I went to my local Rite-Aid pharmacy, but they said they no longer carry cinnamon oil but that I could buy it in the "Spices" section of any supermarket. They were wrong! you can get Cinnamon EXTRACT, but that's just for cinnamon flavoring when you are making baked goods or candy. I wanted the Hot Stuff, the Pure Cinnamon Oil, and that's exactly what I got when I ordered the 8 oz bottle of it from Olive Nation, using Amazon.com. It works so well that I ordered a larger bottle, the 16 oz version the next time I needed to get some more. BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU HAVEN'T EVER USED THIS CINNAMON OIL, OR IF IT HAS BEEN AWHILE SINCE YOU'VE USED IT ---you can burn your lips and tongue if you are not careful. YES, I know this from experience! My suggestion is to start small ---- put several toothpicks in the oil for six hours. Take them out and let them air-dry (caution: don't dry them on paper or cloth towels or the towels will absorb much of the oil.) I dry them on mosquito netting. Try those. If that's not hot enough, double the soaking time. I normally leave mine in for 72 hours, then dry them for 48 hours. I've also found out that the flat toothpicks absorb better / quicker than the round ones. But you can chew on the round ones longer before they start to splinter. --- Good luck!

review/summary: Pure Cinnemon oil - Hot! and Very Powerful.
review/text: This is really good stuff, but use VERY sparingly. One drop in a recipe will still be very strong.  Two drops on your tongue will be very hot and make your mouth numb for half and hour.

review/summary: Perfect for cinnamon toothpicks!
review/text: I bought this in order to create the cinnamon toothpicks I remember buying as a kid. My sister and I could spend a dime each (or a quarter if they were really strong) for super-hot toothpick that would last for hours. I found the intensely strong cinnamon oil I was looking for and have already had several flashbacks. This stuff is seriously potent - be careful when handling. Wash hands or use vinyl gloves - don't get it near your eyes, or even on your skin/lips/tongue unintentionally. The 10 cent toothpicks were soaked overnight and the 25 cent ones for several days.  Man do I miss the 80s - Enjoy!!

review/summary: This is not the real thing
review/text: First of all this stuff is Cinnamon Leaf Oil and NOT Cinnamon Bark Oil. Olive nation is misleading people by not making it clear that this is Cinnamon leaf Oil. Even the label on the bottle they sent is different to the one on Amazon. Don't get me wrong,this stuff is Potent and will burn your hands if you are not carefull but it has no smell. And what is point of it if you don't get that classic Cinnamon scent? Only Cinnamon Bark oil will give you that. Compared to Cinnamon Bark Oil you can't smell this stuff. I wanted this stuff for my house, after seing them used in hotel in Sri Lanka (where the best Cinnamon Oil comes from)but I might as well throw it.

review/summary: Not quite LorAnn quality, but for the price it's good quality.
review/text: Say you want to demolish a small house. An nuclear weapon will get the job as well as anything so why not use it? Just because it works doesn't mean it's the best solution or the most cost effective. A nice chunk of C4 might work just fine. This stuff is C4. I've been a consumer of LorAnn Cinnamon oil for over 20 years and I've never found anything as potent or as expensive.<br /><br />For 8oz, $25 was too cheap NOT to try. I entirely expected to be disappointed but for the chance I wasn't, $25 was worth the risk. I'm accustomed to paying ~$2.50 for 1/8oz (1dram) of LorAnn oil which is ~$20/oz. That makes this product 8 times cheaper. In my opinion the flavor is about 90% and potency is about 85% that of LorAnn's version. Since LorAnn oil is powerful enough to actually cause dangerous reactions (like extremely hot chili peppers), that can actually be a good thing. I'm conditioned to both well enough to consume things most people wouldn't dare try and this oil is still strong enough that I handle it carefully. The flavor is a bit more like that of "RedHot" hard candies rather than overly-intense cinnamon (which is the best way I can describe LorAnn cinnamon oil).<br /><br />If you're into cinnamon toothpicks or candy flavoring, I can't imagine this being anything less than sufficient and for 1/8th the cost, you have to at leave give it a shot. They have smaller quantities if you don't want to risk $25.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'll ever spend the premium for LorAnn again now that I've had this, but then again, I have the equivalent of 64 drams now and I don't think I've used that much cinnamon oil so far in my life so it'll be a while before I have to purchase again :) The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it's not a 100% substitute for LorAnn cinnamon oil, but I wish I could give a 4.5 or 4.75 stars instead of just 4 out of 5.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: My wife said she couldn't find good cinnamon oil for her candy at the grocery store anymore and was in a panic because the grandkids were asking for some of her home made cinnamon candy. So I searched the Internet. I've had good luck with Amazon so I started there to see what I could find and to read the reviews. There were a lot of positive reviews on the OliveNation Cinnamon oil sold by Jr Mushrooms & Specialties so I ordered a 4 ounce bottle. When it arrived I opened the bottle, took a whiff and dipped a toothtick on the bottle for a taste. WOW!..This is the REAL DEAL!!!!! If you looking for a good Cinnamon Oil, you just found it.

review/summary: Love It
review/text: I'm a huge fan for cinnamon. The taste, the smell, and the sight is enough to make my mouth water. I purchased this cinnamon oil for no other reason but to have some delicious cinnamon oil at home. If you're worried about wasting your money on weak cinnamon oil, then you should definitley have no worries with this stuff. After seeing the reviews and how people make cinnamon toothpicks, I decided to do it too. Let me tell you, after washing my hands (with soap) then doing the dishes, my fingers still smelled (and tasted) like cinnamon! This stuff is really strong, and the toothpicks will just about burn a hole in your lip if you leave it sitting there. These toothpicks are great to carry in a mint tin to use after a large, garlic/onion meal. And since it's pure cinnamon oil and not candy or gum with sugars, its great for your teeth, digestive system, and breath without leaving a nasty aftertaste. All in all, this is great oil; a bit pricey but worth it. Also, the oil you soak the toothpicks in can be resused over and over again, as long as the container is sealed shut; so I can see this oil lasting for a very long time.

I like the taste and they are really filling and curb your hunger for some time, although I often have a little something else with them at lunch.  They keep well, do not require refrigeration, and are just so convenient.  You would need to try them for yourself to see if you like the flavor and texture but I like them very much. I feel good about eating them too as they are a sensible food.

review/text: I bought these bars to take to work after reading a whole bunch online from a lot of diet sites about them. First off, let me admit that these bars are HEAVY. Each one feels like a brick. I usually have to pick and nibble on them, I can't sit and eat one like a granola bar. That being said, they are very filling. They're about 220 calories each and they do taste pretty good. As well, you should be aware that they're MEATLESS- its stamped right on the side; these bars are soy based.

review/summary: Forget the 'Names' you know
review/text: Forget Clif, Luna, Builder's, Power Bar, Nature Valley or any other goop/grain brick you see in the stores. They can't carry the wrapper for a Pemmi Bar. Tasty, energy-packed, nutritionally balanced and all natural, these gems rock. I discovered the Raisin Nut variety 30 years ago, and they've been saving me ever since. They banish hunger, taste great and don't punish you with a sugar crash (I'm sensitive to this).<br /><br />NOTE: Eat these babies slowly. If you don't take small bites, you'll think you just bit into a chewy cotton ball. Pemmi Bars need saliva. So if you give them the space and time to generate it, you'll be a happy camper, biker, worker, traveler, spectator, parent or any other human who needs quick, big-time sustenance.<br /><br />BONUS: Pemmi Bars keep amazingly--probably indefinitely in the freezer, where I store mine. But I've eaten unrefrigerated bars literally years old. Taste and consistency suffer, but they still get the job done.<br /><br />At 420 calories a bar, Pemmi Bars outpunch all the rest and can easily replace a meal in a pinch. Don't want the whole thing? Rewrap it, and save it for a week. Or two. Or...yeah, I've eaten open ones pretty far down the road--with no problem. I'm obviously a major booster, and I put Pemmi Bars in the elite class of brilliantly effective, bombproof products including bow saws and the Concept 2 rowing machine. So do yourself a big favor. Try a bar.

review/summary: FOOD BAR!
review/text: I was introduced to Pemmican bars at Philmont Scout Ranch.  Specifically the cocoa karob.  I ate pretty well when the kids I was with turned up their noses at these bits of real food.  The cocoa karob, specifically, was just too far removed from the candy they wanted in a bar.  This was food.<br /><br />These things rock.  It's really a food bar, though they get lumped with energy bars a lot.  They have a ton of complex carbs, good fats, fruits, fibers, food, etc. lumped into a hunk that you can easly find room for in a backpack.  Then, provided you have enough water to get some portion of it down... you're good to go.<br /><br />The flavor is not very exciting, and the bars are very dense.  The fruit and nut is fairly sweet, but not what I would call a fruit bar.  I prefer the cocoa karob, which is less sweet and seems to have less of the malty flavors going on in the fruit and nut.<br /><br />I've taken these for ultra trail runs that had no aid stations.  They are a must on backpacking trips.  I grab them when I need food during the day, but am not going to get a full meal in.  I can eat these fairly regularly without getting too tired of them, and unlike all the other bars out there, when I eat a Pemmican bar I feel like I have eaten something.  I feel full, and ready to move on.
