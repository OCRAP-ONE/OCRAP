review/summary: Pretty good, but...
review/text: Excellent size and not too many are broken, but they may be RAW, not ROASTED, so beware. Would be nice if the merchant was more explicit or offered options.<br /><br />I bought these for my wife who is somewhat salt intolerant, so would buy again IF they were prepared (or presented) properly.<br /><br />UPDATE: Contacted the vendor, who apparently has a problem with English, and does the "run around" game, so BEWARE.

review/summary: To me these are well toasted or dry-roasted
review/text: The nuts arrived very quickly (with reg. $5 shipping). They came adequately packaged in 5lb thick, clear double-plastic bags. There's no oily residue left on my fingers after handling these nuts, thus I say they're dry-roasted or well toasted, actually too well for my taste, as some have pronounced "burned" taste to them. Since there're very similar cashew offerings here on Amazon that state "roasted", I was naively wishing for these to be UN-roasted. Still, these are much less expensive & less burned than those in grocery stores & not covered in sugar, salt, oil etc...

review/text: I didn't actually order these, but wrote to the seller. He replied that these are indeed "roasted", not "raw".<br /><br />The raw ones cost a bit more, about $65 + shipping for 10 pounds (at the time of writing), or you can get the raw 320's (which are a large size), at 5 pounds for $35 + shipping. Both are still fairly reasonable.

review/text: While the flavor of Jolt Blue has changed due to the change to corn syrup from sugar back in the day, it's still pretty much the same thing that it always was.  It's still tasty (and where else are you going to get blue raspberry soda?) and it still packs the same caffeine punch that it always did.  Tasty, and in the classic bottles -- what more could I ask for?

review/text: This pecan meal is more like bran flakes than pecans.  I had thought it was ground pecans, and the name would indicate that.  The container it came in is very light, which was my first clue it was not exactly the whole pecan nut meat.  The "meal" is flaky.  The price might have been a clue, I suppose, since the per pound price of pecans is over $12 most places.

Really a lot of pretzels for the money. Will buy them again.

review/text: I grew up eating pancakes with real maple syrup, and the fake HFCS-based syrup just doesn't compare. Maple syrup is just wonderful with breakfast or as a sweetener in cooking. I had never had grade B maple syrup but recently decided to try it because it's a few dollars cheaper. Turns out I love it just as much if not more than the grade A syrup I was used to. It's not graded by quality like some foods, but rather by the color. Grade B is darker and has a stronger flavor. If you like one you'll like the other, and you'll like this Anderson's maple syrup. With Amazon's subscribe and save it's a much better deal than buying at my grocery store.

review/summary: Good, strong, Wisconsin maple syrup
review/text: I ordered this back in October through subscribe and save, and it arrived promptly and in good shape.  I then wrapped it up and -- two months later -- drove it nine hours north to Wisconsin as part of a Christmas gift basket for my parents in Waukesha, not having noticed that it's actually made by a family-owned business further north in this state.  Not only was this a good price for pure maple syrup (grade B, with strong maple flavor that goes a long way on a stack of pancakes), but it was a nice surprise to find that Wisconsin maple syrup is just as flavorful as that from New England.

review/text: I've heard that some grade B Maple syrups are too strong.  Maybe so, but this stuff is excellent.  This is the second quart we've received, and the flavour is perfect.  A bit stronger than grade A, but sweet, and very pleasant to my taste.<br /><br />PERSONAL TASTE NOTE: I also like my honey straight from the hive, and unfiltered honey is sometimes a bit stronger, as well, as it has bits of pollen and comb mixed in.  That being said, I have friends who are more finicky and they like this batch of syrup, as well.

review/summary: Pure Sugary Heaven
review/text: I've tried a few different maple syrups, but this is absolutely the best I have tried.<br /><br />First off, grade B has a much more delicious maple flavor than grade A without being overpowering. This brand is not as thick as most syrups, but it's a quality I happen to love. It's way less sticky and you can easily get out every last drop from the jug without having to set it upside down or breaking out a knife to scrape the jug.<br /><br />I love adding a spoonful into some almond or soy milk for a touch of sweetness, mixing in with some peanut butter (try it, it's delicious!), or making the best tasting lemonade on Earth.<br /><br />Even if you're not on the master cleanse or don't feel it's necessary/healthy you should still try the lemonade just to drink. It's way better than any refined sugar lemonade I've ever had! Two tablespoons each of both grade b syrup and fresh lemon juice with 8 oz of water is the most amazingly refreshing beverage you can imagine.<br /><br />My only complaint is I keep finding so many new uses for it, that I've been going threw a jug every week!

review/summary: It's a matter of taste
review/text: I LOVE ripe green olives, but do not often buy them, because I cannot eat less than a can at a time.<br /><br />Lindsay olives are what they are:  Very distinct from typical American stuffed queen olives.  No vinegar.  Only slightly salty.  With a mild nutty flavor.  To me, they most closely resemble ripe black olives---but milder.<br /><br />If you like olives but are on a low-salt diet, and perhaps mostly use them in salads, or even sliced on pizza, Lindsay Olives are terrific, as is the price.  For a delicious spread, microwave cream cheese for about 1 minute in a ~24 oz glass bowl (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MZPII">Marinex 23.7-Ounce Small Round Casserole with Lid</a>) to soften it, then mix-in coarsely chopped Lindsay Green Ripe olives.  To make a dip, add a tablespoon of milk and mix.<br /><br />For snacking, or as a light meal with cheese and fruit, Lindsay Pitted Ripe Green Olvies are a faint shadow of the truly wonderful genre of "California ripe green olives".  Unfortunately, the only brand you are likely to find outside California is Grabers olives,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P8HPCI">Graber Olives Size 14 7.5 oz. Can</a>.  Grabers are the Rolls Royce of ripe green olives, and are priced accordingly. About $1.50 per olive including shipping to the East Coast, perhaps $1 per olive if you buy them by the case directly from Grabers.  What's the difference?  Bigger, better olives to begin with, PITS, and careful processing.  The pits make a huge difference in any olive---they impart a nutty flavor to the flesh.  In the case of Grabers, the flaver is nutty and buttery. If you want to impress your guests at a buffet, serve Grabers---and go for the big size 16 olives.  They'll cost you about $2 each (i.e., per olive), but are worth it.  Unfortunately, Lindsay does not sell unpitted olives.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAKUP0">Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAIR46">Byzantine Pitted Country Olive Mix, 5-Pound Bag</a> Both are nice mixes of unpitted olives, without hot-peppers or other excessive flavoring.

review/summary: Best Coffee Ever
review/text: My wife had some coffee at the Cafe d'Arte coffee shop when visiting her mother last year. She raved about it so much that I contacted their web site to sample some. It was great. Some friends who own a local restaurant (which prides itself on its good coffee) agreed that it was the best they ever had. I reordered several times, before deciding to look up the price on Amazon.<br />Short version: Same coffee, much better price.

review/summary: Alternative Thickner!  Gluten-Free!
review/text: This gluten-free starch  is used to thicken soups and gravies.  Its main advantage over other starch thickeners is that it's a permitted ingredient for Passover, unlike cornstarch and other grain-based foods. Liquids thickened with potato starch should never be boiled.  Supermarkets often stock it among the Kosher products. I have used this in cakes and in some gentle sauces.  There is no taste that comes from this so just the flavor of the ingredients comes through.  It is very silky and fine.  Remember you do not want to let your sauce boil with this starch.  Those who are on a gluten free diet may be able to use this.

review/summary: Potato Starch
review/text: What can I say about potato starch. It's just potato starch, so this review will be on Barry Farm instead of potato starch.<br /><br />From Barry Farm you're going to get things cheaper, much cheaper. I've been buying products from Barry Farm for several years and they have been great to deal with. Their shipping is fair, but unfortunately, flours and starches weigh a lot and shipping isn't cheap. I purchase items from them that are too expensive to buy locally, things I can't find locally (finely ground white corn flour, sweet rice flour and Ivory Teff) and items that are better quality than what I can buy locally (the best sorghum flour anywhere). I usually order 25 or 30 pounds of product at a time and that reduces the overall price per pound to a reasonable cost.

review/text: I love this product, and I wish it was easier to find in the stores.  For some reason, I can never find it. Our local stores will order it, but they won't call and let you know it came in.  By the time I get there, it's already all been sold.<br /><br />This is a great side dish with a piece of chicken or a green salad.  I love it with vine ripened tomatoes, but my favorite way is to substitute Del Monte brand Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes. It amps up the spicy factor by quite a lot, but it's not hot spicy, just very flavorful.  Try it this way during the winter months when decent tomatoes cannot be found.

review/summary: Like eating kid's cereal!
review/text: This cereal is so tasty - it seems like you are eating one of those not-good-for-you sugary cereals that kids love. They are very similar to Cinnamon Toast Crunch. They do have a slight "healthy" taste, but it's hardly noticable. Even the kid's will enjoy this cereal which has an amazing amount of fiber in it - especially to taste so good (not like sticks)! I used to eat raisin bran b/c it had 7g of fiber and still tasted okay. Now I eat this, which has 9g of fiber and tastes awesome!<br />I highly recommend it. Oh, and the squares are small, about 1/2 the size of CTCrunch, so it's the perfect size for toddlers to pick up and eat. They'll think they are eating candy, but you'll know it's good for them ;)

My teenage children had the same opinion about Caramel Delight that I did...they liked it as an occasional high fiber snack, but it's way too sweet as a cereal!  General Mills should reduce the sugar, and instead increase the insoluble fiber in this cereal. That would make it perfect!

review/text: I was a skeptic about this product until I tried it with skim milk. This cereal is delicious and retains its crunch even after 5 minutes of being soaked in milk. I enjoy its texture and caramelly flavor. I think it could definitely be less sweet and lower carb, but so far, I find this cereal to have the highest fiber content. The other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies. This is perfect for breakfast or a snack any time of the day!

review/summary: My least favorite of the FiberONE options
review/text: This cereal makes getting your fiber easier, but it does not taste as good as the other products in the same line. I was expecting "Caramel Delight" to have a powerful caramel flavor, but found it lacking. It's not that the cereal is inedible - it tastes fine, but the flavor gets a little lost once you add milk. It's like you're eating "healthy" cereal - the "clusters" options make it much easier to feel like you're indulging and taste much better. Just be warned - don't eat too much. Don't snack on it like it's popcorn. It's got fiber, even if you can't taste it - and your body will let you know when you've had too much.

We have started ordering by the case because it's hard to find in our area.<br /><br />Yes, it's sweet, but I'm a dyed in the wool Frosted Flakes fan, so it wasn't too sweet for me. If you look at many 'healthy' cereals, they have sugar too - a cup of FOCD is only 40 calories more than Special K Red Berries (my old 'healthy' cereal.).<br /><br />I think the taste is rather like Golden Grahams - not a lot of cinnamon that I could detect to make it taste like Cinnamon Toast Crunch (a healthy substitute would be the new Total Cinnamon Crunch).<br /><br />5 stars!

As good as the Honey Clusters and Raisin Bran varieties are, this one may be the most fun to eat and will have you pouring yourself a bowl faster than you can run to the toilet (it is Fiber One, after all). The great thing is the taste, which is very reminiscent of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. The squares in this cereal are dusted (seemingly) with cinnamon (or caramel as the flavor claims) sugar.

review/text: Fiber one products actually don't have real fiber.  They contain inulin (from chicory root) which is technically fiber because the body can't digest it.  Unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that can't be broken down easily.  These products do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals) So if it says "chicory root" or "inulin" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.  So if you want lots of sugar and fat without fiber, this product is for you.

review/summary: Delicately sweet and rosey
review/text: I seem to have a love affair with roses.  I've always admired their beauty and fragrance. and then few years ago, I discovered they are edible.  The first time I tasted rose jam, I was in Vancouver, BC.  It was served on buttery vanilla scones.  I knew I had to take some home with me.  Since then, I've tried 2 other brands.  The Kafka is quite good and actually has real bits of rose petals in it which really boosts that sweet flowery flavor in your mouth.  It has just the right amount of sweetness too.  My only beef is, I found them at my local imports store for only $3.89.  I spent nearly $15 ordering them from Amazon.

review/summary: So good!
review/text: I first tried Rose Preserves at an Algerian restaurant and I was hooked. They are absolutely amazing and so delicious. I knew I had to get a jar of my own.<br /><br />This is now a staple in my household. I use Rose Preserves on all sorts of things but crepes are probably my favorite. Rose Preserves go wonderfully with both sweet and savory foods. Try it with goat cheese or Brie, you will not be disappointed. It's also divine over ice cream. And do not get me started on how great it is for baking...<br /><br />These preserves are quite sweet, so a little really does goes a long way (which is nice, the jar lasts quite a while even when I use it often). They're high quality and the flavor cannot be beat. I highly recommend these!

review/summary: Exquisite! An elegant addition to the breakfast table or tea tray
review/text: I am in love with everything rose. I wear rose lotion ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087L6T">Rose Milk Skin Care Lotion - 8 fl oz</a>), I burn rose candles (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00069ZDJS">Yankee Candle Large 22-Ounce Jar Candle, Fresh Cut Roses</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OEWDH6">Votivo Aromatic Candle Rush Of Rose</a>), I use rose lip balm (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049XKXRY">Rose Love Balm (Limited Edition) - 15ml/0.5oz</a>) and I drink rose tea (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017SZTRI">Teas' Tea Rose Green Unsweetened Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>.) I seriously surround myself with anything rosy!<br /><br />So when I saw this, *rose preserves*, literally preserves made with real rose petals, I couldn't wait to try it. Oh, the wait was incredible! When it finally arrived I didn't even wait for the toaster, I grabbed a spoon and dug right in!<br /><br />It's delicious. Divine. Extraordinary. It feels absolutely indulgent, eating a jam made of roses. It's so romantic and positively Victorian. There couldn't be a daintier dollop for your scones at tea time.<br /><br />So far I've had rose preserves on waffles, toast, ice cream, fresh fruit & yogurt, and coffee cake. I daresay it would even make a unique sweetener for hot tea.<br /><br />Speaking of sweet, that is my one issue. I find these preserves to be really much sweeter than I generally like; I prefer a bit more tartness, even in jams. Don't get me wrong: it's not overpoweringly sweet, there *is* a definite rose flavor in this, and definitely real petals adding unique flavor and texture. I just wish it weren't quite so sweet. But apparently, according to another reviewer who has tried other brands, Kafkas Rose Preserves are the *least* sugary! Any bit sweeter and it would definitely overpower the delicate rose flavor.<br /><br />So, while I can't give it a full 5 stars because I think it's too sweet -  and by the way I sure wish I could only deduct a half star -  I acknowledge that Kafkas Rose Preserves might be the best available. I certainly won't stop putting it on everything and yes, occasionally enjoying a tiny spoonful!<br /><br />I'm going to host a little tea party for my two little nieces and our American Girls dolls (My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010XH10I">American Girl Samantha Doll & Paperback Book</a>, Joelle's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZHY3H4">American Girl Julie Doll and Paperback Book</a>, and Lisey's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZYZAO">American Girl Kit Kittredge Doll & Paperback Book</a>) and I know the girls will get a kick out of eating jam made of flower petals! I'm also looking forward to my extended family's next brunch, because I will be proudly serving up some rose preserves. In fact, I may be giving out Kafkas Rose Preserves as hostess gifts in lieu of the boring bottles of moscato or prosecco I'm forever dragging to parties. This would be promptly opened and enjoyed, I'm sure of it!<br /><br />If you're a rose lover, or looking for a unique gift, perhaps a cute and clever new spin on "a bouquet of roses and a box of candy", I highly recommend these rose preserves!

review/summary: Amazing customer service
review/text: When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert "3-4 mm" to inches and consequently discovered the "Coarse Grinder Salt" was almost 1/4" (1/6" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!

review/summary: Great salt
review/text: This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.

review/summary: For more than salting foods.
review/text: Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.

review/summary: super fast shipping, free samples
review/text: placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).

review/text: I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.2 lbs. Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking.

review/text: This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.

review/summary: Difficult packaging
review/text: Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).
