review/summary: Orgain is still great- just beware of bad batches
review/text: Yes, Orgain changed their formula recently. Among other things, it no longer contains soy, which I think is a good thing since it can be an allergen and can cause digestive discomfort (gas, bloating, in some cases).<br /><br />Unfortunately, with this change, apparently some bad batches made it out into the market (mine were dated 8/21 and 8/22). These batches have a weird and very strong "grassy" flavor that is indeed quite disgusting (which I think I've tasted before from some organic milk from grass fed cows).<br /><br />However, if you receive these batches, please try contacting them with your concerns before jumping to conclusions. I sent them a private message on Facebook ([...]) with the codes on top of my drinks, and they quickly responded, sending me free replacement cases.<br /><br />The replacements tasted just like the formula before the change (as far as I could tell).<br /><br />They know there's a problem, and are working to resolve it. Customer service still exists in the Internet age of automation!

review/summary: Tastes like mothballs
review/text: Oh, dear God it tastes like mothballs. I really wanted to like this product and commit to it -- so I ordered a case of the creamy chocolate fudge shakes. I previously was on the Robard products, but didn't like having to go to the doctor every week so I could get the shakes (it's doctor-supervised). Robard shakes are delicious and filling, but have a lot of unhealthy ingredients and are expensive, plus not readily accessible. When I found Orgain, I thought it'd be a great alternative because it's organic. However, if you're lactose-intolerant, beware -- it contains milk. And a very strange mediciney taste. I'm stuck with a case of this stuff -- maybe if I blend it with bananas it'll be palatable. Buy a couple of the single servings, if you can find them, before committing to a large order.

review/text: Orgain is my favorite protein/meal-replacement drink! It is certified organic, which is rare among drinks of this kind. I have tried all three flavors and I think they are all pretty good. Sweet Vanilla is my personal favorite. They are a little pricey, but worth it! So much good stuff inside just one of these drinks.

review/summary: The best organic shake!
review/text: I've tried several nutrition shakes from Muscle Milk to more natural ones and Orgain is by far the best. The ingredients are the cleanest and best quality, it's USDA Organic, and it tastes great. I especially love the organic fruit and veggie blends and 16 grams of ORGANIC whey protein. I use it for breakfast, on-the-go, and after working out. My whole family has become hooked too.

review/summary: Best Mocha Protein Drink
review/text: Orgain's Iced Cafe Mocha is the best. Great taste and so perfectly light. A hint of coffee and chocolate makes this light protein drink great any time of the day. I drink one everyday, either before heading out in the morning to the aerobics class or as a healthy snack in the evening. I have been drinking the Orgain Mocha for years, purchasing them at local stores. July 2012 I ordered a 12 pack from Amazon. It was very easy to order with Amazon, and I was pleasantly surprized when the delivery date was sooner than expected.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I was ecstatic to finally find a protein drink that was healthy. A drink that was organic, had additional nutrient value, had plenty of protein, and that tasted good! A drink that did not have artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, gluten or any other added chemicals. Orgain has been very beneficial for my husband who is undergoing chemo. It was expensive for us given our medical bills but it was one of the only things he could keep down. I signed up to have 2 cases delivered a month by Amazon, thereby getting a discount for doing so. I received my shipment for two months. I then received an email from Amazon saying Orgain was not available anymore through Amazon. I subsequently received another email that stated it was available again. Great! But then I noticed no monthly discount and the price had jumped up considerably. What a huge disappointment. Orgain 5 stars...Amazon no stars.

review/summary: Drink Every Day
review/text: I've been drinking the Chocolate Orgain for breakfast every day for about 8 months now.  It's quick, tastes just like chocolate milk to me, and leaves me full until lunchtime.  I sometimes drink another in the evening after I workout.  I do find it tastes better colder - I love sticking it in freezer for 15 minutes before drinking!<br /><br />I sure hope Amazon carries this as a subscribe & save item again.  I've found it locally at Whole Foods, and their sale price makes it comparable to the subscribe & save, but I miss the convenience of having it show up by the case at my door.

review/summary: Orgain
review/text: I just had a heart bypass and my doctor recommended a diet high in protein to help build muscle mass after the surgery.  I had never tried a supplement other than a multi-vitamin.  I try to eat organic so I was told by a nurse that there was an organic protein drink on the market.  I did some research and found that ORGAIN met my requirements.  I've been drinking it for about two months now, at least one a day.  Not only do they taste good, but they have helped me gain back a lot of the muscle mass that I lost during my hospital stay (almost two weeks).  The only draw back to the product is the cost.  Most protein supplements cost a little more than half the cost of ORGAIN, but being organic I guess justified the higher cost.  I would highly recommend this product.

review/text: Since I serve lunch, there's no time or space for a sandwich. I've been looking for something I can drink for lunch, but everything I encountered included unsavory ingredients and/or had a terrible taste. Orgain is one of the more expensive protein drinks but it's worth it. I don't get tired of the creamy vanilla bean flavor and the chocolate tastes like a frothy glass of chocolate milk. It fills me up without making me sluggish and is also a great boost when you need some fuel for working out.

I don't like the vanilla.

review/text: I tried the Orgain Creamy Chocolate Fudge and was very happy with the taste.  I use these as a meal on the go and they have been great.  I always keep them refrigerated and pop one in the freezer before I drink it so it can be slightly slushy( if you leave it for too long you might end up needing to squeeze it out of the box though)...I also sometimes blend the shake with a banana, so tasty! It is a little pricey but I have yet to find something less expensive with the same quality and taste. Overall, I was happy enough with them to buy again. I might try the vanilla (because of other positive reviews) but for sure I will order some more chocolate.

Artificial sweeteners give me a headache, I do not like the way they taste and they are horrible for you. This product tastes great, has 16 grams of whey protein and many additional vitamins, minerals and antioxidants from organic sources. I usually make a whey protein smoothy post work-out with unflavored whey (without all the added chemicals), but Orgain is great if you do not have time or are just looking for a meal replacement. The only con is that it is a little on the pricey side and is hard to find in stores, but if you look at all the ingredients, I think it is worth it.

review/summary: Best tasting, most nutritious RTD out there
review/text: In order for me to get the nutrition I need, I have to supplement with protein and vitamins.  The taste of most powders mixed into water turn my stomach, so when I'm on the go, I turn to ready to drink (RTD) shakes.  On a whim, I grabbed an Orgain from the cooler at the grocery co-op near my home last weekend and was incredibly surprised at how good it tasted.<br /><br />Since then, I've purchased several more and consumed them as snacks, pre-workout fuel and post-workout recovery.  I like them so much I've signed up to have several cases delivered to my home on a monthly basis.<br /><br />I've sampled dozens of brands, and none even come close on flavor or texture, especially given how low the sugar content is.  As an added bonus, the included vitamins, minerals and fruit/vegetable complexes alleviate some of my need to take vitamins in pill form.

review/summary: Worked great for sensitive stomach
review/text: I recently tried this shake in vanilla which I purchased at my local health food store and it tastes really good chilled. The best part about it is the minimal bad ingredients and additives that make it hard for me to consume any prepackaged drinks on the market right now. I used this as a meal replacement and was very impressed on how well it sat on my very sensitive stomach. I don't care for the soy protein factor or even the whey, since it would appeal more without these ingredients. I am wondering why the doctor who formulated this would add soy into something when cancer was an issue behind the product. Maybe a reformulation is in order, at least for me to continue consuming this. Very satisfied with this product and most of the ingredients but 4 stars for the noted exceptions.

review/text: The chocolate flavor is not too sweet, relies on natural sugars, has veggies and fruit added, and a smooth texture.  Tastes great cold or room temperature.  It's well balanced with 16g protein, 13g sugars, 7g fat, 2g fiber, and 255 calories.  It makes a reasonable replacement for a small meal or larger snack.  For a while, I had several a day, but I now use them as a back up plan, which means they get stashed in my car, my office drawer, and my luggage when I travel.

review/summary: Better than any other protein/health drink I've tried
review/text: I first discovered Orgain a couple of months ago right before I had a tonsillectomy.  I went to a health food store and literally grabbed different brands and flavors of drinks to buy and test right there.  I am a picky eater and the only one I liked (and actually loved the taste of) was the chocolate fudge Orgain.  For several days after my surgery, Orgain, literally, was what I lived on.<br /><br />Once I could eat solid food, my husband and I agreed that, due to my picky taste and poor food habits, I should continue to drink Orgain.  That was fine with me as I love the taste of them.  I am now signed up with Amazon for automatic delivery and drink 1-2 a day, and my husband, who is working out and trying to build more muscle, has been drinking about 2 a day.

review/summary: Best Tasting and Healthiest Ready to Drink Meal Replacement Shake
review/text: I've been searching since the days that Kashi stopped producing their meal replacement shake mix for something that tastes just as good and is just as good for you.  I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste.  The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled.  I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too.<br /><br />Potential downsides:<br />It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that...  So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich.  The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix.  The shakes are expensive too.  The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources).  The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for.  There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term.<br /><br />I still rate this 5 stars for the ingredients, the taste, and the fairly extensive nutrition content.  I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend.

review/text: I was the biggest Orgain fan, purchasing many cases a month. They have recently changed the formula and the new taste is bad and very different.  Also, they've removed the antioxidant complex. They also added a sweetener - Stevia which I don't understand. Usually, sweeteners are added to make products taste better, not worse.

review/summary: Delicious & Easy while Pregnant or Breastfeeding!
review/text: I currently have 9 month old breast feeding twins, so protein is a huge need for me, as it was during my pregnancy.<br /><br />It can be really hard to consume the full amount of protein that pregnant ladies should have. Orgain makes this important task so much easier and yummy! I would drink one right before bed and kept one on my bedside table (yes they actually taste great at room temp) and drink it the moment I woke up. I believe that this was a huge part of me not getting morning sickness. That's not even counting the few I always had stashed in the car for when I got stuck in traffic.<br />Now that I'm breast feeding, they are just as important to my daily nutrition. Specially great when you need something fast but you are stuck in bed or have hands full of baby. I could feed me, while I fed them.<br />It is really good to know that I can do all this without consuming fake sugars that can be dangerous to my babes or lots chemicals that most commercial shakes have. This shake has a great wide array of the good stuff and little or none of the bad.<br /><br /> Amazon Subscribe & Save  gives you pretty much the best price I have ever found.<br /><br />Great Uses:<br /><br />  * Put them in coffee at home, wow!<br />  * Make them the base of a larger blender smoothie<br />  * On your bedside for late night breastfeeding refueling<br />  * On your bedside for morning sickness prevention<br />  * In you diaper bag for mommy fuel<br />  * Glove box for getting thru traffic thats makes you late for meals<br />  * Frozen as a desert!

review/summary: LOVE this stuff!
review/text: SO glad to see this on Amazon with free super saver shipping!  I tried Orgain after reading Dr. Julian Whitaker's<br />glowing recommendation. I was most pleasantly surprised at how tasty it is, especially considering all the healthful ingredients it contains.  I found it at my local health food store and continue to keep it on hand.  It is great icy cold but is also good at room temperature, making it handy to toss in a bag or purse while going out and about for those who need a snack or have to miss a meal for one reason or another.  When I need to leave the house early, I stick a straw in the container and sip it for my breakfast as I drive. My daughter-in-law who has GERD found that she tolerated Orgain well.  Love both flavors but the vanilla has the edge.

review/summary: Not as good as it was before
review/text: I have been a longstanding and enthusiastic customer of Orgain for many years, subscribing to several cases per month.  I was quite dismayed to realize that they changed the formulation.  The change in taste was immediately obvious and it was NOT for the better.  I compared the old with the new list of ingredients and there are a number of changes.  I wish they hadn't messed with a good thing.  I practically lived on Orgain before and now I can barely choke it down.  It just doesn't taste good any more.  Yuck!!  I need to find an alternative!!

review/summary: Organic Orgain
review/text: After my first drink I was hooked on Orgain creamy chocolate fudge.<br />I had been looking for an organic protein shake and came upon this brand by accident. The 10 servings of fruits and vegetables is bonus. I wish it was lactose free. Though I handle it better that pure milk.<br />It taste like regular chocolate milk and is heavenly when chilled. I find it an excellent meal replacement but I think one a day is sufficient due to it being very rich.<br />It comes in a tetra pak and it feels different than drinking from a soda can so I prefer to pour the drink into a glass.<br />Orgain is pricey $3.49 Bartells, $3.30 Amazon and $2.99 Whole foods. It is cheaper than a sandwich for lunch.<br />For a chocolate lover like me Orgain gives me my daily chocolate fix.

review/summary: The best protein drink
review/text: We've tried lots of protein drinks over the years, but this one is the best we've ever had. It tastes great and it's good for you (no fake sugars, no bad-for-you fats, lots of vitamins and minerals). In no other dimension would you catch me eating beets, but supposedly they're in this drink. I sure don't taste it if that's true! It would be nice if there were a bit more fiber, but 2g isn't horrible. The only true negative for this product is the price. They are very expensive; however, for a ready-to-drink meal, it's the easiest, most convenient and tastiest alternative we've found. The vanilla flavor is most popular in my family, but I like the chocolate one, too. Overall I don't think you can go wrong with this drink.

review/summary: Finally...a great protein drink!!
review/text: This is honestly the first protein drink I've ever had that I absolutely love!  It's rich and chocolatey, and it doesn't leave that horrible chalkiness in your mouth like nearly every other protein drink.  It tastes pretty similar to a good, rich chocolate milk.  It was recommended to me by my doctor, but I was skeptical of trying yet another protein drink that I'd waste my money on.  I bought one container at a local store to give it a try.  I'm in love!  I'm not sure what exactly Orgain has done to make this taste so great, but with organic ingredients, I'm not sure I care.  I 100% recommend this to anyone - even if you're skeptical of protein drinks.  Haven't yet tried the vanilla or mocha, but looking forward to doing so.

I take it with me to work and since I spend a lot of time in my car, it has proven to be a great way to have lunch without having to resort to fast food or other less desirable choices. Also very good before and after exercise. I will continue to reorder. The price is right. Just think about how much you spend for a cup of coffee from you know who or for a decent sandwich.

review/summary: Tastes so much better than a "health drink"
review/text: Firstly, the health benefits: It's only about 250 calories and has just about every vitamin, mineral, and other healthy thing you can stick in it, not to mention it's organic. (I also LOVE that they aren't in plastic bottles). There are a gajillion other things I could say, but really you just need to read the nutrition info for yourself. I bought these to drink for breakfast since I am rarely hungry enough to eat actual food in the mornings and I was pleasantly surprised by how GOOD they taste (Very fudgey.) I am now somewhat obsessed with these and find myself craving them when I'm not in the mood for a big meal, or when I'm sick and I don't want solid foods. They keep me full for at least 2 hours, not as much as a real meal, but plenty for breakfast. I can't seem to find these in stock at any nearby stores, which is fine since you automatically get super saver shipping on these, but beware that the price will skyrocket when they're backordered (these things are like liquid gold). I can't start my morning without these anymore and insist on dragging them with me on vacations and trips. Beware the vanilla flavor though, which I hated so much that I threw them away (no one would take them off my hands). They were lumpy and left a gross after taste. I haven't tried the mocha flavor since I'm not into coffee, but it sounds like it would be good if you are a coffee drinker! I hope they come up with some other flavors to try!

review/summary: Best Protein Shake
review/text: Amazon sent these ready to drink protein shakes which had issues, the protein had separated (or maybe curdled) I shook the container for a minute or so and was not bad, but still felt weird about it. I contacted Orgain and they said Amazon might have some warehouse storing issues, they right away replaced the product and the difference between what Orgain sent and amazon sent was the difference between a very refreshing drink and (drink is ok, why these amazing reviews). This drink really fills me up, I usually drink this in the evening with dinner (steamed veggies, fruits). Helped me reduce my weight. I highly recommend this drink to everyone, just look at the ingredients, all natural, organic & simply amazing.  Excellent Customer service from Orgain too. I wish I could give 1 star for amazon's service and 5 stars for orgain when I ordered the first time. BTW I have ordered more of these RTD shakes from amazon and this time I think they got it right! I only wish this drink would come in quart size and becomes more economical for busy people.  This product will be part of my diet for a long time, my wife loves it too!  I will try the Mocha variety next time. Again Orgain thanks for this great product.

review/summary: Fabulous Organic  Meal Replacement Drink
review/text: I am totally sold on the Orgain nutritional meal replacement drinks.  Creamy Chocolate Fudge is my very favorite but the Vanilla Bean is super also.  They are quick, delicious and very satisfying.  I drink one each day before I leave for work and it keeps me until lunch time.  I often drink another one for lunch.  You never know before you purchase something if it is going to be good but, let me tell you, you will not be disappointed with the Orgain organic meal replacements.  The taste is superior.  They are also a wonderful company to deal with if you have a problem or question.  Thank you Orgain for a wonderful product.  I'll keep drinking them!

review/summary: Best and most nutritious 'meal replacement!!!"
review/text: Hands down, this is simply the best protein/meal replacement I've ever had.  They use real fruit extracts and wholesome ingredients.  Aside from these nice points, it tastes great; like a milkshake you would make for yourself.  No nasty/gritty taste of powdered protein or chalky powder taste.  Just all goodness.  My favorite flavor is Ice Cafe Mocha, but I will happily settle for the Creamy Chocolate Fudge until I can get the other from Amazon!  I thank Orgain 3 times a day for creating this beverage!!!!

Orgain is delicious and makes a great breakfast for on-the-go people.  Also, if your children don't always want to eat breakfast, this would be perfect drink on their way to school.  It is very filling and I like knowing that it is a healthy choice.  The auto-ship is a lot cheaper than the store prices, and you get free shipping!

review/summary: Good product.
review/text: I purchased my twelve pack in the ten days leading up to Hurricane Irene. Turned out to be a great idea.  These were a stand-by during and after the storm as there was no need for electricity. Looking forward to having one thoroughly chilled.  I was astonished by the list of ingredients and the whopping protein content in the Orgain. This is a very good value when you consider the ingredients and cost in comparison to other brand-name mrps. Orgain tastes good and there is no weird after-taste or chalkiness like most mrps.  I like the packaging, too. These are a great grab 'n go.<br /><br />I also use Ultimate Life Ultimate Meal Replacement which I love, but this tastes better and requires no preparation.

review/text: I have tried lots of powders and shakes over the years usually sticking to with one for a few weeks then getting tired of it. Orgain taste so good that I never get tired of drinking it. I know you might look at the price and want to shy away at first but trust me you won't find anything that is even close in quality and taste on the market. The boxes are quick and convenient, I grab one on my way out the door in the morning and enjoy it on my drive to work. I have been drinking these for just over a year and still look forward to them in the morning. These are also great substitute to an evening bowl of ice cream.<br /><br />Thank you Orgain for developing the perfect shake!

review/summary: Great!!!
review/text: I have been getting the Orgain for a few months now on auto delivery. I like the vanilla best, but the chocolate is great too. I recently contacted Orgain directly because of an issue with the vanilla I was having. It was chunky (not normal)and I wasn't sure it was safe to drink. My husband called them for me directly to see what the problem might be. They were very nice and informed my husband they were indeed safe to drink and that sometimes the protein might separate due to temperature fluctuations but there was nothing wrong with the product. They asked for our address and said they would send a replacement out immediately even though I buy it through amazon. I really love this product. I don't like to eat a lot of meat, and I never get enough protein, and this helps me a lot. It's easy to carry with you and I take it when I travel as well.

review/summary: Tastes great, organic ingredients, high cholesterol
review/text: For those who require additional daily calories and nutrients, or those looking for a quick and delicious meal replacement in between meals, this shake is the real deal. Aside from the loads of nutrients packed into this powerhouse shake, I was amazed at how great it tasted. I kept referring back to the label to remind me how healthy this drink was because it tastes so good. Hands down the best meal replacement shake I've ever tried. And not to mention, it fills you up for at least a few hours. I loved the vanilla, but the chocolate is simply scrumptious for all you chocolate lovers. I'm ordering another case so that I'm not without any of these fabulous grab-and-go meals.<br /><br />UPDATE (08/22/12)<br /><br />Ok, so I recently had my cholesterol checked and was shocked to learn that it was a little on the high side (actually 209/200). This may not seem like a big deal to most, but I am a vegetarian who does not consume meat, or much dairy including cheese, milk, and eats a 50% raw vegan diet. Orgain is made with whey and has 20 mgs of cholesterol per serving, so if you're consuming more than one drink a day...well, you get the picture.<br /><br />I love the taste and the organic ingredients, but until the company starts making a vegan alternative with soy, rice or almond milk, I'll have to spare my arteries and heart by passing.

review/summary: Delicious taste, long lasting protein energy
review/text: I have tried, like most reviewers here, all sorts of different WMR shakes and bars. There is something really nice about the Orgain Chocolate Shakes, not only in the way that they taste but also in the way that they keep my energy up for a longer amount of time than other meal replacements. The fat content may have something to do with that, which is kind of counter-intuitive to my DIY dieting strategies, but good fats really do have excellent energy as any nutritionist will tell you. The bottom line is that these shakes really do live up to their reviews and, while they do seem expensive, products with high nutritional value usually are. By a pack and I promise you won't be disappointed! Thumbs up to Amazon for putting the Subscribe and Save program on these as well.

review/summary: Best tasting one I've tried
review/text: I have been looking for a decent-tasting meal replacement drink for MONTHS. The healthiest ones taste like liquid grass and the best tasting ones aren't at all healthy.<br />This hits somewhere in-between healthy-wise but tastes GREAT! I found it while shopping at whole foods (in L.A.) they were giving out samples and, after tasting both vanilla and chocolate, I walked away with four boxes of each.<br />I love that it's organic and doesn't use soy-based protein (my soy-allergic son can drink it too!). I love the flavor and the natural, whole grain sweetener. No chalky taste or aftertaste from splenda or any of that other fake garbage.<br /><br />Only reason it's not 5 stars--could have used a little more fruits and veggies in the blend. And at least a couple of grams more fiber. I would have liked a higher vitamin profile. But this way you COULD drink 2/day and not worry about OD'ing on Vitamin A. Lol<br /><br />Great as an after-workout protein boost with a salad or healthy, whole grain snack (multi-grain tortilla chips and hummus?)<br />;)<br /><br />So glad I found it.

PLEASE DON'T MAKE US SWITCH TO PEDIASURE! my girls are still very thin and this helped them gain weight heathily ( though they would have originally preferred chips and cookies like every other kid).<br />Please change this back, or make it better.

In fact if I had to make a comparison it taste almost identical to a really good chocolate milk.  This stuff is great, the only negative I have is its a bit low on the protein side so I usually have to eat it with a protein bar.  I am a 6'1 Male and I run about 12 miles a week though so my protein cravings are a bit higher than average!  Highly recommend it to anyone!!

I love that it is organic, and I LOVE that there are no artificial sweeteners in it. I have these on a delivery system to my home, and I'll keep it that way for a long time. Worth every penny.

review/summary: Best "diet" shake ever!
review/text: This is the best healthy shake I've ever had! Everyone in my family loves it. Creamy, sweet, chocolaty - perfect! The vanilla flavor is not as creamy but still tasty. It's a bit expensive but worth every penny. I tried other shakes (Special K, Slimfast, Musclemilk, etc.) and didn't like them.

review/summary: Organic Perfection!
review/text: Been waiting for a product like this for years!  When I finally came across it at Whole Foods, I bought it thinking that it would be foul tasting.  I'm so happy that I was wrong!<br /><br />Best ready to drink on the market, from the ingredients, to the taste to the packaging, you simply can't beat it.  I love the fact that they don't use any cheap soy protein and that its loaded with antioxidants!

review/summary: Orgain hit a grandslam
review/text: Finally, there is an actually healthy RTD shake! I would like to shake the hand of the developer for making a healthy drink for an affordable price. I've heard enough educated people warn about the other RTD drinks like muscle milk (which I used to drink for a lack of alternatives) that I figured I better find something a with higher quality ingredients even if I end up spending a little bit more. Well Orgain is very reasonably priced and isn't filled with garbage preservatives and msg derivatives. I went through 2 12 packs and am sold since the taste has remained delicious throughout (sometimes you initially like something but eventually get olfactory & taste exhaustion). IMO Orgain hit a home run with this RTD mix.<br /><br />About the only thing I wish Orgain would change is to offer a mix without the added vitamin mix. I like the veggie blend, fruit blend, and anti-oxident blend that is included, but since I already take other high-quality supplements I don't think the vitamin blend is necessary even if it is in relatively low-amounts. Plus, adding vitamin powder tends to reduce the taste quality.

review/summary: Love this product!
review/text: Orgain is a great product!  It is an organic drink full of vitamins and minerals, green tea, antioxidants, 16 grams of protein and only 255 calories!  It also tastes great.<br />I am using Orgain to help me lose weight.  It is a perfect meal replacement because the high level of protein keeps me from getting hungry.  I have tried drinks of this nature before and they had a terrible aftertaste and didn't "agree" with my system.  Not so with Orgain.  I drink the chocolate flavor and it tastes like chocolate milk to me.<br />My son uses this product as a protein drink after workout.  It works very well for him.  He actually researched the product for us and found that it was developed by a physician that had been through cancer treatments.  He wanted to develop a drink that was very healthy that he could have when he couldn't handle regular food.  Orgain was the result.<br />I would highly recommend Orgain for a dieter, a sports enthusiast, and someone on the go needing a healthy meal replacement.

review/summary: Aboslutely Deeeelish!
review/text: So I am not really a hard core athlete or anything. Just an average person trying to take better care of myself. I recently started walking 5 to 6 miles a day and reducing my caloric intake (about 1200 daily currently) as I am about 50 lbs over weight. I work with kids and have a very weird schedule, with that it sometimes difficult for me to get a good healthy meal in.<br /><br />So, I found these last week on Amazon and decided to try them. I got the creamy chocolate fudge and it's scrumptious! I threw mine in the freezer for about 10 minutes before I drank it, that's just a personal preference because I like milk products very cold. I have no complaints at all. It doesn't give you that funky after taste I've experienced with other drinks. I am happy I put this on my monthly subscribe list!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Soooooo Gooooood! (wish they weren't) ;)
review/text: Ok. I'm the kind of person who thinks the ideal diet is whole food in as close to the state it GREW from. Soooo, it doesn't help that the Orgain shakes are soooooo delicious (both vanilla and chocolate) and so NOT filled with gunky, NON-food-ISH items. It makes it ever-so-hard for me not to drink them when I don't really even HAVE to. :( Yeah, I know it isn't live nor does it meet my other parameters as stated above for the "best" diet, but when I am not able to comply, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Orgain MRD. Love 'em!
