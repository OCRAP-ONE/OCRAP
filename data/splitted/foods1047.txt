review/summary: Gets an "mediocre" from a non-coffee person
review/text: First a warning - I'm not a coffee person.  I generally don't drink coffee and I definitely don't pay $5 for a grande tall whatever the heck. Every once and a while though, I do like my coffee flavored desserts. For someone like me, you won't like this coffee.  For me all you can really taste is the Starbucks "burnt" flavor with a bit of vanilla flavoring. When I asked my friend to try this stuff, he said "Yeah, tastes like old Starbucks."  This particular Starbucks flavor comes pre-ground, which immediately starts the decay of the coffee's various oils and flavor notes. There's even a warning on the bag which recommends using the grounds within a week of opening the bag. This may not be an issue for most die-hard coffee drinkers, but for me, much of this bag will probably go to waste.<br /><br />Generally speaking, this Starbucks bagged coffee tasted like that flavor of beans at the local Starbucks that no one likes, so it's been sitting there for weeks. It's still very "coffee" in flavor, but slightly off, slightly milder, slightly weaker. While absolutely drinkable, it's not going to be like visiting a Starbucks.

review/summary: A bit too much of a dark roast for my taste
review/text: The Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee Vanilla Flavor tastes bitter to me. I believe it's because this is a darker roast than what I prefer. The first pot I made, I made like I would my normal every day coffee. It came out way too strong and way too bitter. The next pot I made I put in less coffee and it came out better, but still a little on the bitter side. I finally got so that I added 1/3 the amount of this coffee than I would my normal brand and it finally came out decent. Coffee is one of those things that is very individual to each person and their taste. What one person may not like, another might. If you like darker roasted coffee then this would be perfect for you. If you prefer a lighter roast, you may want to pass on this or do what I did and make it much weaker than you would your normal brand. The Vanilla flavor is ok, but I prefer another brand of Vanilla coffee (DD are the initials). Overall, not horrible, but not great and if given a choice between this and DD vanilla coffee I would pick DD. Again, this is just my personal preference and taste.

review/summary: Good vanilla flavor  in a a relatively mild coffee
review/text: I usually like strong , dark roast coffee and find most flavored coffees to be strong on the (often phony) flavor and weak on the coffee taste.  This coffee was better than I thought it would be, in that it had a distinct but not overpowering vanilla taste that nicely complemented coffee that was milder than most Starbuck's coffee.  I am not likely to switch to this coffee on a regular basis but do think it is good for someone who likes flavored coffees and might think that most Starbuck's blends are too strong. The vanilla flavor is pleasant and not overpowering (e.g., doesn't taste like a milkshake).

review/summary: My wife is a big fan!
review/text: I'm not a big fan of flavored coffees but my wife most definitely is. The challenge is to find flavored coffees that actually taste like coffee, rather than some bizarre chemical flavoring, so that we can both enjoy it. Starbucks Vanilla Flavored Coffee manages to walk that fine line. And my wife LOVES it.

review/summary: The Cubicle Crew has spoken!
review/text: I decided that my thoughts alone weren't sufficient to review this coffee, so I took this into my office and had my coworkers try it out.<br /><br />My Cubicle Cohorts have been known to maim anyone responsible for bad coffee, and I was prepared to either smile pleasantly and accept their thanks, or run for the fire escape and use my swivel chair as a battering ram.<br /><br />The first person who tried it had this to say:<br /><br />"I enjoyed the coffee. Starbucks is usually very strong and bitter but this was not. It was mellow, tasteful, and the right amount of vanilla. It would be a product that I would purchase and brew at home."<br /><br />That's some high praise from our regular cubicle coffee supplier!<br /><br />Another person (our cubicle tea drinker) happily offered her opinion:<br /><br />"Very tasty.  To me the aroma is better than the taste though.  Is that their travel instant coffee?  If so, I like the caramel one better even though I really do like vanilla."  *grin*<br /><br />And our official CS (Coffee Snob) had this to say:<br /><br />"It has a mild flavor.  Unlike most Starbucks coffees it does not have the bitter, highly acidic taste one comes to expect from Starbucks.  It does have a bit of a vanilla aftertaste that reminds this taster of French Vanilla ice cream...One cannot taste the strength of the roast and the coffee does not have the typical burned flavor of a Starbucks roast.  That is a refreshing departure from what I normally find with their coffees.<br /><br />The positives of this coffee are:<br />1. A subtle, pleasing aroma<br />2. A lighter flavor and taste<br />3. It is a smooth coffee<br /><br />The negatives are:<br /><br />1. The vanilla aftertaste grows stronger the more coffee that I drink<br />2. It seems to be too light of a roast for my tastes, I prefer a medium to dark roast"<br /><br />And finally, our CSIT (Coffee Snob In Training) offered these thoughts:<br /><br />"This being a Starbucks blend, the initial taste does contain the trademark bitterness of Starbucks coffee, which may turn off the less seasoned coffee drinker...unlike most other vanilla coffee brews, there is no creamy texture to accompany the hint of vanilla.<br /><br />On subsequent tastes, the vanilla flavor stays consistently subtle so as not to overpower the coffee's flavor.  When this blend is sweetened, however, the vanilla changes to a caramel flavor, which may disappoint those looking to be overcome with the subtle sweetness and aroma of Vanilla.  This blend is best enjoyed either lightly sweetened or unsweetened at all, which may leave many outside the ardent coffee drinker crowd with a bitter tasting disappointment.  True Brew lovers will no doubt appreciate a vanilla coffee that is more subtle and tastes like, well...coffee, and not a vanilla milkshake."<br /><br />As for myself?<br /><br />Well, I felt a hint of the bitters that Starbucks coffee is known for, but I was pleased to find the taste of vanilla with a hint of caramel (as previously stated). T'was a tasty coffee, and the masses appear to agree.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Natural Flavoring doesn't equal better flavoring
review/text: First, a confession. I typically don't drink flavored coffee, especially after learning that most flavored coffee is artificially flavored and usually is made with inferior beans. Still, I like most Starbucks coffee and welcomed their new take on flavored coffee. Opening up the bag, it smells wonderful and you can see small pieces of vanilla bean in with the coffee. I make my coffee fairly strong in a Braun drip pot. I found this coffee has some vanilla taste, but such an unpleasant aftertaste that I will finish the bag I have, but will not likely buy any more. I don't think they make this at their stores, so unfortunately you have to try a while bag to decide if you like it or not.

review/summary: A little disappointed
review/text: I was a little disappointed with this particular offering from the usually wonderful Starbucks line. When I first opened the package, the smell was wonderful, but not the vanilla I was expecting - more like some other spice.<br /><br />Then when I brewed this coffee, same thing...not the vanilla I was expceting. I know Starbucks is known for its French Roast coffee, but I think the darkness of that roast overpowers the vanilla. It would have been better in a medium roast blend.<br /><br />Not a bad coffee, just not what I was hoping for.

review/text: I have to say that although I'm not a big fan of Starbucks coffee since I find it too strong and sometimes having a burnt taste, I was pleasantly surprised with this vanilla flavored coffee, even though I don't normally care for a vanilla flavor in my coffee. I found both the vanilla scent and the flavor pretty natural and I would recommend it if you like flavored coffees, especially flavored with vanilla.

review/summary: This Coffee is not "My Cup of Tea"
review/text: When brewing Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored coffee, I found the smell to be tantalizing and pleasantly inviting. However, upon the very first sip, I couldn't believe how far from vanilla taste this coffee was. It did seem to have a slight vanilla flavor, but nothing like I would have expected or preferred.  There was a slight bitterness present. The taste has a lot to be desired - at least for me.  I really wanted to like this coffee, but to no avail.  Every cup just reinforced my negative feeling. When it comes to vanilla-flavored coffee, I prefer other brands to this one.

review/summary: A bit bitter but with right amount of cream, it smoothes out
review/text: Starbucks's Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavor, has a wonderful aroma while brewing. Also, I could tell it is quality because I didn't need as much to put into the coffee maker. When I put in the same measurement as I do my regular coffee, the Starbucks blend would come out too strong.<br /><br />Once I got the measurement down, it made a nice cup of coffee. The vanilla is not too strong. I got a hint of mint from it as well. It does have a bit of a bite on aftertaste but when I put the right amount of cream, it was very tasty and smooth.<br /><br />I have had as both hot and iced and while both versions were good, I actually prefer it iced which is saying something because usually I only like iced coffee from a coffee shop like Starbucks.<br /><br />I will probably look at other flavors of this brand and try them out too.

review/summary: Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee Tastes Great When Brewed With A Keurig One-Cup Coffee Maker
review/text: My parents and I enjoyed drinking Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee over the holidays.  Mom graciously made it with her antiquated percolator.  The coffee had an aromatic smell and rich flavor.  We drank it with International Delight Vanilla Latte Creamer.  I also drank it alone with Stevia, which is an all-natural sweetener used by health conscious people.  The Stevia enhances the vanilla flavor but I prefer using the creamer.  See my posted photograph.<br /><br />  I enjoy drinking coffee on cold winter mornings in order to warm and awaken me.  However, I don't want too much caffeine or I'll become jittery and agitated.  The recipe (instructions) on the bag calls for 2 Tbsp (10g) ground coffee for every 6 fl oz (180 ml) water.  My parents and I made it with 1 Tbsp ground coffee for every 6 fl oz.  The coffee still tasted great but it only had one-half the caffeine.<br /><br />  When I returned to work after the Thanksgiving holidays, I brewed the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee using my Keurig Mini Brewer, which makes individual cups of coffee.  I scooped the Starbucks Coffee into the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter.  I also used International Delight French Vanilla Creamer.  My vanilla coffee was excellent.  It tastes much better than the coffee I brew using the French Vanilla K-Cups from Van Houtte and Green Mountain Coffee.  (See my posted photograph.)  Using Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla Ground Coffee in the My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter will save me a lot of money.  I personally believe that Starbucks would profit tremendously if they manufactured K-Cups for the Keurig.<br /><br />  As an extra bonus, the empty Starbucks Coffee bag can be taken to a local Starbucks restaurant and exchanged for a free tall (12oz) brewed coffee. I actually took this to my local Starbucks.  The barista gladly accepted the bag.  I enjoyed drinking the free coffee while eating a delicious Tarragon Chicken Salad Sandwich.  The meal and atmosphere were excellent.  After eating, I drank my coffee (I even got a refill) while comfortably reading a novel.  I'll have to go back to Starbucks again.<br /><br />  I think I'm hooked on the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee.  I'm going to have to try the other flavors in this new line, which include caramel and cinnamon.  (They are all available in most grocery stores.)  However, I've been drinking vanilla flavored coffee ever since I bought my Keurig One-cup Coffee Maker.  The Starbucks Natural Fusions is highly recommended for those who own a Keurig.  I used it to make coffee for several of my coworkers and they loved it.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/text: Myself, I always find Starbucks coffee to be a bit on the bitter side (I take my coffee black, so maybe milk and sugar soften it) and this is no exception. It's a decent coffee, for all that, and if you're a fan of the Starbucks general taste, you will love this.<br /><br />My main issue is...I can't taste anything remotely resembling vanilla. Maybe the coffee overpowers it, or maybe, again, if I were the type to add milk or sugar the vanilla would pop.  Straight up, though, it's just black coffee to me, and nothing that special.

review/summary: A pleasant flavor and aroma
review/text: When Starbucks does coffee, they tend to go all-in.  They have twice the caffeine as most other brands, they really roast their beans (some may say burn?), so I would expect their foray into flavored coffees to overwhelm as well.  Except, that's not happening.  The ingredients are tame, coffee, vanilla, and sarsaparilla -- that's it!  The flavor is nice and the flavor of vanilla is subtle, not overpowering.<br /><br />The aroma, on the other hand, is quite strong.  I brought the empty bag in here to refer to while I write this review and the office now smells like vanilla.  Vanilla aroma also wanders throughout the house as each new pot of coffee is brewed. It's a pleasant scent, though.  I'll take it over the stench of air fresheners any day.<br /><br />Would I pay twice the price for this versus a competing brand?  No, but I'd pay a little more.

review/summary: It's Grown On Me
review/text: I did not like this coffee at first, because I didn't think it lived up to the smell it had in the bag. I could smell the vanilla, but somehow it didn't translate into the taste. I make my coffee the old fashioned way, with a percolator that I inherited from my grandfather. I like doing it that way, because it gives the whole house a nice coffee smell in the morning and this coffee didn't disappoint smell wise and it didn't really disappoint taste wise, it's just that it didn't quiet live up to the promise of being vanilla flavored.<br /><br />Yes there is a hint of vanilla and if I would have ordered this at Starbucks, I might not have ordered it a second time. But I had the bag and I don't like to waste, so I did make it a second time, and a third, and a fourth and so on and now it's kinda grown on me, so four stars.

review/summary: Fairly strong vanilla scent, not as much vanilla taste
review/text: I had high hopes for this coffee.  I sometimes enjoy having a flavored coffee, but I don't generally like the sweetness that comes with the syrups.<br /><br />When I brewed it, it had a very strong, natural vanilla smell, which I really liked.  It made my kitchen smell warm and inviting!<br /><br />The taste, however, is much more subtle.  Perhaps this is because the coffee is strong, and vanilla is a delicate flavor.  I found that most of the vanilla was really coming in through the aroma.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for something that tastes like coffee with syrup in it, this definitely isn't it. However, I think it would get a bit overpowering for my taste if it did, so I'm fine with that.  Just understand what you are getting.<br /><br />Sean P. Logue, 2010

review/text: I like vanilla as a flavor quite well and it complements this coffee perfectly.  The vanilla flavoring is done very well and is the best aspect to this new flavored coffee.  I like it very strong and without any additions.  You may well obliterate the vanilla by putting in cream and/or sugar.  I like very strong coffee and usually get it by making an even finer grind with the machine in the store but this comes pre-ground and not in whole bean form.  If you want this coffee even stronger, and I may, then find it in the whole bean container instead.  Otherwise, it tastes great.

review/text: I love Starbucks coffee, it's about all I drink. I usually buy the beans at Costco's and grind them myself and that might make a difference. I found this coffee to be a bit too acidic for me and I didn't really taste any vanilla (and I drink black coffee so it's not that cream and sugar hid the flavor). Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was disappointed. I would like to see if they make it in a bean I can grind fresh so I can see if that makes a difference.<br />I will say that I took some of the ground coffee to a friends and she made it and said she liked it. Maybe she was being polite, or maybe she really liked it. I wouldn't buy it ground.

review/text: Smells great... too bad it didn't taste good too. I tasted no vanilla, and the coffee itself was very bitter for a medium roast. I wouldn't buy this product myself as I like to have FLAVOR in my flavored coffee and I don't think this had any. Overall, it was a disappointment.

review/summary: Coats the back-of-the-throat like the taste of some awful medicine
review/text: I figured I would give this 11-ounce package of "Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored" a chance to prove my bias against flavored coffees was groundless. The smell of the flavoring--be it real vanilla, imitation vanilla, or something that isn't vanilla at all but smells like someone's idea of vanilla--escapes even from the sealed bag to the point I decided not to keep this coffee near the rest of my stash. After opening the bag, I involuntarily snapped my head away, fearing my olfactory system might be under siege by the sickly sweet smell.<br /><br />Next was to try this coffee, and I admit my courage faltered when I considered what an unadulterated cup of this vanilla flavored coffee might taste like in the morning as I prepared the coffee and set the timer. So I mixed in a good dose of regular coffee, probably three-fifths regular, two-fifths vanilla flavored.<br /><br />Well, first impression is that using the word "natural" to describe this flavor would be a reach until I remembered that just because something does not have an appealing smell does not mean it is not natural and that perhaps these vanilla bean received the same treatment as civet coffee. The coffee seems to burn slightly as it goes down, and tastes overly sweet even without any extra sweetener. I needed that second cup at 6:15 a.m. far more than I wanted it, and I will not be drinking this brew again except as iced coffee and even then, not without cutting it with some regular coffee to help constrain the cloying flavor that coats the back-of-the-throat like the taste of some awful medicine.

review/summary: Very surprised
review/text: Normally I do not like flavored coffee, or Starbucks' coffee. I prefer my coffee to taste like coffee, and come from just about anyplace other than Starbucks. Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee has really surprised me though. It is quite good. The vanilla flavor is very mild and natural tasting. It is not overpowering or overly sweet. As a whole, the coffee is very smooth and I really like it. I would not want to drink it everyday or replace my regular coffee with it, but I enjoyed it, and will definitely drink it in the future when I want a change. The price is not too outrageous either, which is a good change for Starbucks.

review/summary: Nice flavor & aroma
review/text: For flavored coffee drinkers, the Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla should be a hit.  This coffee has a well rounded taste, is not overly strong, and the emphasis is definitely on the vanilla taste.  I drank this several ways, including with cream and sugar, though it is fine without extra sweetener.  I also "cut" the vanilla with regular medium roast coffee and found the "hint" of vanilla that way more enjoyable than just the full on vanilla alone.  If you like flavored coffees or just want something special every now and then, try this coffee.

review/summary: Dark and muddy, smells like vanilla
review/text: This coffee is finely ground, so it has a good powdery consistency. Typically this means you'll need to use less of it for brewing. My wife and I like strong coffee, but this coffee is very strong, almost to the point that it's muddy.<br /><br />The coffee smells like vanilla, that's not an issue. However, I feel that the coffee blend overpowers the vanilla flavor. The coffee appears to be so darkly-roasted that you taste more coffee than vanilla. This coffee tastes better with milk added, which helps cut through the bitterness of the blend.<br /><br />The bag is typical packaging designed to keep the coffee fresh. Once opened, it can be folded down and sealed with an attached wire clip. The bag is imprinted with a bonus: take the empty bag to a Starbucks, and you get a free "tall" coffee.<br /><br />It's coffee, but not something I would enjoy on a regular basis. This may be a once-a-week blend for me. It's just too strong and lacks a clear vanilla balance.

review/summary: The best flavored coffee ever ... and I hate flavored coffee!
review/text: I accidentally picked up an 11-ounce bag of this coffee because I saw the words "Starbucks" and "ground coffee" and wasn't paying attention to anything else. My wife and I love Starbucks brand coffee but we HATE flavored coffees. All of the flavored coffees we've ever tasted used syrup to add flavor to the coffee beans. As a result, when I drink flavored coffee it tastes like someone poured syrup in my coffee and I hate it.<br /><br />Not so with Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee. The "natural fusions" part of the name is an indication of how Starbucks makes this flavored coffee: they mix ground vanilla beans in with the ground coffee beans! The end result is a flavored coffee that gives you a little "kick" of natural vanilla but doesn't taste like someone poured a bottle of vanilla extract into you coffee.<br /><br />My wife and I love this coffee and we think it makes a great holiday coffee. I will absolutely buy more of this.

review/summary: Reliably good flavored coffee for any occasion
review/text: With the multitude of competing coffees in California, Starbucks coffee seems to be the coffee that people love to hate.  Whatever the reason, many of my coffee drinking friends visibly cringe when I mention the brand name.  I am actually a fan of most of the Starbucks products and the Vanilla Natural Fusion (caffeinated) is a tasty addition to their product line. It is not overpowering in the vanilla department and retains a robust fresh coffee taste.<br /><br />In the interest of objectivity I must mention I am not a coffee aficionado, drinking coffee only twice a day and often using additives such as milk and sugar.  However, I care about the coffee I drink and avoid many brews that tend to be too strong, bitter or headache producing!  It does not need to be refrigerated if used within a reasonable amount of time. This brew is mild and perfect for the casual coffee drinker.

review/summary: Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla With Other Natural Flavors Flavored Ground Coffee
review/text: This coffee really has more of a vanilla scent than a vanilla taste. Adding a little vanilla flavoring to the pot gave it a more satisfying vanilla flavor. I was surprised to see that it is 100% Arabica beans as it is also a little bitter despite being a medium roast.<br /><br />Overall, a decent but not exciting cup of coffee without any chemical or artificial taste that flavored coffees sometimes have.<br /><br />Note that this product is not whole coffee beans but rather is already milled to what is called a "universal grind" which is intended for drip coffee makers.<br /><br />It seems like a long time ago that a pound of coffee was 16 oz. but I suppose that this 11 oz. "one pound" bag is appropriate company for those 64 oz. "five pound" bags of sugar and those 59 oz. "half-gallons" of orange juice that I have been seeing at the grocery store lately.<br /><br />I predict that 10 eggs will be sold as a "dozen" before long.

review/summary: If flavored coffee is your cup of tea, this might be for you
review/text: I've been drinking coffee since I was a kid, and that was back in the 1960s when coffee was coffee, an unpretentious drink whose own flavor, with the addition of cream and sugar, was enough. Now, of course, there's an endless variety of flavored and gourmet coffees for that seemingly upscale crowd for whom a cup of good old Maxwell House would be as unthinkable as wearing their grandfather's hand-me-downs.<br /><br />I'm still a Maxwell House-Folgers-Chock Ful 0' Nuts kind of guy myself, capable of enjoying a coffee from McDonald's more than I could one of Starbucks's syrupy products. Still, I like Starbucks coffee, but more as a change of pace than a habit. The same goes for "flavored" coffees which I consider as unnatural as menthol cigarettes. As flavored coffees go, however, Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, of which I received a complimentary package, is pretty good. The vanilla flavor is very apparent in both the taste and aroma, and just misses being overwhelming. I enjoyed it, but did not follow it with a second cup, choosing to switch to my usual unflavored brand for that. As previously noted, I enjoy flavored coffee as a novelty, preferring "real" coffee instead.<br /><br />So, I'm giving this product a mild recommendation. I probably won't be buying it myself in the future, but if flavored coffee is your cup of tea, this might be for you.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks

review/summary: Surprisingly good; subtle; sophisticated.
review/text: It's a total cliche and sounds incredibly elitist, but Starbucks' Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee tastes like the grown-up version of nasty flavored coffees from places like Dunkin Donuts and cheap grocery store brands. Maybe it's because I grew up in Seattle and was therefore raised on Starbucks coffee, but I do prefer the more complex flavor of their brews in general and don't find it overly strong or "burnt" as many New England natives - raised with the swell on spout at "Dunks" - do.<br /><br />Not to be too hard on Dunkin; their coffee is certainly "budget friendly"! Actually; the 11oz bags of Starbucks aren't very expensive. In fact, you can get it for the same price, which seems a bit odd to me unless the company plans to raise the price to more traditional "Starbucks prices" after getting people hooked- which seems like a bad idea.<br /><br />As for the coffee, it comes ground, which is great for most people; not if you do cold brew.  The flavor - at least for the vanilla option - was light but it was there; I found myself using one less packet of sweetener than I normally do. The scent is also not overbearing, but pleasant.<br /><br />Overall, I'd buy it. It's good, it tastes better than the competition, and it's available for (essentially) the same price.

review/text: I like the idea of flavored coffees but I can't stand the sticky, syrupy, artificial flavor of most of the ones out there.  Starbucks has come up with a very subtle, natural-tasting vanilla coffee that strikes just the right balance of flavored and rich, dark coffee.  I did not detect an unpleasant aftertaste at all, and enjoyed the change from my regular, unflavored coffee.  I don't expect to be making a switch to always drink this, but as an occasional experience, I give it a thumbs up.

review/summary: Good Coffee, Can't Taste the Vanilla
review/text: While there is no doubt that Starbucks Vanilla Fusions Brews a good cup of coffee, I wouldn't claim it's infused with Vanilla flavors. In fact, without additional vanilla creamer, I can't tell the difference between this bag and the ordinary cup of Joe. So if you're looking for the Vanilla flavor right out of the pot, this is not your bag.  But this coffee also claims to be natural and ethically grown, so it does give you something to feel a little better about, just have a little flavored creamer standing by.

review/summary: Not up to par for my tastebuds
review/text: I am one of the biggest Starbucks fans and have tried nearly every blend of coffee bean they have.  While I am not a huge fan of flavored coffees due to the nature of the artificial flavoring they add when Starbucks came out with ALL NATURAL Fusions I was intrigued.<br />I have tried all three blends they offer: cinnamon, vanilla and caramel.<br />Caramel blew me away and I loved it and the description on the bag of vanilla had me guessing it would be the same subtle syrupy sweetly decadent taste that I would like.<br />Not even close.  The vanilla did not impress me at all the while the scent of the coffee smelled heavenly and even my kids remarked on it, the flavor was off putting. The aftertaste made me grimace and I slogged my way through the first cup and offered one to my husband who did not like it either. We poured the rest of the pot out.  I took to to work and brewed a pot and two of my coworkers loved it so to each their own.<br />I would not buy this flavor again or the cinnamon but I have bought multiple bags of the caramel.  I am glad Starbucks is making natural flavored coffees and is a leader in the industry by being the first to do so.

review/summary: I liked it, but clearly tastes vary!
review/text: I am amazed reading through the reviews of this coffee...everything from strongly artificial vanilla taste to almost no vanilla taste at all.<br /><br />For my part, I almost NEVER make straight flavored coffee...I tend to mix it half and half with an unflavored coffee, just because I like the flavoring to be light. I did make one full strength pot of this and everyone in my family liked it a lot! They all drink it with cream and couple add sugar as well. Every other time I made it, I went half and half with "plain" Starbucks coffee. I didn't find the vanilla taste overpowering *or* non-existent. I thought it was great and very natural. I wonder if some people are comparing the taste of a vanilla coffee drink that actually has vanilla syrup in it, with something like this? I guess I don't know, but I don't know how else to account for such differences in perception.<br /><br />I would buy this again. I do find some vanilla tastes to be unnatural or chemical (think of the feeling you get from a cheap vanilla candle scent) but this coffee was lovely and smooth. To each his own!

review/summary: Great taste, wish it were organic and fair trade
review/text: This coffee is "100% responsibly grown, ethically traded."  Sounds good, although I'd rather them have it certified Fair Trade and organic.  But they're on the right track.<br /><br />Before I got my free bag of Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I'd been using various organic brands of espresso roast or french roast ground beans for my iced mocha every morning.  Chocolate syrup + 2 shots of espresso + milk + ice = a very tasty coffee.  And that coffee and chocolate taste was good.<br /><br />Once the vanilla natural fusions arrived, I used it in my normal iced mocha.  It tasted a little off at first.  I wasn't used to the vanilla taste.  And there IS a vanilla taste.  And smell.  It's a really pleasant, delicious vanilla, actually.  Once I got used to it, I really like the addition of the vanilla to my concoction.  That bag was quickly used up, and I went back to the half-used regular coffee bag.  I quickly decided to buy another bag of the vanilla natural fusions next time coffee was on my shopping list. :]<br /><br />And yeah, it is nice that you can bring in the empty bag for a tall brewed coffee at any Starbucks.

review/text: Just for some background, I drink coffee on a regular daily basis, mostly making my own lattes and regular brew coffee.<br /><br />I purchased this product not expecting too much as I am not a fan of pre-grounded coffee beans, but I was very much surprised by the freshness of these grounds. I have not been a big fan of "flavored" coffee since I enjoy the natural taste of coffee with only milk. I tried this out as normal brew coffee and was greatly disappointed. Instead of enhancing the flavor of the coffee, the vanilla just tasted a bit awkward to me. This left me dissatisfied. I thought, "oh what about a vanilla latte?" and decided to try out a latte with this. It was actually pretty good, a hint of vanilla and not too overwhelming.<br /><br />So my ending verdict is that it is great as a latte, but not as a regular coffee. I'm not sure if I want to buy this product again unless it is on sale, but it's definitely worth a try if you are a casual drinker of coffee.

My first thought was that the aftertaste was like a weak cough syrup. I tried making a couple of other pots, one weaker and one stronger. It didn't seem to help. The after taste was still there, but weaker on the weaker pot. I tried putting milk in the coffee and that helped some, but didn't bring out any vanilla flavor. The coffee does have a good vanilla scent. I can't recommend this coffee, which disappoints me because vanilla is one of my favorite flavors and scents.

review/summary: Understated vanilla as advertised in a smooth coffee
review/text: Flavored coffees can be fun for mixing things up or even when you create your own coffee blends by mixing and matching. The vanilla in this coffee fusion is indeed understated as advertised, and you certainly do not get the overpowering "fragrance counter" experience when you open the bag for the first time. This I like as some of the flavored coffees in the past had been so overdone. The sense of smell varies from person to person, but I did get a pleasant yet understated vanilla sensation.<br /><br />The coffee itself is nice and smooth, perhaps an after-meal or a slow weekend morning coffee, or an afternoon/evening coffee - if caffeine doesn't keep you up at night that is!<br /><br />One negative on the packaging - especially for people who like to keep their coffee in the original bags: this bag is too short when full, making it harder to seal the air out.<br /><br />One positive on the packaging that will also please the environmentally conscious: if you check the side of the bag, it says you can take the empty bag to a Starbucks store and receive a free tall coffee in return.

I've reviewed some other brands that were actually better.  I am very particular about vanilla.  Artificial vanilla is an abomination.  Genuine vanilla, just like coffee has a pretty wide range of flavors and quality levels.  This one may be natural but its not quality.  I found the vanilla in this to be aromatic but a bit underwhelming as far as flavoring.  The coffee was good but just a little bitter when consumed black.  Sugar and cream smooth it out but that pretty much defeats the point of getting a preflavored coffee as far as I'm concerned.

review/summary: Good Taste, Less Filling.
review/text: I've never bothered to buy Starbucks ground coffee before--I'm a Millstone Man when it comes to national brands. Right off the bat, the grounds are much finer than I am accustom to handling. A little bit goes a long ways; I made the mistake of spooning in my usual measure, which knocked out the sample bag in two weeks. Now, I'm one of those sinful folks who'll reuse the same grounds for a couple pots before I change out. This brand seemed to spend itself in the first go around, so I had to refill daily. The taste definetely smacks of vanilla, but it isn't particularly rich or smooth. I care about packaging, and this one was easy to open and didn't rip on me. The tabs are long enough to keep the bag sealed. In short, it does all of the basic things that a commercial bag of ground coffee should do, and no more. Keep in mind that as a Vine Reviewer, I only got one bag instead of two, so I can't comment much on the price tag. Just know that if you drink lots of coffee daily, and you like it heavy, this stuff will go fast.

review/summary: Disappointng
review/text: Mmmmmm....coffee.....love it!  Ok, I'm not a coffee master/aficionado/snob, but I know how I like my coffee: strong with cream and sugar.  Please take that into account, as your preferences may differ.  As with any coffee one is not familiar with, it takes some experimentation to figure out how to make it "just right."  That's my experience anyhow.  So, I usually brew it up a couple different ways to see how it will come out and adjust from there.<br /><br />First, I followed the instructions on the package and made a pot in a drip coffee maker.  This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.  Sadly, the taste again not so good, though not as bad as the first pot.<br /><br />In the end, I did find two brewing methods that I liked.  While I would have preferred a stronger vanilla flavor, I wasn't able to get it out of this product before I finished the package.  Perhaps some more experimenting is in order, but, for now I will stick with another brand that I already enjoy.

review/summary: Strong robust coffee without the bitterness
review/text: I have to admit, I was skeptical as I always am when it comes to flavored coffees. Flavored coffee usually does not taste good at all to me since it almost always comes at the price of having some kind of weird taste associated with the coffee flavor. This vanilla-flavored coffee has done a great job of mixing good coffee and flavoring without too much of that "weird taste" to it, however it doesn't altogether avoid it. If I were to wager a guess I'd say that there is some process that adds the flavoring and ensures it doesn't lose its potency which is the culprit for most flavored coffees having that strange taste, usually in the form of what I can only call a chemical-taste. Starbucks has minimized this, thankfully.<br /><br />I brew mine on the strong side, and usually put in more than what the package calls for because otherwise the coffee winds up on the weak side. Don't do that with this brand, or at least with this line of their brand. They are right on the money with the measurement. The first morning I brewed this it opened my eyes, but only because it was overwhelmingly strong. The next day it was much better after I toned down the amount. The brew turned out rich, strong, bold, and the vanilla flavor is very much a part of the aroma and taste. You won't need to worry about a weak pot of coffee that looks watery and tastes thin.<br /><br />The 11-ounce bag lasted about 2 weeks, with me drinking a pot brewed with 4 cups a few days a week. If you like flavored coffee, you will more than likely enjoy this and I'd say give it a shot. If you're a big coffee snob, then it's probably not for you. For the record I'm a borderline coffee snob, and although I wouldn't go out of my way to order it, I wouldn't turn down a cup if it was offered me like some of the other flavored coffees out there.

review/summary: Major Disappointment
review/text: I love vanilla flavored coffees. In fact, until I tried this one, there wasn't a vanilla flavored coffee I'd ever tried that I didn't like. But the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee was a major disappointment. I found this coffee to be very coarse tasting and bitter. Even using double the amount of creamer and sweetener I would use did not smooth down the grating roughness of this disaster. I tried to give it a fair shake and  used up half the bag before I couldn't take it anymore. I ended up having an idea and mixed the remaining half a bag with a full brick of unflavored dark roast coffee from a well known brand available at most any grocer. Finally I was left with a lightly vanilla flavored coffee that was flavorful, smoothed out to a drinkable state, and still had a good vanilla flavor. So there you have it: Alone, it's a disappointing and practically unpalatable disaster; cut it with some average run-of-the-mill coffee and it can become pleasing enough to drink.

review/text: As a flavored coffee, I would give this five stars. Since I don't really like any flavored coffees, I deducted a star. But if you have tried flavored coffees in the past, you will probably give this five stars. It was less disturbing to me than any other flavored coffee I have tried, thus the four stars. Other flavored coffees would get no more than three stars from me.

review/summary: Throw a fancy name on coffee and it's still just coffee
review/text: First off, let me say bravo for a vanilla coffee that isn't French vanilla.  For a while I thought that was the only vanilla that could be used in coffee.  Second, I prefer Starbucks over most brands simply because it has a bold, strong coffee taste.  Essentially, it tastes like coffee.  It never tastes watered down or over flavored.  The same can be said about their new Natural Fusions ground Coffee.  Now don't get me wrong, it's great coffee, but "natural fusion" doesn't seem to make the coffee taste any different or better.  I never understood how a label such as that, or organic, or all natural, is supposed to give the impression that the coffee is better than the, I guess, regular version of the product.  This is good coffee, I could care about it's marketing label.

review/summary: A pleasant brew
review/text: I normally grind my own whole beans, but I always keep a couple of bags of ground coffee around for a quick brew, or when friends stop by.  I must first caveat my review by saying that I love many of the offerings at the local Starbucks store, but I am not a huge fan of their coffee.  In the case of this Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Some vanilla-infused coffees have a harsh, chemical taste, or taste more like vanilla than coffee.  Starbucks seems to have found a good balance between vanilla and coffee flavors.  The vanilla is not overpowering, but you know it is there.  The components of vanilla come from ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root.<br /><br />I was a little taken aback by two of the items on the ingredient list.  Corn Maltodextrin?  Is it just a filler, or is it there for sweetness?  Vegetable Glycerin?<br /><br />Overall, this coffee is a notch above some of the other vanilla infused coffees out there, and I would recommend it for the occasional cup.

review/summary: Likable but not spectacular
review/text: I am married to a coffee purist who will only drink black coffee and frequently turns up her nose at even flavored coffees such as Natural Fusions Vanilla from Starbucks. I on the other hand love to adulterate my coffee with cream, and especially flavored cream. It's not that don't enjoy black coffee--I do quite a bit--but that I also enjoy the robustness of coffee mingled with more subtle flavors. The best combinations are those which allow you to taste both the coffee and the added flavor, without one overpowering the other.<br /><br />This is my first exposure to Starbucks Natural Fusions, and I wasn't sure what to expect. I decided to serve the coffee to a group of friends and see what we all thought of it (including my coffee-snob spouse!). The results were positive; everyone liked it, but certainly not rave reviews. My wife said "I like it--for a flavored coffee it's not bad." I thought it was tasty, just a hint of sweetness, and not overpowered with vanilla flavor. It did not have an oily feel like some bad flavored coffees I've run into in the past. Overall it was pleasant, tasty, and enjoyable, but perhaps not so good I'll be running out to the store to buy more. I'd give it a solid 3.5. I'll probably just go back to my usual Sumatra beans or Kona Blend, but this is a nice break from time to time.<br /><br />If you're a vanilla lover, or flavored coffee lover, I'd say it's certainly worth a try. If you're a coffee purist, you can safely skip it.

review/text: I was very happy to receive a bag of this coffee to review, but need to admit up front that I am not typically a flavored coffee drinker.  I tend to drink my coffee black and bold, so this lightly flavored, more mild coffee was a departure for me.  The scent is lovely and the flavor is refreshing, although not intensely vanilla tasting.  It has a semi sweet hint and the taste lingers a bit after drinking, but not in any objectionable way.  For those who enjoy lighter and flavored coffees, you will likely really enjoy this refreshing blend.

review/text: Used this in my Cuisinart and brewed an 8-cup pot. Also used it in a perculator. Has a nice full-bodied flavor with a even vanilla flavoring. It was very satisfying and aromatic. It is stronger than the usual coffee I brew, so I  used a little less coffee to accomodate my preferences the second time around. Still I really liked this coffee. This was like going to Stabucks and having a cup of joe without having to pay the exhorbitant coffee shop price for a Grande.

review/summary: Tastes better than it smells, but not as good as it looks!
review/text: When Starbucks says natural, that's what they mean! I was surprised to open this bag of coffee and immediately smelled vanilla extract. It was so similar I got my little container of vanilla extract out of the cupboard and compared the two. This ground coffee definitely has natural flavoring. Unfortunately, I think it's a little too natural and too strong for my preferences.<br /><br />You know when you bake and a recipe calls for maybe a teaspoon of vanilla extract? That's because it's strong stuff! I'm convinced that the same approach wasn't taken when creating this coffee--no "less is more" approach when it comes to Starbucks using natural fusions, I suppose.<br /><br />Once I got past the smell, because I was still determined to taste it, I was pleasantly surprised. The taste is a lot more subtle than the scent. It still takes like coffee, not something spiced up like chai or other unnaturally flavored coffees. It has subtle spicy taste to it along with the natural vanilla. I attribute this to the sarsaparilla root. It made for an alright cup of coffee. It would be better if I couldn't smell it.<br /><br />I finished my mug, but I think I'll be passing the rest of the pack on to someone else who wants to try it and stick with my Starbucks House Blend or Breakfast Blend.<br /><br />FYI, Ingredients: ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root

review/text: In my house, this coffee got very mixed reviews.<br /><br />My brother in law liked it.  Thumbs up.  He's a teenager and for some reason drinks his coffee black, although when my husband put cream and sugar in it, he liked it much better.<br /><br />My mother in law gave it a mixed review.  She thought it was better than most flavored coffees.  The vanilla flavor is genuine instead of artificial.<br /><br />My husband didn't like it.  His complaint with flavored coffee is that the vanilla flavor stays with you long after the coffee is gone.  He agreed that this is better vanilla flavored coffee than any other he's had, but it still wouldn't be what he'd choose.<br /><br />Personally, I discovered that I am not a Starbucks coffee person.  I love their iced coffee and drinks, but not their coffee.  I prefer a mix of Trader Joe's Columbian decaf and Joe Blend.  I did like the vanilla flavor though and if I were to choose a Starbucks coffee, it would be this one.<br /><br />The verdict:  if you like flavored coffee, you'll love Starbucks new version.  For ground coffee, it is also surprisingly fresh tasting.  If you don't like flavored coffee, then you probably still won't like this.  There is an aftertaste to it.

review/text: I'll be honest, I'm one of the few who isn't a big fan of Starbucks coffee. I think the coffee is a bit too bitter. So, I was reluctant to try this coffee.<br /><br />Having said that, I was very pleasantly surprised by the fact that this particular coffee is not at all bitter. But, that's where my excitement stopped. The coffee really didn't have much flavor. It didn't have that rich coffee taste. I also didn't taste any vanilla at all. I must admit, I'm used to freshly ground coffee, so the fact that this coffee is pre-ground may make a difference. I can't vouch for the whole bean option. However, with my experience, for the price, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Nice
review/text: If you have read my other revews you know I LOVE coffee, especially that first cup in the monring. There was a time many years ago when flavored coffee was just about all that I wanted to drink. However I found if you take a good thing too far it ruins it for you.  I actually got burnt out. Lately I have started to drink some of the flavored coffies again and I have been enjoying them.<br />I was glad to review Starbucks Natural Vanilla coffee.  When I first opened the package a very pleasant aroma traveled to my nose. Smelled good. I used my regular little coffee pot to brew the coffee.  Again, the aroma floated in the room and it was pleasant.  Now for the taste test.  I was happy to say that it was good, pure and simple. The vanilla taste to me was not too strong but just strong enough to let you know you were drinking something different and special. It was smooth tasting, rather comforting, in a way and I liked it and enjoyed the cup.<br />I don't think, at least for myself and my family, that flavored coffee is what we would want for our 'wakin up' cup each morning.  However, for a special treat, a warm feeling and a sharing experience with others this is a very good coffee to use. Starbucks does a great job in trying to give their customers choices. It's also a good value. Give it a try.

review/text: Flavored coffee has never been a hit in our household----probably one reason could be we just haven't tried many.  The last we used was something so overpowering the flavor of the coffee was lost, never tried again until now.  I must say this is nothing like our previous experience.  The coffee is what you taste with just a hint of the Vanilla and it is great!  Taste is subjective, so what I like may not be to your liking at all.  If vanilla is a flavor you enjoy then I think you would enjoy a cup of this wonderful coffee.  I first tried a cup, by filling a K-Cup holder and running it through the Keurig, had to have a second cup.  Next day made a small pot, it disappeared fast.  I enjoy a good strong cup in the morning just to get my motor running, the vanilla makes it something just a little different.  Excellent coffee with a difference!

review/text: I am not a Starbucks lover, nor fan of any particular coffee joint, I just have my morning coffee at home and that is the extent of it.  I do love vanilla though, so was looking forward to trying this.  Well, upon opening the bag I could not smell the vanilla at all, it just smelled like the the other bag of coffee I had from Costco.  Brewed it up and I still didn't really taste the vanilla and wouldn't have noticed it was any different from my regular coffee (a ground hazelnut flavored coffee from Costco).  Granted I do add a flavored creme to my coffee, and some agave nectar, so I guess I like it sweeter than bitter.<br />Overall the coffee is well worth drinking, but I am not gaga over it, and will probably stick to my other cheaper bag coffee just to save a little money.

review/text: Usually I am not a Starbucks fan.  I find their coffees to be bitter and generally too strong.  However, Natural Infusions Ground Vanilla coffee is a little smoother than most Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />The first thing you notice when you open the bag is a healthy, but not at all overpowering, vanilla aroma.  It is quite pleasant, providing you like the smell of vanilla.<br /><br />While brewing, the vanilla scent comes to life and will fill your kitchen.  The coffee itself is milder than most Starbucks offerings, but still not what I would consider smooth.  It still has that strong, almost bitter taste.  There is a definite flavor of vanilla in each sip, although it is a background flavor to the traditional Starbucks strong taste.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a decent cup of java, but still a tad too bold for my taste.  This ground seems very flavorful though; it would be nice to seem Starbucks tone down the bitterness a bit.<br /><br />But if you are a Starbucks lover and enjoy vanilla aroma and flavor, you may just love Natural Infusions!

I have been mixing it with hot water for about one week and the Vanilla flavor is still coming through strong.<br /><br />The most surprising thing, though, was how quickly the water drained when I was making it.  The grind was perfect for the Cold Toddy system.<br /><br />I will definitely buy the Starbucks Natural Fusions again.

review/summary: Not very much Vanilla flavor but still a great tasting coffee.
review/text: I've always wanted to try some of the Starbucks coffee. Since we don't have a Starbucks in the little town that I live in and what they have in the grocery store is so expensive I haven't had a chance to till now. So when it was on my Vine List to try out I jumped on it.<br />  Most of the other vanilla flavored coffee's that I've tried have had a very strong vanilla flavor to them. So I usually have to cut it 2 to 1 or � & � with some Folgers to get the level of Vanilla flavor that I like.  But this Starbucks Vanilla Coffee doesn't seem to have very much Vanilla flavor to it at all. I made the first pot of it like I usually do with the flavored coffee's and mixed it 2 to 1, 2 parts Starbucks to 1 part Folgers. I could hardly taste the Vanilla at all in that pot so the next one I made with just the Starbucks coffee. This time it had a slight and very light Vanilla flavor. It was still a very good pot of coffee but it didn't have much of a Vanilla flavor to it.<br />  So if your looking for a flavored coffee with a lot of Vanilla to it then you will be disappointed. But if your looking for one with a slight and very lite Vanilla flavor in it then you will love this one. If you have never tried a flavored coffee I would definitely suggest trying this. It has just enough Vanilla to it to say that it does and it's a great tasting coffee.

review/summary: The perfect amount of vanilla flavor
review/text: A perfect starbucks blend in this vanilla concoction: not bitter, not overwhelmingly vanilla, or too sweet.<br /><br />After sickly sweet additives and bitter coffee flavors, this blend is a nice escape from the overly processed blends I have encountered.<br /><br />The vanilla is a good flavor, not sweetener, that enriches the coffee.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Very tasty, and exactly what you'd expect from Starbucks...
review/text: I like Starbucks coffee--what's not to like?  Bold flavor, very strong, good quality coffee.  I generally stay away from flavored coffees, as I just prefer the taste of the magic bean itself.  I received this bag as part of the Vine program, and I was excited to try it.  The vanilla flavoring in this coffee is pretty subtle, and I didn't think that it changed my enjoyment of the coffee itself--rather, it was a new note to enjoy within the coffee.  Definitely not an overpowering thing, and that is all to the good as far as I am concerned.  A solid coffee, it won't ever be my absolute favorite, but I have definitely enjoyed this bag.  I may purchase this again in the future.

review/summary: A fine flavored coffee from Starbucks
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee, but I am not a big fan of Starbucks. Generally, I prefer a lighter roast that is less bitter than regular Starbucks. The description mentioned this being a milder coffee, so I was pleased to have the opportunity to try it.<br /><br />I enjoy flavored coffees, although rarely vanilla. I usually find the vanilla to be so overpowering that it masks any taste of the coffee beneath. I was pleased to note that upon opening the bag, the vanilla smell was subtle and pleasant. So far so good. Even though I normally buy whole bean, this bag is pre-ground. I brewed it in my Bunn coffee maker, which is a drip brewer. The aroma while brewing was lovely!<br /><br />I would say that this is definitely a dark roast, although it is milder than regular Starbucks. There is still a certain degree of bitterness. The vanilla flavor is perfect - just the right amount. My husband said that adding (real) cream and a little sugar make his cup a real treat.<br /><br />This coffee would thrill regular Starbucks fans who enjoy vanilla. However, it is somewhat smoother and milder than regular Starbucks, so I think you could serve it to anyone and it would be enjoyable. (Please note, despite the vanilla flavor, it is definitely strong and has a serious caffeine punch.)

review/summary: A better Starbucks coffee
review/text: I've never been a big Starbucks coffee fan, for I always felt that it was much too strong, at least for my tastes. No matter how I would try to brew it at home, it just didn't taste good to me. Even in Starbucks locations I found the coffee too strong, so I was a little hesitant about testing out this new vanilla flavored coffee. I am pleased to report, however, that I am happy that I did.<br /><br /> This new edition of Starbucks coffee has a very subtle flavoring of vanilla, not enough to overpower the taste of the coffee, unlike the jarring tastes in other companies' flavored coffees. It's light and goes well on the palate, and the best part is that it is not strong as the other products from Starbucks. That alone rates a 5 star award from me!

review/summary: good flavored dessert coffee
review/text: I'm a major coffee-fiend, meaning something of a purist, so I rarely partake of flavored coffees, preferring the natural nuances of regional varietals.<br /><br />But a flavored coffee can be a nice touch after a meal, in lieu of, or with, dessert.  I'm loath to buy specialty beans for these limited purposes, and flavored beans also leave hard-to-remove residue in grinders, even more of an issue if you use a burr grinder, like I do, which has parts that shouldn't be wet-cleaned.<br /><br />So, step back to pre-ground coffee.  Starbucks takes a lot of flack for various reasons, but they reaaly do know their coffee, and always have big, robust flavors-- exactly what a coffee fiend desires.  This flavored blend is no exception, it's dark and rich, with modest-but-noticable vanilla notes.  I brewed it in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AFX53">Krups Moka Brew</a>, for which about 1.25Tbsp per cup of water worked well for drinking it black.<br /><br />The grind is fine; much too fine for a French Press, but suitable for a drip coffee-maker with paper filters.<br /><br />This isn't a flavor I would drink every day, and I especially don't see it as a morning cup, but for after-dinner coffee, it's Recommended.

review/summary: Lightly Vanilla'ed Starbucks Coffee
review/text: The idea of vanilla-flavored coffee sounded intriguing, and since Starbucks is relatively new at this I figured I'd give this blend a whirl.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you like vanilla in your coffee, this blend is a treat.  It's typical Starbucks coffee with a very mild (not overpowering) vanilla flavor infused.  It seems to be not as artificial tasting as some varieties I've purchased at the grocery store.  The brewing aroma is lovely and the grind worked great with our flat-bottomed metal filter.  Add a little milk and a little sugar and you've got yourself a cup of coffee candy.<br /><br />This makes for a fantastic dessert coffee, but it's a very pleasant day-brightener as well!

review/summary: Quite good!  More vanilla Please?
review/text: This Starbucks vanilla flavored coffee is really good, hot with sweetener and creamer.  But, I like to drink iced coffee.  I make a pot of coffee, and put in a packet of Stevia.  I pour bits at a time over ice in a large, tall mug with a straw and a screw top.  Delicious. Not too sweet, and VERY "coffee".  This coffee is as strong as the regular Starbucks dark roast types (which I prefer).  I make mine strong so that the drink gets better as the ice melts.  But, I still prefer THIS coffee hot with creamer and sugar.<br /><br />The vanilla is there in the taste, but this coffee could use more.  Otherwise, this is a definite winner, and I will buy it when it comes to stores.<br /><br />I am thinking this is a first for Starbucks to make a FLAVORED coffee.  I would like to see a chocolate flavored one.  I had chocolate flavored coffee in French Polynesia, and it is a winner as well.

review/summary: Starts off weak, gets worse
review/text: The back of the bag tells you to use two tablespoons or coffee for every 6 ounces of water when brewing this coffee. I did that, and the vanilla taste was very weak. This is strange, because my ground floor smelled strongly of vanilla after brewing, but you would not have known that from tasting the coffee itself.<br /><br />Since I had a week to use it after opening, I made it again and again each morning. With each passing day, the coffee would taste worse. Just the other day, I made some for a road-trip to the in-laws. My wife took a sip and said "oh, that's bad," and never touched it again. Yep, there was something about this coffee that just did not jive. At all. I'm sorry Starbucks, I have nothing against you, this coffee was just a big disappointment.

I'm not a fan of the vanilla flavors, but this one is quite nice, actually! If you are like me and you like a strong cup of coffee without a bitter edge, I highly recommend this one!

review/summary: The cadillac of coffees found flavorful
review/text: There is a huge difference between coffees that have added flavor that mask an inferior blend and flavored coffees that allow the coffee bean itself to be appreciated. I enjoy flavored coffee and French vanilla is a common variety both in the coffee itself and of course in creamers. This version by Starbucks is definitely a winner. The Vanilla tastes genuine - not chemical, and even with the addition of flavor, it was still apparent that there had been no shirking in the quality of the bean. The overall effect is very smooth, whether you like your coffee strong or a slightly less robust brew.My only regret was not having some real cream to add because this blend exudes luxury.

review/text: I like my coffee, but I'm no coffee-ophile or whatever the correct term might be. I have a Keurig for daily use but dusted off out trusty old Braun drip maker for this pack. I made mine on the lighter side as that is my taste. The aroma was just really enticing. Freshed brewed coffee and vanilla-they should make a Lysol version of this stuff. But anyway, The smell was a really pleasing beginning. It looked to be a nice strong cup despite me using less- that's a good thing in my book. I let it cool for a bit because that's what I usually do. Great first sip, no bitter after taste. Larger slug, still hot, but not burning, the aroma stays with you which is also good. The arome seamed natural, not "chemically" at all like some additives can be. I would order this again if it came up in K-cups at a reasonable price.

review/text: It's been a while since I've enjoyed a flavored coffee. I'm something of a purist and honestly, most flavored coffees taste artificial and over-done to me.  But Starbuck's has come through with a very natural-tasting vanilla-flavored coffee for coffee drinkers who want a bit more without the addition of a sugary syrup.<br /><br />The scent of the coffee is a nice vanilla-coffee blend with the vanilla more understated than I'd have expected. As it brews, the scent of vanilla rounds out the coffee aroma without ever overpowering it.  And the cup is smooth and almost velvety, pretty much all you could hope for from this sort of blend.<br /><br />I'm not saying they've won me over to the flavored coffee camp, but I will say that this is a cup of coffee I can respect in spite of the addition of a flavor. If you love vanilla coffee but hate artificial flavors, give it a try.  I think you'll be pleased.

review/summary: A Good Cup!  Starbucks' Vanilla Flavored Coffee:  A Critical Review
review/text: I have NEVER liked Starbucks' coffee.  This, in spite of loving the chain.  Nantucket Nectars, the cakes and the warm atmosphere are all a plus, but the coffee has always been horrible.<br /><br />There've been two main issues I've had with Starbucks' brand: the coffee was not robust and the bitter aftertaste lasted far longer than I'd like.  Even venturing back for a cup at different locations and at different times left me wanting something more desirable.<br /><br />However, this blend of Vanilla and light-medium Acacia and Sarsaparilla beans is quite good.  There's still a slight bitter after-taste but overall it's flavorful and has a nice veneer of vanilla that doesn't dominate (i.e. that you're not drinking Vanilla Quik) and not so weak that you've forgotten that it was an ingredient.<br /><br /> Better than average, but not exceptional.<br /><br />3.5 stars

review/summary: A Fine Dessert Coffee
review/text: I love Starbucks coffees. Always have. Yet I've been reluctant to try any of their flavored coffees because I'm not a big fan of sweetened coffee and most flavored coffees require sweetening to taste good. This is certainly true of Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla, as well.<br /><br />When the package was first opened I was impressed by both the rich and sweet aroma and the beautiful dark and oily grind which was accented by flecks of ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root. I found it impossible not to put the opened bag under my nose and inhale deeply! This wonderful aroma continued throughout the brewing process.<br /><br />The flavor is quite good, medium in strength, with notes of mellow vanilla, an almost indiscernable hint of coconut, and a nutty finish. Like every flavored coffee, however, Starbucks Natural Vanilla requires some sort of sweetener to bring out its best flavors (at least for me). I tried a teaspoon of Stevia along with cream with my first cup. Meh. Added Coffee Mate Vanilla to the second cup, which was much better. But the best combination was achieved for me when I added Coffee Mate's Peppermint Mocha holiday creamer. That was the winning combination for me. This demonstrates that Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla is really a dessert coffee. And, as fate would have it, my package arrived in the mail on the day after Thanksgiving, which made each steaming cup the perfect companion to leftover slices of pecan and pumpkin pie!

review/summary: An Interesting Experiment
review/text: Starbucks is known for the very strong, almost burnt, flavor.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee</a> is something different.  On their web site, Starbucks bills it as "A blend of high-quality coffee with just the right touch of luscious, natural vanilla."  They also say "Enjoy with: A crumbly butter cookie (or two) and a pool of late-afternoon sunshine."<br /><br />How well do they pull it off?  The coffee has a very strong aroma of vanilla, a lot like freshly baked cookies.  The flavor is a mixture of the traditional Starbucks taste with an equal amount of vanilla.  For me, the two tastes do not do well when mixed together. The appeal of coffee and cookies to me, Starbucks web page ideal, is the contrast between the strong coffee and sweet cookies. How many people would like their coffee to smell and taste like cookies?  There may be some, but I cannot go for it.<br /><br />As for the claim of all-natural ingredients, corn maltodextrin is listed on the package as one of the ingredients.  The US FDA says this, "Maltodextrin ((C6H10O5)n, CAS Reg. No. 9050-36-6) is a nonsweet nutritive saccharide polymer that consists of D-glucose units linked primarily by [alpha]-1-4 bonds and that has a dextrose equivalent (D.E.) of less than 20. It is prepared as a white powder or concentrated solution by partial hydrolysis of corn starch, potato starch, or rice starch with safe and suitable acids and enzymes."  I guess it depends on what you mean by natural.

This Starbucks vanilla _did work_ for cup after cup with with a uniformly enjoyable reaction to every cup.<br /><br />The vanilla flavoring is light, more in the fragrance than the taste. It would make a good pairing with a not-too-sweet dessert, like dark chocolate or pastry.

review/summary: Good, if you like Starbucks coffee
review/text: I tested this coffee on two coffee-lovers, my wife and my sister.  My wife likes weaker, light-roast coffees and my sister likes stronger, dark-roast coffees.  We brewed one batch with a percolator and both tasted the same coffee.<br /><br />They both like the vanilla flavor -- it's subtle and not overpowering.  The vanilla aroma is good and as-expected.  However, for my wife who likes a lighter-roast, she didn't like the strong, "burnt" flavor of the coffee.  In fact, she said she finds most Starbucks coffees to be too bitter for her taste.  She had hoped that the vanilla flavoring would mask or counteract the expected bitterness, but alas it did not.<br /><br />On the other hand, my sister liked the coffee.  She likes dark-roasted coffee and already liked the Starbucks brand anyway.  So the vanilla coffee tasted good to her.<br /><br />The conclusion is that if you already like Starbucks brand coffees, then this Vanilla Flavored version is a winner.  If you have not tried Starbucks but like dark-roasted or stronger coffees, then give this one a try.  If you like lighter or weaker brews, then you might try this one with less than usual grounds per cup.  Or just look for a vanilla-flavored version of the brand you usually like.

There is no bite, and when I initially put the mug to my mouth, I could smell vanilla.  What was disappointing was that I could not TASTE the vanilla.  I took a few more sips, but every time, I could only smell the vanilla and not taste it.  My husband really likes it because he doesn't feel like he has to do the teeth-clench-swallow.  He says the vanilla taste is very subtle, so perhaps I am just missing it.  Either way, this is a very smooth blend in our Keurig.

review/text: Starbucks will not use any artificial flavors in their coffee. For this reason, they were not quick to offer flavored whole bean or ground flavored coffee products. In the shops they offer to add flavoring to already brewed coffee. I was very impressed by the ingredients of this coffee. They actually added ground vanilla beans! The flavor of the ground vanilla beans really cuts through the much stronger coffee flavor. After all, vanilla is a subtle flavor. The coffee beans used are very robust in flavor, typical of Starbucks coffee.  They also add sarsaparilla root as well. Sold at a reasonable price, I highly recommend this coffee for those who appreciate a full bodied flavored coffee.

In fact I have compared this to the Starbucks Natural Fusions vanilla flavored ground coffee and I like 8 o'clock with flavored vanilla much better.  I will not be too harsh on my rating because it is not horrible coffee - just not the best I have had.  Sorry.

This Starbucks Vanilla surprised me because it is neither, and didn't require mixing it with regular coffee to dilute the extra "flavor".  A cup of this with a little half-and-half gives a nice, creamy vanilla coffee experience with a mellow aftertaste.<br /><br />The package says these are "Latin American" beans, and the ingredients include the dreaded mysterious "Natural Flavor" (which includes "Corn Maltodextrin, Vegetable Glycerin"), and Ground Vanilla Beans and Indian Sarsaparilla Root.<br /><br />As to be expected, this product like other Starbucks coffees is, for my income level, far too expensive for regular use, but for an occasional treat, really hits the spot.

review/text: I should preface this review by noting that I am not a Starbuck's coffee drinker since I have not found it enjoyable in the past, and also that I always drink coffee black.  So, it was with hesitation that I tried the vanilla ground coffee. I did not expect much, but I also really went into it with a hopeful attitude that this time it would taste delicious.  Unfortunately, my previous experiences held up to be true once again.  The taste was bitter and sharp, not smooth and had a yucky "fake" taste.  I will say that the vanilla flavoring tasted more natural than some flavored coffees that I have tried, but it still wasn't great.  I'm really not a coffee snob and will drink just about anything else (!), so I hate to sound so negative, but this was my opinion of the product.

review/summary: Is this the same Starbucks?
review/text: I am a Starbucks junkie, gold card holder who gets either a mocha frappuchino or if it's a chilly day a simple mocha.  So I was thrilled to try a bag of their coffee at home.  Since I was in charge of the coffee maker down at Thanksgiving, I brought both this bag and a bag of decaf for the Grandmas.  I made the first pot when I arrived and was unhappy with how bitter it was, I had been expecting at least a vanilla aroma but there was no vanilla to be discerned in either the scent or taste.  Also when I looked into the bag, it the color of the grounds was far lighter than most of the coffees I make, and the grinds had what appeared to be wood chips in them (now I know that they weren't actually wood chips, but that's what they looked like.)  We drank several more pots of this coffee over the next few days as it was the only coffee that I'd brought, the volume of creamer and sweetner consumed had increased over the next several days.  It was simply too bitter, and did not have an attractive flavor.  I was very disappointed as there are very few Starbucks products that I don't care for - but this falls into that category.  It appears that I will still be brewing Dunkin Donuts coffee at home.  Currently at the price of thirteen dollars for two this is actually a good price should this coffee be to your taste.

review/summary: Very nice, but not my taste for everyday.
review/text: I'm not usually a fan of flavored coffees, but I enjoyed this one. The coffee is mild to medium in strength, and the vanilla flavor is noticeable, but not overpowering. The brew was sweet without any bitterness. The grind was not entirely uniform and some very fine grinds came through the mesh filter I use.<br /><br />The bag opened and resealed easily, but I prefer tins.<br /><br />This is a fine occasional coffee. I'm not interested in a flavored coffee are my regular. The price is reasonable. My standard coffee is Melitta Classic Blend. They are both premium coffees, but neither is gourmet.

review/summary: We're enjoying this coffee!
review/text: My husband is the main coffee drinker in my family, though I have a weakness for Vanilla coffee.  This coffee smells delicious and has a nice, smooth taste.  There is no detectable "bad" aftertaste that you sometimes get with vanilla flavoring.  The coffee is not bitter (I often find that Starbucks coffee is too bitter for me).  Nor is it too sweet.

review/summary: Not great for french press
review/text: I typically drink my coffee as a latte (microwave a little skim milk, then use a frother), so the coffee is about 1/4 froth/milk. I also use a french press.<br /><br />The grind is a little fine for the french press - small pieces end up making it through the filter.<br /><br />The taste of the coffee is fine to me. The vanilla flavor is light. I don't love the coffee, but it's...OK. Not a ringing endorsement, but eh.

review/summary: Sweet vanilla
review/text: It is winter season and when it come to choosing Starbucks coffee most will go for gimgerbread or other holiday flavors.  But this Thanksgiving season, I have tried Vanilla flavored Starbucks ground coffee and it is nice way to start one's day.  It is not too bold of a flavor and sweetness is not overwhelming.  The fact that coffee was already ground speeds up the process of making a morning drink.  The fresh taste stay long after cup is finished.  I had mine with soy milk and I really enjoyed it.

review/summary: Pleasant and Restrained
review/text: I usually drink my coffee black and unsweetened without flavorings but thought giving the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> a try would be a nice change of pace.  I was right.<br /><br />I found the vanilla to be medium-mild in strength with the aroma playing as much a part of the experience as the actual flavorings.  The vanilla was not overly pronounced or artificial but it was also not what I would consider subtle.  The flavor is there, it's persistent, and there's no mistaking that this is vanilla with a capital V without it being cloying.<br /><br />Would I purchase this in the future? Maybe on a whim but as I mentioned before, I like my coffee to taste like coffee.  Would I drink it if it was offered to me at someone's house?  Sure, it's not bad and it certainly beats those bottled flavorings or creamers with the chemical aftertaste.<br /><br />For those who enjoy flavored coffee this is a nice choice.  The coffee is full flavored and robust with a nice controlled infusion of vanilla flavor and aroma.

review/summary: OK, but I prefer dark, bold roasts
review/text: I took a chance on this coffee, and I do like the way it smells and infuses the air with scent. However, I much prefer a dark (VERY DARK) roast. I usually drink Starbux French Roast, Sumatra or Italian Roast, which are Bold or X-Bold coffees. This arabica flavored coffee just didn't cut it for me. It's a LIGHT roast, and too mild & too light for my taste.

review/summary: Smooth, with a hint of vanilla.
review/text: I traditionally drink my coffee with a little vanilla creamer. I usually brew a cup of Starbucks, house blend coffee, at home every morning and indulge from time to time in a white chocolate vanilla latte from Starbucks. (I know what some of you are thinking, that's not real coffee but hot chocolate.). Regardless, I usually don't like strong coffees and manipulate the directions to accommodate my tastes. When I selected this coffee, I hoped that it would be something that I would enjoy and I was not disappointed. Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla flavored was pleasing (remember, I used less coffee than the directions required) and not overwhelming. The way I prepared it, it had a rich (yet mild) flavor. It is a bit milder than most Starbucks coffee that I have purchased in the past, and not as acidic. It made for a decent cup of coffee.<br /><br />Scale: 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.<br />Packaging - 5 (You are able to secure the product once opened. Adhesive tape closes nicely insuring that the product remains fresh).<br />Flavor - 4 (It has a rich, mild taste and isn't acidic. I rate it a 4 because if I follow the directions on the package, the taste would be a little overwhelming.)<br />Cost - 5 (In the store where I shop, Starbucks coffee costs close to $9 for a package, unless you get it on sale...so the Amazon cost seems reasonable. Especially if you consider you are getting 2 packages for a little over the cost of 1. And it's cheaper if you spend between $3 and $4 for a cup of coffee in Starbucks, while buying a bag gets you at least 30.)<br />Smell - 4 (When you open the package, you can smell the faint smell of Vanilla and even see some vanilla beans in the grounds. While brewing you do get the faint aroma of vanilla.)<br /><br />The only thing that I am not sure of was my use of vanilla creamer. While I really enjoy the taste of my regular house/breakfast blend with a splash of vanilla creamer (I don't have to add sugar), it seemed that my normal splash of vanilla creamer did not complement the vanilla already in the coffee. I think it is better with a regular half & half, than a flavored creamer. Otherwise, I think this coffee is a wonderful alternative to regular coffee.

review/summary: Where's the vanilla?
review/text: I love Starbucks coffee.  I stop twice a week on my way to work for an espresso or just a cup of coffee, and I have Starbucks Via instant coffee at work for the other days.  I do like the occasional flavored coffee as well, and, when in season, get the Starbucks gingerbread or egg nog lattes, or have the Starbucks Via Cinnamon instant coffee.  So it was that I had high hopes for Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee.  The coffee had a strong, lovely vanilla aroma upon opening the bag of ground coffee.  I quickly prepared myself a cup and sat down with much anticipation at enjoying some wonderful coffee.  Well... it's coffee.  I guess that's about all I can say about it.  The actual coffee part of the 'taste experience' seemed humdrum.  Starbucks is known for robust coffees, but this was lackluster at best.  And while the vanilla scent was strong upon opening the package, the vanilla flavor is all but dissipated upon brewing.  There is a hint of vanilla flavor upon drinking, but it's not enough in my opinion.  I can smell it more than I can taste it by quite a bit.<br /><br />Perhaps some of the 'infusion' was lost due to the coffee being already ground when bagged, which I've heard causes the coffee to lose some of its flavor very quickly, but can't state that for a fact since I buy only whole beans and grind them myself (this product wasn't available in whole bean to try).  Overall, I was disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone who likes some body and rich flavor to their coffee or likes a distinctly flavored coffee, and I won't be buying it in future.

review/text: This Starbucks coffee has a delicious vanilla fragrance, although the taste of the vanilla does not come through when you actually drink it.  The coffee has a smooth taste.

review/summary: Vanilla Brew
review/text: There is no question about the fact that I absolutely love a rich and full-body flavored cup of coffee. The aroma can always get to me through a single whiff for me to enjoy. But when it does come to the best, you really expect to the best company to have the best flavor. That does come mostly well with Starbucks, and their brand of Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee. The taste does fell delightful, but honestly I was hoping from the smell that there could've been a lot more vanilla flavored into the coffee, making more savory cup deliver the best vanilla you could ask for. While it isn't a bad cup from Starbucks at all, I have definitely tasted better from brands like Melitta and Folgers. Still, I wish I could've gotten more Starbucks than my money had shown for it.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Taste: B-<br /><br />Overall: C+
