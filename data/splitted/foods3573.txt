review/text: Size of the bars are the same you would buy at a typical retail checkout line.  Ordered these late April, 2011; expiration in November, 2011... probably a little too close to buy again in the future.  Or maybe we DO eat them that fast?  The price is about 50 cents a bar vs the local store in our area is about $1/bar.  Nice price.  Free Shipping.  Can't ask for more.

review/text: This has been of my favorite mild herbal teas and it appears Lipton, sadly, has discontinued it.  But I'm amazed at the comments of this being a good price.  One would think a discontinued tea would be the same or less than the past store price but this is much higher.  So torn - to buy and feel ripped off or try to find another tea to replace it :-(

review/text: This is my mother-in-law's favorite tea.  The problem was finding it in the stores.  She tried all last year looking but could not find this tea.  So I looked on-line.  It's a pack of six but I don't think it will be a problem for her to use them up this winter. Plus the price was excellent for six!<br />I usually buy health food store tea but for lipton brand this herbal tea taste really good and it uses several different herbs in it. Great for the cold and flu season.

review/text: Lipton Herbal honey lemon hot tea has been a favorite of mine for years. It's caffeine free, which is an added bonus. So you get all the taste and none of the hype, which is what I'm going for, since I like to have a steaming cup of this tea to relax in the evenings...no matter how good or bad the day was, when you sit back with a cup of this tea, it's a great way to end the day and slough off the stress...I highly recommend to those who like their tea hot and spiked with a lil honey and lemon.

review/summary: A most excellent summertime brew - try it iced!
review/text: Lipton's Honey-Lemon herbal tea is another winner. This has to be one of our favorite summertime brews for ice tea. The lemon backbone is nicely mellowed out by the honey flavors. Take 3 or 4 bags and place them in a pitcher, add sugar and water, stir, and put that bad boy in your 'fridge or out on the porch for some sun tea. It'll really cool you off on a hot day, and with record-breaking temperatures here in Central Texas, that's a blessing.

review/text: I remember nostalgically the creamy taste of those little squares of chocolate called "Ice Cubes".  This why I was delighted, almost overcome, to find they were still being made, and even better, sold on Amazon.com.<br /><br />The order was placed for holiday stockings and arrived in plenty of time.  According to my family, I wasted my time filling the stockings with anything else -- they wanted stockings filled to the brim with Ice Cubes.<br /><br />If you like a creamy chocolate, that literally melts in your mouth, tasting much like a truffle, this is your candy.  I'm a chocoholic and proud of it.  I may make a banner and put this image on it.  Vive le Ice Cubes!

review/text: I lived across the street from a small, family-owned grocery store and they used to have these Ice Cubes chocolate squares for individual sale on the counter for maybe 10 or 15 cents each. I loved them and the unique hazelnut flavor was better than any other chocolate. (Sometimes I feel that Dove Chocolate sometimes tastes like these now.)<br />It scares me to order food products, especially meltable chocolate, on-line/through the mail so I was wondering if anyone has ever seen these carried in candy stores in Illinois or Northwest Indiana anywhere? If you do see them, please let me know.<br />Thanks for your responses. :)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001684NTE">Ice Cubes, Chocolate - 82 Unit Pack</a>

I noticed during chemo it did help keep my energy level close to normal. I also used it during my six weeks of radiation and was able to function near a normal level. Now that I am "back to normal" it is definitely something I miss when I run out and don't order it! When I am using it consistently, I wake up without an alarm, I feel clear headed AND I don't crave carbs and sweets! This may not work the same for everyone, but no one will ever convince me that I would be better off without it!

review/summary: Works great with Scoop-Free system
review/text: I will preface this review by saying that I've only been using the litter for a couple of days. That said, I completely agree with the review by "Mani Arabi'. If you're used to crystal litter, then you already know how it works (it absorbs the urine and the liquid in the poo, and therefore eliminates odor, and there's no clumping), and this is a very good version of the crystal litter because the particles are so fine. I have a scoop-free auto litter box, and have been using the 'forever' tray, but the crystals that you i used to buy to use with it were really big, and they would bunch up behind the rake. Also, because they are so hard, my cat would like leap out of the box to avoid stepping on them, and they would get everywhere. Both of those problems are eliminated with this litter -- it's so fine that the rake easily passes through, and so far the cat doesn't seem to track any of it. it costs a bit more than other crystal litters, but in this case you really do get what you pay for, and i think it's worth the few extra dollars to not have to vacuum/sweep next to the box constantly. (also, you can do the subscribe&save thing to save 15%, and they let you cancel at any time, including immediately after placing a single order. you won't get the 2-day shipping though, even with prime.)<br /><br />as for the reviewer who complained that eventually the litter got soaked and started smelling -- all crystal litter does that. some cats pee more than others (lord knows mine does), and they will 'fill up' faster. it's really not a defect of this particular crystal litter, it's just how crystal litter works.

review/summary: No smell, no mess, no cleaning up, and NO LITTER DRAGGED INTO THE HOUSE
review/text: I have used "crystal" type litter for several years now and they are absolutely fantastic. There is absolutely no smell or dealing with urine clumps and whatnot. In my experience, all crystal litter has performed in this manner.<br /><br />I used to use PETCO brand crystal litter. This is a great litter but the rocks are big and often got stuck between my cats paws and would be dragged into the room (or at the very least all around the outside of his litter box). These Micro-Crystals are far superior to the petco litter at the same price point.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Very fine litter, does not get stuck in my cats paws or spread anywhere (In fact, I have not seen ANY of it spill outside his box yet and I have been using it for roughly 3 weeks)<br />-NO smell<br />-Once a month; just scoop the poop don't worry about the urine at all until you swap the whole thing out.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Dusty when the cat uses it or when changing it out (due to how fine the crystals are)<br />**This is a minor problem because I keep my litter box next to my toilet (easily scoop the poop) so if I go into the bathroom right after my cat, it is a little dusty. It settles very fast though (a minute or so is plenty to wait)<br /><br />Overall, I definitely would recommend these as the #1 type of cat litter I have ever used. I have had cats for over 20 years and am exclusively switching to these. The ONLY issue I have seen with them is the dust that is kicked up after my cat uses the box, but this settles so quickly it is not an issue.

review/summary: Would not recommend.
review/text: This was the first of the two litter pearl products I tried.  It sounded great.  It cost a little more, but the whole concept seemed wonderful.  I scooped it out every day and thought it was great until I hit day 22.  Then the crystals soaked up the urine, turned yellow, stayed wet, and then became very malodorous.  I had to change the whole thing out at 4 weeks, which kind of changes the long lasting, no odor idea and GREATLY increases the cost.  Maybe my kitten (who loves his litter box) is different and I am never going to find kitty litter that works.  I can't believe he continued to use this when I couldn't even stand to be within 10 yards of the box because of the smell.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.

review/summary: Just like the picture
review/text: I am not a great chef, but I can follow directions.  I have gotten good results from my bread machine with plain white bread (on the basic setting with light crust), but I wanted something more interesting.  When I saw the reviews for the Prepared Pantry breads, I ordered several, including this english muffin bread mix.  When the directions said "use a thermometer", I listened.  I used a meat thermometer (which worked just fine) and made sure the water was within a few degrees of 80.  The bread came out perfectly (again on the basic setting with the light crust).  When I went back to write this review, I looked at the picture posted with this mix, and my bread came out exactly the same (after being sliced and toasted for about four minutes).  I am very satisfied with this product, and am looking forward to testing the other mixes I bought, including Black Russian and two different cinnamon breads.  I would definitely recommend this bread!

review/text: These noodles have a great, chewy pasta texture. They are thicker than the "Thai sticks" more commonly available, and are so much more satisfying for any dish that uses noodles. You cook them like Italian pasta, instead of just soaking like Thai noodles. I originally bought them at Publix in Florida, and have been searching grocery stores all over the U.S. ever since they stopped carrying them - my husband considers anything else a poor substitute.

review/text: This is hands-down the best drinking chocolate mix ever! There is dairy in this product, so be careful if you're allergic or intolerant to dairy. I use the powder to make both hot and frozen drinks; it mixes beautifully (even with just water) and fully dissolves in hot chocolate, which is made even better with some amaretto.<br /><br />Since I don't live near any CBTL stores, I've discovered that purchasing the Special Dutch cocoa powder here on amazon is cheaper than buying it directly from CBTL. I do wish they would package the powder more sustainably. I use the powder daily and, even though I recycle the aluminum canisters, I feel guilty about recycling another tin every ten days. I have reused them for organizers, too.

review/summary: My Favorite Hot Chocolate
review/text: I love The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's Special Dutch Chocolate Powder. I've tried many hot chocolate drinks, and this special Dutch chocolate powder is one of the best. It's flavorful, smooth, and doesn't leave much residue in my mug after I'm done with the hot chocolate. The 22 oz. container is the perfect size to serve your whole family, and it lasts for a while. And you can use the nice container for other stuff after the chocolate powder is gone. This Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Dutch Chocolate Powder mix is multi-functional as well. On the container, there are recipes for not only Hot Chocolate but also Cafe Mocha and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's Original Ice Blended Coffee drink. The chocolate powder contains 15% calcium, 4% vitamin C, 2% iron, and five grams of protein per serving size. Since there are no Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf stores near where I live, it's great to order Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf products online through Amazon or The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's website. I also highly recommend The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's Vanilla Caramel flavored coffee, Raspberry Cream flavored coffee, Limited Edition Blueberry Streusel flavored coffee, Blueberry Peach Green Tea, Spring Peach Oolong, and Lemon Chamomile. Anyways, I give a big thumbs up to the Dutch Chocolate Powder mix!

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: Up until recently I have had 4 dogs. Sadly, one passed away from old age this past July. Anyway, all four of my dogs love these Iams biscuits. My finickiest dog never turns them down although she has turned down other brands of biscuits. The only thing that puzzles me is that the biscuits are now thinner than they used to be. They must still taste the same since my dogs still gobble them up. I had brought up this inconsistency to an Iams rep at a dog show about a year ago. His only answer was that they had 2 manufacturing companies and one must be making them thinner than the other company. I would think that their standards on this would be fairly strict so that the 2 companies would be manufacturing identical products, but apparently not. Oh well, it's not really a problem as long as my dogs remain elated with them, and since they are sold by weight there's nothing sneaky going on as far as I can tell. I love that I can order a pack of 6 on Amazon.com. Many times the stores do not have that many, so the 6-pack is really convenient since my dogs go through these pretty quickly.

review/summary: Dogs love them, a lot of treats!
review/text: I have 2 dogs, one is a small chihuahua and one is an older sheltie. The small dog eats these things like crazy, loves them. The older dog has few teeth left (she was abused and we rescued her). A lot of treats we buy are to hard for her to eat but these are the right texture and hardness. She can chew them up and she loves them as well. Perfect for giving to the dogs after they use the bathroom.<br /><br />The value is great. I didn't really think about how many boxes 6 of these were but the deal is that much better when you actually see how many treats you have. It's an amazing amount and I'm set with treats for a few months at least!<br /><br />Great deal, I will be placing a new order when I start running low.... But that will be a long time!!<br /><br />I uploaded a picture so you can see how much the little dog loves these thing!

review/summary: Healthy Treats
review/text: I have been giving my dog these treats since she has been a puppy.  She loves them and were great rewards for her training.  Best of all, they have kept her teeth and gums clean and free of plaque.  I recommend them to all dog owners.  Buying them from Amazon on a recurring basis has been a lifesaver.  These treats do not last long on store shelves so finding them locally has been difficult.  Thanks Amazon for solving my source problem!

review/summary: Great Way to Buy a Great Product: Subscribe Today!
review/text: I live in an isolated town, and you cannot purchase Iams dog biscuits within a four hour radius.  Unfortunately, Iams small biscuits are all my parents' spoiled dogs will eat for a snack.  Like another reviewer's dog, these dogs will not eat large biscuits, even though one is a Great Dane and the other is a lab mix.<br /><br />When I found the monthly subscription on Amazon and found they were slightly cheaper than in the stores (where I can no longer buy them; thank you, over-sized "super" stores that carry fewer and fewer products since you feel the consumer is at your mercy), I immediately ordered them.  They arrived a week later with free shipping.<br /><br />The packaging was neat and tight; very few biscuits were broken in the opened box.  They were also very fresh.  The expiration date was June 15, 2012.  Traditionally, the ones I've purchased in stores were only good for six months or less.  I subscribed for two six packs a month, and it's very satisfying to know I don't have to worry about my mother haranguing me to drive to Mississippi to pick up dog biscuits.  They come to the PO box once a month: No fuss, no muss, no bother.  And the dogs are infinitely happier. :)

review/summary: THE MOST AWESOME HONEY EVER
review/text: We love it!! It is sooo delicious - but even better - it's healing properties are like oral tea tree oil - how cool is that!! Altho we consider it one of the most important medicinal things we can take each day - actually 1/2 to 1 tsp in the morning & at night to not only keep us healthy but also protected from all the "bugs" going around..inside & out - amazing when used under a band-aid!! I like to just hold it in my mouth and swish it around-even gargle a little before swallowing- not only to savor the flavor but again for it to work it's anti-germ/viral magic on mucous membranes - also gets absorbed faster that way, too...A friend of mine mixes this very unique honey with Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar (it's organic, unpasturized, unfiltered with the mother)as part of her ultimate health strategy!!) Thank you Airborne, Amazon, & the person I purchased it from - I will be a repeat customer as long as it's available!! I think it would make an excellent & unique Christmas gift!!

review/summary: Manuka Honey
review/text: I ordered Manuka Honey from Amazon because I had recently read a small article on important ways to become a healthier person. Manuka Honey was mentioned as a medical use to effectively treat the symptoms and health conditions such as Athlete's Foot, Ring Worm, Insect Bites, Arthritis, Acne, Eczema/Dermatitis, Sore Throat, Rashes, Wrinkles, Wounds, Burns, Nail Fungus, Aches & Pains, Blisters, Stomach Ulcers, Skin Ulcers, Gum Disease, Acid Reflux, Cold Sores, Infections, Psoriasis, Surgical Wounds, and MRSA/Staph infections. Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells. Manuka Honey is a natural substitute for NutraSweet, Equal, and Aspartame. My review is that it is thicker than the common clover honey and that it has a milder sweet taste with a hint of a smokey molasses flavor. On the jar, it states that it can be used for sauces and marinades for savory dishes. Manuka Honey is worth a try. I ordered it & it took about 8 days for the honey to be delivered to my door. Four stars.

review/summary: A cello in comparison to the violin of orange blossom honey
review/text: Manuka has a strong, deep, rich flavor, suggesting essences of fig, tannin, and molasses. This is honey to be savored. Try a bit atop an excellent stilton for a symphony of tastes. Because of its intensity, children might not like it (give them ordinary supermarket clover honey and keep this for yourself!)<br /><br />A teaspoonful of manuka will assert itself in the strongest of assam teas. The same spoonful will make one's morning oatmeal a culinary experience.<br /><br />As for the medical claims, honey in general and manuka in particular have been touted for antibacterial qualities. To me, because I like strong flavors, manuka makes a wonderful sore throat soother. A professional singer that I know uses a spoonful before every performance as a preventive.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive (although I suppose those fortunate enough to live in New Zealand pay far less), but it is as worthwhile as a fine French Burgundy, fresh Chincoteague oysters, aged prime filet, and king salmon are for gourmets. I certainly hope the bees of New Zealand are not affected by the viruses and parasites that are killing off their North American counterparts.

review/summary: Culinary and Holistic delight.
review/text: I'm a believer. I just used my first tablespoon to coat my stomach after overdoing it with the coconut oil. It settled my stomach. I have also been fighting an allergy induced sore throat for the past two days. My throat feels notably better. I like the taste. It tastes a bit like caramel apple. It is softer and thicker than traditional honey.  Smooth taste, I cannot wait to include this with my steel cut oats. I'm curious to see how it dissolves into tea as it is a bit thicker, but I made a nice honey glaze for my veggies with it and it was a definitely delight! It is good stuff. I would advise you to try local if you have a Central Market, Whole Foods, H.E.B., or other grocer that carries exotic brands. I only paid just under twelve bucks for the same size, same product. Amazon is great about price matching though, so for my next purchase I will find out if they will honor this price as here it comes from an Amazon marketplace seller. This is a superior product.

review/text: Airborne honeys are outstanding. I am posting the review just to inform potential customers that there is another online souce for these honeys at New Zealand Natural Goods [...]. Their prices are so much better than Nature Healthy Life's I felt obliged to share the information. For example, the New Zealand Manuka Honey sold here has a picture of a jar of Airborne Honey's Manuka with Wildflower, a different product. The price listed above is $44.95. The price at New Zealand Natural Goods is $16.99 for Manuka Honey 500g. ParthenonFoods.com has Airborne Foods Manuka with Wildflower Honey for $14.99 (500g).<br />Nature Healthy Life's price for 500g of Airborne Honey's New Zealand Beech Forest Honeydew Honey is $19.99. The identical product at New Zealand Natural Goods is $7.95.<br /><br />As you can see, Nature Healthy Life's prices are very much out of line for Airborne Honey products.

Honestly, if you have irritated, oily skin the last thing you need is to put honey on it. I was a gross, sticky, sweaty mess.

review/summary: BEWARE These are 2nds!
review/text: The candy I ordered from Amazon was for distribution to the neighborhood children this past Halloween.  The first disappointment was that it wasn't even shipped until the week after Halloween.  It was ordered with sufficient time to arrive before the holiday.<br /><br />The more important concern became evident when it arrived.  This candy is 2nd's from the manufacturing line.  It is candy that was not wrapped properly.  This varies from the wrapper not quite being sealed to only � a wrapper to begin with or completely out of the wrapper because at least one end was open.<br /><br />At least 25% of all the candy received was out of the wrappers.  Another 50% was not sealed on at least one end.  This would have made it inappropriate to distribute.  I would have had to sort each bag for the few pieces I could have given to the children.<br /><br />The good news is that if you're purchasing for your own families consumption the candy is fresh.  There are no quality problems with the chocolate.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I had this the first time at our local Greek restruant and this is the only iced tea they serve. First sip I was taken back as I was expecting regular green tea, but was amazed at how unique this tea tasted. It has a slight natural sweetness to it, and at first I could not quite pin what the flavor was. After asking one of the employees they told me where they get their tea and I ordered it directly from the retailer. I would have never thought there was Jasmine in this tea, especially since I do not like most teas with Jasmine in it, and once finally figuring out it was pineapple it all made sense. This tea is wroth giving a try and comes in a nice large pouch that works perfectly with my Mr. Coffee tea maker. They say it makes two quarts per tea pouch, but I can make three by setting my tea maker to strong. Figuring you get 6 pouches that make 2 to 3 quarts each, the price is not bad at all. Its worth trying, or if you live locally to Brea, CA head over to The Olive Pit and give it a try yourself. My family can't get enough of this and I can't keep the pitcher filled come summer time. Kind of crazy, all this over tea.
