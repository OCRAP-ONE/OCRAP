review/summary: Great deal on best GF pretzels I've found!
review/text: I fell in love with Glutino stick pretzels when I started a gluten-free diet six months ago. I actually think they taste better than the regular pretzels I used to eat! The only downside was the price -- the local store charged $8.99 per 14 ounce bag. When I checked on Amazon, I was pleased to find they carry Glutino pretzels. Interestingly, the 8 ounce bags turn out to be a better price per ounce than the 14 ounce ones, so that's what I ordered. With the subscribe and save deal, the 8-ounce bags came out at just over $3 apiece. If you or your gluten-free child loves pretzels for a snack, and you have the space to store a dozen bags, this is an awesome deal! I have a handful of friends who also are gluten-free, so I've shared some of my order with them. These are amazingly good pretzels and Amazon's subscribe and save price is the best you're going to find anywhere!!

review/text: Of all of the gluten free pretzels I have tried, these by far are the best.  They are close to the real thing as I recall.  Sometimes they are difficult to obtain.  Stores do not stock them since they are a bit pricey but well worth it for those of us who are gluten-intolerant.  These are a must for me.

review/summary: Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE
review/text: I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch.  They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.  Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward.  Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night.  Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.  The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose.  You will find they are synonyms if you Google them.  All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.  If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with "side effects" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea.  Never again.  All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned!

review/text: As far as the product goes - these are excellent.  Can't even tell they're gluten free.  Nice and crispy and good flavor.  Usually they're packed well but the boxed was partially crushed on this last shipment and half the pretzels were broken. They had slapped a shipping label right over the "fragile" that was printed on the box.  Not good thinking.

review/summary: Awesome snack choice for Celiacs
review/text: I bought these pretzels for my dad, who suffers from Celiac disease and Type 1 diabetes. He has a hard time keeping any weight on due his restricted diet, and often resorts to potato chips for his sole source of carbs between meals. He absolutely loves these pretzels, and said he enjoys them more than the regular kinds. I think they taste excellent, with that very slight "burnt" flavor that makes pretzels so good. They also seem to have a delicious buttery aftertaste IMO. Plus, they're very satisfying and healthier than potato chips.

review/text: I love these pretzels.  They are just hard to find.  I think pretzels have too much salt on them and I am always trying to scratch off the salt with my finger nails or a knife or something.  Even if I wasn't trying to watch my salt intake I try to take the salt off because they just put too much salt on pretzels.  These pretzels are really very good tasting.  I was afraid because they are gluten free they wouldn't taste very good because a lot of the gluten free products you sacrifice taste.  But not with these.  These are very close to regular pretzels and I am so glad they come in salt free.  I buy them by the case.

review/summary: Glutino Gluten Free Pretzels
review/text: If you Celiac or just perfer gluton-free, these pretzels are a good substitution for both other pretzels and other types of snacks. Despite what O'Reilly used as a tip at the end of his show, gluten-free usually mean more "carbs" for a similar serving.<br /> But as a Celiac, varity is truly the spice of life. Celiacs first response to diagnosis is to see all the walls between them and what used to be their favorite foods. Celiacs in this day and age are so much luckier than previous generations. Firstly, because Doctors are running the proper blood tests to diagnosis gluten-intolerance much more frequently. It might appear as if more folks are stricken with this these days, but I am convinced that is just because of this increased knowlegde by the Doctors.<br /> As to these pretzels. They may or may not strike you as better than your previous favorite, but you now understand that the previous favorite were the cause of "palor", malnutrision and gastro issues. So you must resign yourself to exploring the every expanding gluten-free offerings.<br /> These are not your Philly soft pretzels, but they make a great salty and crunchy "chip" with which to scoop up some hummus, peanutbutter, etc.<br /> Also, this size bag and the Amazon price for a box of these every month or two is one of the most affordable ways to enjoy these healthful snacks. They also good straight from the bag, but it easy to get carried away.<br /> My wife and I found out about my Celiac 5 years ago. It makes you read everylabel on every product you bring into your house. You may even go as far a throwing out all porous (i.e. wooden) utensils, your old toaster and several other things and can't be guaranteed sanitazied.<br /> You learn to trust mostly the food you make yourself, but when you learn that you can trust Glutino, and you can, subscribe to Amazon for regularly scheduled deliveries of all types of life giving goodies like the Pamela's Pancake Mix which go great with chopped, toasted walnuts, blueberries and a couple of raisins although, most maple, agava and other syrups are still safe.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8HY">Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists, 14.1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

We finally found Glutino a few years ago and then began the quest of buying them at a reasonable price. Amazon S&S is the perfect place to find them at a good price per bag or price per ounce compared to a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />These pretzels are so good I usually don't buy regular pretzels anymore and just eat a couple of these when I want to eat pretzels.<br /><br />If I had to make any negative comment it would be that they could probably use a little more salt.

review/summary: Wonderful Treat - Better Than Non-Gluten Pretzels
review/text: Not only is this snack delicious but it's one of the first items to be even better than regular pretzels that have wheat.  The recipe produces a light and very crispy pretzel, doesn't get stale after leaving it a month in ziploc like other pretzels.  Everyone that I've shared with agrees with me.  So it is very expensive though for those who cannot eat gluten, it's a must have.  I buy it by the case and sparingly share with others!

review/summary: better than "regular"!!!
review/text: These pretzels taste great! I am lucky that I am *not* gluten intolerant but for health reasons I'm trying to limit my gluten intake. This means I can choose snacks from either side of the fence so to speak. I think that these Glutino GF pretzels taste better than most "regular" pretzels. Less salty than most non GF pretzels too which I think helps bring out their better flavor.<br /><br />These tend to be a little messy - the sesame seeds fall off quite a bit - not so much they aren't on the pretzel but enough that a couple of teaspoons wind up in the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />The only quibble is cost; these are usually more expensive than another equally good choice of GF pretzel that I enjoy - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047IG6OU">Snyder's of Hanover Gluten Free All Natural Pretzel Sticks 8-oz, 12 pack</a>.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: Great pretzels!
review/text: I found these pretzels originally when I started eating a primarily gluten-free diet.  They taste great!  I had been getting them from my grocery store, but they are rather expensive, so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for a less expensive price and I was able to get them for even less when I got them on auto-ship.  These pretzels are my main snack food and even my family loves them.  I would highly recommend them.

They restored hope that I can have good food without the "aftermath" that typically comes with eating.<br /><br />My mother, who has no problem with gluten, tried them and liked them. She even packed up some to take with her after tasting them. She was surprised, because she thought they were going to be salty - like "normal" pretzels.

review/text: MY husband cannot became alergic to gluten about a year ago and thus we have been trying all kinds of products.  These are expensive so I buy my kids pretzel's at the grocery store.  I can say these taste 10X better than any that I have had (regular / with gluten) - they have a fabulous taste.  I would recommend these if you like Pretzels - even if you can eat gluten they just taste great

Buying the case not only saves money, but I always have some on hand!

Most of the gluten free products that would normally be made with wheat flour either taste weird or have a odd texture to them when you are chewing.<br />She came home with these the other day and they actually taste really good!

review/text: These are my favorite of the gluten free pretezels but they are expensive. So I decided to order a case from Amazon. I was VERY disappointed when the package arrived. They sent the regular pretzels and further the order said no returns. I called and they did refund my money but did not offer to send me the right product. I would rather have had the sesame pretzel rings I ordered. I won't order anything else bulk from here. I have had such good luck ordering from Amazon I was really disappointed with this order and Amazon :(  I gave a one star on the review because I did not get the product I ordered. The pretzels are a 5 star in my book.

review/summary: I love these pretzels!!!
review/text: I recently discovered these at a local Walmart priced at about $5 or $6 a bag (about 4 servings).  I decided to check on Amazon and loved the lower price.  A case of 12 bags for about $31.  I have not been diagnosed with Celiac disease (so far), but I am very sensitive to gluten and to oats (migraines, intestinal pains, diarrhea).  These pretzels have never once caused a reaction of any kind , even if I pig out on an entire bag in one weekend.  The only negative thing I could say is that the fat count in higher than I'd like. 8 grams for 32 pretzels.  Salt content is moderately high at 540mg, but they are pretzels after all.  I highly, highly recommend these pretzels.

review/text: Christmas isn't complete without Party Mix. My mom started the tradition with a 1960's recipe from my great-aunt. Now I use that same recipe for my grown-up kids and their families using all gluten free ingredients. Glutino pretzel sticks are the best; they're light, with just enough salt, and none of that bitter after-taste that many gf pretzels have. They are my first choice.

review/summary: Where have all the pretzels gone?
review/text: I recently purchased the 20-pack of 2.6 oz. bags of Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists. They are excellent and my family agrees! The 2.6 oz. bag makes it easy to control portions for those who (like me) are on a restricted diet. Unfortunately, when I tried to re-order within the last week, they are not available or no longer stocked. Upon searching for other suppliers, I found a few who have these available. However, they are available at a higher price than on Amazon. I already consider these great tasting pretzels to be a splurge item - if you do the math you find they are a little pricey for a snack item, even at Amazon's price. I truly hope these Glutino gluten-free pretzels will soon become available. I had planned to buy them again and again. They are a good-tasting, crisp and crunchy, very satisfying snack food.

review/summary: Great gluten-free pretzel!
review/text: My 4 year old loves these pretzels.  They have a sweet salty taste.  We use them as snacks and in recipes.  They do have more fat content than most pretzels.  Not a big deal for a kid though!  Best price is on Amazon with the discount and free shipping.  Grocery store sells them for ~$7.59.

review/summary: Way over priced at Amazon
review/text: Like everyone else my wife and I love these Granola bars.Started by having a golf buddy offering me one a couple of months back while playing a round on the course.Puchased 1 pack of 6 at WalMart and found them to be priced at about $.50 each.Purchased 1 box of 48 at about $.45 each from Amazon.But guess what,I picked up a box of 48 at Costco yesterday and the same identical box for $12.79 or $.26 each.<br />  Thought Amazon beat everyone but I guess I'll have to be more aware of my purchases in the future.

review/summary: So good I buy them in bulk
review/text: I eat a lot of these.  I've been buying these regularly for the past 4-5 years, and go through a 48 pack every 2-3 months (eating one every other day or so).  They are salty, sweet, and crunchy.  They are quick for on the go, relatively healthy, and usually fill the craving and give a bit more energy, especially if I don't have time to grab something to eat.  I take them hiking, camping, and leave a few in the car.  And after years of eating them regularly, I'm surprisingly still not sick of them.  They're just that tasty.<br /><br />Just be careful they don't get hot, because the peanut butter turns into a nasty gooey mess inside the wrapper if you do.

review/summary: A great snack bar for when you need a lift or have low blood sugars!
review/text: These snack bars are one of the best tasting ones available.  You get the sweet taste including peanut butter and the salty and crunchy taste of peanuts.  These are good for a snack at a break for a pick me up or when your blood sugar is low.  I am a type II diabetic and sometimes I can get low blood sugar levels.  This snack is the right balance of sugar, fiber and protein.  It will give you 11 sugar grams and 4 grams of protein with 170 calories.  I have included a photo of the nutrition label for your use.<br /><br />Being diabetic I have to carefully select my snack foods and I don't eat them on a regular basis for obvious reasons.  These are nice to stick into a shirt pocket or take in the car to eat while I am on a trip or just out for the day.  They taste great and they can help maintain by sugar levels.  To me most energy bars don't have much flavor but these are almost too good.<br /><br />My only complaint is that since I put them into a shirt pocket or in the car the sweet coating on the bottom of the bar gets soft and sticky.  I have to eat them carefully to avoid making a mess if they get too warm.  I like these bars and I recommend them to you.

review/summary: Tasty Granola Bars - Recommended!
review/text: These Nature Valley "Sweet & Salty Nut Granola Bars, Peanut" are very good tasting and make a great between meal snack. We have been trying to get my kids to eat healthier and these are certainly better than candy bars but the real test is if my kids will eat them, and they really enjoy them. Being a Type 2 diabetic I am fairly careful choosing snacks and these are at the upper end of what I feel safe eating with 170 Calories and 17g Net Carbs (11g of sugar).<br /><br />My only issue is that the layer of peanut butter on the bottom can be messy in warmer weather or if heated up by holding in the hand too long, so I eat these out of the open wrapper.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Great Low Carb Snack!!
review/text: Being diabetic, it's nice to have a salty\crunchy snack that doesn't raise your blood sugar.  The trick with these is to spread them out in a SINGLE layer on a paper towel(and a plate, these things get HOT).  Depending on the microwave you have (power wise) I've made them in a 700W microwave and they take right at 4 min. and I've used a 1500W microwave that only took 2.5 min.  Don't be afraid to under cook, just keep adjusting the time up 20 sec. or so until they all puff up.  I like to take the finished ones off the plate and continue cooking the ones that haven't finished, that seem to take away the burning problem.<br />These come out fresh and hot, I can't even LOOK at the nasty bagged ones in the store anymore!!

review/summary: A bit disappointing
review/text: I have tried a variety of microwave times and settings, and also used a convention oven at various settings. Regardless, I cannot get a good batch to turn out. The rinds "puff up" inconsistently. None of them really puff like the rinds you get in the prepared store packages. The convection oven works best, but be prepared for many of the rinds to be under puffed and hard as rocks. I also purchased the BBQ flavor, which actually turned out a bit better, but these had similar problems with inconsistent puffing.

review/summary: Dusty Tea
review/text: I was so excited when I ordered this tea, I couldn't wait to try it.  When I opened it and sniffed it, I noticed there wasn't really an aroma.  Most teas have an aroma.  When I started putting the tea into my little tea ball it wasn't at all like other loose teas that I have had.  It's all crushed and dusty.  There is absolutely no flavor to this tea.  I am really disappointed, especially since other people seem to love it.

review/summary: wonderful gluten-free grain
review/text: Both my nursing baby and I have to be on a gluten-free, cook-from-scratch diet right now, and millet is about my favorite of the non-gluten grains. I cook it like rice--1 cup grain to 2 cups water, bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 20 minutes--although I have found that millet needs more salt than rice or quinoa. It has a pleasantly chewy texture, and the taste reminds me a little bit of corn flakes, especially when eaten with goat milk. You can also cook it in a 1:3 or 1:4 ratio with water, and then it resembles corn grits or polenta in both taste and texture.<br /><br />I have been using Arrowhead Mills millet for years. It is always high-quality, odor-free (I have had some trouble with big-chain health-food store bulk grains trapping odors while in storage--other people might not really notice, but we are sensitive enough to smell someone's laundry detergent when they pass by a few feet away, so this was a big deal), and clean (some sources suggest you rinse millet and quinoa before you cook them, which is rather a pain, but I don't need to with Arrowhead Mills packaged millet). Given our rapid consumption of gluten-free grains, the 6-package box is a convenient and economical way for me to purchase. Add in Amazon's fabulous free shipping, and I was on cloud 9... while the offer lasted, anyway!<br /><br />Amazon, please bring this product back!!!
