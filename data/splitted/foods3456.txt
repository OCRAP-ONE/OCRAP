review/summary: Tastes good, but too much packaging
review/text: I really like the canned LavAzza ground coffee, so I tried these pods. Tastes good and I would have 3 or 4 shots every morning. The pods make the espresso making process much quick and clean. However, my only gripe is that each pod is individually wrapped in a blue plastic pouch, like in the product photo. If you make as much coffee as I do, this amounts to a lot of trash! I would have preferred to get all the filter paper pods in one larger zip-lock bag or even resealable coffee can.

review/text: These pods work okay in E.S.E. compatible machines, and produce good crema.<br /><br />I prefer the "Bold" pods from Starbucks, both for the stronger flavor and the smaller "tab" on the side of the pod.  The Lavazza pods' extra long tab can interfere with seating the assembly in the machine.

review/summary: Decent espresso pod at a good price.
review/text: Works very well with Importika Handpresso HPWILD unit.<br />As one other reviewer mentioned, in order to get good froth you need to press the pod very well, to that end<br />I use a metal tamper the same I use with my regular espresso machine. I advise caution using a tamper so as to avoid damage to the Handpresso unit.<br />These pods combined with the Handpresso unit make for a very quick, portable and cost effective way to a good espresso.<br />Since I was not sure of what I was getting, I purchased the 20 pack. I recommend getting the 150 pack as it drops the per unit price significantly!

review/summary: Shoddy construction and bad espresso
review/text: I bought these pods mostly due to the great price and positive reviews. I had been buying Illy ese pods from Sur La Table and the cost was astronomical. I was looking for a tasty and cheaper replacement...<br /><br />That being said, I will keep looking. These Lavazza ese pods are not great at all. They are poorly made, the espresso is somewhat loose in the pod and not packed properly. A few of my pods were not sealed all around the edges and the grounds leaked out into the foil packet rendering them unusable. The filter material itself is very cottony and ends up soaking up your brewed espresso rather than just filtering it through into your cup.<br /><br />While it does produce a beautiful crema, the espresso flavor is flat with no body, no tone, no aroma, no nothing. I was a professional barista for years and I know good espresso. This is NOT worth the cost, even with free shipping. You will end up with a cup of muddy, gritty, acidic brown water. Save your money and look elsewhere!

review/summary: Nice Finish
review/text: I have purchased this tea several times now and I think it is one of the better ones I have tried.  I am a Dragonwell girl.  It hits most of the high notes of a Dragonwell tea, and this is probably the only one that I have found to be nice hot or iced, the others usually tasting best only hot.  It's not "too" anything, doesn't seem high in tannins as some other Dragonwells, yet not weak flavored either, just more down the middle, and it is a bonus to know it is organic, although that is not always a guarantee for high quality.  Teas vary in flavor according to climate variability that particular season.  Bottom line:  whether organic or not, I will pick the Dragonwell that best represents its signature qualities.  This one does, in my opinion.

review/text: Fantastic Dragon Well and it's organic which is a big plus. Good Dragon Well reminds me of high quality Sauvignon blanc wine. It has that nice Grapefruit sweetness and smell and delicate yet reach taste. I had other Dragon Wells from different tea shops but this one tastes and smell best in my opinion (so far at least). Adagio's was good but more expensive and not organic and Mighty Leaf's Dragon Well was average at best. The price is also great and when you subscribe it's even better. Highly recommended. Also steeping timing and water temperature is critical with this type of tea (never go more than 3 minutes and more than 180 F). Nevertheless it seems more forgiving that some other "higher end" greens.

review/summary: Pup loves them but our wallets don't
review/text: Our dog is crazy for these Gourmet treats.  They come in various combinations of flavors including carrots, apple, sweet potato and chicken.  Packages are zip locked and have a small stay-fresh insert to keep the treats moist.  They are small, maybe the size of your thumb, and they're chewy and smell pretty good, unlike other dog treats we've tried.  I am not happy with the pricetag on these goodies, however, and finding them in stores is hard to come by.  Buying them online is costly enough but then adding the shipping fee puts the purchase way over the top for a simple dog treat.  If they would come out with bulk package, I'd justify the higher price tag, but this sized bag is just a rip off.

review/summary: Delicious, additive free and microwave-easy!
review/text: The flavor of Bird's Custard is really close to the made-from-scratch taste and texture I was hoping for.  It doesn't contain all the additives that American custard powders contain, and it's delicious made with 2% milk. These canisters are HUGE and will last a long time since the average batch only requires two tablespoons.  I especially appreciate that the amount of sugar can be adjusted according to taste. The deal-maker is that it can be made in the microwave in about 10 minutes, start to finish.<br /><br />Here's what I've learned about Bird's in the microwave:<br />The package directions give perfect directions for mixing. The directions also call for microwaving on high for three minutes, stirring and then microwaving another three minutes.  If you do this, be prepared to mop up most of the custard from the bottom of the oven.  (Ask me how I know this).  My microwave is fairly powerful, and I can only imagine what a mess this would make if it was more so.<br /><br />Through trial and error I've learned to use a large bowl.  I've been using the Pampered Chef large microwave vegetable steamer. Mix 2 T of powder, an equal amount of milk and sugar to taste in the bowl.  I like about 1 1/2 T of sugar.  Pour in the rest of 2 cups of milk and mix thoroughly.  Microwave on high for three minutes.  Remove the container and stir.  Replace in the microwave for another five minutes.  Watch it closely, and every time the mixture is about to boil over, stop and stir.  It takes a bit longer this way, but the results are consistent, delicious AND it stays in the bowl.  An added benefit is that only one container is used and scrubbing out a saucepan isn't necessary, not to mention no additional heat in a summer kitchen.<br /><br />This technique makes the perfect custard to serve with berries for a summer dessert.  With angel food cake or spongecake, it's TDF and no one ever needs to know how little effort it took!

review/text: Turkish coffee is delicious, and this is a simple and delightful introduction to making it. I opened it up, rinsed it...it was a bit hard to get a hang of making it at first, as you have to add the right amount of sugar and watch it carefully (had a couple spills) But it was fun!

review/summary: Prolonging a quality life
review/text: Not trying to be melodramatic here but I honestly believe that the Wysong chicken (and also the chicken and turkey) are extending the life of my 15 (at least) year old cat with chronic renal failure.  Three months ago she was in crisis and I was sure she would die.  I read all I could about CRF and the Wysong Au Jus recipe was on a comprehensive list of low solium and low phosphorus foods.  I bought some and could not believe my good fortune when she ate it up.  I know now what triggered the crisis episode - it was the solium in a small amount of ham I gave her as a treat.  I k ow this because  after she was back on her feet and doing great eating Au Jus one night  I let her lick the tiniest amount of spaghetti sauce from my bowl and the next couple of days I could tell she felt bad.  She loves spaghetti sauce and I never considered the high sodium content in it plus it was a tiny bit but it had a big negative impact on her.  So I learned my lesson and she has not had any critical setbacks.  She still has the disease of course and it is apparent.  She drinks a lot of water and she sleeps more than she used to.  Some days she is very quiet but some days she is loud and rambunctious.  And she still  keeps herself clean.  So there is  a quality life there in that little rascal of mine and I truly believe the Au Jus food is why.  Just to keep things interesting for her I keep chunk light tuna in water (nothing on the ingredients list but tuna, water) and Gerber baby food - beef, chicken, and turkey varieties.  It is meat, water, and cornstarch, nothing else.  Mainly she eats the Au Jus but now and then I give her one of the others to keep her from getting bored, which she tends to do.  She is not getting the USDA mandated vitamins and minerals found in most cat food but at this point I feel like that is not a priority.

review/text: My friends made me try this as a joke, and holy crap, this has gotta be the worst tasting gum ever. I only tasted this flavor, but I don't plan on tasting the others since it's so crappy. It tastes like cough medicine mixed in with iodine. It's sooooo bad tasting that it'll make your mouth burn, almost. And no it will not give you energy either. So ignore that "RECCOMENDED DOSE" bogus on the back of the package. They obviously made this as a joke to prank friends.

review/text: Nicely dried, not heavily sugared (sugar is second ingredient) unlike most other dried mango.  There are no preservatives in Klein's Naturals Mango.  It is not sticky and is soft and easily torn into smaller bits.  Packaging is very light rigid plastic, recycleable tub.  The inner seal is cellophane over tub that while thin, has worked properly and has never arrived with any shipping damage.

review/summary: Delicious Organic Mangoes
review/text: We truly love these mangoes and have ordered dozens of cases throughout the years. They are naturally delicious and exclude artificial flavors and colors.  Plus, this dried fruit requires no refrigeration, which is great for those of us on the go.<br /><br />Klein's Mangoes use MINIMAL packaging, which greatly supports reduced waste in American landfills.  However, if a cardboard mailing box was not handled properly during shipping, the contents may, unfortunately, get crushed.<br /><br />Although we appreciate reduced recyclable packaging, for quality control purposes, we think it would be best if this product was shipped and labeled with FRAGILE stickers for better/safer handling.

review/summary: Vanilla wafers -- beware they can melt in shipment!!!
review/text: These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts. You'll have three solid blocks instead of 18 wafers, even if you used next day delivery. Best to order this product when cloudy weather is forecast, and high temps will be in the 60's or less -- apparently those brown UPS trucks get pretty warm in the sun!

review/summary: Great Cookies -- Period
review/text: I've purchased most of the gluten free cookies available on Amazon and in local stores.  These are best of the bunch.  If you like wafer cookies -- they're good whether you can eat gluten or not (I grew up eating cookies with wheat and these compete with any "normal" wafer cookie (I wouldn't go as far as I would with Blue Diamond's Nut-Thin crackers, which I would say are better than regular crackers -- but they are at least as good as most cookies -- if you serve them to friends they won't wince (or even know they are eating gluten free) when they bite into them).  The other Glutino flavors aren't bad either but the chocolate is the best -- I find chocolate tends to help mask the glutin free flour taste in most cookies.<br /><br />I would recommend some caution in shipping them during the summer as you are more likely to recieve a cookie block rather than individual wafers (although the cookie block was pretty tasty too).  Also, an added bonus for anyone shipping to APO or DPO, they will ship to these addresses(again a caution about the heat, especially if you are shipping to Afghanistan during the summer).

review/summary: Nice crunch and great taste.
review/text: These dark chocolate covered wafers are wonderful. I don't even realize they are gluten free. With a rich dark chocolate covering and good tasting crunchy wafers they are the same as regular wheat wafers but without the problems for my condition.

review/summary: These cookies are to die for.
review/text: Since going gluten free, what I have missed the most is a good cookie.  The gluten free breads and cookies on the market are not very good.  When I found these, I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  Can't live without them.

review/text: These are good, rich cookies, but I would not buy them from amazon again because they were so poorly packed that half of them were falling apart or already crumbs. I'll go back to buying them locally.

review/summary: Addictive Gluten-Free Wafers!
review/text: I keep these on auto-ship and hope I don't run out! But once a box gets opened here...they disappear at once. Crisp, light, so flavorful....and gluten-free! Whole family is hooked on the entire brand..but this flavor cookie is the MUST have. Especially refreshing refrigerated on a hot summer day.

review/summary: Styrofoamy with too sweet icing
review/text: I've been gluten free for about 10 years now and love my cookies!  I generally order Schar products and love their vanilla sandwich creams which really are as good as or better than gluten cookies.  With Glutino I feel it's hit and miss.  Their crackers are generally delicious and I love their pretzels but these cookies tasted like styrofoam and the icing was super sweet.  Not my favorite product from Glutino.  If you didn't care for these, you might try the Schar vanilla cremes.  They're amazing!

review/text: The wafer part tastes very close to Nabisco sugar wafers but it's so much lighter. The light, crispy wafer combined with the strawberry flavor is not too sweet, like most GF products are, it's just right. We love them.

review/text: I love these! After discovering a familial gluten intolerance, premade items that are gluten free have been difficult to obtain. Therefore, I now order these by the case each month. Light, refreshing, sweet and no grainy aftertaste. Yahoo! I don't have to break my dient now and I might not starve to death! I am so weary of lettuce....

review/summary: Crunchy & Good Gluten-Free Sandwich Cookies!
review/text: Having tried a couple of other brands of gluten-free sandwich cookies, these are the best of the bunch.  They're crunchy and true to the texture of the other "real" cookies that aren't gluten-free.  Some might think that the filling makes them a bit too sweet, but for me that just means I've satisfied my sweet tooth sooner!  The chocolate version from Glutino is just as good and has a true "chocolatey" taste - something that isn't there with the other gluten-free brands out there.

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: This product is very tasty but if you are also lactose intolerant, better forgo the pleasure.  Milk is not listed on the allergy advisory (May contain traces of...) but the ingredients section lists whole milk powder as a component of the chocolate coating.  Otherwise, it's a great product.

review/summary: Excellent- but do yourself a favor and try them from the fridge!
review/text: I loved these cookies when I first tried them, but found that in the humidity they will get soggy and gross if left open for too long.  Easily fixed with a Ziploc, but one time I tossed them in the fridge to keep them extra fresh.  That was when I fell IN love with these cookies.  When cold the creamy layers really hold up against the crunchy wafer and make a wonderful combination.  They are truly addicting.  Also, because we keep our entire house allergen free for my boys, these cookies are some that I can confidently serve when entertaining gluten-eating friends.  They often ask where they can get their own!

review/text: I recently had to go gluten free.  I have disliked so many products, because I can't get used to the tastes of some of the flours.  I would NEVER had guessed these were gluten free.  They are delicious!  I really have to use self control so that I don't eat them all in one day. If only I could find a gluten free bread that tastes good.

review/text: Well, my kid who isn't gluten free likes them, and my kid who is won't touch them.  I cook and bake most of what we eat, so desserts are very homemade and natural in their flavor.  These are really, really artificial-lemon flavored....they remind me of my dish soap every time I try one.  I really don't like the flavor, but the texture is nice.  I'm a little dizzied that I have so many boxes of something I don't care for... it was worth a try, though.

review/text: My son is 6 and he has celiac.  He loves sweets, however when he took a bite of this wafers he was done with it.  He said that it just was not good.  I tasted it and had to agree with him.  The only thing I could taste was the extreme sweetness and the fat sticking to the roof of my mouth.
