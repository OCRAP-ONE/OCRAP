review/text: Just wanted to say that whenever I need almost anything I go to Amazon for the best prices. I love Stash teas but find them to be a little expensive in the supermarkets but at Amazon you not only get a great price but many times you can qualify for free shipping. I received the tea quicker than I expected which was a nice surprise since I was completely out of my favorite tea, Earl Gray from Stash. Thanks again.

review/text: I can't find decaf chai tea in any stores near me. I was a little hesitant about purchasing such a large quantity at once because I wasn't sure whether I'd like this brand. But I LOVE it! Add a couple teaspoons of half and half, some honey, and some sugar and YUM homemade chai lattes! This has been one of the only things helping with my morning sickness during my pregnancy (thanks to the ginger in it). Mmmm... I think I'll go makes some right now!

review/summary: My Favorite Tea
review/text: Wonderful tea. I think most of the reviewers who hated it already had their own favorite vanilla-nut tea and found this tea different from what they expected?<br /><br />I usually dislike Stash Teas, but this flavor is just so pleasant and homey. Add some sugar and milk and it's a real treat. I agree with the reviewer who found it reminiscent of hot cocoa. It does have a tiny chemical smell, or maybe that's the vanilla. I have a poor sense of smell. It's a very cozy winter tea, but I like it too much to not have it all year 'round.

Isn't harsh and doesn't leave the skin dry like over the counter soaps such as Zest, Irish Spring, etc. Even my husband came over from the "dark soap side". He use to love Irish Spring, but after using Savon he was hooked.

review/summary: quality varies from bag to bag
review/text: I've bought this brand of freeze dried chicken in various sizes from various places over the years.  My most recent purchase is the large 21 oz bag which I got here at Amazon.  The pieces in this bag are mostly flat, averaging 1/4" thick.  The color is light tan.  The previous bag I got (same size) from another vendor in July had large pieces that were 3/4" to 1" thick and the shapes were irregular, not almost perfect rectangles like the current bag.  The color was also much lighter and the pieces were flaky and easy to break up.<br /><br />My cats do seem to prefer the bigger, chunkier, lighter & flakier pieces but they're also happy to eat the darker, flatter ones as well.  One cat will sometimes not be interested in the flatter, darker pieces but will eat them at other times.<br /><br />I've bought the smaller bags in local stores and you can see the product inside through the bag and they have always been the nicer, lighter chunkier pieces.<br /><br />I give 5 stars for when I get the nicer product, 3.5 - 4 stars for bags like the one that was delivered today from Amazon.

review/summary: dried chicken
review/text: The Natural Freeze Dried Chicken Breast looks very appetizing. My cat loves it. It has become the snack of her choice even though sometimes she likes it mixed with some other dry treats. Sometimes some pieces in the bags are a little dark, almost too dry and hard to chew. In general I have luck and it looks excellent even if pricy. I wish the price would be more accessible for other pets to be able to enjoy pure protein not found in any other commercial product.

review/text: My fussy Himalayan just goes crazy for pieces of this chicken.  He doesn't eat any other dry food.  I was concerned because many of the pieces in the bag are broken down into tiny specs, and I was concerned about wasting so much of the food.  I now call it frosting and put these tiny pieces on top of his wet food Weruva Paw Licking Chicken and he devours all of it.  He knows the word "frosting" and waits patiently for me to sprinkle some of it on top of his wet food. I use the larger pieces as treats. Great product especially for fussy cats! Buying the large bag from Amazon saves me at least $12.

They even lick up the chicken "dust" and walk around with it all over their (black) faces.  They love this stuff.  My only complaint is how hard it is to find!  It stays "out of stock" all over the internet a lot so I have to stock UP on any size I can find, when I can find them.<br /><br />All natural, nothing bad for them and they love them.  Perfect treat- but often hard to find.

review/text: A very good coffee -The dark roast makes a very bold, strong cup of coffee without being bitter.  I actually mix the dark and regular roast beans 1:1 to get the flavor I want.  Amazon's price is good, and they show up at my doorstep as needed with the Subscribe and Save deal.  The only reason(s) this is 4 stars and not 5 is (a)the vacuum seal on the bags is sometimes poor or broken -the package is not "open" -just not under high vacuum any more -that said I have not noticed a difference in the flavor between the vac sealed and the non-vac sealed (b) I recieved a shipement where one of the bags was slit open.  Perhaps from a razor knife used to open the large boxes from Lavazza and package them into the Amazon shipments -I called and they replaced them immediately.

Buy a Grinder for $20 and grind your own beans. Much cheaper than buying the pre-ground Lavazza. In fact it's almost as cheap as buying good coffee in the grocery store. It really is easy to grind your own and the coffee is so fresh. Its really wonderful.

review/text: Met my friend at a sandwich shop, brought a thermos of this coffee. I had added a little soymilk to lighten, she thought the coffee was too weak. The pot was black as night. The taste was smooth as hell, and 30 minutes later, she was a little spun out of control.<br /><br />It is by far, the smoothest coffee blend I've had, and is great stuff. Just because a cup might be so bitter from various alkaloids, doesn't make it superior coffee. This stuff truly equates to quality.

review/text: This is the coffee we will buy from now on. It has the smoothest taste, great finish, and none of the bitterness so common in Starbucks coffee. And you cannot beat the price! I would take this over Illy any day! Try it - you'll love it!

review/summary: Talisker 10 is the coopered spirit of a wild and barren maritime land
review/text: Talisker 10 is my favorite of Diageo's excellent "Classic Malts" series.  It comes from the desolate craggy island at the end of Earth known as Skye.  Geographically half way between the dense oceanic peaty malts of Islay and the ethereal heather and wood glow of Highland Park, Talisker manages to split the difference from a flavor and style perspective as well.  More easy going that the big Islay malts it still manages to have an unmistakable character that is classically of the maritime West and yet has some of the heather and delicacy of the extreme North.<br /><br />In the glass Talisker 10 is rich old gold (dark yellow with amber and orange glints).<br /><br />The nose is the smell of the sea coopered in an old dry box.  Brine, iodine, mineral and faint seaweed notes combine with old dry oak or even basswood aromas.  There's a tiny whiff of band-aids here too.  With added time sweet notes come from below: butterscotch, caramel, and a hint of mint. It's a superb and complex aroma that is instantly recognizable as Talisker once you've tried it.<br /><br />Entry is sweet but complicated by the sudden appearance of sea flavors of brine and sea moss.  Midpalate begins with a peppery tingle and broadens into oak tannins, honey, floral essence, a kiss of mint, turkish delight candy flavors and a peculiar mineral (rock) aspect. Finish is long with old wood and a bitter citrus rind.  It's a complex and delicious clinic on "terroir" - sense of place.  It smells just like what the barren rocky promontory by the sea where Talisker is made and barrel aged for a forlorn and windswept decade.<br /><br />Talisker is closest to Oban of all the malts but ultimately it is something unique and wonderful all its own.  The ten is a brilliant achievement and a fine selection.  It is edged by the other two Talisker expressions (the 18 and Distiller's Edition) - but not by much.  The 10 stands very well on it's own and is a lovely and distinctive experience each time I drink it.

No refrig. required and take up little space in the food storage locker.

review/text: These are really quite good and simple to make.  Water and a bit of oil in a pain, cook until the water is all gone and turn up the heat to brown.  Less then 10 minutes and you are done.  The potatoes are pretty natural tasting considering they are freeze dried.  The flavor of the spices included is very good.  You could probably easily do the same thing by cutting your own potato slices and adding some garlic and seasonings, but these are good if you are in a hurry .

review/summary: Not bad for a diet drink - only a slight artificial sweetner taste
review/text: I think Snapple makes great products. I especially like their ice tea and used to drink a lot of the regular, full sugar variety until I decided to do something about my weight. (The card from the scale at the drug store said, "beware of ivory poachers". - I got my shoes shined, I had to take the guy's word for it.)<br /><br />The lemon flavor seems to hide the artificial sweetner taste and I have been drinking it for a few months without really missing the one with real sugar.<br /><br />The 16 oz. size works perfectly for me - a 12 oz. can of soda isn't enough but 2 cans, is a little too much.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good summer drink. I especially like the trivia tidbits written in the cap...<br /><br />Give it a try if you want to cut back on calories and not suffer from the experience.

review/summary: A Very Good Product
review/text: special note:  This is a review of the product, not the offered price.<br /><br />I don't use a lot of molasses in my cooking but when I bake ginger snaps I love that the recipe I have calls for 1/4cup of molasses.  Why?  Because molasses have a lot of iron.  4% of the daily requirement per 1 tablespoon of Grandma's.  Not a fantastic amount per cookie, but every little bit helps with toddlers and growing big kids.<br /><br />That said, you can imagine my surprise when my husband brought home another brand -Golding Farms- where the iron percentage is double (2X!) Grandma's.<br /><br />Something to consider.<br /><br />Pam Tee<br />mom/foodie<br /><br />ps--this is the 2nd best molasses advice I ever got --first is don't use sulpured:  Use a spray oil on measuring cups.  That way the molasses just slips out and you get all the goodness.

Unique in appearance, the San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser K-Cups deliver a great cup of coffee!  As other reviews state, you'll notice a heavenly, strong coffee aroma when opening the air-tight plastic packaging.  Once opened, I store my Fog Chaser K-Cups in an empty, (clean) large metal coffee can.  It not only keeps the aroma intact, it keeps the K-Cups nice and fresh for brewing.<br /><br />If you haven't already tried these K-Cups, do!

review/summary: size and shape worried me- but taste is where they excel
review/text: The size and shape worried me.  I am glad that I read other reviews first.  The top of these cups are not as big around (diameter) as a regular k-cup.  In fact I was afraid that it wouldn't fit.  But they do.  Then they lack all the plastic that surrounds a normal k-cup on the bottom.  So they definitely look different and weird.  But taste is what is important.  Well taste and price.<br /><br />Taste- I have only tasted Fog Chaser.  It definitely has an upfront bitterness (or acidity) to it.  It is the first thing I notice.  Don't get me wrong.  I actually enjoy some acidity to my cup of coffee.  Otherwise I find it to be a bit bland.  After the acidity comes a great taste.  Very rich and strong.  In fact I think this is the strongest, boldest k-cup I have had.  Only real concern here is the packaging allows the coffee to go stale faster than if each was sealed individually.  It is nice that they come in three separate sealed bags.  But I think we will go through them fast enough that it would not be a problem.  If you drink very slowly and allow these to linger for several weeks I think the taste will definitely be an issue.<br /><br />Price- At 49 cents per cup this is unbeatable.  Then you have the option of buying on subscription and get them at 41 cents per.<br /><br />Conclusion= I love rich/strong coffee and I love the price.  sold.

review/summary: A hearty, fresh, and somewhat bold taste
review/text: I really like this coffee.  Rich, flavorful, bold, and very tasty.<br /><br />I was put off by the odd look of the cup at first...as many others have described, it looks strange when you first see it.  If you turn it upside down it looks like a cranium in a hair net.  But it's just as easy to use as a typical k-cup, so no problem there.  The only problem you might have is trying to place it in one of those vertical k-cup dispensers you can get wherever you buy k-cups.  This cup doesn't sit well in there.<br /><br />One thing you'll notice when you open the cardboard box and cut open the rather thick plastic pouch the 12 containers come in: the smell.  It's extremely rich, a very deep, bold smell that makes you think of your very best cup of coffee ever.  Think about it, though: that's the smell of your coffee when it's manufactured and placed within the container.  I doubt the plastic k-cups are as bold when they're tapped into by the Keurig machine...I'm sure they've disseminated some of the freshness on their way to you.<br /><br />What I do to keep that flavor is to take each cup out of the nice thick bag and immediately re-seal the bag with a strong clip.  I feel that retains the flavor.  In that sense, I'm glad they don't fit on the vertical k-cup dispensers...I like that the freshness stays intact within the thick plastic bag.<br /><br />Anyway, I love this flavor.  Keep it secure in the plastic pouch and you'll have a great fresh taste every time you want a cup.

review/summary: Our favorite coffee at a fantastic price
review/text: My girlfriend and I got a Keurig a couple years ago. Previously, donut shop or caribou kcups were our favorite. Those are both great, we still love them. I ordered the sfbay french roast, as was definitely intrigued. It had a bold taste, and the cups themselves got my attention. I wish the top cap wasn't plastic, but the pouch definitely allows for more of that coffee smell that I missed when moving to the keurig. I decided to try fog chaser out, it's fantastic. The flavor is wonderful, smells great while you're brewing, and we cut the tops off and easily compost the rest. It's a step in the right direction, and I would recommend these to anyone with a keurig.

review/summary: Excellent coffee from a family-owned company
review/text: I love supporting family businesses and was pleasantly surprised to discover the Fog Chaser K-cups provide an excellent cup of coffee. I love my Keurig, and I also love a good cup of coffee in the morning and the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company doesn't disappoint. Their coffee is just as flavorful, if not more, than the big brand coffee chains. I will definitely be buying more Fog Chaser and also trying some of their other coffees!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I was a little wary of trying these, but the price was right, so what the heck?  The good news is, they're delicious.  Both the hubby and I are enjoying them.  I wish I could put them in my K-Cup carousel, but I guess I can live without that little perk in exchange for a more affordable K-cup that still tastes great.  I don't understand why people complaining about them going stale don't put them in a ziploc bag after opening.  We consume at least four cups of coffee per day in our house, so we go through one bag of 12 in 3 days or less.  That's not enough time for the coffee to go stale inside a zip loc bag!  Give these a try.  I am going to be sampling the other blends, for sure.

review/summary: Strongest K-Cup coffee out there
review/text: This Fog Chaser was available at my local grocery store. I thought I would give it a try. Well let me tell you, even on the highest setting this cup is STRONG. Reminds me of a regular pot of Dark Communittee Coffee. If you think the regular k-cups are just too weak, give this a try and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Good Value, Good Taste
review/text: Coffee preference is just a matter of taste, so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn't mean much. You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer, "the VUE"  that uses different and patented cups.

Once I put creamer and sugar in though, it is a really good cuppa joe. I probably won't be ordering again since I don't always have cream/sugar available, but I think it is still a solid 4 star since it is so good when properly doctored up.

review/summary: Good coffee, bad packaging
review/text: One of my biggest pet peeves is over-packaging, so I gave the "frustration free" pods a shot. I like that there's less waste to dump in landfills. However, the pods don't work well in my Keurig. In order to brew, I have to push down on the handle until the cycle is done, otherwise, nothing happens. I really like the flavor of the coffee, but keeping it fresh is an issue, even though I store the pods in air-tight containers. I probably won't buy coffee packaged this way in the future.

review/summary: Best tasting coffee I have had for the Keurig
review/text: The San Fracisco Bay Coffee One Cups for Keurig K-Cup Brewers have been the best tasting coffee I have had from the Keurig.  I have tried just about every K-cup brand.  This is not packaged in the typical K-cup plastic cups.  It comes in bulk (12 per bag) and the One Cups have the same top as the K-cup but insead of the plastic housing it is a filter material.  This might bother some people.  I store them in a plastic zip lock so they will stay fresh.  The filtering process through a filter rather than the plastic housing might be what makes it taste so good or it may just be the coffee.  It is much less expensive at $13.59 per 36 than the typical K-cups as well as being the best tasting coffee.  I love the French Roast.

review/text: Tried these pods since they were on sale, and glad I did.  Very robust but super smooth flavor, almost sweet.  The only downside to these is having to keep them in a sealed bag, which isn't much of a negative...  Can't stop raving about how good this coffee tastes.  My husband loves strong coffee and I usually don't like most of them because they can be bitter.  This is the smoothest strong coffee I have ever had!

review/text: This is pretty good coffee at a very reasonable price compared with other Keurig coffees.  I liken it more to Dunkin coffee than Starbucks.  The pods work fine even though as others have pointed out, they are not true K Cups.  They come in 3 x 12-pod bags, and they stay fresh until you open the bag.  You can reseal the bag with tape, or transfer the pods to a ziplock bag.  I happened to have an OXO coffee storing container that keeps them fresh after they are taken out of their plastic bag.<br /><br />Give 'em a try, they're not half bad, and it sure beats paying $15 for 24 K Cups.

review/summary: Simple the Best Keurig Cups
review/text: This is absolutely the best Keurig Cup coffee I've tasted, and I've tried a lot of them.  (I don't call them K-Cups just because they're made a little differently -- not encased in plastic, just a little filter filled with the grounds.)<br /><br />All the K-Cup varieties I've tried seem to brew a bit on the weak side.  This actually tastes like a full-bodied cup of coffee!  The Fog Chaser flavor is bold by nature, so if you like a milder coffee it might not be your best choice.  It's not bitter like some bold coffees can be -- it's actually quite smooth and seems to have very low acidity.<br /><br />My favorite way to enjoy coffee has always been a French press, but since I found this Fog Chaser coffee I haven't used my press in months.  It's that good.

I use the Fog Chase and French Roast on the 12 ounce setting but the Rainforest is too weak to use  so I have to use the 8 ounce setting. The Big plus with these ecocups is that they are really good for use with your own coffee! I use DisposaCup Lids to refill these ecocups over and over again!

review/summary: Good quality coffee-- cheaper and less waste
review/text: I was given a Keurig as a gift and it is so easy to use that I use it almost exclusively.  I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to "chase the fog away" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.  This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.  This is the best brew and the least wasteful way but I don't have the patience too do it in the early morning until awake.  I recommend it highly.<br /><br />San Fran Bay coffee are very similar to K-cups but they do not have a complete cup attached to the mesh brew bag.  This eliminates a lot of hard plastic waste.

review/summary: SF Bay Fog Chaser K Cup - A pleasant surprise
review/text: I saw this brand for the first time at a local supermarket yesterday and figured for $6.49 for a box of 12 (that's 54 cents a cup), I'd give it a try.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, its not actually a plastic K Cup but a rigid rim with a foil lid attached to a filter filled with coffee. The rim sits perfectly in my Keurig machine. When you close the lid of your machine, the product is punctured from the top only. The filter is sort of bowl-shaped and doesn't make contact with the lower puncture needle, but you really wouldn't want it to puncture a filter anyway - you'd have grounds in your coffee. It's a clever idea, actually.<br /><br />I was skeptical about this product because the box doesn't have the "Keurig" co-branding that all the others do, but given the variation to the cup design, I can now understand why. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The taste was quite good and strong, and is the closest thing to real coffee-pot coffee that I've had in 3+ years of Keurig machine cup samplings. I had no coffee grounds in the cup, and it was quite satisfying.<br /><br />By way of background, my all-time favorite variety is Tullys French Roast, and I prefer dark roasts. The box for San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser says its a combination of their regular roast and their french. Its not as strong as Tullys French but it's definitely not weak. My machine is the B77 model which has 4 size settings. Going from small to large, I used the third size which is 7.25 ounces and I was very satisfied with the taste and strength.<br /><br />I wanted to start with the small 12 count box at the market to try them out. Really, who wants 80 cups of something you might not like? But now I know it's a winner, I'll be getting them here regularly where they are even more affordable.

review/summary: Good Coffee, Different Packaging
review/text: I love discovering and drinking a variety of different coffee's in the never ending quest for the perfect cup.  The K-Cup format makes the trek much easier and enjoyable with the guarantee of a fresh tasting cup every time, as opposed to coffee beans that can go stall plus the convenience of drinking something different with each single cup if I desire.<br /><br />The journey brought me to San Francisco Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser.  Having had the opportunity to travel I had experienced the the brand and was excited to see it "available soon" in K-Cups so I didn't hesitate to preorder.<br /><br />As I have come to rely on, Amazon delivered on time and I was anxious to try it the next morning.<br /><br />The Coffee (5 Stars)<br /><br />- Fog Chaser didn't fail to impress. In fact I would say it over delivered on quality based on my expectations - The rich full bodied taste and smooth finish made an excellent addition to my morning routine and I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />The Packaging (2 Stars)<br /><br />-  The K-Cupish like packaging, though innovative leaves room for improvement.  Instead of the traditional solid sealed K-Cup we have all grown use to the San Francisco Bay Coffee comes in a hybrid type packaging.  The coffee is held in a coffee filter material pouch that is attached to a K-Cup like top. It doesn't effect how you us it but it does effect a few other things.<br /><br />First off I seem to get more coffee grounds in my cup than I do with a traditional K-Cup.<br /><br />In addition the individual cups, because the coffee is exposed to air via the filter pouch freshness becomes an issue.  They come in the box sealed in an air tight bag but it is not resealable so once you open it the remaining coffee is exposed.  If this was the only coffee I drank it would probably not be an issue but because I jump around a lot it sits longer effecting the taste.  I guess I could place them in a resealable bag but call me lazy or cheap but I don't and feel I shouldn't have to.<br /><br />Lastly, though very nit-picky the individual cups will not sit in the coffee carousel I have on the counter next to the maker (you probably wouldn't want them to because of the freshness issue) but again it just makes it a little more inconvenient.<br /><br />As I drag myself into the kitchen after loosing the battle with my alarm clocks snooze button and I struggle in to make the first cup to get the caffeine flowing through my system I just don't like to work that hard at it.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />- The packaging itself will probably not keep me from reordering but it will be much less often than I would normally with some of my other favorites.<br /><br />So with all that said, if the packaging doesn't bother you or effect long term freshness, you are in for a very nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: Great cup of coffee
review/text: Had to try this as soon as I received it. Made a great bold cup of coffee. Was very impressed  with the "pod". Very little waste, as compared to the regular k-cups. I will be trying different flavors in the future.

review/summary: disappointed with my first SF Bay coffee
review/text: I like the idea like most people and saw many good reviews to believe that the coffee will actually taste good.<br />Nope. The taste is terrible and no aroma. The quality of the coffee bean selection need to be improved.<br />Disappointed with my first try of  san francisco bay kcup coffee.

review/summary: Great Taste, Less waste!
review/text: Great coffee and less plastic in the landfills. As stated in earlier reviews, not actually a K Cup, but that's a good thing. My new favorite.
