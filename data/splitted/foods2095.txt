review/text: I had enjoyed the first package of this coffee, really good. So good, that I put it on subscription but when I received the second package I thought there was something wrong with my Tassimo. Then after a few more tries I found that this was just plain terrible, terrible coffee. The hazelnut was really artificial-tasting. What a shame. They've ruined my taste for hazelnut. Actually, now--anything by Gevalia.

review/text: Currently on a tight budget, I love this pasta. It's available in a local store for mere penies (but I bet it'd be even cheaper through here).<br /><br />The pasta cooks up fairly quickly and when mixed in with low-fat meat and veggies, provides me with healthy meals for a very long time at a price which I can definently afford to buy. I was concerned about product quality, but I could not taste the difference between the more expensive brands and this pasta. They taste the same.<br /><br />I only wish more local stores were carrying this because it's such a great bargain.

review/summary: My Dog Thinks This Is Her Treat For the Day!
review/text: When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the "chicken flavor" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended "Golden Aloe" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these "doggie crack", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online. I am completely sold on this product and have now started purchasing some of their other treats and products as well!! Can't go wrong with Zukes!

review/summary: Natural treat our Bichon loves!  A plus for his joints!
review/text: We've been feeding our Bichon Zuke's hip action treats for years.  He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints, etc.<br /><br />I only rated a 4 because I have no idea if the Zuke's hip action really does work in terms of improved mobility.  Yes, he loves the treats; yes, he walks every day; and yes, we're hoping the Zuke's is working to aid his mobility.  Nevertheless, he loves the Zuke's treat and we like the fact that they're made in the USA and are natural.  Just note of caution for Bichon owners with urinary stone issues; don't feed a Bichon beef products.  The chicken is great.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/10<br />I've updated my rating to a 5 because I recently took our dog to the vet who confirmed, at the age of 12 going on 13, he has no arthritis.  In fact, both front and back legs have full mobility.  I do attribute part of this success to his walking every day but also to Zuke's hip action treats.  Digby's had a Zuke's hip action treat for years and this treat is the only joint action remedy we feed him in addition to Nupro All Natural Dog Suppplement for his other nutrients, minerals, and vitamins.  While Zuke's hip action treats are not the only reason he is doing so well, I believe this treat in conjunction with exercise and the proper diet have significantly contributed to his overall well being!

They said she might have cancer on her leg and probably need to cut off her leg.<br />I didn't have the money to take her back to the vet to check up again when is was crying in pain. So then I read others reviews on Amazon and found Zuke's. I immediately bought it and gave her 2 doses a day for a week. And now she is running around the house ans jumps again. My dog doesn't like the taste but I sandwiched between the sliced cheese and she eat it with no problem. Thank you so much Zuke's. From now on I will buy every month for her.

review/summary: Thank God for Zuke's Dad!
review/text: Knowing his mother's agony, my son let his dog remain at home when he moved out, and, already spoiled, Raider became the center of our world. We would do anything for him and he returned our love tenfold. At the age of 12, our little pupcake began *screaming* whenever attempting to rise from sleep. Throughout that year his pain grew far greater...my husband and I were *forced* to have "that talk".  How much pain was too much pain? Were we just letting him live because we couldn't bear to let him go?<br /><br />On a trip to Utah, our friends saw the anguish overwhelming us.  They recommended we try Zuke's.  HOURS later, Raider was *running* for the first time in years!  He is now a happy 17-year-old, and ONLY ran into trouble the ONE time his Mommy was late in refilling the Zuke's. I kid you naught, the screaming is GONE, and has been since Day One.  We owe *so* much to that awesome hiker who owned Zuke and developed this 'treat' to help him out. As much as we wouldn't wish pain on anyone, we're so thankful Zuke had *such* a smart Daddy!!!

review/summary: Doggy Likes!
review/text: My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats.

review/summary: Nearly Miraculous
review/text: I don't usually bother with reviews, but these results pretty much demanded it. Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his "golden years" without the misery of a poorly aging dog. I'm completely a believer in this product, and we'll be giving them to every dog we ever own. (Plus, you just saved me a bundle on an expensive pet bed.) ;D

However, I never give them more than a whole one in a given day because of the glucosamine and condroiten.  (I believe an excess of these ingredients is not beneficial but in limited dose may be helpful.)

review/text: Our older dog, Broccoli, has been quietly aging.  Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.  Thank you Zuke's!

Yesterday for the first time in months she came upstairs during the day while I work in my office. And today she jumped on the chaise for a nap.  I figure there is no placebo effects for animals so that can't be it. The treats must have had an effect on her mobility and pain. I will be a repeat customer.

review/summary: After a month, I am a believer
review/text: I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you! Knowing our time left with this most important member of our family is getting shorter, I am so relieved I can make him a little more comfortable in the last stages of his life.

review/summary: My PUPPY loves these!  They aren't just for older dogs
review/text: I have a 5 month old Pomeranian puppy.  Poms have a tendency to develop collapsed tracheas and also have issues with luxating patellas (knee problems).  Both areas are made of cartilage.  I give him one of these per day to make sure that we strengthen his cartilage/joints so that we can try to prevent or delay these issues that may develop later (and hopefully some vet bill money down the road!).  He loves these things and the chewy texture of them (I must admit, they smell good to me too, haha)!  These little guys live for a very long time typically, and I want him to have a very happy and healthy life - there is nothing like the power of prevention.  I love that they are made in the USA and not in China, and that it's very healthy for him.. very natural.

review/summary: Absolutly a Godsend
review/text: This product is amazing!  We had a gift card for an out of town feed store and my husband happened to pick this up.  We have an older Rott/Boarder Collie who has been having joint, arthritis trouble.  The vet has given him several medications.  One he won't eat unless I  force it and the other makes him act "wonky".  The vet says I shouldn't have a problem with either product, but I know my dog! Anyway, because of this fluke purchase, his mobility and attitude improved by "leaps and bounds" within two weeks!  He no longer cries or yelps when he tries to get up and he is much more playful.  Bucky, our dog, is also allergic to corn.  It isn't easy to find a "treat" that doesn't have corn. This product is free of corn and other additives i.e. wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors, added fat or by-products.  The only thing I could wish for is disclosure of the caloric content.  I don't know how many calories are in a treat.  We use this in conjunction with a senior glucosamine /condroiton dog food. The 1lb pk that we purchased was $17 and a 45 minute trip out of town.  I'm down to one treat. He takes three (huge dog) a day.  I decided to see if I could get it on line.  Everything I found was still expensive especially with S&H.  And, then I thought maybe Amazon.  Sure enough there it was.  So, thanks to Amazon.  But more importantly, greatful thanks to Zuke's for a miracle product.  Couldn't be more happy.  God gave us a great gift when he gave us all our furry friends!

review/summary: Hip Hip Hooray for Zuke's
review/text: We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement, Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat, corn, soy, by-products, or artificials.<br /><br />Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine, but I've taken it for years with wonderful results, and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.<br /><br />These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course, I'll be ordering another.

review/summary: My 3 dogs love these
review/text: I've started giving these to 2 of my dogs which are a very large breed.  They aren't really old yet, but we have mostly wood and tile floors which are hard on their joints.  So I've started giving them these in hopes of preventing - to some extent - damage and pain for them. They love these.  My small dog isn't very old, but wants them, too.  I don't think they are so good for her since she has thrown them up before.  The pieces are fairly large so the dog knows she's getting a real treat.  I haven't found any flavor that they don't like, although the Beef seems to be their favorite.  I like that they seem to be a made in the USA product since I lost a dog during the "bad dog food" epidemic. Since then, I've been very careful what I give my dogs.

review/text: I have tried a lot of different arthritis supplements for my small dogs, but this one is the best product I have found for the price.  My dogs love it and it is wonderful to see them running around where before they could hardly move for the pain.  Granted, they are old (one is 17 and one is 13) but I believe this product has given them a better quality of life, which, after all, is exactly what we want for our pets.

review/summary: It Works!
review/text: We have a 15-year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over-the-counter glucosamine for him, but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over-the-counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action, and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed, so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine), but he's doing great...running up and down stairs, playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action, but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog.

review/summary: Soft, Chewable, Yummy Treats for Your Aging/Arthritic Dog
review/text: I buy these for my nine year old Chihuahua. He has bad knees, hips, and back. He also has lost the majority of his teeth due to former owners who neglected his dental health. He loves these and they seem to help him a lot. When I pull out the bag, he starts doing his tricks hoping I'll give him one just for doing them! He can eat them easily even without the majority of his teeth, although I do break them into smaller pieces since he is only about 5 pounds.<br />These treats seem to have really improved his mobility and stamina. He skips less(to get his kneecap back in place), bunny hops less(because his hips hurt him), and jumps on the bed without any help(he used to stand on the top of his pet stairs and wait for me to pick him up). He's always had tons of energy, but now his body can keep up with him better.

review/summary: Fixed My Dogs Hip
review/text: I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past.

They go nuts when they know they are going to get one, and my vet recommends the supplements for them as they get older.  They are a bit pricey, but I think they are worth it.  Much better now that Amazon is carrying them directly.  I can also say that the manufacturer stands by their products 100%.  I used to buy these in a 3 pack from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon.  On my last shipment, it was very noticeable that in all 3 bags, the treats were very hard and brittle, despite being well before the use by date printed on the bag and the packaging being intact (no holes).  I emailed the manufacturer, and within just a few days they shipped me 3 new bags without any hassle.  Now that is Customer Service!

review/text: I have an 8 year old female German Shepherd. Lately I have been noticing she has a bit of a difficult time getting up and her hips always seem to be stiff.<br />Since I don't know anything about dog vitamins, I decided to take the route of these treats. I would much rather give her something she might possibly like over giving her a pill.<br /><br />Thing is, she doesn't really like these very much. I usually have to try 2 or 3 times to get her to eat. Bright side is that I can get her to eat them after a little hassle.<br /><br />The even brighter side to these treats (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3) is the fact that they do seem to be helping her stiff joints. I have only gone through one 6 oz bag of these treats and I have noticed a difference in how she stands up, walks and runs. For the first time in a while her legs don't look so stiff.<br /><br />P.S. you can get these treats cheaper on Linens and Things website(LNT.COM). You don't have to pay shipping. I paid 12.21 for a pound of these treats.

review/summary: Best way to give glucosamine that I've found
review/text: My dog loves these treats. I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid. These are pretty affordable, too. They also travel fairly well, and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.<br /><br />The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day. The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog's weight. But so far "over-medicating" has not been a problem (especially if you break them in half).<br /><br />I've been really amping up my dog's walks and runs to get ready for hiking this spring, and so far he's not only limp-free, but the stiffness he used to get just after a nap seems to be significantly reduced. All in all, we're both really happy with these. I'll be buying them again, and I'll be trying out more of Zuke's other treats.

review/text: I bought these for my 13 year old pug, who has very bad hips and arthritis, and very few teeth.<br /><br />Poor ole girl, she's a sweetheart, but getting around was hard on her.  These are soft, so she can chew them with no problem, and while she's still stiff if she's been sleeping a long time, she loosens right up once she starts moving.<br /><br />She was on Metacam, which worked just about the same, but is waaaay more expensive.  I love that these are made in the USA and part of the profits are donated to the Dog and Cat Research Fund.  These are just a win-win-win all around for us!<br /><br />Almost for got to mention....she loves them!

review/summary: Boppy gives it 5 stars
review/text: Boppy gets overly excited when Rodan (grey crane) flies up from the creek, or a squirrel raids the bird feeder.  She has torn her ACL more than once - when she takes off at top speed.  So I now get her treats with glucosamine - so much easier than trying to get a pill in her.  She like the chicken flavor best - she tried beef too.  I like that it is made in the USA.  She does much better with her hips and joints - vet tells me it is really her knee that has ACL problems.  Zukes has a great product here that I like to give her, and she enjoys the good-for-her treat.

review/text: I order Hip Action every month for my dogs, I think they like it better than thier food! I wasn't looking for a treat for my dogs as they are getting older my primary reason to purchase Hip Action was for the "medicinal" properties. I can't say I see a huge difference in the dogs agility because hopefully I caught the issue before the dogs had a major problem. A must try dogs love them.

review/text: These are great dog treats that are made with natural ingredients and my dogs love them.  I give them these treats to provide the Glucosamine needed especially for my larger dogs.  They get a very good grain free dog food but it does not contain glucosamine and my older dog needs it. Zuke's Hip Action really seems to help her. I have brought this item for several years and highly recommend it.

review/text: My dog loves these treats, I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages, no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products.

review/text: My elderly lab suffers from arthritis.  Her pain is greatly diminished by taking glucosamine and chondroitin.  Unfortunately she is not a fan of the gravy, chewable tablets or pill forms.  Hip Action has been a fantastic find because she actually wants her meds.  You can set a clock by her these days at 8 pm she goes into the kitchen and stares at the cupboard where we store the Hip Action and waits for her two treats.

review/text: I bought these treats for my 16 year olo husky/beagle mix dog. Within two weeks she showed a visible improvement in mobility and seemed to be pain free. She has pretty bad arthritis and these seem to be working very well. The only issue is they are a semi soft treat so they were all pretty broken and in a big lump in the bag. But other than that they are a great product.

But he loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>, so I thought I might as well give Hip Action a try. And he loved them!<br />They are also a great value - I actually took the time and counted the number of treats in a 1 lb bag - and I got 64, which means more than 2 months of hip protection for dogs under 46 lb (you only need to give one a day).

It comes in one and a half inch squares.  It's a little big for us so we cut into smaller, bite-size pieces that are great for training.  We are still young so can't comment on the hip action part yet. I just want to give my dog a good quality treat and I think this is worth the price.

review/text: My mom purchased a variety of treats for my dog to try.  He does not have any hip problems but we needed a treat that he would not turn his nose up at and not choke on.  The pieces are 1 x 1 squares, about 3/4 of a centimeter thick.  They smell like fruity beef bullion to me even though the formula says it is chicken.  I have a Bichon Frise (5 yrs old) and he likes these treats.  The texture reminds me of a Lara Bar but just a tad firmer/dryer.

review/summary: "With xylitol?" That's misleading labeling...
review/text: There are a lot of reported benefits to xylitol, but Trident is just using it as a marketing gimmick here. The ingredients list for this gum starts out like this: sorbitol, maltitol, gum base, mannitol, xylitol... That's right, xylitol is the fifth ingredient, and the fourth sugar alcohol!<br /><br />If you do a little searching on the internet, you'll come across a number of doctors and dentists who have said that this gum has too little xylitol to have any practical effect. For people who don't read labels closely, this might also lead them to think that this gum is actually sweetened with xylitol (which causes fewer digestive problems than sorbitol and maltitol).<br /><br />The bottom line is that they've added a few milligrams of xylitol so that they can pretend that this gum is healthier and thus charge more.

review/summary: Exactly like Starbucks
review/text: I got hooked on the green tea lattes at Starbucks a couple of years ago when I was looking for an alternative to all the caffeine and acid in their coffees.  But, while I loved the taste, I was hating the fat and sugar in them.  I began experimenting when I'd go in by asking for nonfat versions.  Didn't take me long to adjust to the lower fat and then I started asking for substitution of the various sugar-free syrups for the melon syrup.  Eventually found that the sugar free caramel was the right combo for me and reduced the calories.  The cost is still prohibitive for a daily treat and I started exploring the options for green tea matcha online.  Kind of strange that you can buy the sugar free caramel in big bottles from Starbucks, but you can't outright purchase the matcha.  Finally found this green tea frappuccino mix from Island Teas and it's been a great substitute for my morning ritual.  I take a large mug of nonfat milk and microwave it for 2 minutes, add two to three tablespoons of the frappuccino/latte mix plus three pumps of the Starbucks caramel sugar free syrup and then whisk and I'm set to go!  I'm purchasing my fourth 2.2 pound bag today and it lasts me about three months.<br /><br />Try having Starbucks making you a nonfat greent tea latte with sugar free caramel syrup instead of the regular and if you like it, try my mix at home.

review/summary: This stuff is amazing!
review/text: I first got hooked on green tea matcha powder when I ordered a green tea frappuccino at the Barnes and Noble cafe near me. I decided to see if I could find the ingredients so I could make these at home, considering the fact that my B&N isn't open at 2 a.m., which is typically when I'm craving one of these delicious drinks! So I ordered this product. Two heaping teaspoons, a couple of spoons of granulated sugar substitute of your choice, a splash of sugar-free coconut syrup, 12 ounces of soy milk, and 4 ounces of ice in a blender suddenly whip into a delectable concoction that is equal to or better than any I've ever gotten at B&N or Starbucks! This is the only place I found the matcha powder in bulk, and the quality is excellent. Be advised, it truly is a powder! When you open it, powder will waft into the air. I had to sniff it, to absorb the wonderful woody aroma, but later noticed a little green tinge around my nostrils, LOL.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product. The seller shipped promptly and the product arrived in excellent condition.

review/summary: Love It!
review/text: This stuff is awesome if you really like Green Tea Latte's.  I use a splash of vanilla syrup with the mix and no longer can justify going to Starbucks for the expense I save with this product.  It's great when mixed with ice or ice cream too!  It lasts me about two months with almost everyday use.

review/summary: Nice gift
review/text: I just wanted a little extra gift to hand dad for Father's Day and this fit the bill. The logs are a little smaller than I would have liked but it was good sausage and cheese, overall I'd say it was worth the price paid.

review/summary: Super customer service!!!
review/text: I ordered this product in the middle of one of the hottest summers on record.  When I received it, the cheese was hot and very soft from sitting in the truck for long periods.  I called customer service to determine if it was still safe to eat.  I was told that it probably was but just to be sure, they would ship me a new order by overnight delivery.  I hadn't asked for a replacement, so I really appreciated their generous offer.  Great customer service!!!!

review/summary: Great food - on a slow mule.
review/text: I love Swiss Colony foods.  Perhaps not as much as Hickory Farms, but their summer sausage is quite delectable.<br /><br />The shipping was listed as 3-5 business days all the way through checkout and should have arrived by Monday at the latest after I ordered it.  I got a message telling me not to expect it until Thursday of the following week!<br /><br />With such horrible planning on SC's part, I will either order before I need something a week or more in advance or just forget it.  It's more likely that I'm going to say forget it and go with another company after being burned twice by Swiss Colony's outmoded and unnecessarily expensive shipping standards.  3rd class mail?!  Horrible.  Wouldn't a well-known company have established a flat rate deal with their shippers?

review/summary: Slab of slimy fat
review/text: I ordered 1/2 slab dry cured smoked bacon. What I received was a vacuum packed slab of slimy fat that smelled a bit like rotten meat, not smoked bacon. I cooked a slice and it was nasty, didn't even smell like bacon. A complete waste of $50..

review/summary: Not genuine or Joyner
review/text: Ordered this product, and though I was led to believe (see photo) that this was a Joyner, salt-cured Smithfield slab bacon, it was not. The product delivered was Olde World Cure, and nothing like authentic Smithfield bacon. In fact, I could have purchased this taste for far less money at my local supermarket, where the other tasteless pork products reside.
