review/summary: Great cereal
review/text: We discovered this cereal a few years ago at Trader Joe's.  We love it as an "amendment" to granola or Great Grains cereals.  Put simply, a mixture of the two is better than either one alone.  Since we can't ever count on our local grocers to have Kashi Honey puffed Seven Grain Whole Grains & Sesame on hand when we run out, this Amazon subscription is a brilliant idea, and the price is competitive.  Thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: A Real Find...
review/text: Progresso Vegetable Classics Hearty Black Bean Soup is a real find - in more ways than one!  A favorite  of mine, I think Progresso Vegetable Classics Hearty Black Bean Soup is the best commercially produced, mass-marketed soup available.  It is a rich, hearty soup that is perfect for that cold winter evening meal.  The bacon-flavored base is more like a gravy and does not overpower the black bean taste.  The base is not thin and runny as are the broths on other canned soups.  The black beans are plentiful and are not cooked to a mushy consistency, but neither are they undercooked.  I like to serve Progresso Vegetable Classics Hearty Black Bean Soup with a dollop of sour cream or a sprinkling of cheese; sometimes I add some cracked pepper and minced onion.<br /><br />However, Progresso Vegetable Classics Hearty Black Bean Soup is very difficult to find.  The primary grocery chain in Texas stopped carrying this variety of Progresso soup several years ago.  Shipping costs kept me from having out-of-state friends send me cases of Progresso Vegetable Classics Hearty Black Bean Soup.  Unfortunately, this is not a grocery product that Amazon stocks or offers on the subscribe-and-save program, so I had to seek another source.  A careful internet search helped me find an online retailer who offered free shipping with a $39 order and an additional 15% off as a new customer.  As a result, my cost per can below $2. If you cannot obtain this soup locally, be sure to do an internet search for Progresso Vegetable Classics Hearty Black Bean Soup before you buy.  Prices vary widely.

review/text: If you can catch Mashups at a good price on S&S it tends to be a better deal and less hassle then say, buying them at a Babies R US or grocery store that happens to carry them.

review/summary: My 13 month old loves these
review/text: This is the perfect size for a toddler to have for a snack or as part of a meal.  My son is always on the go and these are great portable snacks.  He can carry it around and feed it to himself with very little mess.  It's also nice to keep in the car or diaper bag since they have a long shelf life and don't have to be refrigerated.  I like that they have 1g of fiber and are low in sugar.  They are mostly apple puree (that is the first ingredient), with a few other fruits and veggies mixed in. I think having more veggies and less apple would have earned it 5 stars for me.  These would be great for an older baby as well (9-12 months range).

review/summary: Another tetra-packed apple sauce product (that kids love!)
review/text: Lets be honest, I don't care about it being organic. Buy these things with subscribe and save through Amazon Mom (I am a dad, where is Amazon Dad, Amazon?). Anywho, all I care is that they don't pump these full of extra sugar/sweeteners which is not necessary since this stuff has naturally high levels of sugar anyway. I do like that it has veggies in it and carrot puree is on the ingredient list rather than just veggie juice. My daughter can down several packets in a row if I let her (18 months old). She loves this stuff regardless of the brand so we try to mix in the variety of ingredients where we can.

This stuff tasted terrible!!! I really thought it was bad, or tainted! So I had 3 others taste it, and with the same results! Immediately it went into the garbage! Maybe their other items taste ok, but the Cashew Butter, was just gross tasting! I recently went to Aruba and at a grocery store there purchased a jar of cashew butter, and it was fantastic!! Soooo I thought hmmm, why not buy some more on line... WHAT A MISTAKE! I should have just burned the 20.00!! Stay away from the cashew butter from this seller!!! YUCK!! No, DOUBLE YUCK!!

review/summary: A Sweet Mango Blast
review/text: I became somewhat addicted to Mango Madness at work. There was a coffee shop at my office that sold the delicious smoothie for $5.50 to $6.50 depending on the size. I'd get a smoothie at least twice a week. Luckily, one of the staff members told me which brand they used before the coffee shop moved.<br /><br />After searching the Internet I discovered the smoothie mix on Amazon and it happened to be a special item for that month. I ended up purchasing the Mango Madness, Peach Pizzazz, and Pineapple Coconut smoothie mixes and got $20 discount. The products are great and well worth the price even without the $20 discount. I spent more than the regular price in a month  just on smoothies from the coffee shop.<br /><br />The smoothies made with this mix have a bright mango flavor, and you can vary the amount of smoothie mix to change the sweetness. Best of all there's no high fructose corn syrup and it's loaded with vitamin C.  If you're like me and have smoothies often from a smoothie or coffee shop then the product pays for itself after using the first bottle which makes the two pack a great deal.

review/text: A number of years ago, I worked at a coffee shop that used these smoothie mixes, as many coffee shops do. I have to say they are amazing if made right and I got many compliments from my customers. Therefore, I was very excited to see them offered on Amazon.<br /><br />I found the ideal "recipe" to be 6 oz. of smoothie mix, 6 oz. of water, and 16 oz. of ice. And the biggest secret I learned is that making the smoothie with 6 oz. of orange juice in place of the water makes the smoothie 100 times better.

review/summary: Sickly sweet syrup; misrepresented ingredients/nutritional info
review/text: I took a risk and ordered the mango flavor, hoping that some of the reviews would be wrong and this product would be as described - that is, a relatively healthy smoothie mix.  Alas, that was not the case.<br /><br />This smoothie mix is basically sugar syrup with maybe (I'm still dubious on this one) a little bit of fruit mixed in.  The mango mix is BRIGHT orange and SICKLY sweet.  They WAY overdid it on the sugar.  I couldn't even finish the first smoothie I made because it was way too sweet.<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer noted (not sure which flavor was being reviewed then), the ingredients for the mango product are also not as listed in the nutritional info on the product page.  I think part of the problem is that the product picture (and probably also nutritional info) are actually for a different product, the MANGO GUAVA flavor.  I ordered and received the MANGO MADNESS product, with no guava listed in the ingredients.  But my main beef is the type and relative amount of sugar was misrepresented.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients and nutritional info from the product page:<br /><br />Ingredients: MANGO PUREE, BEET SUGAR, TEA INFUSION (FILTERED WATER, GREEN TEA), NATURAL MANGO AND GUAVA FLAVORS, VEGETABLE GUM, CITRIC ACID, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C) YELLOW 6, SODIUM BENZOATE (TO PRESERVE FRESHNESS).<br />Calories 110<br />Total Carbohydrate 28g (9%)<br />Sugars 27g<br /><br />And here is the info from the actual product label:<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, water, mango puree concentrate, malic acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), natural flavors, green tea powder, potassium sorbate (preservative), sodium benzoate (preservative), cellulose gum, yellow #5, and yellow #6<br />Calories 140<br />Total carbohydrate 36g<br />Sugars 35g<br />Also note that the nutritional info directly above is for 1/4 cup of smoothie base.  Of course, the directions on the side of the bottle instruct you to add 4oz of smoothie base to generate a 16oz serving.  So, you're really getting 54g of sugar in each smoothie.<br /><br />Wish I had received the product that was promised, it sounded like a great product. Instead, I'll be trying to return this if I can.  Very disappointed in this purchase.

Being sugar free was a good thing because kids already get too much sugar anyway. As soon as it arrived we all tried it and liked it very much. I bought some regular (non-sugar free) a few days ago and now that I have had that I can taste the difference, but only slightly. If you haven't had Hawaiian Punch in a long time or if your kid has never had it, they won't even know the difference with this one.

They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only "real" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.<br />****

That said, this pasta is as good as any other on the market, but you can make it wonderful just by adding two simple ingredients. After I take the pasta out of the pan to drain it, I add about a tablespoon of light margarine (any soft butter-type spread will work) and about 3 tablespoons of fat free sour cream (you may also use plain yogurt). I whisk the cheese powder into this mixture and then add the pasta back to the mix. My kids finish an entire box EVERY time. Try it!

review/text: My kids have always preferred Kraft Mac & Cheese. *I* did not prefer it's ingredients but I relented because they liked it. I took a chance and ordered this mac & cheese hoping they would like it. I have purchased other organics (like Annie's) which they hated so I wasn't holding out much hope. I made it in place of the Kraft for dinner one night and there wasn't even a comment made about the switch! They ate it up and wanted seconds! This is now a staple in my pantry and I feel better about serving mac & cheese twice a month or so since it's ingredients are organic. If your kids like Kraft but don't like Annie's, I encourage you to try Back to Nature

review/summary: Great way to feed kids lots of veggies
review/text: I like Back to Nature's mac and cheese a lot, my toddler do too. I do add my ingredients as well.<br />Here's what I do:<br />I cook pasta as directed, but on top of the pot with pasta I set a steamer basket with variety of frozen veggies, like mix of squash, cauliflower, green beans, carrots, corn, clove of garlic and either butternut squash or a winter pumpkin. By the time pasta is ready, veggies are nice and warm too. Then I cream all the veggies with some milk, cream and the cheese powder from the pouch. We never do anything low fat in our house, but if you do, you can use whatever you usually do. I add this sauce to the drained pasta, put it back on the burner just to warm it up again and add a good amount of a frozen carrot/sweet peas mixture. My kids finish their plates and ask for more. It's really good and you can never tell how much veggies are in there.

review/summary: Good, quick mac and cheese option
review/text: We purchased this mac and cheese because it was reviewed as the best in category from a magazine we receive. It is definitely better than many other organic boxed mac and cheese options out there. We purchased it online because it is currently not available at our local supermarket. While it was good, it saves a bit of money for us to catch a sale on the Annie's organic at our local store. I would buy this again, but it is not so good to make it the only organic boxed mac and cheese option in our pantry.

review/text: My husband and I are transitioning into organic.  This is our first try at substituting Velveeta Mac N Cheese - and what a success!  It takes more like Kraft, or like I say, how Granny used to make it (probably due to the butter).  If you follow the directions on the box you will have one delicious batch of Mac N Cheese, that is creamy and so tasty.  Bon appetit!

review/summary: If They're Your Only Choice...
review/text: ... jarred and vacuum-packed chestnuts may be close enough to the real thing to deceive your palate. The real thing is increasingly problematical in the USA, available only part of the year at best, often of poor quality, sometimes of such terrible quality that you'll give up on chestnuts forever. And of course, even if you can get good chestnuts, they are hard work to prepare in sufficient quantity for many recipes. This offering, by the way, is shockingly expensive; the same or similar imported jarred chestnuts are sold in my local markets in SF for half this price or less.<br /><br />One of my cage-mates in the amazoo requested this recipe:<br />Equal quantities of roasted chestnuts and fresh Brussels sprouts.<br />Roast and peel the chestnuts (or use these pale substitutes from the jar).<br />Steam the sprouts, but somewhat less than completely.<br />Braise the chestnuts and sprouts together in an ample amount of unsalted butter, with just a hint of garlic (not powder of course!), until the sprouts take a bit of brown color.<br />Serve hot.<br />Very well matched with a puree of potatoes and celery root, and roasted duck.

I ordered these for my mom, who has been a chestnut lover for a good portion of her 84 years on this planet, and she liked them very much, so I guess they must be okay.  Last year I purchased a different brand and these measured up.  So for you chestnut afficionados, it's a thumbs up.

I first bought these in 2009 and they were pretty good.  So just to make things easy I bought these again the next year and the quality was just not there;they were not at all fresh.<br /><br />So depending on the seller, it is hit or miss.

review/summary: Highly Addictive Cereal Is Fortunately Healthy As Well As Tasty
review/text: As a serial cereal eater, I have had my bouts of addiction throughout my life from Apple Jacks and Count Chocula during my early childhood through an extensive adolescence with Sugar-Frosted Flakes, a short-lived health-oriented period with Bran Flakes and of course, my self-deceptive dieting tactics using Special K. My latest has been Kashi's Heart to Heart, which I find flavorful and filling. There is a slightly sweet taste which has something to do with the light honey glaze on the Cheerio-looking rings, though the most pervasive flavor is a toasted oat. I don't find a need for sugar, but I do like to pile up blueberries if I have them in the fridge.<br /><br />I have to admit that I have used it as a dinner replacement on really lazy evenings. The best part is that the low-fat, low-sodium cereal is heart-friendly (thus the name) with one gram of soluble fiber per serving. The box claims 11 servings of 3/4 cup each, which for a cereal lover, is a stretch. I've been lucky to eke out eight bowls since I tend to overflow the bowl. Still, the calorie count is reasonable at 110 of which only 15 come from fat. For a price that is on par with local retailers, Amazon delivers the cereal in cases of six boxes, which I think is a reasonable medium-term amount.

review/summary: Heart to Heart Cereal- The Best Cereal Ive EVER Tasted!
review/text: Heart to Heart really is the best cereal Ive ever tasted. A couple of months ago my mom and I were shopping at Rite Aid buying toilet trees and then I came across this cereal, Heart to Heart. I looked at the back and found out that its low in calories. I had been trying to find a cereal that tasted delicious but is also low in calories and hadnt found one until I came across Heart to Heart Cereal. It also lowers cholestrol and it also lowers blood pressure. It doesnt have a bland taste like lots of low calorie cereals do; it has a honey flavor to it which is wonderful :) I eat Heart to Heart every morning, Ive lost a lot of weight (maybe because I start my day off eating Heart to Heart Cereal), and I totally recommend this cereal to anyone. You will LOVE it!

review/summary: Read the Ingredients before Believing the Health Claims
review/text: Sure, the first ingredient on this cereal is whole grain oats. That's good. But the second ingredient is sugar, and there's more nutritionally-devoid corn in this cereal than Kashi's signature 7-whole-grain blend. Also note that this corn is not GMO-free. I'm not saying this cereal is bad for you (although there is debate over the health effects of GMOs), it just contains more empty calories than you think.<br /><br />Side note: Kashi is owned by Kelloggs. It's not some small company devoted to creating wholistic, nutritious foods; it's a corporation that is interested in taking as full advantage of cheap, subsidized corn as it can without deterring health-conscious consumers.

My 5-year-old and I tried it. I was great! Nice crunch but not too hard. Terrific flavor with a hint of sweetness. We gobbled it right down and I had to promise my daughter that I would go out and buy more the next day. We end up eating it dry as a snack as much as a wet cereal. Another great point is the fact that there are no artificial colors in it, as my daughter is allergic to every artificial color and it is difficult to find satisfying treats. I highly recommend this cereal!

review/text: I'm a big fan of Kashi Heart to Heart.  Sure, it's not a cereal most kids will like, but I find it's great for someone who is working to eat healthy as an adult.  It may not be as good for you as oatmeal and fresh fruit, but it has to be better for you that a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit.<br /><br />I have a bowl of this cereal, or Kashi Heart to Heart Blueberry Flake and Cluster Oat Cereal, with Whole Foods 365 Unsweetened Almond Milk every day for breakfast.  If you must have a sweeter cereal, you can use the 365 Vanilla Almond Milk.<br /><br />Regarding value from the sellers on Amazon.com, I'm concerned by the e-mail Amazon sent me on 1/13/12 advertising a 6 pack of this cereal on "sale" for $42.79 ($7.13/box) from Bangalla Organic.  In June of 2011, I purchased a 6 pack from Amazon with Subscribe & Save for $17.91.  Really!  A single box sells for roughly $3.50 at Publix and Target.<br /><br />On a positive value note, Amazon has the Blueberry cereal right now for $15.84 / 6 pack with Subscribe & Save.  That's a great price.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a good cereal.  Just don't assume the advertised price on Amazon is good.  Do your homework.

review/text: Yep! I got hooked on Kashi. The first time I tried it I thought it was nasty. Hard, expensive, you name it, I thought it. However, I've been needing a food item to include in my daily diet to fill the sweet crunchy void so I gave Kashi another try. Lo! A free full size Kashi bar in the mail- the one with chocolate chips and it was excellent! And not made of excess garbage chemicals and unecessary sugars and fats that clog up your heart and brain. I went to the Kashi website and printed their coupons, bought some Heart to Heart cereal and- didn't like it. I thought "dog food, boring, etc., etc. But I ate it.I began to appreciate the quality of the product, the subtle not-too-sweet crispness of the cereal and now I eat it dry more often not. If you don't like one Kashi product, try others, you're bound to find something you'll enjoy. Kashi products are excellent products that are clean, healthful, and more apt to do your body good than many of the other sugary over processed products on the market now days.

review/summary: A Better Alternative To Cheerios
review/text: Kashi Heart to Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal could be described as Kashi's take on Cheerios.  However oats and shape are about all that they have in common.  The taste of the Kashi cereal is quite different, and one might even say that it is an acquired taste.  I'll admit it is not a flavor that I try to seek out in any other foods, but it is one that I find pleasing enough after having eaten it for years.  I will say that it tastes a lot better than regular Cheerios which taste like Styrofoam.  In addition to taste, Heart to Heart wins over Cheerios on ingredients too.  While Cheerios list "modified corn starch" as an ingredient, Kashi using nothing modified.  Kashi also uses evaporated can juice which I prefer over sugar.  Heart to Heart also has a couple of additional ingredients that claim to promote heart health:  grape seed extract and green and white tea extracts.  The USDA has not substantiated these claims yet so take that for what it's worth.  Overall, Kashi's Heart to Heart is the winner for me over Cheerios based on both taste and ingredients.

review/summary: Good source of fiber, protein and great with milk.  I love Kashi!
review/text: I really enjoy this cereal right out of the box as a healthier snack or with milk.  It is one of those cereals that passes the milk test with flying colors and will not wilt.  Expect a great, crunchy and nutritious cereal and snack.  It is filling and not overly sweetened.  Other people in my house thinks that the cereal borders on the bland side ... if you are accustomed to Lucky Charms, these definitely will.  But if you are trying to ease your palette into a healthier cereal that is not loaded with sugars, you will like this.<br /><br />I tend to lean towards Kashi products even though they can be more expensive.  I like the company philosophy and the ingredients.  Not a lot of empty stuff in their products.<br /><br />This is a great cereal to ease into as you move away from the surgary stuff.  I used to keep a box in my drawer at work to hold me throughout some of those long corporate days.  It works!<br /><br />5 Stars.

review/text: We love this cereal,it is a regular part of our breakfast routine - just add berries! However, if I watch local sales (Rite-Aid, Target, Walgreens) I can get this cereal for about $2.00 a box - which comes out to $12.00 for the six boxes as opposed to Amazon's $26.00. A huge difference for my budget!

review/summary: Great Nutrition, Highly Recommend
review/text: I have been eating the Kashi Heart to Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal for a few years now.  I first began eating it after being diagnosed with an Underactive Thyroid.  I especially like this cereal for the B-Vitamin content and its great taste.  Anyone suffering from Underactive Thyroid or Hypothyroidism usually have issues with energy and that's why this cereal is so helpful and nutritious.  I am currently attending college part-time online and eat this cereal whenever I need some extra energy or mental alertness.  When I'm not eating this specific Kashi cereal, I am usually eating the Kashi Go Lean, and others that I alternate with.  This cereal has a nice texture and a light honey flavor.  I particularly like that it's not real sweet tasting since there are so many cereals out there that contain just too much sugar.  I highly recommend this cereal as well as Kashi's other cereals.  You just know you are doing something positive for your body, mind, and spirit.  As always, Amazon's delivery and convenience is just great.  Amazon also offers very competive pricing since you save quite a bit by ordering this cereal in a bulk amount.  Great product and great service!!

review/text: I got a coupon for a free box and so I decided to try this (usually pretty expensive) cereal. The taste and mouth-feel are definitely better than most high-fiber rivals, but I have a really hard time getting over its appearance! I know that sounds silly, but I just cannot whet my appetite for a cereal that looks so much like dog food. If I ever got another coupon, and it took the price under $2, I would probably buy it again. If not, I will stick with cheaper, more attractive cereals.

review/summary: Way Better Than Cheerios
review/text: I share an apartment with two other college-aged guys.  Kashi is really expensive in the grocery stores nearby, so we get monthly subscribe-and-save deliveries of the following:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E05G">Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E074">Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E08S">Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal, Honey Almond Flax, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317EA46">Kashi GOLEAN Crisp! Toasted Berry Crumble, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E060">Kashi Heart To Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal, 12.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />We save quite a bit of money this way, and we always have a stock available.  I eat it for breakfast every morning and often for a snack as well - it really is tasty and filling, has lots of healthy protein and fiber, and doesn't leave you feeling sugar-shocked like kid's cereals overloaded with high fructose corn syrup and cane sugar.  I rotate between the five cereals listed above to keep things interesting.<br /><br />Kashi Heart-To-Heart is my choice when I'm not feeling quite up to the heavier multigrain GoLean cereals.  It's extra-tasty with dried, fresh, or frozen fruit, but I usually enjoy it plain with vanilla soymilk.  It's not quite as filling as the GoLean cereals, so I usually eat this one as a snack instead of breakfast.

review/summary: High fiber "O's".
review/text: At the time of writing the Amazon.com cost for this is $3.34 a box (or $20.09 for six boxes). As another reviewer noted, you can usually find this for around $2.50 at a Kroger's. I haven't seen it at sale prices in other grocers, but $3.34 per box is comparable to most of the prices I've seen when it wasn't on sale.<br /><br />My husband is picky with his cereals and he didn't have any complaints about the smell or flavor of this one. I enjoy this cereal, I think it is more flavorful than the brand name Cherrios, and I like that it is high in fiber. It isn't SWEETER than Cherrios, mind, but it does contain more flavors. If you like sweet cereals (puffs, loops, frosted etc.) this may taste more like grains than you could be used to.<br /><br />I recommend trying these out, keep in mind though that they don't really taste like Cherrios.

review/summary: Great taste and not overly sweet
review/text: Love the taste as I don't want a mouthful of sugar first thing in the morning. These are way better than the salty bland old Cheerios I used to eat. This cereal did not leave me feeling full as long as the Go Lean Crunch variety does, but it is much easier to chew. My main concern with many Kashi products is the high fiber content and how many times I will have to excuse myself... well I'm happy to report that this gives me about 1/5 as much flatulence as the Go Lean Crunch, and Go Lean Crunch is known for some serious flatulence. if you work in an office you are safe with this variety. As with all Kashi products my body just seems to work better when I eat this stuff. It also helps keep things regular in the ol' digestive system. I would give it 5 stars but I like a little bit of nutty taste in my cereals and when pouring it out of the bag I was reminded of processed pet food. The Go Lean crunch has me spoiled I suppose but it makes me poot way too much so for now heart to heart is my top pick.

review/text: I have to admit, I don't normally eat cereal for a normal meal. However, I'm trying to replace my bad snacks with good ones & cereal is one of those things that I do like to snack on. So yesterday when I was at the store, I decided to give this cereal a try. After all, my mom & several of my friends adore Kashi.<br /><br />Here's the pros & cons:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Tastes good, is healthy for me & has lots of fiber. There's a lot of nutrients in this & it is far better for me than if I were to eat sugary cereal or other bad snacks.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />The Kashi brand is expensive & forgive me... but this looks like something you'd feed to a dog or cat. Like another reviewer said, it looks like kibble.<br /><br />If you can get past the lackluster appearance, this really is a great cereal for everyday munching & for breakfast.

review/summary: My favorite cold cereal
review/text: Kashi's Heart to Heart is, by far, my favorite cold cereal.  The crunch and the fact that it stays crunchy in soy milk makes it perfect.  The honey flavor is very mild and the cereal has an almost maple taste to it.  And the cereal is made with whole grains.  How perfect is that?!<br /><br />One week, I ran out of the Heart to Heart and grabbed a box of Cheerios at Target.  It was such a disappointment.  It didn't stay crunchy and the flavor was just flat.  I  was grateful when my next Subscribe & Save shipment arrived.<br /><br />While the cereal is mighty tasty with milk, it also makes an excellent snack to eat out of hand.<br /><br />Update: This cereal is no longer available on Subscribe & Save.

review/summary: Best tasting HEALTHY cereal...
review/text: I have been eating continuously for over a year now and love it! I love the taste and I know what all of the ingredients are. Do yourself a favor and look at the ingredients of other "healthy" cereals from other brands like Kellogg's and General Mills. You will find out that there is a lot of junk in them or ingredients which you don't know what they are let alone be able to pronounce...imagine how your body reacts to it. This cereal has very low sodium too.

review/summary: My Absolute Favorite Cereal
review/text: This cereal is a daily part of my diet.  It tastes delicious and I love that it is low fat, low calorie and has low sugar! All the added antioxidants are great too.  I give the ingredient list an A+.  The only down side is the price here at Amazon.  I can get this same cereal at Wal-mart for $2.50 a box which is only $15 for 6.

review/text: My kids (ages 8 and 10) love these with milk and without. I like them,  though they can get a bit monotonous, but I am not a big cereal/carb lover. They are a much healthier and tasty alternative to cheerios.

review/summary: another kashi winner
review/text: great cereal.  my 18 month old daughter likes these everyday for breakfast or as a trail mix with raisins, cherries and/or m&m's .  its a shame that they don't sell them in a smaller quantity though, 6 boxes takes up an awful lot of storage space.

review/summary: Tasty, Crunchy & Healthy!
review/text: Kashi makes some of the tastiest, healthy cereals and their Heart to Heart is no exception.  Their O's are crispier & crunchier than the leading "O" cereal and have more of a lightly sweetened graham cracker taste. They stay nice and crunchy in milk/soy milk and also mix up great with nuts & raisins for a trail mix treat.<br /><br />I like to eat them with plain Silk soy milk which adds just a bit more sweetness.<br /><br />I love this stuff!

review/text: Great deal from Amazon, the entire family loves this cereal.  The kids really like the heart shapes.  Also great since it only has 5g sugar per serving, good fiber and protein levels too.

review/summary: Good Cereal and Good for You
review/text: Great price for 6 boxes, better than a grocery store (but not quite as good as Costco -- not that mine staocks it).<br /><br />I like Kashi Heart-to-Heart.  It tastes almost like Honey Nut Cheerios, but the texture is a bit strange.  To get used to it, I recommend mixing it with Honey Nut Cheerios.

review/summary: Healthy, but not tasty in the least
review/text: I have to admit that I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, but it's not an abnormal one.  I bought this cereal knowing it is healthy because I am trying to lose a few (read that as 10) pounds and be healthy about it so my husband and I can try to get pregnant (I'm over 35, so higher risk).  It has great nutritional value and I decided to try it instead of my "usual" Grape Nuts.  (Figured it would save my teeth.) :-)<br />It is not, not, not tasty.  It is very bland (which is OK, I guess) and mildly sweetened, but it tasts like I've decided to eat one of my dog's biscuits with a little honey.  It's fully edible, but it is not something I have to worry about anyone else eating because it isn't good.  It really doesn't taste good.  I read these other reviews that say it tastes great and wonder, "what do these people usually eat?!"  I would MUCH rather have my Grape Nuts or Shredded Wheat or some other granola/bran cereal.  I'll finish my box, but I will NOT be buying another.<br />Healthy?  VERY<br />Tasty? NO WAY<br />Sorry.

review/summary: Five stars... for my cat.
review/text: Something about the texture of this cereal... once it's in the milk, it quickly becomes so soggy and mushy that it feels and looks like cat food. it is also very lacking in taste- it's VERY slightly sweetened and lacks the toasted aroma of other "honey toasted' cereal.  Granted, this product is probably a lot healthier.  I wish I liked it since I bought the Costco pack... and I usually LOVE other the other Kashi products (go lean crunch, energy bars), but unfortunately this cereal is not one of their best.

review/summary: Worst cereal, ever!
review/text: After looking all over town for a good price on this, we finally found it in the natural section at Kroger on sale for $2.50. I cannot believe I paid that much for this junk! First off, it has absolutely no flavor and the texture/consistency/thickness reminds me of dog food kibble. I know its supposed to be a low sugar cereal, but it also has no flavor! It tastes like cardboard and I have to sprinkle sugar on top of it to tolerate it. I will never, ever make the mistake of buying this stuff again!

review/summary: no longer good. well, it's really bad.
review/text: I ordered one last month due to very high ratings and some old memories of mine that this cereal was healthy and tasted reasonably good.  Once I received the boxes, the first one had a very stale smell and taste. so does the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth.  the sixth one?  I haven't decided what to do, but i am sure the birds in my backyard would love them and would be able to handle the stale taste better than me.:-)  well, unless they also have a sensitive stomach like I do.:(
