review/summary: Love this item!
review/text: I wanted this for making seitan and for baking whole wheat bread.  I love that it's a large size and doesn't cost as much in bulk like this.  I have used it in experimenting with some new recipes and it is a great item.  I made a recipe for quinoa and red lentil cutlets.  They are a great vegan meat substitute and really deliciously reminiscent of a good sausage.  The gluten makes it seem very meaty!  Thanks for this!

review/summary: Good for vegans and bread making
review/text: I'm not a vegan and I'm not allergic to wheat gluten.  Nevertheless, I use this to make Seitan in many varieties.  Extracting wheat gluten from flour is very time consuming so this is a real time saver.  My favorites are Asian Seitans and faux pastrami.  You can also use it to fortify some breads.  If you don't know what wheat gluten is used for then don't buy it.

review/summary: Helps 'heavy flours' rise
review/text: Great for getting good rising action from rye and whole wheat flours, etc. Sounds like a 'too big' size, but if you bake often you know how expensive this stuff is in small supermarket sizes. Keep in fridge or freezer for long lasting freshness.

review/summary: Fantastic Results
review/text: For years I've used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDMLVS">Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten with Vitamin C</a> to amp up the gluten in my bread dough.  I love the stuff.  My loaves look and taste better with it.<br /><br />I get the same results with Honeyville Vital Wheat Gluten.  You'd be surprised how big the can is!  Don't be deceived by the price.  Hodgson Mill is actually cheaper per use, but at one tablespoon per loaf, it takes a long time to use it up.  If it expires, you've wasted money, and that isn't cheaper.  The instructions on the side of this can are a bit confusing to me because I don't have a kitchen scale.  I just use a scant quarter-cup.  I make my bread with whole wheat flour, so more gluten definitely improves the texture.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.  And when it's empty, you can play drums with the can.

review/summary: Amazing value.. great packaging and this product works :^)
review/text: Works in the sense that I use it to raise the gluten level of my loaves, making even lighter loaves than I did previously. I generally sub around 1 oz for 1 oz of whatever flour I am using in my bread machine. I also add around 1/2 gram Ascorbic Acid powder (Vitamin C) to my liquid as it feeds the yeast which develops the gluten for a more "professional" bake. I buy Ascorbic acid in large quantities anyway... NOW Foods.. because it goes into much of my preserving/juicing etc.<br /><br />I love the plastic lid that I simply use to reseal the container.<br /><br />Value for money? 3.5 lbs of this product for $12.95 is a steal.. I reckon that at three ounces per week, this should last me six months :^)

review/text: After using Bob's Red Mill brand from my local Whole Foods and Safeway (at $7 a 22 oz package), I was stoked to find this huge tub online at a better price. I'm a vegetarian and am constantly using vital wheat gluten to make seitan. As far as I can tell, this brand works the same as Bob's Red Mill, but has much smarter packaging (stays airtight, dry, and doesn't spill, unlike the competitor's non-resealable plastic bags). I also love making bread, and though I haven't had a chance yet to add this, I'm excited to see how it will enhance my results.

review/text: Wow, this thing really works to make my breads rise much better.  I think it even helps with shelf life of the bread.  The only "downside" is that this is really big!  It would probably be better for a small bakery than a home user like me, but at this price, who can resist?<br /><br />Definitely a good investment for anyone trying to improve the texture of their breads.

review/text: Use this product in my baking.  Decided to make my own bread, with no strange additives, and went for whole wheat, with several grains.  There was some difficulty with the rising, and discovered that gluten flour added to the loft.  Really hard to find, and comes in small amounts and expensive at the retail store.  Searched for another outlet, and have been very happy with this product.  It came in a sturdy, larger, easy to use container, shipped rapidly, arrived in very good shape. The flour has provided that extra bonus of better flavor and a lighter texture to my whole wheat baking.

review/text: I will be baking with this gluten for next 3 months MOL. No more problems finding gluten for mixed grain bread. Have you ever made attempt to make oats/flex see/ sesame/ whatever/whatever bread with no gluten? Did this result in a 3 inch thick tortilla for coons instead of bread loaf for people? Here is your answer - gluten. This one is at lowest price you can get and quality is superb. I am no longer buying those "5 grain Italian" bread loafs from the supermarket for 5 bucks a pop because I noticed they started to contain ingredients I cannot pronounce. LOL. I switched completely to home baked bread and it is tastier, better, cheaper and logical. Get this and get dry yeast. Look up some recipes from the Internet. Life is good and simple - so is the bread. You just need ingredients to prove the point. This is a major one.

review/text: This wheat gluten was processed on equipment that also processes peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, and soy.<br /><br />It would be really nice if Amazon required allergen statements on grocery items since its policy is that it does not allow returns on groceries.<br /><br />I don't really like hurting a product's ratings, but the vendor can certainly (and SHOULD) include this sort of critical information about the product's contents. All you have to do is upload a photo of the label.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you have severe food allergies to these substances, be forewarned. This isn't the product for you.

It is sold in Big K and other fine, upscale retail establishments. The 5 oz. bottle is easily transportable and can be pulled from your pocket when there is no seasoning for that hamburger on the grill. (Of course, make sure that the top is screwed on very tightly to the bottle when in your pocket).<br /><br />Please ingest responsibly and have a bowl of ice cream afterward.

review/text: After trying lots of different blends in K-Cups over the past couple of years, I've settled on a mix of Tully's French Roast and Newman's Extra Bold as my go-to choices for morning wake up coffees.  Both have a strong, deep flavor that pairs well with weekend waffles and other "sweet" goodies.  It's a shame that the price has gone up so much, but it's not the fault of the coffee.  I'll keep drinking this one -- it's one of my simple pleasures and still much more affordable than picking up a cup at the local espresso stand.

review/text: We normally get Deidrich's French Roast but it is no longer carried in "Subscribe and Save" so I thought a good alternative would be Tully's French Roast.  It's a wee bit stronger than the wife would ideally like, but it's O.K.  Personally, I like it!  (My real favourite is Tully's Italian Roast.)

review/text: I need to say I absolutely love my Kuerig brewing system. French Roast is one my favorite types of roast. I don't want to sound biased, but anyone who loves a strong aromatic coffee would love this kind. I would recommend it to the coffee enthusiast, but that's just me. This won't be so good for those who don't like a very strong, extra bold coffee. If you are one of those who doesn't like a coffee this strong...this isn't for you unfortunately.

review/summary: Great Tasting and affordable
review/text: Addicted to this brand and found this coffee fresh, bold and unbitter.<br />The delivery was super fast and my only complaint is it came in an unmarked box meaning I felt I had to count. But the count was right on & for the savings I'm not complaining so will order again. This coffee being bold but with no aftertaste is one I never tire of it. Everyone who tries this loves it. I find if I brew a small cup makes excellent iced coffee or warm latte. My coffee maker does have size options so considering cost of lattes my homemade version using liquid stevia/almond milk is money saving plus healthy. I have used both plain/flavored stevia and my coffee flavor stays true. All in all addicted and loving every cup.<br /><br />I am adding to review ordered a few days ago and a super charged delivery this was in original package this time and I am a very satisfied customer. Fresh cup in hand while I write this!

When I purchased a small box of this  extra bold coffee, he said it was the best coffee he has ever had...home or in a restaurant!  I purchased this larger box, and he said, "Why don't we put the Keurig in the kitchen, and put our 12 cup coffee maker away"!  He is now having less cups of coffee...enjoying it much more...and absolutely no waste!

review/summary: A non-guilty pleasure!
review/text: Upon running out of black tea at work I decided to pick up some Bigelow Vanilla Caramel, as it caught my interest for a while now and perhaps it made me think twice whether it was going to be sweet and cloying. To my surprise the brew turned out caramely and rich in color, with a delicious nutty and sophisticated aroma. I added milk and some sugar, and even though there was only fat free milk on hand, which I do not like much, the tea tasted luscious and delicious. It tastes like black tea with a nutty and caramel undertone with a hint of buttery vanilla bean and it makes me feel like I am eating a snack. Without milk it tastes less creamy and more natural if one prefers only subtle richness.<br /><br />This tea is absolutely divine and satisfying, and it really makes me love all kinds of vanilla tea, for they taste like dessert with no calories and with the healthy antioxidants found in tea leaves. Bigelow website also offers a wide range of recipes that can be made with their teas, and there are many mouth watering deserts and jellies I am willing to try and make at home. Upon visiting the website I also discovered that they make Eggnogg'n tea, something that really caught my interest and hopefully it might be similar to the Vanilla Caramel tea.<br /><br />Bigelow Vanilla Caramel can satisfy my sweet tooth without the calories and with its healthful properties its one of my favorites. I also love it before bed on the weekends, when I can relax and cozy out with a hot mug of rich, creamy tea.

It blends well with walnuts, adds a<br />unique flavor to beans, adds wonderful flavor to poultry, gives a nice<br />taste to  fish, gives an astringent edge to salads and vegetables, and is a great<br />tenderizer for lamb and pork.<br /><br />I like its flavor even just diluted with cold water as a drink or adding tart flavor to sorbets.

review/summary: Price Check???
review/text: I've been a happy buyer of this product for about a year now, and I love it.  I'm a student living in a dorm, so it's nice to have a little 10-ounce bottle on hand every once in a while.<br /><br />Just as a precaution to people, the default price that shows up, sold by BABYWUVINC, is a gigantic rip off.  The original price of this product was around $20, so it rounded out to about a dollar per juice bottle, plus shipping.  A little pricey, but I was happy with it.  But apparently as of this month (July 2012), the default page that pops up shows the price at $42.  Unreasonable much?  There's no way I'm paying $42 for a 24-pack of 10-ounce juice bottles, delicious Welch's grape juice aside.<br /><br />Make sure you hit the New From section and Amazon sells it for the original price (With Prime if you have Prime).  I almost missed that option and was about to go shopping the old-fashioned way, so just a heads up.<br /><br />Otherwise, as far as the actual product goes, it's perfect.  24 sounds like a lot, but they go fast.  The size is great for kids, adults, college students wanting to stock their mini-fridges, and it goes great next to a meal as a single serving.  Plus it's Welch's.  What grape juice is better than Welch's?

review/text: Just returned an unopened bag to local pet supplier who kindly took it back.<br /><br />A couple of our cats seem to like it at first, but soon lost interest in it for some odd reason. I did keep it airtight as suggested by the pet store.<br /><br />I've since switched to dry cat food that contains no fruits,  vegetables, corn, wheat, or soy & all 5 cats are happy as all get out. My new consultant is a homeopath for small animals and she said to avoid all canned cat food, and all but 3 dry cat foods, as all contain ingredients which are toxic to most cats, and especially those with immune-compromised systems. (avoid fruits/veggies/herbs in particular)<br /><br />And why the  acidolphilus?<br /><br />Bottom line: the cats didn't like it and too expensive to keep throwing uneaten bowlfuls of it out.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious!
review/text: After receiving a gift of delicious blueberry preserves from a speciality store, I set out to find something similar in my local supermarket; in particular, I was looking for a product made from wild blueberries.  Bonne Maman's Wild Blueberry Perserves turned out to be exactly what I wanted!  It's a very sweet jam that includes whole wild blueberries (which are smaller than regular blueberries) in every spoonful.  The preserves are easily spreadable and are great on toast, but I've also found that they are wonderful for adding to plain yogurt or smoothies.  A delicious must-have for blueberry lovers!

review/summary: Serendipity in Chamonix!  Bonne Maman Wild Blueberry Preserves
review/text: Having breakfast at a five-star hotel in Chamonix, France, I discovered the most delicious preserves I ever tasted.  Gorging on croissants and wild blueberry (or in French, myrtille) preserves, I watched the hotel staff person refill the  crystal serving bowl on the buffet table and noted the name on the label of the container he was dishing out the preserves from--it was Bonne Maman. I bought some jars of Bonne Maman at a grocery in Paris to take home. Back in the States, much to my delight I found them in my neighborhood supermarket.

review/summary: This is the ONLY canned cat food my picky Ragdoll cat will eat!
review/text: In the effort to include more H2O into my cats' diet's I, the mostly educated pet owner, started buying canned food. First try was Wellness canned food. Two of my cats dived right in enthusiastically, the third, my picky Ragdoll cat, Phoebe, sniffed and snubbed my offering immediately. I then proceeded to try many different canned food varieties, even resorting to yucky Fancy feast, which I thought any cat would love. But low and behold, she is the most stubborn finicky cat I have come across in all my years of cat ownership! I know I probably made it worse by offering her so many choices for her to turn her pretty little nose up at!<br /><br />I think it became a bit of a game to frustrate "mommy" to death with the endless food purchases. Luckily, I have a cat whom I affectionately like to call "the garbage disposal" b/c he will literally eat anything and everything (which is really lucky b/c he has IBD and has no choice but to eat a grain free canned diet now)so nothing really went to waste. That's what happens when you live on the streets and fend for yourself versus being born in a breeder's house and having a silver spoon in your mouth like Phoebe was. She's an ungrateful brat! She's also a kitty kibble addict to her very core! I at least was able to get her to eat a grain free dry cat food, which although not ideal, is better than her going without food for more than a couple of days (I know that this can be dangerous and that's why I finally caved on the dry food issue with her).<br /><br />As a last ditch effort I decided to try the L.I.D. diets from Natural Balance. What could it hurt? At least is was readily available from my local pet store as opposed to some of the brands I tried only available online. She continued to turn her nose up at them all EXCEPT the Venison and Green Pea canned food. EUREKA!!! She amazingly LOVES this cat food. I thought that would never happen.<br /><br />It's been a year and she still will only eat this canned food. I'll occasionally throw her a curveball and try and sneak in some other flavor and sometimes she'll even start to eat it, but quickly gives me the evil eye and walks away, so I now only give her the Venison and she still loves me (mostly:). Sometimes for variety and even more water intake, I'll put the canned food into my little Magic Bullet blender w/ water and blend it into something like a kitty smoothie. She really goes gaga for that and will lap up the whole bowl instead of leaving some behind, so I do that as often as I have time. On a sidenote, my other cat (the non-garbage disposal:) who is a little something of picky eater sometimes too (although not nearly in the league of my ultimate picky eater) really, really loves the Natural Balance L.I.D. Duck and Green Pea, more so than any other canned cat food. He will eat most chicken based cat foods, but will leave a lot behind. But if I give him the Duck and Green pea he'll eat it all.<br /><br />Whew! Sorry to be so long winded, but this cat has put me through the wringer and I just had to share my trials and tribulations before my discovery of the Venison and Green Pea "magic" kitty food!

review/summary: Okay food, inadequate quality control.
review/text: Natural Balance needs to improve their quality control! A few months ago I opened a can of the Venison & Green Pea canned food and found a piece of flexible plastic cooked into their food. Needless to say I was surprised and notified the manufacturer immediately and sent the can back to them (at their request); they assured me that they have the highest standard of quality control and that this would not happen again. I was given a replacement can as well as coupons and an apology for the incident. I continued to feed them the canned Vension & Green Pea, but lo and behold, a few months later and we're experiencing the same thing! This time there was a big piece of green plastic in the canned food. I will be notifying the manufacturer again and sending the can back to them as before (hopefully they can test to see exactly what happened), and I will no longer be using this product.

review/summary: Natural Balance Venison and Green Pea gets two paws up!
review/text: Natural Balance Venison and Green Pea is a favorite in our house.  My cats LOVE the taste and I love that it doesn't have any by-products or fillers like corn, wheat or soy.  My guys eat this food as part of their regular rotation.  They have shiny, silky coats and they hardly shed at all.  The litter box is easy to clean, even with 2 cats.  I thought at first that this food was really expensive, but considering that I only have to feed 1/2 as much as the "grocery store brands" to get the same amount of nutrition, it all evens out in the end.  And I also can't put a price on the health of the animals I chose to care for.  They also love the other Natural Balance canned flavors, as well as the Natural Balance Ultra dry kibble.

review/summary: Great food for a picky eater or those with digestive issues!
review/text: Our Himalayan cat is an extremely picky eater.  To add to this she has intestinal trouble with many foods (diarrhea, vomiting).  We only feed her quality foods with no grains or fillers, and this narrows our selection down quite a bit, knocking out most grocery store brands.<br /><br />We initially tried Wellness and apparently it was too rich for her with all the additional unnecessary ingredients (squash, zucchini etc?)  Then we tried the Natural Balance DUCK and pea, and she hated the taste and texture, which was extremely mushy.  We then put her on this Venison flavor, and she absolutely loves it and the more meaty texture.  She is enthusiastic every time she eats.  She loves the dry as well.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this food to anyone, especially those who have a cat with a sensitive digestive system.  Not only is it a healthy grain free, artificial/dye free food, but it is also a limited ingredient food, meaning pets with food allergies or bowel problems are more likely to tolerate it.  And it's very reasonably priced!

review/summary: Counterfeit? Or lousy quality control?
review/text: I also have had inconsistent results with this product. In addition, the labels on the cans aren't always the same--one indeed looks completely fraudulent. Another is dimmer and the contents were a slick, pasty substance that looked cheap and SIGNIFICANTLY different from cans that have more legitimate looking labels (they look brighter, crisper as if done on a proper printer, not some fly-by-night).<br /><br />So either they get their stuff from different suppliers with haphazard quality control in some cases or, as with SO many other products from drugs to DVDs, someone is canning some [...]crap and passing it off as Natural Balance. In any event, I'm disappointed, disgusted and dissatisfied with the company's response and apparent indifference to the issue.

review/summary: So bad, my cat pooped in her food dish after being served this!
review/text: I fed my cat, for the first time, a can of Natural Balance Venison and Green Pea wet food. First thing I noticed was she didn't eat it as quickly or enthusiastically as other wet foods. This morning I woke up to find that she pooped in her food dish! LOL, "Message received!", I thought to myself. Seriously, she has never done this before and has been mad at me all day.<br /><br />I don't think she's ever met a wet food she hasn't liked until this. I'm taking the rest back and will never purchase this brand again. What a shame, their website really got me to believe it was tasty, healthy food. After doing some research, found there are mentions on the web about 2 recalls recently involving Natural Balance and many others with similar complaints about cats not liking the taste.<br /><br />One review I read elsewhere summed it up perfectly, "Even if this food is actually healthy, what's the point in serving it if my cat won't eat it?".

review/summary: A so-so hot sauce
review/text: For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Cholula Chili Lime Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I consider to be disappointing.  As far as I remember, I tried a bottle or two of this product in the past, but I do not remember having a favorable impression of it.  I decided to give this hot sauce another chance, but my opinion of it has not changed.  The heat is not a problem--neither is it too hot nor too mild.  But the flavor is bland.  The only things that stand out about this hot sauce are its tanginess and heat.  The bottle's wooden top is a nice touch, though.  Actually, I rate this hot sauce 2.5 stars.

I can across one where the filling was purple, I had already bit into it and there were little seeds, like maybe blue berry or grape? The fillings taste worse than the cheapest kind of jelly beans. There are no normal candies in these assorted sets.

review/summary: Makes great coating for chicken or fish when mixed with breadcrumbs!
review/text: I have been using Bob's red mill unsweetened coconut for about 2 years now and it's great.  My favorite use for it is as part oif a coating for chicken or fish.  You just toast the coconut in a nonstick pan until nice and deeply browned and then mix it half and half with Panko crumbs or regular breadcrumbs.  Dredge your chicken pieces in flour, dip in egg and then coat with the coconut & breadcrumbs.  I bake mine in the oven but you can also deep fry. This coating is also excellent for shrimp or scallops.  Since it's unsweetened, you can use it in carribbean stews or any other savory dish.  For baked goods it's especially helpful in controlling the amount of sugar in the final product.  Coconut doesn't really need to be sweetened when it's added to other sweet ingredients.  For example, those 7 layer dream bars with chcolocate and butterscotch chips as well as sweetened condensed milk don't really need sweetened coconut now do they?  I also add this coconut to banana nut breads, chocolate brownies and icings for cakes.  If you are making a regular white cake with coconut icing, you can punch up the coconut quotient by trhwoing in a half cup or so into the mix and then some more into the custard filling and get triple coconut cake!  Yum.  It's not hard to toast this coconut  but be aware that once it starts browning, it browns VERY fast and will continue browning even after you remove it from the heat. Once you have bought this and used it, you'll find a hundred other uses for it.  try the coconut encrusted chicken for something different!

review/summary: Better than I expected
review/text: I like coconut - pretty much in/on anything and everything. I took a chance on this because of the value and while it is flavorful, either I didn't realize/see, or the description of the product failed to mention (not sure which it is), this coconut is NOT long, narrow, shredded texture, which is what I expected. This is tiny granules - more like sugar crystals. Even raw sugar granules are larger than these coconut mm's. It doesn't affect the flavor or any recipes (so far). It is just messy working with it as it is more like a fine powder that just gets everywhere when spilled. While I wouldn't buy it again, that decision is based on my preference for shredded coconut; not this price, the flavor, or even the packaging all of which was great.

We freeze ours, vacuum sealing all but the bag we're currently using, and we never have to endure stale, tasteless coconut, even a year or more later. Frozen coconut works just great in ALL recipies, too, no need to thaw! Compare this coconut to that yucky American favorite called "angel flake" coconut which is LOADED with sugar, salt, preservatives, and WATER! You gotta order some of this!

review/text: I was looking for plain shredded coconut, not the highly sweetened stuff you buy in grocery stores, and this is perfect. One thing that I couldn't really tell from the descriptions and pictures is this stuff is pretty finely shredded -- think very small grains of rice. That's OK with me since I didn't really have a texture preference, but I think "flaked" coconut is a little closer to what I had in mind when I bought this? That doesn't really change anything about my impression of the product, just something to be aware of. All in all I really like this stuff, I even enjoy it plain (no extra sugar) when I add a little warm milk or water.

We are doing low carb and this coconut product is very versatile for so many recipes. it's about rice-sized.<br /><br />If you want coconut flour just run this through your food processor or coffee grinder (not one you make coffee beans in) and you have instant flour for thickening or coating or recipes.<br /><br />I recently discovered this coconut product is ideal to make coconut shrimp! Just use this instead of flour in your egg/flour wash before you fry your shrimp. Watch carefully as it browns in a hurry! Pulse some coconut with some peanut flour (Protein Plus or PB2) and use that as your dredge, it makes THE crispiest, sweetest coating!<br /><br />It goes from brown to burned in seconds so keep the heat low and slow. Stir a lot.<br />If you have liquid Splenda you can make a mock Angel Flake coconut with it! (I prefer Ideal sweetener but you have to make a simple syrup with it and water to get the same effect)<br />Love this product, I've tried a lot of crappy coconut over the years and as long as this is fresh when you get it, you can't get anything better!

review/text: Good freshness.  As it is a dessicated coconut, it is very dry (to be expected).  Good white color.

review/summary: just what i was looking for
review/text: I am so pleased with this purchase.  I had bought 2 ounces of Med. shredded coconut from Whole Foods and paid a much higher price.  This coconut is not as sweet as the one from whole foods but is just as delicious and so much less expensive.  I have made the recipe on the side of the package for chocolate macaroon cookies, simple and delicious.  i use Stevia powder instead of white sugar that is calls for and they are delicious if not better.  better for you for sure.  i also made chocolate macarooms with dried cherries, again delicious.  i also eat this shredded coconut by itself, great snack, low is carbs and good for you.  love love it!  and for this price you get 4 packs of it!  each 24oz.  if you do the math in what i paid for at whole foods for 2 ounces 3.99, you will figure how much you save.  store it in the frig. for longer life.  if you do not use that much, give it away as a gift.

review/summary: Taste I'd forgotten!
review/text: It's been decades of ordinary grocery-store coconut for me, so I'd forgotten how good coconut meat can taste, and how naturally sweet!  It's become increasingly difficult to stick to recipe amounts, so great is the temptation to add just a tad more of this coconut to cakes, icings, cookies, cheesecakes, etc.  Well-wrapped in the freezer, it has stored very well, retaining its moisture and flavor over several weeks.  I too was initially surprised at the small size, but the flakes are tasty enough to make size virtually irrelevant.  (P.S.:  I've yet to be disappointed by any of the several products I've bought from Bob's Red Mill, remarkable given the excellent price values -- admittedly a purely subjective opinion from this old Southern cook.)
