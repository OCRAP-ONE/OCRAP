review/summary: Excellent Jasmine Green Tea
review/text: I love the scent and flavor of this tea.  I have moved away from a city where my favorite tea shop sold only natural, hand-blended teas; their version of jasmine green contained dried jasmine petals and was a little more fragrant. What I appreciated about that blend was the subtlety of the green tea and that the jasmine was "front & center" in both flavor and aroma.  Tea Nation's version is the closest I've found so far.

review/text: I am a huge fan of Jasmine Green tea but this one is just plain awful. it tastes like if they would have just spilled a bottle of cheap women's perfume all over the green tea bags. the smell is totally artificial and so is the taste. would not recommend to anyone unless you like the idea of drinking perfume!!

review/summary: Good if you need gluten-free
review/text: While on a wheat-free trial diet for a month, I needed wheat pasta substitutes, and one kind of pasta I tried was this one from De Boles.<br /><br />This is my favorite shape of pasta.  This variety cooks up pretty fast, 5-7 minutes and it's great.  Because of the starch in the rice, it will boil over fast if you don't watch it!  You also need to rinse it with cold water after draining.  When this is done, it does not stick or clump up together.  It also doesn't turn hard or gummy.<br /><br />It does taste different than standard wheat pasta.  It has a brown rice flavor, and while it's not my favorite flavor in the world, it's tolerable.  I don't plan to buy this now that I'm back on wheat, but if you cannot have wheat or gluten, then it's a decent pasta.<br /><br />We had this brown rice pasta for mac -n cheese and for tuna noodle casserole.  In both you could taste the noodles' brown rice flavor, but the other flavors overpowered enough to compensate and the pasta didn't ruin the meal.<br /><br />Kids may find it disgusting, depending on how picky they are.<br /><br />I did not try this pasta with cold pasta salad, but it may not be half bad.

review/summary: The dogs love em
review/text: I have two dogs, a basset and a corgi, and they are total chewers. If they don't have something to chew on then they're running around the house like little mini-tornadoes. They don't like rawhide chips, get bored of unflavored bones, and are only occupied for ten to fifteen minutes with all other forms of chew toys.  Keeping them in flavored rawhide gets expensive.  These things are a great deal.  Big bones, flavors that make my dogs happy, and way less expensive than anything I could get at the local pet store.

review/summary: Great variety at a good price
review/text: I ordered the small-sized bones for my miniature schnauzer.  He's not a big fan of the natural rawhide bones, so I decided to order a flavored variety pack.  What a success!  According to the package the flavors are hickory, beef, and chicken, and it comes with a mix of twelve bones and rolled rawhide.  The price isn't much better than a local pet store, but I would buy these bones again.<br /><br />Also, if you are concerned with the country of origin, these bones were made in Brazil.

review/text: These treats made my dog seriously ill with kidney failure.  We had been feeding our dogs these treats for months, then suddenly both our dogs became ill.  We almost lost our smaller dog, a Cavalier King Charles.  While the FDA is still investigating, these treats continue to be sold.  In our small town there were four cases diagnosed within one week, and our newspaper, the Longmont Times Call, ran a front page story on it.  Since then I've been contacted by people from across the US who have been affected, and we have created a web site dedicated to this issue: [...]

review/summary: Jerky Chicken
review/text: All of my dogs LOVE this product, however, with the recent recall and problems that have occurred with this product and others just like it (different brand names) I am sorry to say that my dogs started to get sick when they would eat these. I contacted my vet who insisted that<br />I stop giving my dogs these treats immediately. She stated that these, and others, were on a recall due to a chemical that was used in China.  Yes, these are made in China and I did not know this until I received the product and after the vet brought it to my attention. If you can find this type of product, but NOT made in China, then it should be okay to give to you dog.  I am still looking for one that is not made in China, because my dogs truly did love this product to have as a treat.  Contact your vet before giving your dog any kind of treat like this.  I am now giving my dogs a jerkey duck treat, and so far so good.  None of them have gotten sick.  I am sadden by all of the problems we are having with our dog food and dog treats coming from China.  Now, when I shop, I DO NOT purchase anything made in China, only made in the USA.

review/summary: Made in China
review/text: My vet has my dog on a very limited source of low fat treats due to her impaired fat metabolism.  She suggested chicken jerky, but specifically said to avoid those made in China due to all the contimination problems they've had.<br /><br />I searched here on Amazon for "chicken jerky" and one of the suggested searches that popped up was "chicken jerky dog treats made in usa." Great! I used that search and this was listed at #8 on the list. Nowhere in the product description did it say it wasn't made here.  I ordered it and was unpleasantly surprised to find "made in China" on the label, when it arrived.<br /><br />The FDA has several warnings out on dog chicken jerky treats made in China.  The latest ones were Nov. and Dec., so it's an ongoing  problem.  I never even opened the jar, as I didn't want to harm my dog.<br /><br />Had the country of origen been in the product description, I never would have ordered these.

review/summary: Good product, but made in china so there are risks
review/text: As far as I can tell, these chicken jerky strips are a good, natural product.  Even so, they do say clearly on the label that these are made in China, making them somewhat risky (because of the quiet jerky-poisoning cases of 2007).  Another concern - between Dec. 2008 and Feb. 2009, the costs of these went from about 11.00 to about 16.75 on amazon.  At that price, it becomes both safer and more cost effective to just make jerky yourself from USDA grade chicken!

I just wanted you to know that if your dog starts to vomit or not feel right, STOP FEEDING THE TREATS TO HIM.  Bag says PRODUCT OF CHINA.  And is one of the recalled items from PetSmart where I bought them.  Listen to your instincts and stop feeding him the treats at any sign of illness.

review/text: After reading the reviews, I searched the web and found info regarding this product.  I had been feeding my dogs this treat once in awhile.  After reading the very negative info on the Vet Medicine sites and several recall sites,  I chose to throw these away.<br /><br />Sadly, on Thursday, while I was out, one of my dogs, Kio, broke through the barrier where the trash was waiting for pick up and got into the bags.  He ate several pieces of these strips at one sitting.<br /><br />Today, Monday, he went to the vet with acute kidney failure.  He will die.<br /><br />DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE YOU FEED THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />I didn't and now my Kio will pay the horrible price.  Like the other poison food, it's made in China..even though it gives the impression it's American.<br /><br />Several stores have pulled this product and refuse to sell it.<br /><br />I THINK AMAZON SHOULD DO THE SAME THING.<br /><br />Amazon has a responsibility that includes not selling foods that kill our beloved pets...I know it's a money maker for them, but there's evidence that it might be a killer.  And it should NOT BE SOLD until the final verdict is is.

review/text: When I searched in Amazon for "chicken jerky treats made in USA" this product was listed. No where in the product discription did it mention the country of origin. I purchased this product in a smaller size from a local retailer and the package said "MADE IN USA" so I naturally assumed that the 20 ounce tub would be the same. What a surprize. When the package arrived I opened it and gave a piece to my dog, then I noticed that the label said "PRODUCT OF CHINA"! I cannot give this to my dog as it causes severe symptoms.<br />Either Amazon is misrepresenting the product as Made in USA or the manufacturer is. In either case, I have learned my lesson, NEVER BUY DOG TREATS FROM AMAZON.

review/text: My yorkie almost died!  He has eaten ONLY organic food his entire life.  I purchase a bag of these (the only store bought food or treat he has ever eaten) and within weeks he became lethargic and refused food of any kind.  He was admmitted to the hospital Nov 2007 for 6 days and was administered IV fluids to prevent his death from<br />*****************Acute Renal Failure*********************************<br />These treat causes kidney failure which can be deadly and there is no medication available to prevent,minimize or repair the damage. The damage is IRREVERSABLE!!!!!! My dog is now damaged for life!!!! If you love your pet DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! The FDA has received over 100 complaints and UC Davis is following over 40 cases....how many have dogs have to die before big corporations stop allowing this toxic stuff from China to be sold in their stores AND stop allowing very deceptive labeling practices that trick consumers into thinking the product is safe and made in the USA?????????????? Save yourself the heartache DON"T BUY THIS IT"S DEADLY!

review/summary: Cats loved it!
review/text: I gave them 1/4 of a can at first of the venison brand to each of my 2 cats(bought a can of each flavor to test first).  They polished it off like they were starving, and then continued to nag me until I gave them the rest of the can! (believe me having a cat constantly meowing in your face can be pretty annoying, LOL).  They didn't show such gusto with Proplan canned.  I like that it doesn't have corn or wheat gluten which is hard to find with the regular foods on the market.  Also, one of my cats has IBS and has trouble with some foods irritating his stomach, he had no trouble with this.  My cats give it 4 paws up each!

This one is very fine, she likes the taste, and vomits less frequently.  I also feed her the Natural Balance Chicken and Liver Pate.

review/summary: Top Choice for Cats with DIGESTIVE ALLERGIES
review/text: Okay, I'll be blunt: Diarrhea. We bought 2 Siberian pure bred litter mates & brought them home to comfort me when our very old Maine Coons died. One of them can eat anything and is not particularly  picky. The other cannot ingest gluten of any kind and there is SO MUCH STUFF in a single can of cat food. I worked with these boys for months and couldn't solve poor Merlin's problem. I was at my wit's end, even yelled at my husband to take them back to the breeder because I so exhausted by this horrendous problem. One afternoon on a trip to Petco, a young man who was working in the store came up and started talking with me. Turns out, he used to manage the big cats diets at our local zoo until the budget cuts took his job, so he knew quite a lot about Dick Van Patten's line. He also happened to have a house cat with the same problem as Merlin.<br /><br />He advised me to buy the DVP Ultra Formula (NOT ultra PREMIUM formula) and feed only this food! I did, and our problem was solved! Poor Merlin cannot have table scraps or vitamin treats or any other canned food because his problem returns right away (and its compounded many times over by his long haired triple fur coat and his massive size). He does get DVP Limited Ingredient Diet dry food in rotation with his canned breakfast, but that is it for him. He and I are extremely happy together. He's a Romeo, for sure. I often think of that kind young man and the note about "angels unawares" and I give thanks for that most helpful moment.<br /><br />If your cat has tummy trouble, you need this food and a SpotBot. Thank you, Amazon, for bringing this product to my door! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y3AA2S">BISSELL Spotbot Pet Handsfree Spot and Stain Cleaner with Deep Reach Technology, 33N8A</a>

review/summary: Great Cat Food
review/text: I have been using this cat food for about a month and I have purchased 3 flavors. Now, I'm not a cat, and I've never eaten it, but both my cats eat it right up. I have a 14 year-old cat with tiny kidneys, who was an outdoor cat until July, when I took her to the vet, and he gave her a 25% chance of still being alive in 2 years. He told me that I need to get her on good, wet cat food. So I bought this, after doing a lot of research. Since purchasing this, she seems to have filled back out (she's very tiny, maybe 4 pounds). She is also peeing a bit less, which is also a good sign that her overall urinary tract is working better.<br /><br />Another good sign for this food comes from my younger cat who is almost 2. I am feeding this to her, as well, and her solid waste has become much less stinky! She has had a VERY stinky litter box from the moment I got her. I've tried different foods (even mixing in some pumpkin, per a vet)to no avail, but since giving her this, her smell is not as strong.<br /><br />So, this is a little bit pricey compared to some foods, but well worth it for the health of my cats, and the sanity of my nose :)

review/summary: Kitty loves it!
review/text: Hermes grew up on Fancy Feast, and he seemed to like it depending on how hungry he was. He only ate a few flavors, seemed to get tired of it quickly, and almost never finished off his potions entirely. Plus he had a problem with frequently throwing it all up. On my hunt for something healthier and more stomach-friendly I came across the recommendation for Natural Balance on About.com and gave it a try. HE LOVES IT! It's always completely gone within a couple hours and his stomach problems have seemed to settle considerably. And I love that it's so much more healthy than the dirty scraps and chemicals and sawdust found in many cat foods. It's definitely worth it.

review/summary: The finicky cat's cat food.
review/text: I bought Natural Balance canned cat food on the recommendation of my sister.  She feeds her cats the limited ingredient Natural Balance.  Well this stuff is great! I bought the Ultra Formula product and I have never looked back.  My youngest cat is almost two and my oldest is seven.  They have never, ever eaten any type of canned food without rejecting it after a while.  They ate little bits of other types but, either right away or shortly after, stopped eating it.  This was true even of other premium brands. Natural Balance canned food is the answer.  They gobble it up and have not grown tired of it.  They have shinier coats and you can tell the difference in their muscle structure.  Good stuff!!!

review/summary: Great product and service
review/text: During my trips to Italy, it became a habit of mine to enjoy this tea every afternoon due to its wonderful balance of flavors - tea, peach and sweetness. Its quality reminds me of the difference between ice cream and gelato. In other words, the difference between something good and something great. When I ordered this tea, I was not sure if the plastic bottles and shipment from Italy would cause the taste to change, but it was exactly as I remembered it.  From now on, I expect I will be enjoying this tea for summers to come, whether in Italy or at home.<br /><br />To be sure, this tea is not cheap, especially when you include the shipping. However, it is much better than other peach teas you can get locally and if you compare its price per liter to wine, the price is quite reasonable.<br /><br />I should also note that the delivery service was great. I ordered the tea on a Saturday morning, it was shipped a couple hours later by MondoFood and arrived on my doorstep on Monday afternoon. I do not know if this is typical for the standard shipping, but I was impressed.

Anyway, it's a fantastic tea with great flavor and I couldn't recommend it more.

review/text: I saw this product on Food Network's new show invention hunter. It is very cool..<br /><br />I read a several news reporting that people are sick because of drinking from contamainated soda cans. Drinking duck is very easy to use and it acts as a protective layer prevents my lips from directly contact the soda can. It makes me more comfortable to drink beverage from the can now. It seems made of silicone, which provides a nice touch to the lips. I don't taste the metal taste from the can or the freeze anymore. It is a very cool gadget. I use it at my party. All my friends can identify their own can, so they don't pop a new one before they finish theirs, so it prevents a lot of unnecessary waste of unfinished beverages. It's a good substitute for staws. Kids like the ducky anyways..

review/text: When I ordered I did not know what Western Cut was so it was surprised how thin they cut the meat.  The pack had about a year until the sell by date, which seemed like plenty of time to eat the jerky.  However, I would only need 24 hours as the jerky got better with every bite.<br /><br />A+.  I could not recommend this product any higher.  Lightning speed delivery service.  I've tried country cut HoneyPepper as well as the Teriyaki and they also were just fantastic.  The country cut is much softer than the western cut.  The western cut requires some good chompers to chew.<br /><br />The only draw back would be if you did not have tooth picks or dental floss available after eating the western cut.

But you'll be sorry if you order graham crackers -- or any other food that can be damaged in shipping -- from Amazon.<br /><br />Our recent order arrived in the original box from the factory, containing 12 boxes of New Morning Honey Grahams. That was it. No packing material. Nothing to shield the crackers from the drops and shocks of being shipped to us.<br /><br />So we didn't get graham crackers. We got graham crumbs, and a few graham cracker fragments.<br /><br />By all means, order these crackers. Just don't order them from Amazon. Instead, find a retailer that knows how to do it right, or buy them from your local grocery. Unless you really want graham cracker crumbs...

review/summary: good but broken
review/text: I am always on the lookout for products that do not contain hydrogenated oils, so I was pleased to find these on Amazon grocery, and at such a reasonable price.  The grahams are a little on the sweet side, but again I'll take that over unhealthy hydrogenation.  I was mostly disappointed in the fact that most , if not all, of the crackers are broken.  I suppose that's a result of the shipping so it's enough to make me not purchase them this way again.  I'll buy them at the store next time instead (if I can find them).

review/summary: Best Graham Crackers ever!
review/text: I had been looking for graham crackers without hydrogenated oils and no high fructose corn syrup.  These are the best!  Great value buying them this way, it saves over $2 per carton from the local stores.  The taste and texture is great!  Will buy them many times more!

review/summary: tasty & soy free
review/text: These graham crackers are really tasty.  I do have to agree with other reviewers that there are sometimes plenty of broken crackers, but since I'm more concerned with the ingredients & how they taste, I'll put up with some broken ones.  These crackers do not contain soy, which determines whether I buy these or not.  The fact that they contain no hydrogenated oils is a plus.  The price is great too.  They don't cost any more than the name-brand ones at the grocery store.

review/text: I was a little hesitant to buy these, given the problems with shipping that others have noted. Ours arrived, 12 boxes in a box that fit them well, with none broken in the first package we opened, at least. The flavor is a little different from the ones with unhealthy ingredients, but I expected that. They're still tasty, and my twins love them!

review/text: I have just read all reviews and decided to send an e-mail to "customer service" to let them know I was contemplating buying this product and they replied by saying this would not happen again and that it would be O.K. if I ordered these Grahams.  I notice they come in the tiny squares...that way...maybe not much would be there to crumble in shipping.  I'm going to order for the first time.  I forgot to question about the shelf life. I look forward to tasting them.  Thanks to all of you.

review/summary: Healthy but not that tasty
review/text: I bought these mainly for my kids (almost 4 and 1), and I thought they would really like them.  They seem to like them, but they do not taste the same as the "bad" ones out there.  It is probably obvious why.  They are not being eaten as fast as I had hoped.<br /><br />My other complaint is that they do not break apart well into the 4 crackers like others do.  They are a bit more crispy than we are used to.<br /><br />I might try to encourage them to have them with milk like cereal.<br /><br />The box did come a little damaged, but the crackers seem to have made it alright.

So I try to order them as often as I can.

review/text: Just read the title, seriously. I am a tea junkie and love my Chai. After purchasing many from the local supermarkets and whole foods. I was sold on Stash brand for the powerfully good aroma and flavor they seem to provide in their teas. If you like very watery tea you may not like this Chai as much as I do. For me, one tea bag makes a quart of good tea!

review/summary: A worthy and welcome replacement
review/text: I don't know what has happened to formulation or processing of the "big name" Earl Grey teas in the past several years, but the quality of those had degraded to such an extent that I went looking for a replacement. I am happy to say that I have found it in spades in this brand!  The bergamot comes through not only in the aroma but also the taste. (I also really like the color of the box!) This company also makes a "double bergamot" Earl Grey but I actually prefer the regular (this one) to the double. If you have become unhappy with your current Earl Grey, I recommend that you give this one a try.

review/summary: Perhaps Brewing Wrong?
review/text: I find that most (not all) people in North America brew their tea for too long a period.  When I first visited China I was amazed at how quickly after pouring the boiling water into the pot, they poured out the "finished" tea.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Keurig machine and have it perfect for making this tea.  I only drink it iced, perhaps that is the difference?  Two bags in the permanent filters and run through twice (using the large cup setting).  Poured over ice with a bit of milk.  I use Stevia for my sweetener.<br /><br />No bitterness.  Just perfectly brewed aromatic Chai Tea.  With the double spice, it gives my tastebuds the perfect "kick" that I desire.

review/summary: This chai tastes very good but should include more black tea leaves.
review/text: This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag.

review/summary: Stash tea can vary batch to batch
review/text: I have, in the past, positively reviewed other Stash flavors, Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai.  Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.

review/summary: Best of the Earl Grey teas
review/text: A classic tea, great by itself or with a large chocolate brownie drenched in dark chocolate syrup. Earl Grey seems to be a difficult tea to blend properly: without the proper proportion and quality of bergamot, the tea is either astringent or overly flowery. In my opinion, Stash gets the blend just right with their standard Earl Grey (the decaf version is also terrific, but to my taste the double bergamot drowns the tea flavor). I've tried several other brands, and can hardly drink the others. Don't say you dislike Earl Grey before trying this blend!

review/summary: Stash Brand Earl Grey Tea
review/text: To my taste, the Stash brand of Earl Grey Black Tea (in tea bags) is the best I have found. After trying Twinings, Bigelow and a few others, I discovered Stash and found it to have a fresher, cleaner taste with a more pronounced bergamot fragrance. It costs slightly more than the others but seems well worth it to me. Also, buying it in quantity through Amazon brings the cost down significantly as compared to local grocery chains.

review/summary: stash peach
review/text: I fell in love with Stash Peach Tea in about 2005 when I had it at the Hobnob Tea Room in Loveland CO. Not only can you select it for your lunch but you can buy a box from the stock they keep on hand. Because it's a family owned restaurant (not a chain) naturally they have to charge enough to pay for s/h. I found it a little cheaper at Vitamin Cottage. I always had a big cup after lunch at my desk at the post office where I worked in the passport office. Every time customers or other clerks would come in they would say "wow what smells so delicious?". It began to happen that I would make a trip to Hobnob or Vit Cott and they would be out of my tea. That flavor does not seem to be carried even in stores that carry Stash. So I found it by accident on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I was so happy. If I purchase enough at a time it saves me nearly a dollar a box over all. I drink it every day so VOILA I found a great deal on Amazon. Thank you!!!
