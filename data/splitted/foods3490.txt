review/text: This HEALTHY CHOICE Split Pea & Ham Soup was ordered for and is the unequivocal, hands-down, and all-time unrivaled favorite canned soup of my mom.  My mother is an outstanding cook  who is no rookie soup chef herself, and there could be no more sincere compliment from her to this HEALTHY CHOICE selection than that she relishes this soup and eagerly looks forward to enjoying her cup or bowl for lunch or dinner as an opening or as a main course several times a week.  She is VERY health and nutrient and additive conscious, and it is as much a reassurance as a comfort and pleasure to her - as well as for her children - that she (and we) knows she can conveniently and economically enjoy her "ritual" (almost daily) serving without worrying about less than necessary ingredients and excessive sodium.  Thanks to Amazon.com delivery two cases at time saves her (and/or her son - me) this "haul" from the store - should even any of our five or six local supermarkets actually have it in stock - and at a nice saving for Mom as well.  Win-win all around.

review/summary: A little on the soft side-not a crunchy cookie
review/text: My son loves banana and I came across this cookies in Amazon. I have not seen it sold elsewhere yet.  When I saw it was on sale in Amazon, I ordered a dozen of them due to subscribe and save, and received them in a timely manner. Unlike Gerber Cinammon cracker, or Lil Biscuits, these banana cookies are on a slightly softer and thus chewy side.  I ate a few myself and they taste pretty good. And since they are soft, you don't have to worry that they loose their crunchiness if you live in a humid area.

review/summary: Semi Soft Cookie Good for Snacks or with Meals
review/text: It is not crisp like crackers or thin cinnamon cookies. It is not gooey either unless you soak it in milk or etc. It is one of many good snacks to keep in arsenal for childs continually changing tastes. Many children will go back and forth on what is favorite. My son started on these around 1 year and at 3 he has gone from refusing to eat them to only wanting to eat these only and he has done this cycle several times. Obviously the younger child is or less able with chewing the more attention you need to give and possibly break up into tiny pieces. They do break easy and being semi soft they are not as prone to crumbing as crisp crackers are. The taste is not one that would make it a favorite of mine but I have eaten them and the taste is good enough to be a good snack for me if none of my personal favorites are around.

review/summary: best coffee ever, or so my american friends say..
review/text: what is so amazingly different about this coffee? the fact that it is not incinerated, so its color as well as taste is much lighter (more coffee- less charcoal-tasting) than all other coffees anywhere in the world.<br />i am a coffee lover and i've tried most major european brands plus jamaican blue mountain plus a number of starbucks' blends.. and i still prefer this one, the one i "grew up on" (i'm a croatian, and this is most popular croatian coffee).<br />funny thing is, my american friends are also crazy about it. they say it simply tastes the best.

review/summary: Great Chips but Slow Shipping and Quick Expiration Date
review/text: I love these chips which is why I bought them in bulk. My only disappointment was that they were not shipped until 5-6 days after I placed the order so it took about 1.5 weeks to receive them.<br /><br />My only other caveat is that the "Best By" date is November 4th, and I received the shipment around September 9-10. Therefore, if you are buying them for personal use, hopefully you have family members who can help eat them before the "Best By" date.<br /><br />However, I LOVE these chips so I am rating the chips 5 stars.

The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.  This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic.  Garbage, complete and total garbage.

review/summary: Product is good, packaging needs improvement
review/text: The packaging is rather painful to open.  They should design these with parents of new babies in mind.  Most food products with peel tops have one corner which is indicated as the side to open and the hard plastic has a crack allowing for the user to easily bend and peel the top.  No such luck with these tubs of baby food from Gerber.  It's not clear which side should be opened by the packaging and whichever one you choose will be equally stubborn before you can finally peel the top and feed your hungry baby.

review/summary: Baby likes it enough to eat it however, I just found out it's plastic #7
review/text: I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.

This case has 8 of the packs, making it a total of 16 tubs.  It's a lot of prunes but she eats them often and loves them.

review/summary: Corn syrup may not be a bad thing!
review/text: Aight, y'all. This stuff is EXACTLY the same as the Earth's Best formula. What EB doesn't want you to know is that it also contains corn syrup. EB's ingredient list includes "glucose syrup solids" instead of "corn syrup solids." BUT what they don't want you to know is that it is indeed corn syrup. (I researched and researched to find that this is true.)<br /><br />So, folks, don't get your panties in a wad over corn syrup. "Corn syrup solids" is NOT the same as "high fructose corn syrup." It is a sweetener (dextrose), and it is questionable as to whether or not it is better for you than sucrose (table sugar found in Similac Organic). Why do O and EB contain corn syrup? Well, it is to make formula sweet, like breast milk. What do other formulas use? Similac uses table sugar, and a lot of other brands use lactose -- a naturally derived sweetener from milk. Lactose is arguably worse for babies, since NO HUMAN processes lactose as well as dextrose or sucrose. Most folks are actually lactose intolerant to some extent, so it's real rough for little babies. So the organic formulas just don't use it, and if they do, it's not in the quantities that it is in Enfamil, etc. (Nature's Best Baby's Only is the only odd man out -- they use brown rice syrup -- which is great (?) but hasn't been thoroughly researched as a sugar like additive.)<br /><br />The other advantage to the organic formulas like EB and O is that they have a more similar whey and casein ratio to human milk than does Similac or Enfamil. The first ingredient in those formulas is "non fat milk", whereas the first ingredient in EB and O is "whey." It's broken down more so babies can digest it better.<br /><br />So yeah. We didn't have success with Baby's Only. We LURVE O and EB and Parent's Choice Organic from Walmark -- whichever is on sale, y'all!

review/summary: Great
review/text: My son is doing well on this formula. He was having issues with constipation (I had him on Baby's Only for a long time because it doesn't contain corn syrup), and this formula doesn't upset his stomach at all. This formula is comparable to Earth's Best, and is $10 cheaper. At a can a week, that's $40 savings a month! This stuff is great, my only concern is the corn syrup. I wish it didn't contain corn syrup!!! This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Great formula, great price. Also- this is Safeway's generic brand comparable to Earth's Best. I would highly recommend this formula to all parents.

review/summary: granola meets frugal? NOT EARTH'S BEST!
review/text: I love generic products. When they work.<br /><br />Ingredient for ingredient match to the Earth's Best label, but doesn't perform the same. I bought this Safeway generic product when Earth's Best wasn't available to ship quickly. Based on reviews I assumed this formula would be the same. It looks, smells, and mixes like Earth's Best, and baby took to it the same the first day, but on the second day she refused to eat it without a fight. Then came the diarrhea. I kept feeding her the food, despite the horrible fights with a five-month-old, and the stomach persisted persisted. I thought she may just have an upset tummy from her latest round of vaccines, but took her the doctor after she six juicy stools in one day and still refused to eat without a fight.<br /><br />THE DOCTOR SAID THE FOOD WASN'T AGREEING WITH HER. I'm not saying the food is poison, or dangerous, or likely to make your child ill, but I put her back on Earth's Best that afternoon. She still fought the first meal, but the next day she was eating happily and pooing normally. She is feeling much better.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVE A WHOLE FOODS MARKET NEAR YOU, YOU CAN GET THE LARGE CAN OF EARTHS BEST FOR $26.

review/text: I ordered this formula after carefully researching several of the organic brands. One thing that is a deal breaker for me is corn syrup in baby formula. The ingredient list here and on the formula's own website says nothing about corn syrup, but low and behold on the can, "corn syrup solids". Well, 'organic' corn syrup solids, which to me is no better.  Skip this if you don't want corn syrup in your baby's formula, but if it doesn't bother you, you can find other brands with corn syrup for less $$ than this one. I'll be returning it.

review/summary: A great instant cup of hot cocoa
review/text: One of the joys of having a Keurig K-cup machine is that you can make a cup of what anybody wants at anytime (providing that you have it of course).  Dark coffee, decaf, flavored coffee, green tea, English tea, herbal tea, etc.  This has really made entertaining more fun for both the guest and the host/hostess.  Of all of the drinks that I offer my guests the one that often brings smiles to their faces is hot cocoa, especially if the guest is a child.<br /><br />I have tried all of the hot cocoa k-cups that I could find: Green Mountain and Gloria Jeans hot cocoa, Timothy's White Chocolate, Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate, etc.  So far the hands-down favorite for me is this Ghiradelli mix.  As stated in the product description, this is not a K-cup but a pre-measured packet designed for Keurig brewers.  The taste is classic Ghiradelli: rich, sweet and heavy on the chocolate.  When I made a single cup of hot cocoa for a discriminating adult I reach for this one.  However, I find K-cups to be more convenient (especially when making beverages for a lot of people) and children seem to like all of them (and the sweeter the better).<br /><br />If I am serving hot chocolate to a group I will do it the traditional way but when I offer hot beverages to a guest and they are not interested in coffee or tea I am glad that I have Ghiradelli's hot cocoa on hand.  It is, so far, the best tasting hot cocoa for the Keurig brewers.

review/summary: Great cocoa, Keurig machine unnecessary, cheaper elsewhere
review/text: I really like this very delicious cocoa, no question about it.  That's why I gave the product itself five stars.  But...<br /><br />A bullet on the product description page states: "Specially designed packet to be used with any Keurig machine" and the rest of the description and other comments emphasize some intrinsic Keurig connection.  That is misleading.  The only connection with Keurig machines (or their K-cups) is that Keurig packs sample packets in with their brewing machines.  This product is simply a box of single packets that each create one 8 ounce cup of not-overly-sweet cocoa from any hot water source (tea kettle, microwaved mug of water, etc.).  Milk is not necessary, as milk solids are some of the ingredients.<br /><br />As for Amazon's $20 price, I buy the same box of packets at Smart & Final stores (a West coast chain) for under $10.

We still do the homemade on occasion but this stuff is very good for a easy substitute. I hated the first try which was 1 part mix, 1 rum, 1 club soda but when I changed to 1 rum, 2 mix and 1 club soda we hit our sweet spot. That's the ratio that works for us. We just ordered a couple more 3 packs. I agree that buying just one is a good idea in case you don't like it. It's a case of "Not exactly right but good in it's own right". My humble opinion. Added to $3 will get you a coffee and doughnut.

review/summary: Better than EVERYTHING
review/text: 5 stars, 10 if it were possible.<br />2 mini-doxies who ate homemade from birth to 2, then went onto 'natural' kibble (Holistic Blendz, Hund n Flocken) and developed urine crystals, then went to a vet kibble that got rid of the crystals but developed another crystal.  I needed a solution that wouldn't take all day to prepare, and without grain (dachshunds are better off with potatoes as their starch, no rice or corn).  First impressions - smells good helped by garlic and oh look! I can actually recognize the bits of potato, broccoli and carrots! - add water, so far pretty easy.  Add beef?  I can't bring myself to do the raw thing, but I get organic ground beef from Costco, poach it, and when it's cooled down I add it to the Europa.  Store 3-4 days worth in the frig, and it's done.  Doggies used to sniff at the kibble and swallow enough of it to sustain life.  Now they can't wait to eat.  They're down to healthy weights, which is key for doxie backs, and the vet proclaims the smooth is the "best looking dachshund" he has ever seen.  They're running and playing like puppies at the ripe old age of 7.  I give them Missing Link Plus supplements, Cosequin DS to keep joints in good shape.  I feel like I'm doing a good thing for them, and I want them around me for many more years to come. I can't thank Sojourner Farms enough for understanding the need for grain-free food, let alone the absolute purity of preparation and ingredients. Someone there actually thought about the dog first.  I'm sure it takes longer to prep and dehydrate the vegetables than to pulverize and kibble-ize something far less healthy, but Sojos is doing it anyway and I for one am grateful for the product.  Costly?  I can't even calculate the value when I see the difference it has made in my dogs after just 2 months.  They ship it free from the Sojos web site, and so does Amazon.  Friends, just do it.  You can make it in the time it takes you to cook supper. You'd do it for your kids.  And your dogs don't talk back!!

During the first several months with her, she demonstrated some puzzling symptoms...jerking and shivering, even in 100 degree summer weather...I took her to the vet. but he could find nothing wrong.....Instinct told me otherwise....So I tried giving her what we give our patients in the ER, when they have ingested something toxic...Activated charcoal....the shivers and jerking stopped.....I suspected immediately that something in the kibble type food I was giving her was toxic to her nervous system.....up to this point she would stare at the Kibble type food and eat only enough to survive.....I began a search for a substitute...thanks to a knowledgable pet store owner who showed me a bag of Sojos Europa...I now have a pet that no longer shivers or shakes, her coat is very healthy.....she has the energy of a puppy, and her breath no longer stinks....I mix Sojos with cooked chicken snapper and salmon, not all at once.  She loves it.  I'll try some other meats soon.....bottom line is this is really good stuff.....Read the list of ingredients,  this stuff smells so good,I have been tempted to taste it myself...but remember tasting lemon soap the Fuller Brush Man brought when I was a kid, but that's another story.

review/text: I love this product but the vegetable pieces are a little too big for my dogs to digest.<br /><br />Every time I get a new bag of Sojos Grain Free (previously "Europa") I grind up the whole bag using my spice grinder.  This makes it easier for them to digest and I don't have pieces of bright orange carrot in their poo anymore.<br /><br />When I grind it up like this it also hydrates much more quickly, which is important. If it's not properly hydrated, the dog can get constipated.<br /><br />I always feed this with raw meats such as chicken, beef, or lamb.  I sometimes add it to cooked fish or scrambled eggs, but I don't do this more than once a week.  Also, I add a little bit of organ meat a few times a week.  You should use organic liver because this is where the toxins build up.<br /><br />To make it less expensive, I get chicken necks and trim meat.<br /><br />I hope this helps!

review/text: Enjoyed this product for several years.  They have however made changes to the recipe...changing the type of calcium added and other ingredients that seem to have changed. Seems like there is more powder added to the vegetables in the Europa.  So white with calcium you can't even tell the colors of the vegetables. I have written them to inquire about the ingredient changes but haven't heard anything back yet.  My dogs don't care for it much anymore.  It always seems that when a company has a good product they eventually change it to cut costs and it goes downhill from there. Hope this isn't the case with SOJOS.<br /><br />PS. Did hear back from Sojos after resending and asking for a courtesy response. They have changed the formula from calcium carbonate to tri-calcium phosphate with added Vitamin D.  For folks with kidney patient dogs..please do your homework about the effects of the tricalcium phosphate (phosphorus)on kidney patients.Sojos makes a good product.  I hope they reconsider this recipe change so that it will be safe and healthy for all dogs.

review/text: Like the last review, I have a mixture of dogs.  The 2 Chihuahuas can eat anything and fair pretty well. Our mini long haired mini dauschand is another matter. He suffered terribly from skin rashes and ear/yeast problems.  We put all the dogs on this diet and Volia! no more skin or ear problems.  I do not cook the meat before mixing it, since I have never heard of a dog cooking in the wild.  They are domesticated, but their basic anatomy has not changed, so raw made sense to me.  When my vet first found out, she gave me a lecture about the dangers of raw meat THEN examined my dog.  She changed her tune very quickly, saying that my dog was one of the healthiest she had seen: great muscle tone, perfect weight, great teeth, ect.  All 3 have much higher energy levels and their coats are so pretty and soft now. AND no "dog" smell to them which is a great change from the skin and ear/yeast odor the poor dauschand suffered from.  All 3 dogs love this diet and take turns relicking each others bowls for a good while before I finally pick them up. It has been a good 4-5 years now and they are all doing great. We previously had a golden who suffered the same as our dauschand his whole life (10 years) I wish I had known about this food then!

She also used to have near daily episodes of urping up undigested food, and that has totally stopped. They also have nicer breath, and less gas.  I add poached chicken or raw beef, canned salmon, eggs or cottage cheese to the mix.  The result does look and smell like I could eat it myself.  I supplement with a probiotic and enzyme powder, and salmon oil.  My only complaint is that it is expensive.  So, I just remind myself of how much time, energy and money I save not having to shampoo my rugs constantly!

review/summary: Easy and healthy homemade dog food
review/text: Sojos is a dog food mix made up primarily of dehydrated and freeze dried vegetables and fruits.  Sojos is the third dog food mix I've tried, and it comes in second place for simplicity and palatability.  In order to make the mix into dog food,you add water, meat and any other ingredients you'd like.  I typically add leftovers like rice, stew, stir fry, oatmeal, veggies and similar healthy additions to stretch the food.  I usually make a large batch and then freeze all but two servings per dog.  Then I feed the "smoosh" twice per week with fish oil, nutritional yeast and probiotics on top.<br /><br />My favorite dog food mix is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030JFYYA">Honest Kitchen Preference, Grain-Free Foundation Diet For Dogs, 7lb</a>.  The Sojos is less convenient because it needs to sit for at least an hour between mixing and feeding ("preferably overnight"), while Preference is ready in about 20 minutes.  Preference contains a lot of alfalfa and kelp (which STINK during preparation) and chelated vitamins, so it's my number one choice.  Both of these diets are very healthy, so either one is an excellent choice for your dog.

review/summary: changed formulation?
review/text: My Sheltie suffered from chronic constipation, my Border Collie mix had unexplained bouts of cramping diarhea (sp?) about once a month while on their trainer's recommended high-quality kibble diet from a feed store, supplemented with home-cooked veggies and chicken.  Once I switched to serving SOJO Comlete for one of their daily meals, both GI problems disappeared for good. They both loved the product and any 'pickiness' in their eating habits disappeared. Their coats are remarkable and they're all-around healthy, active dogs.<br /><br />BUT - I noticed a bag-to-bag inconsistency of the proportion of powder vs. chunks.  The company explaiuned to me about six months ago that they were aware of that and were about to make a change that would make it more consistent. Then about  4 months ago I noticed what I suspect was a change in formulation.  The product smelled strongly of broccoli.  My sheltie began nosing the pieces of broccoli aside, and then stopped eating SOJO food altogether.  I gave him back his kibble plus veggies, and after two months began substituting some of the SOJO back in.  Same result - not eating it.  So I began picking out the larger pieces of broccoli. I was surprised to find that his 1-cup portion of food contained nearly 1/4 c broccoli - fully 20% to 25% of the product.  For nearly $75 per bag?  Can you imagine your human diet consisting of one quarter broccoli?  I'm not happy and will again contact the company about this.

review/summary: hounds have stopped shivering, scratching their coats and getting goopy eyes
review/text: I bought Sojos because of the reviewer who mentioned that their dog would shake uncontrollably. My 3lb dog (hound was a joke) would do this all the time. She also had constant dried sleep in her eyes; I'd wash her face every day. My other dog would scratch herself constantly with her back legs. My vet recommended Science Plan or some such kibble designed for dogs with sensitive skin. I asked why the normal kibble they sold would aggravate it. No answer. And clearly--- it's time for a change.<br />I love Amazon and that I could find this food. Talk about a 180. They LOVE this food. They can't wait to eat (they both sit and squeak if I'm even 10 mins late with it- they used to look at me with total nonchalance when I put the kibble down)and my littlest one has put on nearly 2lbs which she desperately needed. They are both healthier, happier dogs. No more skin scratching! No more eye goop. I mix it with ground turkey or chicken breasts. Also eggs are awesome with it and they love them.<br />God knows what goes into kibble. I would NEVER feed it to an animal again. Vets who shill that stuff should be ashamed.

review/summary: My dogs LOVE Sojos
review/text: I rescued two Korean jindos over the past 12 months, and the female had really bad food allergies. Since the breed evolved on an island off South Korea - subsisting on rice, veggies, meat scraps and fish - I definitely wanted to take them off kibble and onto something more "native."<br /><br />After a couple of weeks on Sojos and meat, they are now enthusiastic eaters, licking their bowls clean after every meal. I can also see a vast improvement in their energy levels, skin and coat. Their eyes are much brighter, and they don't have any more eye discharge. With kibble, they would half-heartedly graze and leave a few behind in their bowl.<br /><br />So thanks Sojos for this product...it's fantastic!

review/summary: My dog's favorite food!
review/text: I have been feeding my dog, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, a raw or home-prepared diet since she was around 6 months old. She is now almost 4. At the beginning I fed a variety of "high end" kibbles and canned food like Orijen, Solid Gold, Merricks etc. She would have runny poop, crusty eyes and was never that into her food generally, she would not always eat it all, and I didn't like the idea of all the processing, the 5 million ingredients and I have general distrust of pet food manufacturers after all the recalls and problems there have been.<br /><br />When we switched to home cooked things got better, but when we switched to raw it was amazing! She very rarely has any issues at all (except when she eats a take out menu that comes under the door or something!), her coat is beautifully soft and shiny, lots of energy, perfect weight, no eye goop. I feed Sojo's very frequently, usually with beef, and alternate with various brands of ground raw patties like Stella and Chewy's, Primal, Nature's Variety, and whole raw chicken bones, and various organ meats, raw eggs, canned sardines (no salt packed in water), occassional healthy human leftovers like fruits, veggies, yogurt etc. I have also tried The Honest Kitchen mixes, which are good too, but I can tell that she likes Sojo's more. She will sit in the kitchen the whole time I am preparing a batch sniffing the air and getting excited. I mix up a big batch at once and store in pre-measured containers of four serves (two meals per day) in the freezer and thaw one in the fridge at a time. Sojos is very easy to use, even with the change to the calcium I do not find it especially messy and it is important to shake the bag before use to get an even distribution of all the ingredients. I have ordered it from Amazon and also from their own website (where shipping is also free) and have always found their customer service to be great. I am glad to support a small company that makes their high quality product in the USA. I am so glad that something that makes it so easy to feed dogs healthily is available.

review/summary: Was a 5 star product.....
review/text: I loved this product until they changed the formula.  The newer version, while they claim it offers more calcium (which is great), has caused the product to be extremely messy.  I know it sound minor, but when the ENTIRE area surrounding the container or bag is completely covered in dust, you will be annoyed.  In addition to the mess, the additional powder/nutrient essentially cut down the amount of food in the bag since the weight did not increase. When I scoop out a portion now, it is hit or miss as far as whether I am going to get 60% or more powder & I worry about the caloric intake my dogs are or are not getting now.  If you are okay with a huge mess and paying more for less (I have two dogs, so the difference is significant), the product is excellent.  Unfortunately, this new change probably result in me looking into other food options for my dogs.

review/summary: Fruit & Veggie Mix has EGG and GARLIC in it
review/text: Ingredients: sweet potato, carrots, broccoli, celery, apples, whole egg, tricalcium phosphate, flax meal, parsley leaf, carob powder, dried kelp, dried alfalfa, ginger root, garlic, vitamin D3.<br /><br />The ingredient list was not on the Amazon product page so when I ordered it I thought it consisted only of dehydrated fruits and veggies. When I received the product I learned it contained whole eggs and garlic in the formula.  My dog is on a low-fat Vegetarian diet to control her cholesterol levels and allergies <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000634HD2">Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula Dog Food, 28-Pound Bag</a>.  I thought of adding this mix-in to make her meals more palatable.  While Sojos is a tasty and natural mix-in that helps my little carnivore miss her meat less, I was disappointed to learn that it has these ingredients in it:<br />1- EGG - is highly allergenic. My dog is allergic to poultry and since this is a poultry product, I'd rather not have this in the formula.<br />2- GARLIC - published as a substance that is toxic to dogs.  My references:  both the ASPCA web site, and the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813819857">Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion: Small Animal Toxicology</a>.  I am including a very short excerpt from the book, "The Allium species of plants belongs to the Alliacae family and includes onions, garlic, chives, and leeks.  These plants contain propyl disulfides and can cause Heinz body anemia when ingested by companion animals.  Cooking, drying, processing, and spoiling do not negate the toxic effect.  Pets on diets with Allium supplementation (e.g. garlic or onion powder) may be chronically poisoned."  Detailed info on pages 457-460.  When I learned this, I quickly stopped feeding my dog this product.  This didn't come cheap and that also adds to my disappointment because now it will have to be thrown out.<br /><br />If the manufacturer changes the formula and removes those two ingredients, I might consider buying this product again.

review/summary: My dogs changed completely on Sojo's
review/text: After all the problems with dry food from other countries and scared that I was making my dogs sick, I started them all on solo's grain-free with raw meat diet.  They love it. They have normal, firm stool and less of it to Poop Scoop.  It seems expensive at first, but the results  are worth it, really.  I mix a large batch of solo's with water as instructed, and put it in the refrigerator, then I mix with assorted raw beef or cooked chicken and turkey.  BE CAREFUL..every dog is different and you have to gauge each dog differently, just like humans.  I have 2 Chihuahuas and a Pom, one chi blew up like a balloon and the other hasn't gained or lost weight.  If you have more than one dog I would have a bowl for each and feed separately and observe! because I found my little fatty was eating what the others left behind in their bowls.  The amazing thing is they no longer beg for treats like they used to.  I always felt like they were starving all the time.  And the big ++++ is that they have actually calmed down quite a bit, not nearly as hyperactive as they were before.  My husband and I sit down for dinner and we never hear or see them.  I'm not a paid spokesperson and I was highly skeptical about this type of diet for my fur kids.  But after seeing previous pets have health problems for no apparent reason, I have to think the dry food is not healthy for them.  Also...very important...I do give them the dry biscuits to help with tarter control on their teeth.  That is the only daily treat I give them now.  I do not feed them anything that is imported from china, nothing against them, it's just not what I feel is best.  The results are in front of me and I see a huge difference.  Just don't get frustrated at first with the preparation of the food.  My chi's and pom each weigh 5 pounds full grown.  I give them a 1/4 cup raw hamburger and 1/4 c hydrated solo's twice a day.  They are very active so that's what has worked for us. Hope this helps you make the change.

Then I told him it was dog food...  :-  My dogs LOVE this stuff, but a little goes a LONG way. I didn't want my dogs to get a stomach ache  when we first switched so I put a few spoonfuls in with their regular dog food.  That seemed to work well and prolongs the last of both.  The shipping was fast and the service was courteous.  Would order from again.

review/text: Love the idea of grain free - dehydrated food.<br /><br />Switched to raw a couple of months ago and wanted to add in veggies for fiber and fill as I also wanted my dog to loose some weight.<br /><br />He's thriving on the raw and I love that this product is delivered to my door (I hate shopping) and it is less costly to purchase through Amazon than most other on-line and retailers.<br /><br />The veggies are high quality.  I tend to make my dog's food in small batches and I also run the ingredients through a blender to make it easier to digest for my dog.<br /><br />Great product - will continue to buy - wonderful option to high quality dog food.

review/summary: our Standard poodles love this
review/text: Our dogs were having problems with ear issues. We had been feeding them Innova red meat then Evo grain free kibble and although they liked these foods, they still had the ear issues. WE went to a new vet who a  practices Chinese medicine for pets as well as his long standing traditional vet practices. He suggested the SOJOS grain free with non-heat producing meats or fish  or cooked eggs . Since we have been using these foods, our dogs have been clear of ear issues and they love the food, It is easy. Although as others have said, there have been some changes to the food, I do not believe this is a negative. I think the changes have been improvements. I also find the quality to remain high, no problems there either.

review/text: This is one of the only foods that our border collie has been successful with in terms of allergies and other unwanted side effects of various other high quality grain free foods. We have tried many things but always come back to Sojos. Only problem is she gets tired of it after a while even though we switch up the meats. This is why we keep trying to find something she wont get tired of that will work for her itching allergies. So far no luck - and it seems to be back to Sojos grain free every time.

review/summary: Prefer this to Honest Kitchen Grain Free - Low Phosphorous content
review/text: Although a canine nutritionist insisted Honest Kitchen was better than Sojo's grain free, I like this better.  The Honest Kitchen is ground very fine to aid digestion (I assume) but it just doesn't hydrate as well.  The Honest Kitchen Preference is essentially the same as this product but even though you add the proper amount of water to hydrate and wait the necessary time, it remains dry and powdery.  If you add more water then it gets soupy.  This Sojos' hydrates very nicely, the bit of vegetables are small enough that a human could digest.  So if you are looking for something to add meat or canned dog food to this is the best product that I have I've found.  I was looking for a low phosphorous food to reduce to load on my dog's kidney since she is now a senior.  After 5 years of age it is now recommended you reduce the phosphorous content in your dogs food since so many, many dogs are dying of kidney issues which some say is linked to dry kibble.  If you like dry kibble, Royal Canine makes a senior food which has the lowest phosphorous content of any kibble I have researched.  I'm switching back to Sojos.  It also appears to be kinder on my dog's stomach than the Honest Kitchen.  HK makes great products and I will still use some of their with the meat already added.

review/summary: Sojos almost killed my dog
review/text: My dog, a 3-year-old chocolate lab with no history of allergies, had a severe allergic reaction to Sojos and required weeks of treatment to recover from it.  I took my dog to two different vets, both of whom said the change in his food was almost certainly the cause of the illness.  When I took a closer look at the remaining Sojos food I found that it contained bits of wood, twine and bulap sack material.  When I changed my dog back to his old food, the allergy went away.  Sojos refused to admit that their food was the cause of my dog's illness, and refused to refund even the money I had paid them for the food, let alone reimburse me for over the over $700 I spent for veterinary care.  Don't risk your dog's health with Sojos.  If you want to make home-cooked food, ask your vet for a recipe.

review/summary: Caution, Not as High Quality as they would lead you to believe.
review/text: I was very excited when my local store started carrying this product. I saw this as a relatively cheap alternative to the raw diet I had them on which was great quality but took a lot of work to prepare (the pre-prepped one was even more expensive).<br /><br />For anyone who's done research on dog food, we all know that raw is the best diet we can feed our dogs, it gives them nutritional content, probiotics, moisture, all the things that they need to thrive. For anyone who's been on high grade dog foods, you also know that you can switch foods for your dogs without any concern about stomach/bowel issues. Be forewarned, this is NOT the case with Sojos.<br /><br />I had been feeding my dogs Nature's Variety Instinct Raw (switching as I please between the protein varieties) and Orijen (I switch between all the Orijen flavors). I normally did half in the morning and half a night using one type of food for each feeding. I figure, why not throw Sojos into the mix to give them some variety and save some money. That's when problems instantly began.<br /><br />They liked the food at first, it was new and exciting and they gobbled it up, then when it made its way through their system, they had very runny stool. It was still not too bad and I could understand minor transition time, but by the end of day 1 it was full on diarrhea. I spent an entire weekend (and then some) nursing them back to health, fully on Nature's Variety Instinct mixed with organic pumpkin to settle the stomach. But I spent the majority of my time walking them, and being heartbroken to see bloody stool (knowing I had caused it by carelessly choosing a poor quality dog food product).<br /><br />I know some will argue, 'you didn't transition your dogs,' but honestly, when you stay in the high quality spectrum of dog foods you don't have to. Especially when you know your dogs don't have problems. I've fed them Blue, Candiae, Nature's Variety, Great Life, Orijen, Acana, Nature's Variety Instinct Raw, Earthborn, EVO. And that's not even adding to the mix the versions of those foods that have grain and grain free varieties. I've NEVER had a problem with switching them back and forth.<br /><br />So, this is certainly a better option that Science Diet, but it isn't for everyone, and it certainly isn't for people who want to feed their dogs the best stuff they can. This is NOT a replacement for a raw diet. Please take caution before switching.<br /><br />(Also I read a reviewer who cooks their proteins before feeding it to their dog, how does that not completely defeat the purpose in feeding raw in the first place?)

review/summary: Didn't like the taste; packaging not as easily recycled
review/text: I saw an advertisement for this new line of soups and was really interested. I often have soup for lunch at work and thought this would be a nice treat from my usual Campbell's Select Harvest or Thick & Chunky soups. Considering how much more it cost than those soups, I had high expectations.<br /><br />Before I get to the taste, I want to talk about the packaging. The usual Campbell's soup comes in a metal can that is recyclable in almost every community recycling program I know of. This soup package will require more effort from me to recycle. Instead of a can, it is packaged in a #5PP plastic container with an unlabeled plastic lid. My community recycling does not accept #5PP so I will have to save it in a bag with my yogurt containers until I have enough to bring them to a local grocery store that collects it. But even that will take work because the interior lid is an aluminum poptop and there is an aluminum lid on the plastic container. So I will have to find a way to get the aluminum ring off before I can put it in with the plastic. I wish Campbell's had stayed with the traditional can packaging.<br /><br />The extra work for recycling and the extra cost might be worth it if the soup were really fantastic. I didn't think it was.<br /><br />On the plus side, the chunks of beef and potatoes are much larger than even in the thick & chunky line. And it has portobello mushrooms. But the carrot pieces were small and the ratio of broth/sauce (it's thick like stew sauce) to chunks of meat/vegetables was thinner than I expected for the price. I also didn't care for the taste of the sauce. I couldn't identify why I didn't like it but it didn't taste good to me. This was a lunchtime "splurge" that wasn't worth the price. I'm not sure I'd want it again even if the price were much lower.<br /><br />I won't buy this flavor again and, unless there is a coupon giving significant savings, I don't expect to try any of the other flavors.

review/summary: If you can read this...
review/text: If the people who reviewed it gave it 1 star, its likely because they didn't READ THE BACK OF THE PACKAGE ON HOW TO PREPARE THEM... likely dumped them in a bowl, liquid and all, nuked them, and dug in. The back of the package is written in English for a purpose. Yes, the liquid they are packaged in has a strange/bad odor. Just rinse the noodles, i prefer to parboil them 3 minutes vs. microwave. Just my preference, after that, no stink.<br />As for the product itself, its been featured on the Dr. Oz show, sampled by an audience member, who made no foul face when eating them, Likely because they were PREPARED AS DIRECTED.<br />I buy them myself for a guilt free diet food, and enjoy them as a main course, or side dish. They are a good source of protein, low carb, and go great with pasta sauce, or a little seasoning.<br />The only thing more i would want out of this product would be to be priced at 25 cents a package like their Ramen noodle counterparts. =0)

review/summary: Great!!!!!
review/text: I was shocked to see what some other reviewers said- This is an awesome product!!! You need to rinse well- it is NOT the noodle that has the odor it is the liquid it ferments in- anyhow- I followed the other instructions- rinse well microwave about 3 min then add any type of sauce etc- Tastes like pasta and NO calories to speak of at all my children and husband have no idea yet they are eating an alternative think its a brown wheat pasta!!! i will eventually tell them

review/summary: Pasta - Carbs + Protein = Shirataki Noodles!
review/text: I love pasta and my vegetables mixed in there too, it isn't like I eat UN-healthy. I just like something to go along with my veggies. For a vegetarian it can sometimes be a challenge to find that perfect balance of proteins while watching your intake of salts, carbs, and fats. When I came across these noodles I felt like I hit gold!<br /><br />Yes, upon opening the bags, you smell seaweed water. Which for me wasn't horrid. I eat veggie sushi weekly. A quick rinse and I 'towel dried' my noodles with a linen towel to bring them to an 'al dente' firmness before adding my heated sauce. Or throwing them into a stir fry.<br /><br />So far I have tried the Yam, Tofu and Lotus Root. Next up is the Mushroom.

review/summary: Amazon.com's JFC Brown Shirataki Yam Noodles... a wheat pasta alternative?  Nope.
review/text: The Yam Noodles, if hoping for a replacement to wheat pasta... this is not it.  Better alternative is rice, corn, and/or quinoa gluten-free pastas.  I'm sure it is good for those that like the taste of this type of rice-type noodle.  But not for my desire for gluten-free pasta.

review/summary: Excellent Shirataki Option
review/text: I've tried many brands, types, and shapes of Shirataki noodles. This is actually up there with some of my favorites. Yes, you must know how to prepare these properly. I like to rinse them well in a small plastic colander, then place the colander on a saucer and microwave for 4 minutes on high. When it comes out, it's very hot, steamy, and most of water will be drained from the noodles themselves, which makes it primed and ready for sauce. The texture on these vs others I've tried is nice - not as rubbery. But just know, these can not compare to flour-based pasta in texture - flour (starch) is the very ingredient that makes pasta's texture what it is, becoming increasingly soft and thickening sauces as it cooks. These do NOT do that. But for those looking for something that helps to avoid starches and carbs, this does the trick. As for the brown color, I honestly did not notice any taste difference. Like the white, it's tasteless and absorbs the flavor of the sauce served with it.

review/summary: This is a great choice for a noodle replacement!
review/text: I was initially scared to try this noodle because it was brownish. Then I felt silly because: A) whole-wheat pasta is brown, and B) I eat seaweed all the time at Japanese restaurants. Well, these noodles are no different than JFC's white yam noodles, outside of the fact that they are healthier because of the addition of seaweed.<br /><br />The texture is really strong and firm, and they aren't too chewy (I microwave for 2 minutes prior to cooking in sauce or soup). I didn't smell any suspension liquid during rinsing, though it might be habit not to take any breaths before they are rinsed!<br /><br />This is a great buy and went really great with my minty-pesto mahi-mahi tonight.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: I bought a few bags of these noodles because I wanted noodles that were low-carb. It sounded too good to be true. It turned out that it was too good to be true. I rinsed these noodles and couldn't get the foul smelling odor off of them. You can add sauce but it just masks the nastiness of this product. I dumped the rest of these bags of noodles in the trash.

review/summary: TASTES HORRIBLE!!
review/text: I bought these after hearing all of the raves about them. When they arrived, they looked like worms in water in the bag. This kind is made with seaweed powder, so there is a pungent seafood smell and taste. Did not like them at all. Not to mention that they have the consistency of cartilage.

review/text: This is terrible to say, but the one thing I hate about all these healthier "whole foods" is that they taste so different than the refined products that I am used to. White bread, white rice, etc. These have a good amount of fiber, and I didn't notice any difference in taste when eating them with Vietnamese food (I made Bo Xa Lui Nuong the first time). Get some!

review/summary: Very light but filling
review/text: After finding out I was Gluten intolerant, it became a tedious job hunting for things to eat and try to stay normal for the family.  Rice pasta became just a tad heavy and didn't cook very well unless cooked a long time.  However, with the Mai Fun noodles, they cook in about 3 minutes.  What a surprise for me and the family when they cooked quick and tasted good.<br />They have more of a gelatinous texture but I have used them in soups, pasta salads and for spaghetti and so far we have enjoyed every dish.  One thing I do is break them up in the package because they are stiff and when breaking they can go all over.  If you are looking for a different GF pasta this is a good one.

review/summary: Beware assortment not guaranteed !!
review/text: Very disappointed to learn after ordering that "grocery items" are not returnable. More importantly the picture shows Spiderman and Ironman and description states the assortmant cannot be guaranteed but says it includes Marvel Superhoes - Ironman, Spiderman, Thor, Captain America , etc  I orderd 2 boxes of them for the goody bags for my son's Spiderman themed birthday party ...Not one Spiderman in the bunch! Very disappointed as to me that is not an "assortment"! Has anyone else that ordered this product received any Spiderman products? It makes me wonder if the most popular characters are used to sell the product but not to fulfill the order.

review/summary: Best Olive Oil Ever
review/text: I have tried many olive oil's but most of the time I do not like them. None of the general store bought brands. I should point out that I do not eat olives either. I have found a few good olive oil's that are excellent flavor for cooking.... and this is definitely one of them. I purchased this one after seeing the Barefoot Contessa using this brand of Olive Oil (Regular rather than extra virgin).... This is so yummy even just drizzled on plain pasta.

review/text: Olio Santo comes highly recommended-so ordering 3 bottles seemed a good idea-NOT!! When one receives 3 in March, and the expiration date on the bottles is only a few months hence, one has thrown money away. Shame on the company for sending out this as such. I had to give away so that I knew it would not go bad.

review/summary: My 8 yr old loves it
review/text: My daughter, who is pretty picky about food, loves this oatmeal. It has good texture and taste. I can live with the nutritional content too, not loaded with sugar, has protein and fiber. She likes it better if I smash 1/2 a banana and mix it in. The oatmeal is a bit on the tart side. Overall a great product that kids will eat. Would like to try the raspberry flavor..
