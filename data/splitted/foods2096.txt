review/summary: Vanilla Nesquik
review/text: I purchased this product to give as a gift to my granddaughter who simply said loves the Vanilla flavored Nesquik. I was surprised to find it on line at Amazon and instantly ordered it since this product cannot be found in any area stores where I live or where my granddaughter lives. She has been enjoying it since she received it and has even shared the supply with one of her close girl friends who also shares in the love of this flavor of Nesquik. I am so glad that I purchased the what seemed like a large quantity instead of just one canister. I recommend this to anyone who loves the flavor of Vanilla Nesquik but can't find it in stores.

review/summary: Very Potent! My Kids love It! Full Of vitamins & Minerals!
review/text: I don't know what all the hype is about the color or texture of this vanilla milk is. The taste is what matters. And it is good! Although the directions state 3 tablespoons for 8oz of milk we learned that 1-2 are sufficient. It's really strong so it will go further. I also have used in my pudding, cake mixes, & icings instead of vanilla flavoring and it gives it an excellent light taste.<br /><br />As for the language on the can, it's also in english but who in their right mind needs directions for milk mix. You just add it by spoonfuls till you like the taste and thats that people. As for the color being yellow well it's kinda cool I think. I have always added food coloring to my kids milk & ice cream anyway and it makes it more likeable to children. We even color our mash potatoes & grits sometimes. So unless your allergic to color, and you like vanilla milk then it's a purchase you'll love. I was very pleased to find this since it has been discontinued locally.

review/text: I love vanilla milk and can't find the mix around where I live so I ordered it. I read somewhere that it is only made in New Mexico now and sure enough the writing on the package was all written in Spanish. That may or may not have anything to do with why I didn't like it.<br /><br />I think that this product tasted like vanilla slimfast shakes. I cannot stand slimfast so I was so disappointed. My daughter loves this mix though so it won't go to waste im sure.

review/summary: Miss the old stuff? No longer..
review/text: When Nestle pulled their vanilla Nesquik powder from the US market, I quickly missed one of my favorite coffee sweeteners; I'd almost never used it in milk, few others apparently did, either.<br />Guess the Latin markets still had favor for it, though, as here it is! The Vainilla is slightly different from its late US version: the texture in the can is more granular (to no effect in the drink, that I can tell), and this version is a bit more colored; yellow, to the point that if this is stirred into a cup of hot water *before* any instant coffee is added, the liquid almost looks like commercial lemonade (!). Add the coffee quickly to erase that visual, and enjoy.

review/summary: Not what I expected.
review/text: I purchased this product because I REALLY liked the Nesquick "Very Vanilla". And of course they stopped making it; like they do everything else that I like. It came in a plastic, obling container. This one comes in a round canister. I figured that they would be very close to the same, if not exactly. They are the same brand after all. But I was wrong. This one isn't anything like the other. It is bright yellow to start with. Drinking neon yellow milk is not too appetizing. The taste was completely different. too. I'm not sure how to explain the taste of this one. Except yuck. Ya it is vanilla, tho. But there is some  kind of weird after taste. If you are going to be purchasing this for a child, especially if it is to try to get them to drink their milk, I  would reccomend it. A child wouldn't be bothered by the yellow color. They might even think it's cool. But if you are like me and are trying to replace the "very vanilla" that Nesquik recently discontinued. DON'T. I wish I hadn't. I even purchased an entire case! Big mistake. Oh Ya. One more thing. The writing on the can is mostly Spanish. There is some English but it is not the main language. It is like under the Spanish-just incase we need it. You know how they do with the merchandise here (in the USA); they have a small Spanish translation under the English word. It is the same on this, but reversed. Spanish is the main language. The directions are even in Spanish.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you:)

review/summary: Ok we bought this four months ago...
review/text: I gave a can to my parents, because I couldn't find anything to do with it, and the last can is still laying around the cabinets in the kitchen.  Well, take away vitamin supplements, the beverage is not worth drinking at all.  I am Puerto Rican, while some people may think that Hispanics would all love this, I don't even like it.  Anyway how to describe it is absolutely impossible.  It not as bad as to make you gag, but I expected a similar taste of what you get when you mix milk with vanilla ice cream.  You wont get this with this product.  It's yellow like most people explain, and my 4 year old liked it for a couple of weeks before he completely lost interest on it.<br /><br />Do you want to know about a great vitamin supplemental powder you can put in milk that children love and wont get tired of?  The name is "Rich Chocolate Ovaltine" my 4 year old has been drinking it almost everyday since he was 1 year old.  Never seems to get tired of it.... and ME?  I love it!<br /><br />I thought this Vanilla Nesquik would be a great substitution when (and if) we ever ran out of Ovaltine.  And you know very well how horrible chocolate Nesquik is, I hate it.  My son doesn't seem to like it (he leaves his sippy cup full laying around).  With this one I guess it's official I just can't stand Nesquik products.  They should use me as a flavor tester for their products, their sales would increase I bet.

review/summary: Mixed feelings about this product
review/text: First off, the quality of this product does not measure up to that of any Nestle product I've used before. It's made in Mexico and the consistency of the powder is uneven as if it were poorly manufactured. It's a bright yellow fine powder at one level of the can and it's a darker yellow granule at another level. The taste of the vanilla flavor is totally artificial, but it is good. It tastes exactly like vanilla slim-fast if you've ever had that. I think this may have something to do with the fact that it contains the vitamin complex. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product because it tastes good, it's relatively low in sugar, and it is high in vitamins. The only complaint I have is that the quality of its production is poor. If you want to buy something made in Mexico, it should probably be Tequila or hot sauce. Also, like the other reviewer stated, this is not the same as or even similar to the Very Vanilla flavor previously made by the same company.

review/summary: THE GOLD STANDARD FOR OLIVE OIL - BUT NOT FOR COOKING!
review/text: WHY THIS SIZE:<br /><br />If you are not going to use this everyday, this fifth of a gallon size bottle, is more likely to stay fresh for its entire tenure, in a cool, dry place in your home than one of the super-size tins.<br /><br />WHAT IS "Filippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil"?<br /><br />This is probably the most popular product from this revered time-honored Italian company. Their famous label on the large tin with the coins pictured on it is something I can recall for half a century. This is "Extra-Virgin Olive Oil,Imported from Italy and is stated to be "All Natural & Cold Pressed". Bear in mind that "All Natural" is not "Certified Organic", though they offer Certified Organic from their specialty oil department.<br /><br />SPECIFICS ABOUT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL:<br /><br />This is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their "Extra Light" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />They have a large number of specialty products and a useful website at [...]<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $6. for a fifth of a gallon. However, it does vary regional and depending on the packaging [bottle or tin] may cost somewhat more or less by volume.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: Perfect summer treat!
review/text: I'm a huge fan of iced coffee, but I don't own a coffee pot.  I recall trying Starbucks VIA in stores a few months ago, and the barista telling me that it could dissolve in cold water or milk (unlike normal instant coffees), and tucked it away in the back of my head to try it this summer.  I was pleasantly surprised when Starbucks came out with the VIA Iced Coffee packages, mostly because it was designed for a 16 oz serving and lightly sweetened with sugar (100 calories in the entire packet, 50 calories for an 8 oz serving).  I add it directly to 16 oz of skim milk, add a little extra sweetener, and shake it all up in a water bottle.  It's delicious!  It has the classic Starbucks coffee flavor, without being overly bitter, because the coffee hasn't been brewed.  It dissolves almost instantly, sugar and coffee and all, in COLD liquid, with no residue or sediment at the bottom.<br /><br />At $1.00 a packet, it's not cheap - but it is cheaper than getting an iced coffee at Starbucks, and just as delicious - plus, you don't need to leave your house.  I used to make cold brewed coffee to drink iced, but that has to be done the night before to extract the full flavor, and then you need to strain it, and to make larger quantities was just cumbersome without the right equipment.  I love that I can just pour a packet into a water bottle, add water or milk and sweeteners, and instantly have delicious iced coffee!

review/summary: Too Much Sugar, 83% By Weight!
review/text: Initially I was a fan of Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee. It's convenient, it's tasty, and it's an affordable alternative to an in-store iced coffee. However after taking the product home, I was shocked to discover just how much sugar it contains. The first thing you notice when emptying the packet into a cup is the huge amount of white granules staring back at you.<br /><br />Each VIA packet contains 22g of sugar, and just 4.6g of coffee! This is the equivalent of SIX packets of sugar! Starbucks says each VIA is two servings, meaning 11g of sugar each, but you're likely to have the whole thing (14-16oz with water) in one sitting. That's 100 empty Calories (more if you're adding cream).<br /><br />PROS: Quick, tasty.<br />CONS: Too much sugar, slightly bitter/burnt taste.<br /><br />NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Starbucks needs to either cut the sugar content in half, or make a "light" version using Splenda or Stevia as a sweetener.

review/summary: Looking forward to a low-cal version...
review/text: I love Starbucks iced coffee.  Although an iced coffee is actually one of Starbucks more affordable options, I've spent the summer spending about $50 a month... just in iced coffee!  In an effort to get my spending under control, I thought I would try Starbucks VIA caramel iced coffee.  Although I like the convenience and the lower cost, the drink is VERY sweet.  And certainly, 12g of sugar in a 8 oz serving is more than I would typically add to coffee on my own (a typical sugar packet is 2-4 g).  As someone who prefers to eat her calories as opposed to drinking them, I hope Starbucks will come out with a lightly sweetened option soon, as I do enjoy the caramel flavor.

review/text: Exactly what the product says... dissolves beautifully in cold liquids, and tastes much better than other instant coffees. I've gotten into the habit of adding it directly to some soymilk to make my own iced soy latte. It's on the sweet side (I prefer my coffee to have some bitter notes, this one is all sweet) but since the sugar actually dissolves in cold liquids I'm not complaining too hard. The caffeine level is pretty strong though; I normally have a cup or two of coffee a day and I'm fine, but one packet of this and I was bouncing off the walls. So be warned that while they claim that 1 full packet is a serving, it might not be the case for you.

review/text: I am always in the search for a yummy iced coffee to make at home and am so excited I finally tried this. The price was a little more than I wanted to spend, but compared to the real thing, it's a deal. This is how I make my wonderful glass of iced coffee: First of all, I am one of those people who enjoy a little coffee with their cream and sugar, so I only use a half packet at a time in a tall glass of cold water. I only fill the glass a little over half way full with water and mix in the half packet of coffee. Then, I pour in my milk, almost to the top of the glass, and add 2 HEAPING spoon fulls of condensed sweetened milk that I keep in a container in the fridge where it'll last for a long time. That stuff is a bit sticky, (as is anything wonderfully sweet) so stir stir stir! With a few ice cubes thrown in to keep it cold, it's perfection! No need to add any more sugar since I cut the coffee down and add sweetened condensed milk, either. The only complaint I have is what everyone else has noticed as well, that there is a slightly bitter coffee taste.

review/summary: even better than Frappucino -- WOW!!!
review/text: I was very skeptical when first trying the Iced VIA, particularly since, as others have noted, the addition of sugar (and NOT Splenda, alas) to the mix is clearly stated on the package.  Howver, this product turns out to be a huge win for me.  First of all, unlike the regular or decaf VIA which I also love (see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00451WLYI">Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee, Decaf Italian Roast, 3-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a>), a single serving packet makes 16 oz., not 8 oz -- in other words, you get twice as much.  Second, if you just add a little milk or half and half (I use 4 Mini-Moos for one 16 oz. serving) plus a squirt of your favorite chocolate syrup, it's better than a Mocha Frappucino, and at a fraction of the price for a larger serving than even the large size bottles.  Even throughout the winter, this is my favorite way to start the day.  I'm saving a lot of money by no longer buying Frappucinos, not to mention the effort of lugging a case home from Sam's Club every week.  And the sugar content is LOWER than that of a Frappucino -- even if you add your own chocolate -- which pleases me.  In fact, a Mocha Frappucino out of the glass bottle now tastes too sweet to me.<br /><br />Amazon is apparently getting ready to offer a 50-pack case of Iced VIA, which is fabulous news -- I can't wait!  :)<br /><br />P.S.  To make it easier to prepare, I keep several recycled 16-oz. plastic water bottles in the fridge.  Each time I want a new 16 oz. cup of Iced VIA, I empty one bottle into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KPH6CK">Arc International Luminarc Working Glass, 21-Ounce, Set of 12</a> with one packet of iced VIA mix and add half-and-half and chocolate syrup, then refill the bottle with tap water and return it to the fridge.  No need to use a measuring cup or fuss with ice -- the chilled water is always waiting for me and makes a perfect iced coffee each time!  Another reviewer does the same with skim milk, a great idea which would eliminate the half-and-half for a better nutritional profile.  Either way, delish!!!

review/text: I am a big iced coffee fan, but I don't get to have it that much because I don't like to ice my own coffee and I don't like to pay $5 for a cup of coffee.<br />I was a little leery at first with this coffee.  I have never been a huge fan of Starbucks coffee because I have always found it a bit burnt tasting, but the iced via quickly blew that notion right out of the water.  The coffee comes just a little sweetened.  I opted to add 2 french vanilla liquid coffee mates to my coffee and it was perfect.  The powder dissolves completely and easily.  The price looks a little high at almost $6 for 5 pouches, but that makes each pouch $1.25, which is less than what you would pay for the same thing at starbucks.  Also, if you want to save more, you can drink it without the creamer, I have found that it is sweet enough without the creamer to be enjoyable too!I swear by this stuff and recommend it to everyone.  Even my co-workers agree, this stuff is awesome!

review/summary: Very convenient, good taste, a tiny bit too sweet
review/text: I don't like warm coffee, and my iced coffee needs a little sweetener.  This has a LITTLE too much, but the pure convenience along with the cost makes this worth buying for me.<br /><br />From talking with an ex-Starbucks barista, ordering a large iced coffee at Starbucks gets you 16 oz of coffee, the rest filled with ice.  That's what you're getting here, assuming you got a little sweetener when you ordered it in the store.  Works for me.

review/summary: ridiculously strong, ridiculously good
review/text: So strong, so good; I love it. The Starbucks Via Iced Coffee is delicious and packs a kick. Before I learned of this product, I would drink Redbull, Rockstar, and brewed Starbucks coffee twice a day, making it a very expensive habit. Now, I only rely on one pack of this stuff a day (half the pack in the morning and the other half in the afternoon). It is very unnecessary to drink an entire pack in one sitting. I drank a Redbull the other day and was so disappointed when it wouldn't wake me up. I drank half a pack of Starbucks Via Iced Coffee immediately afterward, and felt extremely energized.<br /><br />I would like to mention that if you are an avid black coffee drinker, this "lightly sweetened" instant coffee may be too sweet for your taste (you people are crazy; sugar makes the world happy!).

review/summary: COMPLETELY ADDICTED... and happy about it.
review/text: I only drink iced coffee, and I've always been on the search for instant iced coffee.  People don't seem to understand that iced coffee is NOT the same as hot coffee with lots of ice in it.  In all my years of searching, there was only one other product that I came across at a high-end boutique grocery store which could compare.  However, it was an imported product, way too light, and cost waaay too much.  I bought Starbucks VIA as soon as it came onto the market.  I've already been addicted to Starbucks for years, but this is taking it to a whole new level for me.  To be able to have iced coffee instantly in the comfort of my home is a miracle!!<br /><br />One packet is good for a VERY large cup, and it is deep in flavor, with just the right amount of sugar.  I add 1/2 cold water and 1/2 milk.  Sometimes I'll make a small (almost like a shot) cup, with a lot of powder, and it is practically like espresso.<br /><br />THANK YOU, STARBUCKS.

I got it in less than a week (for me a record via APO), and works perfectly with the ubiquitous 1-litter water bottle. Everything is in one simple package (includes sugar) just pull the easy rip tab pour into a 1-litter of cold water bottle, shake and perfect coffee every time!<br /><br />My only complaint is you can only buy is boxes of 5 packets, if it came 50 pack i would buy that instead...

review/summary: Better than the gourmet coffee shop
review/text: I used to spend a ridiculous amount of time and money going down to my local coffee shop just to get iced coffee.  I brew my own hot coffee at home and love it but it never turns out the way I like it when I try to drink it iced.  This stuff is incredible!  By adding just a small amount of cream, this tastes even better than the $4 iced coffee I used to have to wait in line for.  I have heard several people say that it's too strong and/or too sweet for their taste.  I usually get my large iced coffees with one sugar and this has about the same.  Using a regular glass seemed to make this too strong for me even (and I like my coffee strong).  I now use a pint glass and it's perfect!  I recently started taking this to work in an Avantro travel mug and I have ice cold coffee that will last me till lunch. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FL23RM">17oz One Mug 3.0 tumbler style with rubber grip ring.

review/summary: finally easy iced coffee
review/text: I love iced coffee but I find it hard to make it well. This makes a nice, very strong cup when made according to directions. Simply add to water and shake (stirring tends to not mix it completely and you end up with some settled at the bottom). I like to mix it in half the amount of water then add milk for the rest of it. No need to add sweetener as it's already sweetened enough to me. Makes for a delicious cup in a fairly short amount of time. As far as drinking it without milk or creamer, I find it hard to do. I can drink hot coffee black, but iced coffee is not as easy, and this is no exception.

review/summary: Sugar Sugar Sugar
review/text: Now, this stuff is quite delicious at first, but becomes a little cloying before you're half done. Just stirring it in a glass is barely enough to dissolve the sugar crystals; vigorously shaking it in a bottle is easiest. I find that I can easily stretch a packet past 16oz, and watering it down helps with the over-sweetness. It is however, a far cheaper alternative to my iced coffee each day, which I'm very grateful for.<br /><br />If they ever create a low sugar version at the same cost, they'll likely have a lifetime customer right here.

When I moved from the city to a small town where the nearest coffee shop is an hour away, I was beside myself until I found this instant iced coffee. It tastes exactly the way I remember - and it's cheaper too.

review/text: The Starbucks Via Iced Caramel is gross. I can't even stomach my first glass of it. I'm a HUGE fan of the regular Iced Via's and drink them daily. I made this with the same amount of water (1 water bottle) and could see immediately that the color was very pale in comparison. I hardly taste any coffee at all, just an overwhelming fake caramel flavoring and WAY too much sugar. Will be tossing the rest and sticking with the original flavor!

review/summary: Good
review/text: I think the Starbucks Via Iced Coffee is pretty comparable to the iced coffee you buy from Starbucks. It's not as good but you can't expect it to be as good as the brew you get from Starbucks so I'm giving it a five stars. It's good for those who don't want to leave the house for Starbucks, it's good for people on the road, and it's good for people wanting to save some money from having to buy an actual iced coffee from Starbucks. It's very easy to make. I usually put it in a water bottle, add some water, shake, and then put it back in the fridge to kind of let it chill all together. The lightly sweetened portion makes for a good treat. On a normal day however, I prefer my coffee/iced coffee to be unsweetened (because I very much enjoy good coffee on its own and because I don't want all the calories from the sugar) so I wish Starbucks would make an Via iced coffee that was unsweetened. I, unlike some of the other reviewers on here, don't find it to be too sweet though. I'm looking to try to Starbucks Via Caramel Iced Coffee next.

review/summary: Great as is! Perfect with a little doctoring...
review/text: This caramel iced coffee mix from Starbucks VIA tastes almost like ordering the real thing from Starbucks, making this a very convenient and cost effective product to drink at home! The instructions say on the package to add 16 ounces of cold water then add milk to taste. My own recipe is for 8 ounces of filtered water and 8 ounces of milk (i usually use 1 percent, may need less milk if using whole). Then, stir the mix thoroughly until completely dissolved. Now, if you want you can add your ice cubes and be done with it. The drink will taste good and sweet as is! However, if you want to really make it taste good, then I suggest doing what I do. I drizzle some Monin caramel over the top. The caramel usually goes straight to the bottom of the cup, which is a good thing because you can then use a straw to suck up a little caramel with every sip, YUM! The monin caramel can be purchased here on amazon! To top it off I use some ready whip, the stuff that you spray out of a can that you get at the grocery store, and drizzle a little more of the monin caramel sauce over the top of that! The end result is just as good or better than ordering from Starbucks....and of course much cheaper!

review/text: My hubby and I really like Starbucks Via! We make up one packet and split it - ends up being two full glasses. It comes out to be the same price as an iced coffee at McDonald's (usually cheaper for us because we buy these on sale/clearance and stock up). Plus, we can make these up whenever we want. We usually add in some skim milk and shake it up in our martini shaker, then pour over ice. Done!

review/summary: Yummy Iced Coffee
review/text: I'll start by saying that I'm usually not a fan of Starbucks coffee in general, but I decided to try this since I love iced coffee and don't always feel like making a coffee run every time I want some.  With that being said, this coffee is delicious, not to mention incredibly convenient.  I start my day by taking a shaker cup filled with skim milk, a packet of coffee, and an equal or two, shake it up and throw it in the fridge.  Then whenever I want some iced coffee it's prepared and ready to go.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would prefer if it came unsweetened.  Obviously, since I add equal I don't find it to be too sweet, but I don't really use sugar and would prefer if I could just use my choice of sweetener instead.

review/summary: Pretty good, and not at all too sweet for my taste...
review/text: I just purchased the regular Via for Iced Coffee today at my local Starbuck's (they ran a free tall beverage of choice offer today, which encouraged my indulgence; The gal was kind enough to upgrade my tall to a grande and give me an extra Via packet gratis!).<br /><br />I was a little disheartened to learn that they don't offer an unsweetened version (just this regular and limited edition caramel flavor), but opted to take the plunge anyway. As someone who typically drinks iced coffees and iced teas without sugar, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the taste of Via is not at all on "sugar overload". The powder mixed and dissolved quickly and the product tastes just as if you had purchased it from your local Starbuck's barista at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Would I purchase it again? In one word; yes! With any luck, they'll come out with a unsweetened version soon, which will then warrant a five star rating.

review/summary: What a refreshing pick-me-up
review/text: Sometimes I like to indulge, and an ice cold caffeinated drink often hits the spot this time of year.<br /><br />I like how quick and easy this makes iced coffee. I substitute milk, and after mixing, I add LOTS of ice. It tastes like I got it at a cafe somewhere, yet it is at least half the cost. I don't measure, but after taste testing, I find I have to use my largest set of tall and wide cups (these little packets make a lot of iced coffee for one person!) The first one I made with a whole packet seemed to at LEAST be Venti sized, and that was BEFORE I added the ice. It was crazy big. So I've started to make two servings with each packet, which doubles the value.<br /><br />The biggest surprise: this stuff mixes VERY well VERY quickly. You won't have any grit in your glass at all. And it hardly tastes instant. I enjoy the level of sweetness it comes with. When I bought this, I did not realize it was pre-sweetened, and I was nervous for a moment. I was afraid it would have a really strong sugar or fake sweetener aftertaste. But luckily, the amount of sweetness is perfect! It definitely has sugar, but it is not THAT much sugar. It actually could have been much worse. This is obviously not a health drink! I consider this stuff to be like dessert...<br /><br />The best part of all is that my husband thinks I worked super hard when I whip these up. He's picky, yet even he thinks they turn out perfect.

review/summary: Definitely LIKE!!!
review/text: I forget how I saw this product originally, but the heat we've been having in Virginia this summer made iced VIA coffee very tempting (hey, and the price is right, too!). I literally just got it and am sipping my first glass now - YUMMY!<br /><br />Now, I'm the type that likes her coffee heavily diluted with cream and sugar (and chocolate, if I'm in the mood for a mocha), so I was a little concerned that this might not be sweet enough. I can say that, although not *terribly* sweet, this is lightly sweet and PERFECT!<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned making it with milk - I think I'll try that tomorrow morning (not tonight; I do want to get some sleep eventually, LOL)<br /><br />So, DEFINITELY recommended - and I'm going to buy several more packs once I hit this review's "submit" button *grinz*

review/summary: Gross and WAY too Sweet
review/text: Milk is almost a requirement.  All I pretty much taste is the sweetner.  It barely tastes like coffee.  It tastes weird and like syrup. The packages are sort of annoying because they only tear like 1/3 the way through.  So, unless you don't mind waiting a minute for the stuff to pour out of that small opening you either need to tear it with your teeth or use scissors.

review/summary: Perfect if you like pre-sweetened drinks
review/text: I purchased the Starbucks VIA iced coffee on a whim at my local Starbucks due to it being on sale.  I love it.  I was nervous about the taste at first because it's pre-sweetened and while I do like sugar in both my hot and cold coffee, I don't like the excessive amounts that Starbucks packs into its bottled Frappuccinos at the grocery store.  The sugar content in those are outrageous.  The sugar in these instant iced coffees I can take and I would say it's half as sweet as the Starbucks bottled Frappuccinos, but still may be too sweet for some.<br /><br />There's one oddity about the pre-measured amount.  The directions say to add 16oz of water (and possibly ice), but most standard drinking glasses are just at (or slightly above) 16oz, so if you like milk or cream in your coffee you're going to have a hard time putting the amount you want without the glass overflowing.  Perhaps I'm one of the few that drinks iced coffee with cream, maybe?  I don't know, but it's annoying (lol).  Not annoying enough to rate the product below 5 stars, though.  Next time I may make a small pitcher of iced coffee by dumping several sticks in 48oz of water and then I don't have to worry about it.  ;)

review/summary: NOT "Lighty Sweetened"
review/text: To be fair I prefer my coffee without sugar, but was not terribly concerned with a "lightly sweetened" product.  However, as previous reviews mention, this is 3/4 sugar and is sickly sweet.  There needs to be a version w/o any sugar (or artificial sweetener) since it does seem to "mix" better with cold water than the other variations of VIA.  (or Starbucks could package an iced version with separate packets of sweetener)  For the time being if you prefer non sweetened iced coffee or prefer to sweeten it to you liking steer away from this.

review/text: As a convenience, this is great coffee.  I do find, however, that is HIGHLY caffeinated.  I made it up in a pitcher that would accommodated 6 servings (recommended number was five) and it did not diminish the taste, but was still quite caffeinated for me.  A good balance of sweetness and blends well with cream if that's your preference.

It's not too sweet..........I only with its price is lower so that I can have several cups a day.<br /><br />I have gone through the whole package(5 packs) in two days, so it will cost me almost $100.00 if I consume three packs a day.<br /><br />I love the taste, but I have to stay with my Taster's Choice for now.  It will be great if an 8 to 12 oz jar is available.

review/summary: "Lightly sweet"???
review/text: What an aggravating product. The package label says "lightly sweet", which sounds perfect, and says that it makes 5 - 16 oz drinks. Checking the Nutrition Facts on the back of the package I see "11 gms of sugar"--sounds reasonable. But when I mix up a packet per directions (in 16 oz.) it was undrinkably sweet. Taking a closer look at the fine print, I discover that although the directions are for one 16 oz. drink per packet, the Nutrition Facts are for "SERVING SIZE 1/2 PACKET and 10 servings per package". My 16 oz. "lightly sweetened" drink contains 22 GRAMS of SUGAR. The packaging is misleading twice over. What could have been a good coffee drink is ruined by our culture's addiction to sugar and corporate labeling practices.

review/summary: Good taste. Too pricey and a little bitter
review/text: Good tasting and a little addictive. I bought it when Starbucks was giving free shipping and now they're tacking on $3 for s/h. That pushes the price up too high, so I guess I'll get it at the grocery store where it is about $7 plus tax.<br /><br />I like to divide these packets almost in half which amounts to about 2 teaspoons which I add to a tall glass of 1% milk leaving room to plunk in about four or five ice cubes. This seems to work for me and doesn't make it taste too bitter. I'm not a strong coffee gal, but this still gives it plenty of coffee flavor. I've followed the directions exactly before making a 16 oz. cup and divided it between me and my hubby. He thinks the strength is perfect, but I think it's too strong. He also likes his coffee black, but I like my cream and sugar.<br /><br />Overall, I think these packets are handy but not the best in the world. Maxwell House makes a good ice coffee. Their french vanilla flavor is very good while the Hazlenut is only okay and too powdery tasting. It is very cheap at $1.80 a box at Walmart. Possibly a little sweeter than Starbucks and you lose all that burnt, bitter taste. No offense to you Starbucks fanatics. Hey, I do love their Mocha and even succumb to paying over $3 for it at the drive through!

review/summary: Great for a quick iced coffee.
review/text: I originally purchased these in my local grocery store and loved them, then searched for the items on Amazon where I was able to purchase a larger quantity for a great price.<br /><br />The Via iced coffee isn't quite as good as if went to Starbucks and purchased it directly from them, and it comes already sweetened, so you don't have the option to customize your drink with Splenda, etc. However, if you're looking for a quick iced coffee it's a great find. I have a Keurig and to make iced coffee, even with the iced coffee pods - I either have to drink my coffee ice cold and watered down or slightly warm. You don't have to worry about that with the Starbucks via, it's a powder, so you can have ice cold coffee without having it get too watery.

review/summary: I absolutely love it
review/text: I am so excited to see that Amazon sells the Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee! I never thought to look before now, and have been ordering it direct from Starbucks and paying their exorbitant shipping charges. I sucked it up because I have to have this coffee. I am not a fan of hot coffee, but I am an iced coffee junkie. I have been known to double fist the 32 oz iced coffees from McDonald's, I am that ridiculous.<br /><br />When the Starbucks Via Iced Coffee came out late last year, I couldn't wait to try it.  I first drank it just with cold water and ice.  It is already sweetened, so we are good to go there.  I missed my sweet, milky iced coffee from McDonald's, so I had to experiment a little bit.  I tried adding a little skim milk.  That helped, it tasted even better.<br /><br />Then I bought a gallon of 2% chocolate milk, and put a bit of that in instead of the regular milk. Oh my gosh! I have a better tasting iced coffee (in my opinion) than I can buy at any cafe.  It is so delicious, and I look forward to it every morning.  I think this VIA is made to be mixed with milk, it is strong so that the rich coffee flavor shines through even with milk mixed in.  When I run out of chocolate milk, I use skim milk with a good squeeze of Nestle Quick syrup, a good alternative.<br /><br />I have been trying to find a good iced coffee to make at home for several years, and this is it...I was brewing whole pots of hot coffee and trying to add ice and vanilla syrup, and coffee creamer...bleh, it was so much work and tasted half as good as this!  Give the VIA a try, you won't be disappointed!

review/text: The taste of this product in my opinion is NASTY to say the least.<br /><br />Nestle's should bring back the recently discontinued (Milk Chocolate) flavor 50000 11164<br /><br />Nestle's you BLEW IT by dropping the Milk Chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Not everyone likes coffee or hot chocolate that is so thick or taste like MUD!!!

review/summary: Packaged goods--not so good.
review/text: I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.

review/summary: Didn't like it, Wrong one
review/text: I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said "Dark Chocolate" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as "Dark Hot" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says "Dark Chocolate" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.

review/summary: Sucralose
review/text: Another non-diet food with artificial sweetener.  I tasted the bitterness of the sucralose, checked the label and sure enough,it was there at the end.  The first ingredient is SUGAR, why ruin it?  Skip this unless you're not on a diet, love sucralose, and not a chocolate lover.  Gross.

review/summary: Terrible - Tastes nothing like store bought product
review/text: I had been purchasing this product for several months at our local grocery store.  The product became unavailable and I couldn"t find it anywhere.  Someone mentioned Amazon so I searched and found it at a decent price.  However, after receiving it and having a cup -  it TASTED nothing like the store bought product.  It tastes exactly like milk chocolate not the dark chocolate it is suppose to be.  There is no way this is the same product - whether its an error in packaging or just a different product I'm not sure.  Now I'm stuck with 100 packs of cocoa that I do not want.  Beware !!!

review/text: Hands down the best cocoa I've had in a long time.  Kept searching for a decent replacement since my stores stopped carrying this.  The only thing that comes close (haven't done a side-by-side taste test) is Hershey's Dutch Hot Chocolate cocoa mix.

review/text: Makes a great cup of sugar free-fat free 25 calorie hot cocoa!  It's not quite as "rich" a product as some of  the gourmet cocoas, but for those of us on restricted diets, it's a really good product. I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof.  I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.  PS Add a dash of cinammon or maybe a little almond flavoring if you feel like having a gourmet cocoa!

review/summary: The best hot cocoa I've ever tasted
review/text: This is, quite simply, the best hot cocoa I've ever tasted.  Being a self-admitted chocoholic, I've tasted a LOT of hot cocoa.  I even prefer Nestle's Double Chocolate Meltdown to pricier choices like Godiva or Ghirardelli.  This cocoa is smoother and more chocolaty than anything else I've found out there.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Excellent in Coffee
review/text: I have been desperately trying to find something to replace the "non-dairy" creamers which I had grown accustomed to in my morning cup of coffee.  I just can't drink coffee without some added sweetening.<br /><br />Then I came across this product!  I can put one tablespoon (and a dash of cinnamon) in my coffee, and I'm good to go.  Easily 60 or more calories less per cup than I was previously drinking.
