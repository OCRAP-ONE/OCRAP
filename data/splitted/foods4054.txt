review/summary: Cinnamon Starbucks Rocks!
review/text: I ordered the Cinnamon-infused as a "second choice" as my favorite, carmel, was out of stock.  Found out I love, love, love the cinnamon!  It's very mild on the Cinnamon yet just enough to give it a smooth, unique flavor with the added bonus of the health benefits from cinnamon!  Would definitely recommend and will order again!

review/summary: Typical Starbucks coffee
review/text: If you like Starbucks coffee, then you should like this product.  As other reviews have stated, the cinnamon flavor is quite faint.  I've tried other coffees that have a cinnamon flavor, and this one falls short.  I still give it 3 stars because I had read the reviews before buying....and it definitely delivers on being good Starbucks coffee.

review/summary: Good, but nothing out of the ordinary
review/text: Don't get me wrong, this is a good product, but I guess I was expecting something with a more robust edge to it and a stronger flavor. As with their caramel coffee, it's a very subtle taste......you don't get the bold taste that's typical of the Starbuck's bold roast coffee I nortmally like. You also don't get the strong "flavored coffee" taste that I like when I buy other flavored coffees (e.g., Maxwell House etc.).<br />That said, if you're looking for a decent coffee that isn't overpowered by the flavoring, this might be a good choice for you

review/summary: Not what I thought it would be
review/text: This coffee base of Latin American beans is foul smelling and tastes bitter and leaves a strong aftertaste after brewing. The cinnamon was subtle but I would not pair it with these beans. It needs a lighter roast to meld the flavors better. I won't be buying this blend and was glad a friend brought her bag over to try so I didn't waste my money.

review/summary: Rank and Bitter
review/text: Why I thought I'd enjoy this coffee:<br /><br />1. My daily coffee is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O9GAPG">Starbucks French Roast Whole Bean Coffee - 2.5 Pounds (40 oz.)</a>(extra bold), which some people think is bitter but I do not find bitter.<br /><br />2. I love cinnamon.<br /><br />3. I loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />4. It's winter and it seemed like it would be a good time to try something different.<br /><br />I don't like this coffee and give it 4 stars.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />1. It is "rank", a term my grandmother used to describe "too much" cinnamon (or "too much" molasses) that makes it offensive. Rank is the perfect word for this.<br /><br />2. It is bitter and to be palatable I had to double my normal amount of sugar.<br /><br />Yes, I did play around with the amount of grounds to use to make the coffee (in my French press).  As I used less coffee grounds it just went watery and did not turn into "not bitter" and "a non-overpowering cinnamon bad taste".<br /><br />I also tried this iced which actually was more palatable and interesting.<br /><br />I'm disappointed in this cinnamon flavor, to say the least and am going back to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O9GAPG">Starbucks French Roast Whole Bean Coffee - 2.5 Pounds (40 oz.)</a>.

review/summary: Cafe y Canela
review/text: Canela is Spanish for "cinnamon"-so this new Starbucks natural fusions coffee has a hint of Brazil. It evokes Ana Rita Simonka's song about a Bengal woman with cinnamon (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00042Y5XC">Bossa Nova Delhi</a>) Cinnamon is commonly used to flavor coffee in South America. Starbucks' taste is alright, the cinnamon isn't that strong. It's not a terrible coffee, but it's not that great either. The cinnamon is subtle to the point of non-existence. Starbucks' Cinnamon Coffee is best accompanied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B4GFNO">Brazilian Cafe</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00075147Q">Acoustic Brazil</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IWNN">Brasileiro</a>. There's a hint of the exotic. It's okay.

review/summary: Starbucks rules, but their Cinnamon Coffee floats
review/text: My mate & I consume more fresh ground coffee by Starbucks, than I ever thought possible. We recently (last year) decided to expand our taste buds, and try some other flavors, other than our usual favorite Breakfast Blend. Everything turned into our newest favorite. We were ridiculous with our 5 different bags of Starbucks Beans Coffee in our freezer. We tried the Cinnamon........ It looked as though our coffee pot was bombed. None of the other coffees do this. Even the competition coffee doesn't do it. After several tries, we decided to discontinue using the Cinnamon. I want to stress, that the flavor wasn't the issue. However the flavor may have something to do with it as well. We noticed that all the other flavors had the same consistency and weight. For some reason the Cinnamon seemed lighter, fluffier. It's as if it was ground differently than the others, making it a different texture, thus allowing it to splatter and float, getting into the carafe, and inevitably into our mouths.......so, maybe Starbucks can remedy, and if they do, we will eagerly retry and enjoy! Thanks- GrayBeard<br /><br />PS- We have tried Starbucks other delicious "Natural" flavors,(i.e.Vanilla, and Caramel) and have NOT experienced the same tragedy. ONLY the Cinnamon has this issue.....interesting, huh?

review/text: I just threw away half a bag of this coffee.  I used one and a half bags because I really, really wanted to like this coffee.  It is without a doubt the worst coffee that I have ever consumed.  It was bitter and the cinnamon "fusion" evidently did not take.  Don't waste your money.  Buy an unflavored coffee and flavor it with your creamer or a flavored syrup.

review/summary: Wonderful Flavored Brew!
review/text: I'm not the biggest fan of flavored coffee, because it's rare that I get one that I actually like.  But Starbucks Natural Fusions Cinnamon is my exception.<br /><br />I bought a bag at Walmart for Christmas, since I try almost every year to find a special coffee to drink for the holidays.  And to my great joy, this one is now my Holiday Coffee!<br /><br />It was wonderful with and without sugar -- I also add cream.  And I'm going to be hard pressed not to drink it year round, it's so good.<br /><br />I'm pondering trying Starbucks other flavors now, but I've never found a vanilla or a caramel (Starbucks two other brews) that I've enjoyed.  But I've been so happy with the Cinnamon, I might try Starbucks' other two flavors to see if the magic strikes again.<br /><br />Good good stuff!

review/summary: PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!
review/text: Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.  In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :)<br /><br />I got a great deal through Amazon on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs.  They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of crap food.  People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal.  But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust.<br /><br />Get these treats.  You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually.

review/summary: Dog loves them
review/text: We purchased these for our poodle.  She is the smaller breed (appx. 10 pounds) so I was a little worried these might be too big.  As a whole piece, the treats might be a little large for her, but they can be broken in two very easily.  The bag actually shows you how to break them in two, of course it's pretty self-explanatory as each treat has a cut down the middle of them.  So, the actual size of the treat should not be an issue for those with large or small dogs!  As far as taste--of course I can only rely on how well our dog likes them-she loves them.  Of course she is a little piggy and likes everything, but she really seems to be more fond of these than cheaper treats we have given her.  Overall I am pleased with these treats and I would recommend them if asked!

review/summary: A+ from picky eater
review/text: In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't buy from Amazon - I bought these at PetSmart, but I wanted to do a product review because these treats are worth buying in bulk - they're amazing!<br /><br />These little treats are wonderful.  I am extremely picky about what my dog eats because he's had digestive problems in the past and also because I believe dogs shouldn't be fed the unwanted junk leftover from the corn/grain industry, food that has been irradiated, or food that is made in questionable countries (cough* China * cough cough).<br /><br />Not only are these Newman's Own treats a good price, they are a good size and are indeed made with quality ingredients.  As another reviewer said, you can literally see the oats and such in the baked treats (see the product picture I took).  Plus, they're shaped like little hearts - adorable!  The best things about these treats, however, are that (1) they're made in Canada from a company we all can trust, and (2) my dog absolutely loves them. These treats are made from certified organic ingredients with 7% fat (min).  With all the pet food recalls and my inherent distaste for low quality, Chinese, irradiated, or high fat treats these treats are a winner!<br /><br />Also, my dog is a terribly picky eater when it comes to treats (which is hilarious because he'd eat cat poop if I let him).  He has never eaten any biscuit that was not literally made in a bakery from a boutique.  This has cost me lots of money in the past (in finding treats he likes, and having to deal with the bags and bags of treats he didn't like such as Blue Buffalo, Mother Hubbard's, and Wellness bars).  I bought a 13oz bag of these at PetSmart today for 5.00 (far less than I spent on the other brands), and my dog will not leave me alone.  He literally dances to get my attention because he wants me to give him one of these treats.  It seems like neither of us could be happier with this product.  If I can remember, I will do an update once the bag is gone to see if this trend has continued.<br /><br />Is there anything Newman's Own cant do?

review/text: Three years ago we found out our dog Bella had severe food allergies.Fish,potatos,veggies,fruit and a few other selected foods are all she can eat. I look and could only find Newmans Own Salmon&Potato treats for her to eat.Since then they come evey 2mths ,by Sub&save. Today when I opened the first package I was shocked. The normally,heart shaped treats that are light, airy, thick, and easy to break,were nothing but,dark,flat,hard to break rocks. So my question is "What Happened?" Not only was it one package but all six. If this is their new product,they lost a customer.But if it was a bad batch, I say how dare they send this out to consumers,take their money,and think its right.Today there are many treats made that she can eat,but I stuck with Newmans out of loyalty,because they were first in making a great product Bella could eat.And Bella really loves this treats.I hope Newmans can fix this.

Unfortunately, my two dogs (male 9 yrs & female 3 yrs) just are not impressed. I think perhaps if the 'cookies' were a little less dry and / or their excellent quality ingredients were just a little more aromatic that they would be more tempting and desired by my spoiled, but well loved dogs. If I break the cookie in half, it seems to release slightly more tasty aroma and I can almost talk the dogs into them.

review/summary: No matter how healthy it is... is nothing if your dog doesn't like it
review/text: I supposed as a treat, this would do better than its dog food. But I was wrong when I received and tried it today. My dog does not like it at all. This treat feels like cookies and very dry. I got a small dog (Yorkshire). I don't know if big dog will find it delicious or not. Just my own experience.

review/summary: Convenient, healthy treats for training
review/text: We use these treat sticks to train our Labrador Retriever puppy. They break cleanly into small bits, are easy to dispense, and don't leave a meaty smell or greasy residue on one's hand. The only downside is that over time, the sticks tend to get rather hard.

review/summary: My Yorkie Loves These Treats!
review/text: I purchased these treats because they were on sale, but also because they're made in the US with safe ingredients.  My Yorkie loves duck breast jerky, but those treats are made in China, and I'm not sure I trust products from there 100% after the poisonous ingredients that were found in China-made dog food in the recent past.  Of course, I didn't expect my dog to enjoy these treats as much as the meaty duck, but he reacts the same way to these cheesey treats as the duck breast!  When I have one of these treats ready for him, his responses to commands (sit, lie down, etc.) are instantaneous - he really wants the treat!  I was concered buying 6 packs at once without first testing them, but now I'm glad I have 6 for him.  GREAT PURCHASE, and I'll be buying other Newman dog products in the future

review/summary: perfect food for my old dog :)
review/text: Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets. After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight. Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years. After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat. That may be age related as well. But the stomach upsets have stopped. And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula.

review/text: Newman's Own Organics Premium Dog Treats were thought to be something that my two dogs (minature daschunds) would enjoy, however Heidi, the older of the two dogs will not eat these treats. She is usually eager to get treats but she turns up her nose to these.  Max, the other dog will eat almost anything so he's getting to partake of the entire purchase.  I will not be reordering any more of this treat because I need something that both dogs enjoy.

review/summary: Natural Treats; a product I trust
review/text: It isn't easy to find packaged food for pets that I can trust.  I have been doing a lot of reading lately about what actually goes into most commercial brand pet foods, and I am appalled.  I decided to start cooking for my brood, but the puppy was going bonkers for bicuits, which was kind of freaking me out.  I never thought I'd find something on the store shelves that satisfied us both...and then, in a WalMart in Honesdale PA (where my family owns a vacation home) I saw these.  I trust Newman's Own, so I read the ingredients.  I was happy, and my dog loves them, but I couldn't seem to find them back home in NJ, so I searched Amazon, and here they were.  I am slated to get a case every other month, but I might need to up that to once a month!

Upon researching the product, and finding them to be a good product as well as a good bargain, we purchased 2 cases of them... not for our dog specifically, but to give them to our local Bank so they could give treats to the dogs in cars that came through the drive up window. (Our dog loves to get treats at the bank)... We have gotten great responses from our friends at the bank.<br />We appreciate giving treats that can be dependable and healthy for our pet family. Thank you!

review/summary: Disappointed, Brownie does not like it at all
review/text: I figured this would be great since Brownie loves Salmon, but he doesn't even want to touch it.  I got him the Salmon and sweet potato one. He'd rather eat regular dog food than this which is quite weird for him.  He eats everything he can get his paws on, including non edible stuff. It might be because the smell is not very strong.  When I put it up close to my nose to smell it, I barely got a light whiff of salmon. Dog treats usually have a stronger smell which makes it more tempting for dogs.

review/summary: Pretty Good Treats
review/text: These are hard treats shaped like hearts that you can break in half if necessary. They have decent ingredients though I try not to give my dogs anything with grain, the oatmeal and barley flour is not too bad. I only give one a day as a late night snack. My Doberman likes them but she is not too picky. My picky Shar-pei will eat them but is not enthusiastic about them (he prefers Merrick sausages). Overall, these are a decent snack for dogs as long as your pet does not have dental issues, these should be okay for them.  I want to make a comment about the packaging. This is one of the few "zip-loc" type resealable bags that actually reseals without having to mess with it a bunch of times. It stays nice and tight and keeps the treats fresh.

review/summary: small - not medium - sized treats
review/text: I'd purchased these dog treats in a local store (Medium sized) and it was a great size for my dog, my dog loved the treats and I thought that the ingredients were okay for my dog.  When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6.  Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats.  Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item.  I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats.  I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium.

review/summary: Good Treats
review/text: My dog loves these, and I believe (and hope not to be disappointed) that the Newman's Own Organics brand is to be trusted.<br /><br />The treats are small, and no doubt healthy, but I wish they listed the calories on their package. The ingredients are all good, but I'm trying to control my older dog's weight, and if these were very high-calorie, I wouldn't feed them to her. I'd look for something else. (I know, carrots and other veggies, but she won't eat them. She's a 9 year old rescue with terrible teeth, and set in her ways. My past puppies found baby carrots a great treat, but not this girl.)<br /><br />Maybe I'll contact the manufacturer and ask for the calorie count. But I do think it should be on the package.

review/text: My three dogs really love these treats.  They are made in the USA and reasonably priced.  One word of caution - I use these to stuff a "Waggle" bone and let my Dal go at it.  He loves it, but if he lays down with the Waggle on a light colored rug, the crumbs that fall out will discolor the rug if they get wet.  No big deal as the discoloration seems to wash out just fine.

review/text: My dog loves Newman's Chicken and rice organic dog food, which I have Amazon ship every 2 months. She also loves the Happy Hips brand of treats. I was excited to see Newman also offered treats, so I tried the Salmon and sweet potato. Unfortunately, she does not like this product, probably because it is in biscuit form.<br /><br />Now I somehow have to make her eat these over the next several months, even if I have to grind them up and put in her regular food.

I have purchased other treats and found that I had to give them all to my second dog (who is in danger of getting fat!).  Not Newman's Own Cheese Treats! My picky eater loves them and eagerly competes with my other dog for her share. Excellent product.

review/text: Apple Cinnamon Cheerios are really good, they taste like apple jacks but healthier. The price may fluctuate, but at the price the day I write this it works out about 50 cents a bowl, for 96 bowls. A typical cereal box is about 13 ounces at $4, or about 30 cents an ounce. You are of course paying extra for the bowl.  We bought these for a boy scout camping trip as a back up to regular breakfast, in order to be prepared for emergencies.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/summary: Neatest thing since sliced toast
review/text: What a great thing Amazon has provided for us here. Twelve pouches at 16 ounces each of Fancy Feast Filet Mignon dry cat food.<br />Number 1: Kitties Like Food. I have two kitties who love Fancy Feast Dry Food and the Filet Mignon is their favorite. I free feed them their kibble and mix the Fancy Feast Flavors together. They never tire of it and nibble on it day and night. My bowl holds 48 ounces so, once full, I do not have to clean it for about a week. Then it is time for cleaning and refilling. I do not know what it is about the taste of Fancy Feast, but my guys will snub Iams, tolerate 9-Lives and walk away from the cheap stuff. But, the middle of the road, Fancy Feast, they love.<br />Number 2: Kitties stay healthy. Both kitties just went for their yearly check up and shots. Both are quite trim and not the least overweight, though they have Fancy Feast available at all times. The Vet gave them a 100% clean bill of health. So, I feel, that though I am not paying the heavtiest price for the "Food with Everything" this food must be quite sufficient for the needs of my two housemates. They do receive one can of wet food (3 ounce type) per day to go with their Kibble. One kitty is a male and I feed the wet food because I know he needs as much fluid as he will take in to preserve his urinary system.<br />Number 3: This 12 pack is convenient for me. I am not as young as I once was and hauling around great large bags of dry food is not something I still manage easily. Also, I store a ready amount of dry food in my closet for the kitties so it is coveniently close to their bowl for refills. My bowl holds 48 ounces and I mix the kinds of Fancy Feast Dry in it so that the full bowl lasts about a week. So, with small packages, I am able to open one, put it in the bowl, toss the packaging and go on. Also several small packages fit easily in the closet. The others await in the garage. Since they are individually packed in small amounts, they stay fresher than the larger bags.<br />Number 4. I am happy. I am happy with the arrangement this 12 pack allows me. The kitties are happy to eat it and remain healthy. It costs a few pennies an ounce and is delivered to my door step. I have this set up to be delivered on a recurrent basis.<br />The entire package of happy kitty, good nutrition, and a satisfied owner will keep me getting this product as long as I have use for it and Amazon makes it available.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042DEDJA">Purina Pet Care Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00437H0OA">Purina Pet Care Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Chocolate Cuisine
review/text: I like chocolate.  Despite eating chocolate products since I was three or four, I still eat it every time I have an opportunity.  Unfortunately, I have been diagnosed diabetic and warned off most chocolate.  Most such products have lots of sugar which spikes my blood sugar.<br /><br />I habitually search for healthy food, especially snacks.  I seek food that is low in  sodium, low sugar, high protein and high fiber.  As a diabetic, I also search for food that does not lead to sugar highs or lows.<br /><br />Extend Shakes are ideal for my needs.  This is chocolate without all the sugar.  Extend Shakes have only 110 Calories, 1.5 grams of fat (no saturated or trans fats), 1 gram of sugar, and only 120 mg of sodium.  In addition they have only 12 grams of carbohydrate and zero cholesterol.  As a bonus, Extend Shakes have 15 grams of protein.  They also contain 24 vitamins and minerals<br /><br />I mix my Extend Shake powder in light soy milk, which is smooth and tasty without having many calories (70).  I understand that skim milk is also good. When dieting I plan to mix it with water to save another 70 calories.<br /><br />Because Extend Shakes use uncooked cornstarch and soy protein, they digest very slowly.  After drinking an Extend Shake, I feel refreshed and not hungry for at least four hours.  With their documented hunger control, these shakes are great for anyone on a diet to lose weight,<br /><br />Also, the Chocolate flavor is delicious.  I highly recommend this product.

It must be great to run a business where you can short a customer's order by 20% and not address it! I'd rather get a note from them that life's like that... than to be totally ignored. I don't view this as Amazon's problem at all, it's the manufacturers problem.

review/summary: Yes, but ...
review/text: I agree with previous reviews.  The shakes are tasty -- I mix them with sugar-free chocolate milk -- and they do help stabilize blood sugar.  They are a good source of protein, too.  The company's customer service, however, is pitiful.  I have tried to order directly from their website.  Orders take forever to ship; mistakes are common; and attempts to correct those mistakes are met with an attitude bordering on clueless (or careless, as in Do Not Care).  Not a pretty picture.  If it weren't for the fact that they have targeted a niche market, I would guess they would drive themselves out of business pretty fast.

I mix with water and ice and shake it vigorously and viola' a tasty thick drink.<br /><br />It does take a little shaking and stirring. I'm sure it would be much creamier made in a blender but it's fine for me to just stir and shake. Instructions say better with milk I but have not tried it that way. I'm sure it would be tastier than just with the water. But all in all a good product for me. A lower price would be a plus.

review/summary: FOR DIABETICS: WORKS WELL - GREAT TASTE!
review/text: These bars are tasty and do maintain sugar levels as advertised.<br /><br />The sugar maintenance has something to do with the principle that because they are low on the glycemic index, the body breaks down these complex carbohydrates gradually and releases nutrients into your system more slowly.  This is especially important when you sleep.  If you sleep on an empty stomach, your pancreas will secrete sugar it thinks you need but a diabetic does not handle the sugar properly. I'm not a doctor, but my understanding is anything in your stomach will shut off the extra sugar the pancreas may release.  Eating something such as these bars which have "0" grams of sugar and high in complex carbs helps maintain the sugar levels and avoids the spiked highs and lows.

review/text: i've often used instant coffee in a jar since no one else in the house drinks it and making a pot regardless of the size is a bit of a hassle. jar coffee loses its robust-ness after a while, it sort of 'stales'. being this coffee comes in little single serve sleeves it is always fresh. and the flavor was surprising and when it hits the hot water it smells brewed, mmm good. i first tried it when i picked up a pack of 6 at my local target for only $1. so then i thought i'd see if i can get a better deal on amazon for larger quantity. i don't care for super strong starbuck kind of coffee so i make mine using about 10-12oz of water verses the recommended 8oz. but if you like yours more full bodied i don't think this coffee will disappoint. ps. DO NOT buy Superior's brand of instant decaf, even tho i prefer weaker coffee i had to use 4 of their individual packets to get even a slightly mild flavor, it was much cheaper than tasters choice and as we learn over and over again 'you get what you paid for'... so now i'm back ordering the good stuf

review/summary: Great coffee, but not enough
review/text: I love this coffee, I switched to decaf with pregnancy and breastfeeding. My husband still brews regular coffee in the coffee maker, so I use these to make my own coffee in the morning. I really love the taste, in fact I prefer it over the coffee we have drank for years. But they are made for 6 oz of water, which is not enough, so I usually use an extra 1/2 packet with about 10 ounces of water. Since I usually drink 2 cups, I use about 3 packets a day.<br />When I do need a little caffeine, I put a small amount of regular coffee (from our coffee maker) in the cup and then use hot water and one packet - it is a perfect mix of mostly decaf with a little caffeine and the right strength for taste - and the packets last me longer.<br />I found that some of the grocery stores sell these 20 count packages for $3.99 which is less than the current price of $33.72 for 8.

review/summary: A Great Decaf Blend
review/text: As a decaf coffee drinker, almost exclusively, I have sampled a number of different K-cup decafs.  There is a surprising range in quality of these coffees. The Caribou version is extremely good to me and deserves five stars.  It yields a fairly strong coffee even when made in the largest size.  Decafs seems to be more expensive than regular coffees in general and this is true for the Caribou brand. However, it sure isn't the most expensive and is consistently of good quality. Getting the 24 count package provides a nice supply.  I do usually have maybe 3 or 4 brands available, but go to the Caribou most frequently.

Some have been okay whereas others were pretty weak and didn't have a smooth taste. Caribou has a good coffee taste and is very satisfying. Overall, this represents one of my favorite decaffs for my Keurig coffee makers. Thus, Caribou is satisfying in both the regular and decaff versions.

review/summary: Good but weak flavor
review/text: This coffee has a good, well rounded flavor but it was very weak.  I need to compensate by making a smaller cup than when using Tully's decaf french roast.  Disappointing as I usually like Caribou's regular ground decaf coffees.
