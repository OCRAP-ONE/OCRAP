review/summary: Love it!  But huge on sodium though.
review/text: Flamin' Buffalo Chick + A1 are my all time favorites. The meat is tender, and the taste (based on the ones I've bought) are extreme with flavor. The only problem with jerky is the salt, and these have a ton of it. I wouldn't consume more then one bag a day, but it's your choice and body. I'll definitely be buying more in the future though, because these are delicious.

review/summary: Downright Addictive!
review/text: These are a great go-to snack/meal when you're in a rush and don't want chips or hotdogs.<br /><br />The nuggets are about the size of a stack of three quarters with some smaller ones the size of a couple of nickels.<br /><br />The flavor is spicy with a nice tang.<br /><br />The texture is softer than jerky but not as soft as say summer sausage.<br /><br />Quick comment on quantity - there are three servings, 60 calories each, in the package.  This ends up being a little over a handful for the entire package.<br /><br />Great to have on hand for those on the go times.

review/summary: Mildly Spicy
review/text: I thought this would be spicy, and coming from someone who eats spicy food all the time and fire sauce on his burritos, this is really only mild. This does not make your nose run, or make your throat burn, ears tingle, which is the funnest part of eating spicy food. Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6-8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience. Just in case you don't eat it all in one sitting, the bag contains a zip-lock storage to keep things sealed. It will last 3 days after opening without refrigeration.

review/summary: Awesome "Hot Wing" supplement
review/text: Ive always been a big Jack Links jerky fan.  I usually buy a couple bags a month, but last month I was in Vegas and they were out of A1 flavor...my personal favorite!<br /><br />I looked around the store and found these!  I opened the bag and had a few on my way to the pool, they were awesome.  Anybody that loves chicken wings should give these a taste.  The chicken is tender and quite generous in size.  I was pretty surprised they even brought a bead of sweat to my forehead, usually store bought "buffalo" flavors don't accomplish that.<br /><br />As another reviewer said these are great if you love chicken wings but don't wanna down 200 calories a piece for that spicy burn.  I do have to say these are impossible to find in WI though, so luckily amazon has them, and at a good price for a pack of 8 bags!

They weren't nearly as good as the ones I have purchased in gas stations.  Makes you wonder why that would be. These were tough and much drier then I expected. I have to say I will not order them again through the mail. If they had been fresher I would have rated them as I love them because I really do.

review/summary: dark meat
review/text: All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)

review/text: I don't eat beef and having a jerky snack around is nice.  Bag is enormous for what's inside it.  There's basically food in the bottom 3 inches of the bag, and, because of the sauce, if you reach your hand in instead of shaking it out of the bag into your hand, you'll end up with dirty hands.  A much smaller bag would make sense.  I'd also like to see more for the price.  Flavor is good.

review/summary: Best Tuna I've ever eaten!
review/text: I'm a 58 year old grandma, and I can say without any reservations that this is the BEST canned tuna I've ever had -- including the home-canned tuna my grandmother used to make when I was a child.  Yes, it's expensive, but I guarantee you will be able to tell the difference, and the difference is worth the price to me.  This product is sometimes found in health food stores, but they are really just starting to expand their distribution, and you may not be able to find it locally just yet.<br /><br />If you want a can of tuna that comes with just Tuna (no phosphates or hydrogenated anything), salt (low sodium) and water, try it.  If you like it, take one of the boxes to your local health food other other local market and ask them to carry it.  Help this company expand, and then we'll all be able to find it on our grocery store shelves -- maybe even at a better price.  In the meantime, I'm putting in my free shipping order today!

review/summary: Best tuna ever tasted!
review/text: I bought some of this tuna on clearance from my local Food Lion for about a dollar a can.  I had never had tuna like this before.  It is like eating a filet of tuna.  I pair it with Glutino crackers and it is divine.  If you can afford the price, it is well worth it.  I feel better about eating tuna that is randomly tested for mercury and PCB's and I like that it is caught responsibly and that some proceeds will go to help sea turtle preservation.  This is the kind of company I like to support if I can afford it!

review/summary: Not the tuna it used to be!
review/text: Have used this product for years, since my first purchase. Have regularly received this product through Subscribe & Save for a couple years. The last 3 deliveries showed me a product no longer a solid, desireable piece of fish but a pressed-together lump of mixed light and dark tuna. Does it taste okay? Yes. Is this sashimi quality gourmet canned tuna? I think not. Cancelling regular delivery.

review/summary: Wonderful Tuna!
review/text: This is the best tuna I've ever eaten.  No water or oil added, it is all tuna.  The meat is solid, no little chunks floating around in water, and very little natural oil.  The five ounce can gives you five full ounces of tuna, completely usable.  It is worth the money to buy such a quality product.

review/summary: As good as albacore tuna gets
review/text: If you like albacore tuna in natural juices, that is, without olive oil and added water, this is superlative food.  When comparing prices note that different size cans are sold.  The cans are generally well packed without too much space.  After consuming one-hundred portions, I have never been disappointed with taste, texture, appearance, or value, meaning the amount actually in the can.  It is fillet, not chunks.  Tuna is wonderfully healthful, though not equal to salmon in that respect.  If one eats from the can/jar, as I do, the only equivalent for taste may be imported Yellowfin Tonnino in olive oil.

review/summary: Used to Be Awesome, Still Pretty Good
review/text: I started buying Henry and Lisa's Tuna about a year ago and it was excellent. It was seriously a solid tuna loin in a can that had no fishy smell- you can't beat that. Unfortunately it's gotten progressively less quality with each shipment. At first there was some less quality filler tuna around the edges, and now it seems the cans more frequently only contain the less quality meat. Some of the glowing reviews here are from about a year ago and in my experience the product has changed since then.<br /><br />It is still better than most other brands that I have tried and it's the only tuna I can eat without having to hide the smell and taste with tons of condiments. The extra cost of the tuna is partially offset by what I save in condiments.<br /><br /> I'm giving it 4 stars for the BPA -free can, dolphin safe, and that it's still comparatively good tuna.

review/summary: Must have for our outdoor trips!
review/text: I first discovered this brand 4 yrs ago at Wholefoods when preparing for a trip to a national park. I bought this one and another one among the highest priced caned fish, and compared them side by side, this one won hands down.<br /><br />What I like:<br />- It is very tasty, and canned in its own juice instead of spring water that most of other brands use.<br />- It has a loop which you can pull the can open. This is an indispensable feature for my outdoor activities. Again, most of the other caned ones don't have.<br /><br />Since I discovered this product and its salmon version (which is also delicious), they become my lunch staple together with some tomatoes and apples, whenever we go out on a whole day biking, hiking or xc skiing trip.

review/summary: Excellent - but Wild Planet is equivalent---in every way---at half the price.
review/text: This Henry & Lisa's albacore tuna is excellent - but Wild Planet albacore is just as excellent (or better) at less than half the price.  (Try them both and see for yourself!)  So even though the quality is equivalent--- including five to six times the omega threes, sustainable pole caught, and very low mercury as a result of handpicking smaller (younger) albacore --- I rate this tuna down a star for being way overpriced.

review/summary: Extraordinary tuna!
review/text: I have been eating "tuna fish" from cans from the time I was a little kid (I didn't even know it was called "tuna" I thought it was something called "tuna fish").  First packed in oil (heavy and gross) then packed in water (much lighter, less taste and texture).  I would squish the top of the can in until the tuna was dry as a bone, then  load it up with mayo and a little lemon.  After years of doing this I got the "recipe" pretty much down and I've enjoyed my occasional tuna sandwiches for years.  Henry & Lisa's is so different it bears almost no resemblance to tuna as I knew it.  It is so fresh tasting and flavorful it's amazing and hard to describe.  The texture and moistness, even with very little (or even no) mayo is unlike any tuna I've tasted.  It's packed, as I understand it, in the natural oils that are released when it is cooked.  It is not a lot of oil, certainly far less than in conventional tuna.  At first I drained the oil out, like I did with "regular" tuna, now I leave all or most of it in and mix in a little bit of mayo and lemon and it comes out just perfect.  This natural oil is extremely healthy and high in omega 3 fatty acids.  In a pinch, this could be a perfect snack with nothing added, straight out of the can.  Just crush it up and mix it with it's own oil in the can and you have a self contained instant healthy snack.  I prefer to mix in the two ingredients in to make it just the way I like it.<br /><br />I was so impressed with this tuna I decided I'd try and duplicate it with expensive fresh tuna bought at a fancy upscale supermarket. To make a long story short, I was totally unsuccessful.  Apparently the process is not easy to duplicate in your kitchen.<br /><br />I would encourage you to buy three cans and see what you think.  If you like tuna, you will simply be amazed at how good this is.  I am on the once every two month plan where they send me three cans every other month.  I'm thinking of moving up to once a month.  Three a month is just not enough!  This plan helps you to save a few more dollars and it comes out to a little over $5.50 a can.  Expensive, to be sure but entirely worth it!

The 'but...' on my review title is that it has gone up in price by $5 in the last month or so.  What gives?  I was signed up for subscribe and save but now I am reconsidering.  I have done some cursory checking and this appears to be the most expensive canned tuna I can find.

review/text: This is the genuine stuff imported from Sweden. It's one of the best known brands for jam and holds a high quality. You get what you expect.<br />So, this is the proper stuff to get unless you live in Sweden. Only lazy swedes would buy this stuff, not because it is bad, but because a proper Swede will go out in to the forest, forced by parents or relatives to pick it on days when you just know you should have said no and stayed at home watching tv, to pick it themselves. They will then make enough jam to last a full year, almost for free (you do have to pay for the sugar).<br /><br />According to my sisters boyfriend, Lingonberry jam is best served with everything!

He made a smoothie with this jam and some soy milk and other ingredients, which I have since forgotten.  Ordered from Amazon.com (where else) and it arrived practically overnight.  Couldn't find Oz's recipe but this jam makes bagels and English muffins absolutely delicious!  Better than blueberry, strawberry, orange marmalade....  I should have bought a dozen jars instead of two.  If Oz says is good for me, that's fantastic but as far as I am concerned, this jam has now become a daily breakfast staple.  Thanks.

review/summary: A Great "Tough" Jerky
review/text: I don't write a lot of reviews, the but one negative one on this product shocked me and I just had to give my own opinion.  Taste is a subjective thing, but I think this product is awesome.  Enough so that I mail order it regularly.  The best thing about the non-vegetarian jerky I grew up with was the tough chewy experience of it.  This jerky manages to recreate that experience and tastes fantastic.  Try it and form your own opinion.

I love that it isn't spongy, or sawdust tasting like some of the other jerkys I have tried....some of them were ever, slimy, something a jerky should never be in my eyes.  Only 80 calories per serving, and a whopping 13 grams of protein.  Wonderful stuff!  Off to order more now.....

review/summary: Great Jerky!
review/text: After going vegan for a little over a year now, I think one of the few things I missed was chomping on jerky.<br />So after seeing online somewhere that Tofurky Jerky wasn't available I ordered one package of Original Hickory Pepper flavor from Vegan Dream. It's very good. Very tasty. Very good texture. My meat eating husband even said that it's really good jerky and there's none of that grizzle stuff you end up with in your mouth sometimes while eating real meat jerky. I've ordered twice now and I'll be ordering more!

review/summary: Best vegan jerky I have ever eaten in my life!
review/text: I have tried every brand of vegan jerky known to man, including primal strips (gross!)  This brand was the closest tasting to the real thing, if not better!  Most vegan jerky tastes like canned dog food with the texture of wet cardboard.  I purchased the hickory flavor of this brand, it wasn't wet, was nice and chewy and had an perfectly balanced flavor.  No weird chemical taste.  It might be a little pricey but I would gladly pay extra for the best.

review/text: I've been veggie for a little over a year and jerky is something that I missed, mostly because I liked the chewy texture and saltiness of beef jerky. This product is very much like the real thing as far as texture and taste. I love this product and I'll be ordering other flavors to try them out as well. I would recommend this product to any of my meat eating friends.

review/summary: Concept?  Great.  Performance?  Blah.
review/text: Not being a food chemist, I'm not sure what the deal is here with vegan and vegetarian "meats."  I really like most veggie-based patties, "chicken" bits, and breakfast sausages.  However, the various "brats" that I so desperately want to grill are, for the most part, terrible.  And I don't just mean "not meat-like."  I mean, they don't taste very good.<br /><br />The food chemists at the famous Monell Chemical Senses Center have, as I remember, "hamburger in a vial."  That is, with your eyes closed, they can fool you into thinking there is a grilled hamburger in front of your face, when in reality it is a combination of chemicals they have isolated from this product.<br /><br />So how hard can it be to really simulate the flavor of bratwurst?<br /><br />In this case, it's jerky.  It kinda looks okay (needs more imperfections... lumps and bumps), has somewhat the same consistency (you gotta pull hard or break off a piece), and, as far as the "original hickory pepper" flavor, you can tell it has pepper.<br /><br />But that first bite made me think of those veggie brats.  Not a good association.<br /><br />I guess this just needs to be an acquired taste.  I do appreciate the effort... the vegan product, the non-GMO soy, and the low-fat (in this case, 0 grams of fat) product.<br /><br />But can't those Monell scientists work up a vial of "jerky taste and smell?"<br /><br />I'll be waiting.

review/summary: My Favorite Unusual "Candy"
review/text: Of course, Sen-Sen is not really candy at all: it is a monumentally strong breath freshener.  It makes Altoids mints seem like pitiful weak kid stuff by comparison.  It's been around for more than 100 years!  Those of us with sophisticated adult palates can appreciate quality bitter tastes in coffees, salad greens, beers, etc...and in this unique licorice "mint".  There is an almost soap-like flavor present, but I think it's more a "knee-jerk" tastebud reaction to the extremely concentrated flavor.  For the most part, kids don't seem to like Sen-Sen, which is fine...leaves more for us grups.  Definitely an acquired taste, but certainly a taste worth acquiring!

review/summary: SO Disappointed Does not taste like the ORIGINAL at all.
review/text: I am very disappointed in these Sen-Sen's. I purchased them because they reminded me of my grandmother. When I was a child 45 years ago my grandmother had Sen-Sen all the time. She used to give me a packets and I loved them as a child. I sometimes would dump the entire packet in mouth. I just loved them as a child. I ordered these so happy to have found them again and I have to say they taste NOTHING like the original Sen-Sen. A faint remnant of the taste but really these are just terrible and barely edible. The old ones were also perfect little cut squares and these are all cut uneven. NOT the original recipe at all. Rate-YUK..wish I could return them

review/summary: If you like licorice......
review/text: Before TicTac....before those little bottles of Binaca...long before those "curiously strong mints"...there was SEN SEN.  One of the original breath fresheners, SEN SEN is a powerhouse.  Word to the wise, the main flavor is licorice so you better like this flavor if you're buying this product.  By the way, SEN SEN got a high profile honorable mention in a Billy Joel song back in the 80s.<br /><br />So, you need a breath freshener?  Like licorice flavors?  Then get some of these really tiny squares, pop one in your mouth, and warn your friends to stay back 100 feet until the initial rush is over.

To the unfamiliar, you're not supposed to pop a bunch of them in your mouth like they are Nerds or cinnamon candy or something. If you try that, you get a mouth-ful of overwhelming flavor that might turn you off to a good little candy.

review/summary: You Can Be Young Again
review/text: It was a treat to once again see Sen-Sen.  As a teenager in the 1950s, it seemed to me that everyone had a bag of Sen-Sens in their pocket and their unique flavor and aroma were everywhere.  Used to drive teachers mad; one warned us that it was a tool for drunks to disquise their breath.  Well, at least it wasn't chewing gum (the real candy culprit in those days) so it was consumed openly in class.<br />So to relive my past, I ordered it from Candy Crate and it came quickly and just as they described.  No complaints from me.  Thanks, Candy Crate.

review/summary: Warning: this is definitely an acquired taste!
review/text: I first encountered Sen-Sen about 45 years ago as a kid.  I found it next to a store checkout and bought myself a pack.  I had read about it in some book I loved and thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I fell in love with the taste.  Sen-Sen was my entre to my love of black licorice, the really strong stuff that you can only get from Italy or the Netherlands.<br /><br />I've had friends ask to sample it.  I first warn them to take ONE tiny square.  And then I warn them not to chew it.  And then I reassure them it's okay if they spit it out.  (About half of them do.)<br /><br />The ones who can take Sen-Sen usually become fans (or at least, they'll ask me for some every time they see me.)  That's why I buy a dozen packs at a time.  Not only is it tough finding it locally, but with a dozen packs, I have stocking stuffers for all those friends who ask for mine.

Mmmm -- you really get socked with a tidal wave of taste (LOL).<br /><br />Sen Sen was gone from the scene for a while, so I'm REALLY glad it's back -- and I am much more circumspect nowadays with how many I pop into my mouth at once.<br /><br />Oh yes -- they ARE effective breath mints too!!!
