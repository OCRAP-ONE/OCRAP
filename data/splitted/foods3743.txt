review/summary: Hairball treats that finally worked for us
review/text: Adopted a 11 month  scrawny. brown, gold eyed, semi-long haired, himalayan kitty from the pound 3 years ago. Who would give up such a beautiful cat? Within two days we found out why. Two to four inch long brown poop like lines throughout the house on beige carpet. Upon careful examination discovered this poop-like substance was partially digested cat food and hairballs. Once we bought a cat comb and various hairball treatments, that didn't work, we tried Friskies hairball treats. Finally something that works. We played with dosages for awhile and Tasha needs 8 hairball trears every day. Now have a healthy, happy cat.

review/summary: Kitty crack
review/text: Tsering DEMANDS these the moment I get home from work.  On weekends, she starts begging for them around noon.  These things are like kitty crack.  I'm giving them to her every day because she insists on it.  (I am so pussy whipped)  If you are having trouble getting your cat to eat a hairball remedy snack, oh, try these.<br /><br />I do worry about giving them to her every single day.  The instructions say to do that when there are symptoms of hairballs, otherwise do it once or twice a week.  Glad another reviewer is giving them daily, too, though they're doing it for a better reason.  (I used to have Himalayans.  I wish I had known about these treats back then.  You should have seen the splatters on the wall from me putting petromalt on Muffler's paw and her flinging it off.)<br /><br />I've lost cats to lipidosis and megacolon, and it wouldn't surprise me if hairballs contributed to those conditions.  If the hairball blocks something past the stomach...<br /><br />These are kitty junk food, and the petrolatum probably blocks nutrient absorption right after she eats them, but that's just for a small part of the day.  The rest of the day she eats kitty health food -  Evo no-grain low-card diet dry.

review/summary: I was dissapointed
review/text: I didn't bother reading the reviews, due tho the fact that my only purpose is to get a cat treat that my cat is not allergic to. I had a alergy blood testdone due to my cats skin, and was told from the results that The crunchy hairball remedy was the only cat treat on the list that he could have. I ordered it thinking that it was the same as advertized and the next day i saw that the package was different in the picture, and now it sais tarter controll.<br />I e-mailed amazon, and they bacically said it eas to late, i can either refuse the order, or send it back, and they will pay shipping. I really do appreciate that amazon, and will continue shopping here. I just wish i was informed of the change by the title. Please take that old information down and put up what you are really selling us consumers. That way we will have no issues. znd i wonder why i ordered 5 days ago and was told that it was to late to cancel, and just today i got an e mail saying that my treats will be shipping my order,and my order NOW cannot be canceled. i can't understand why it could not be cancelled 3 days ago?<br /><br />HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM  STRANGE<br />Thants my story and why i only gave you 1 star

review/summary: I'm confused
review/text: I purchased this item as a replacement for a discontinued Purina item (Hairball Remedy Crunchy Tuna flavor).  I then called Purina to ask why the previous item was no longer available and they said this is NOT a hairball treat so I canceled my order.  I'm confused based on previous reviews and the product description.  They suggested a few items one of which is Friskies Indoor crunchy cat food which I will try.  Although it doesn't have the active ingredient of the discontinued item (petrolatum) Purina thought the high fiber would help. I am not sure why this is advertised as a hairball remedy and without trying it with my kitty I don't have proof....I just wanted to give a heads up to help anyone else.

She loves them so much, that it's actually annoying!  She sits where the treats are kept and begs whenever she has the chance!  When I finally give it, she gobbles them up faster than anything I've seen her eat before!  She's a skinny minny, so she can have as many treats as she'd like, in my opinion.  Also, these are SO affordable!  I bought her a case!  :-)

I subtracted a star only because it's not *quite* the same as the real thing, but it's close enough for me!<br /><br />Real grapefruit, it seems, has something in it which can rush your medication into your bloodstream and cause an overdose even though you are taking as prescribed. No danger here because the flavor is artificial and the dangers of artificial flavors are lots less than ignoring medication warnings. THANKS CRYSTAL LIGHT & AMAZON! I love this stuff!

review/text: This is the favorite crystal light flavor in my household.  The perfect combination of sweet and tart.  I would describe the flavor as a hybrid of lemonade and fruit punch.  We also drink a lot of lemonade that we get from a big warehouse store but prefer the grapefruit flavor.<br /><br />I would rate this 5 stars were it not for the fact that the mix seems to have a lot of sediment at the bottom over time, requiring regular shakes.  This is not true of lemonade.  It's a small inconvenience for an otherwise great product.  And the amazon subscribe & save price is a great deal compared to anything but warehouse-sized discounts (which I've not found for this flavor).

review/summary: Funny taste!  Did they change the ingredients?
review/text: I have enjoyed this flavor for several years.  I usually buy in large quantities because it really is a difficult flavor to find.  I just received my order from this listing.  The containers are different.  The packaging is white, and rather than the little plastic "tubs" with the foil sealed top, the powder now comes in a sealed pouch.  It is essentially a larger version of the little single serving pouches that are sold everywhere which you can add to a bottled water.  Well, the new packaging doesn't bother me (who cares), but the taste is very different, and NOT in a good way!  There is a strong artificial sweetener taste, and a very strong AFTERTASTE!  I am very disappointed because I really liked the original Ruby Red Grapefruit flavor.  A few years ago they changed the original flavor to the "Sunrise" Ruby Red Grapefruit, which was OK, but I never really liked how the drink was not clear anymore, but now "opaque" or "chalky" looking.  The taste was still good though.  This newest change however, is not acceptable.  The flavor is barely recognizable.  I honestly used to CRAVE this stuff.  I would drink a quart or two almost every day.  I have no interest in this new stuff.  Has anyone else noticed the change in taste?

It had a fresh taste that WAS the taste of Ruby Red Grapefruit.  The formula was changed to the "Sunrise" Ruby Red Grapefruit which was less clear and a little less bright in flavor, but still excellent.<br /><br />In the last month or so, though, the drinks I have been mixing have been out of the new packaging (tubes, not tubs) and have a strong metallic taste that they've never had before.  It's not the same drink and it's extremely unpleasant.  I'm really disappointed to lose my favorite low-calorie drink.

review/summary: great flavor
review/text: This is the best flavored diet drink powder that I have tasted.  Until I found this on Amazon I was forced to try other flavors sold in supermarkets because for some reason they didn't sell the grapefruit.  They all had a very prominent artificial sweetener flavor.  The grapefruit doesn't suffer from that.  Hence, I love it!  I don't drink it straight but use it to flavor plain seltzer which turns out to be very satisfying.  Have used it straight with vodka for a so called lower calorie alcohol drink.

review/text: I REALLY like this flavor of Crystal Light, but alas, I'm in the minority.  When I couldn't buy it here any more, I looked at the always trusty place of Amazon.com, and sure enough, there it was.  Then I got notice Kraft would no longer make this flavor.  I made this huge purchase, and the seller did an awsome job shipping it out right away.  I'd do it again, if Kraft would just cooperate.  Thank you Amazon.com and the seller who had the stock.

review/summary: Still mourning the loss of the best Crystal Light flavor EVER... Ruby Red Grapefruit
review/text: My sister-in-law gave us several different flavors of Crystal Light a few years ago, as she knows we like & drink the lemonade. I remember the Ruby Red Grapefruit C.L. was the last one we tried & sat up in our cupboard for a few months. One night when we ran out of everything else, we decided to be brave & try it. We were surprised to find that it didn't taste anything like what we thought... in fact, in a very short time it became our year-round, #1 favorite beverage, even replacing soda. It has a deliciously tangy, refreshing taste - but without the sour, grapefruity taste we'd expected - or the sugar & calories. So that's the good news. The bad, dreadful news is that they've decided not to make it anymore! So once Amazon & other suppliers are out of this particularly perfect flavor... it'll be gone for good. )-:  *sigh*. Come on! Let's band together & beg them to bring it back!

review/text: This is the best beverage. It's fabulous plain, with selzer, frozen. If I still drank I would drink it with vodka.  I've been looking for months but none of my stores have it here: Wal-Mart, Food City, Target, Kroger.  They have the other, sweeter and less tastier flavors and tea (oh, wow!).  I'm diabetic and cannot drink real grapefruit juice packed with fructose.  I called Kraft and she told me the closest retailers that stocked this flavor were in Ashville NC (Harris Tweaters) and Henderson TN!  I'm not driving three hours each way to buy groceries!<br /><br />What is the problem?  Don't the retailers inventory control and product research wizards know that this is the best Crystal Light flavor ever?  I asked Kraft if I could buy it somewhere online and they sent me to Jeffrey Bezos!  Thanks, Jeff.  Now I can use the last four packets, I've been saving.

review/summary: The Best of the Crystal Light Flavors
review/text: This is the favorite flavor for both me and my wife.  I have been drinking it for several years, and it does not interfere with my medication, which real grapefruit would.<br /><br />The drink has a unique combination of sweet and tangy.  When people hear I like this flavor, they are surprised.  Most don't consider a grapefruit as a substite for soda and soft drinks.  After trying it, several of my friends and relatives are hooked.<br /><br />I had an Amazon subscription for about 2 years, but they discontinued it.  Now I see it for about $15 more per case than before.  I ending up buying a large order from eBay.  It was sold there for about a dollar a indivudual packet which is the cheapest I found.  They are wrapped in convenient foil pack rather than the tub, but it is the same thing and easier to take on trips - they don't break as easy.

review/text: I love this drink! I'm on a low carb diet, and I really, really miss fresh grapefruit juice every day. This doesn't taste exactly like fresh juice, but the grapefruit taste is still there, right down to the finishing bite. I've also tried the crystal light punch drink in this cannister version, but it is TOO SWEET and TOO STRONG!<br /><br />I buy gallon jugs of drinking water, pour off a couple of ounces, add two of the little sealed cups to the gallon, shake it up, and put it in the fridge. YUMMY!<br /><br />I buy this item (and several others) through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, so even though it ships a large quantity, I save money. It comes out to about what I would pay at the grocery store, minus the tax and minus the gas money and time to actually go to the store. This way, I get a good deal, I never run out, and I can cancel at any time. I'm very pleased with this product, and I can adjust the frequency of Subscribe and Save item deliveries with no hassle at all.

review/summary: Refuting the 2-Star Review.
review/text: Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked "natural"), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track.

review/text: Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Lamb Meal Dry Dog Food came highly recommended by our Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder. The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep.

review/text: To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

review/summary: It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.
review/text: Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like "chicken" or "chicken meal" and  you do not want things like "meat byproduct."  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the "Holistic"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.

review/summary: For a dog with sensitivity to chicken...
review/text: Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is "bulkier," too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change.

review/summary: Great food for a dog with a sensitive stomach
review/text: My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!

review/summary: Best for my dog, K-9 first responders use this
review/text: I researched for the healthiest, least filler type food.  I live in the Washington, DC area where there are lots of police K-9 dog owners.  They recommend the Holistic.  It turns out that you can serve much less for the same amount of nutrition as all the other popular brands so 30lb. goes for two months for my 45 lb dog!  I keep ordering online from Amazon and my ordering records show an order every two months.  Shows up in two days delivered! The veterinarian always comments on my dog's healthy coat and leanness. I only wish it could be on the subscription feature so that it would automatically be ordered and worry free, but there are more important things in life to worry about, right!?

review/summary: Less meat in new formula
review/text: I've never used this product before, but had a coupon so thought it would be worth trying, I looked at their site and checked to make sure that the protein was still adequate (which was 28%), when I got to the store, they received new bags, which is now only 22% protein, which is not enough meat to grain ratio. Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from "itchy butt" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.

review/text: Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.

review/summary: Excellent Quality; my dogs LOVE it!
review/text: I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.

review/summary: Works for My Dog and Me and Try Their New Treats
review/text: My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods. After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or "like" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>. The treats I bought are not yet offered on amazon. They are called Holistic Select Wheat Free Holistix with Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples & Blueberries Natural Biscuits for Dogs. They are easy to break in half for using as rewards.

review/text: Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and "prescription" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it.<br /><br />Then researched Eagle Pack and moved him onto this as it was heavily fed by Northern dog racers with similar breeds to ours.<br />"Eagle Pack" was prior brand name before it changed over to "Holistic Select" - but same product.<br /><br />GI issues went away, and our troubled-eater, barfer, bloody-diarrhea pooch is now healthy, happy, and has a great appetite and energy. Yes, it is more expensive, but if you compare the ingredients they are top notch.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this dry food for solving these issues.

I stopped feeding her the junk they sell at the corner deli and switched to this stuff, and within 6 days there was a visible difference in her body weight. I never thought a dog could gain weight like that in less than a week, but my dog really bulked up and does not look thin at all anymore. It's amazing.

This is the one that our dog eats the best, and what comes out her other end is the easiest to deal with. No bad breath. Our dog scratches a lot and I was hoping this food would help that, but alas, no.<br /><br />If you sign up at Holistic Select's website they will email you coupons. So far I got one for $5 and one for $3. I don't know how (or if) to use them on amazon so sometimes I buy locally.<br /><br />This is small kibble suitable for small dogs. Don't know about big dogs.

I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.

review/summary: Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS
review/text: We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.

Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from "chronic" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!

review/summary: Quality dog food
review/text: I like this a lot for my 12 y/o cardigan welsh corgi.  She needed a little more protein in her diet and I've added this to the Solid Gold Holistiquez and it's working well.

review/summary: Picky dog likes this as a treat
review/text: I had a sample size pack of three Eagle Pack varieties. (Lamb, fish, and duck.) Last night, my super-picky Aussie mix suddenly decided this fish variety was as good as some of her higher end training treats. I'm not sure how long the novelty will last, but I'm always excited when I find a kibble that works as a treat at class.

review/summary: My dogs got sick off a bag,and cost me 300$ in vet bills
review/text: I have been feeding this brand to my bulldogs for 2 years.  Petco stop carring it, so I have been buying from Amazon.  I buy two 30lb bags at a time.. I never thougth it would make by bulldogs sick.  I stop feeding them from that bag, and opened the new one after I had taken them to the vet and they eventually got better.  I ran out of the 2nd bag  so I put them back on original bag, and they started vomiting again..It's hard to see my pupps so sick, and don't know if I should keep buying this brand.

review/summary: Content means less than names
review/text: I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, "Holistic",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or "natural" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?

review/summary: Tastes Awful !
review/text: I respect Mrs. May's products, they're usually good, which is why I'm so surprised how BAD these things taste.<br />The texture resemble styrofoam and the taste is very chemically, with an apple after taste. I bought because of<br />low calorie content = 38/bag. But it was lower than that cuz I threw it away. Absolutely inedible.

review/summary: Best price
review/text: This is the largest quantity and price per piece that I have been able to find. Not even the pet stores or whole sale catalogs have so far been able to match this. I love these bones because they last longer then most of the compressed non raw hide chew bones. The drawback is that most stores sell them for about 3 to 3.50 a piece.

review/summary: Funniest thing I've ever seen a dog do.
review/text: I first bought a pack of 2 in a store.  Our dog Chewy ate the first one, but the second one we gave him a few days later he walked around the house with it for hours, then went outside and tried to bury it.  He never tried to bury a bone before.  He dug but wouldn't put it in, who wants to eat a dirty bone lol.  I bought much more reasonably priced ones on Amazon and now he'll carry it around for hours and tries to bury it under my pillows and covers and my daughter's couch.  Then he finally eats it.  I read about this from another Amazon customer and couldn't believe my eyes.  Have fun with your dog with these Busy Bones.

review/summary: Removed calculus from my Golden's teeth.
review/text: I'll apologize in advance for the length of this review, but it's more of a story than a review.<br /><br />After adopting a five-year-old Golden Retriever last year, I had to spend a few hundred dollars to have her teeth professionally cleaned.  She had a lot of staining on her front teeth and canines and a lot of hard calculus on her large premolars.  (See image I posted above for reference.) The vet had to remove one of her large bottom premolars due to the amount of decay.  After the surgery, I committed to brushing her teeth two to three times per week, but that wasn't enough.  The tartar and calculus came back within months.  I began to get concerned that I'd have to get her teeth cleaned again and they'd have to (eventually) remove her other large, bottom premolar.  (Imagine a dog without its bottom premolars!) Despite my rigorous brushing, the calculus would not come off.  Going against the advice of many vets, I BBQ'd a slab of beef ribs and let her chew on them, but she refused to gnaw on them.  She'd remove the meat and leave the bone. I then went to the pet store and spent about $20 on an assortment of chewable bones in hopes one of them would do the trick. The first one I gave her was the Purina Busy Bone.  She went right at it and consumed almost the whole thing within 20 minutes.  I let her consume the rest of it the following day, but didn't expect to see a difference so fast, so I didn't inspect her teeth immediately.  A couple days later while brushing her teeth, I couldn't believe how much of the calculus was gone.  I was so relieved that I wouldn't have to get her teeth professionally cleaned again and that I'd found something safe and effective to keep her tartar and calculus at bay.  I committed to buying several of these while they were on sale.<br /><br />The only downside to these Busy Bones is that they get really sticky when wet.  Your dog's paws and legs WILL be sticky after chewing on one of these, so be prepared.  Either let them do it outside or plan on wiping their legs afterwards.  (It's a small price to pay, though.)<br /><br />I really feel for the guy with the corgi whose dog almost choked when the Busy Bone became lodged (see review titled, "Dangerous Choking Hazard").  As a result, I will certainly monitor my dog while she's chewing on these in the future.<br /><br />Good luck everyone.

review/summary: My dogs ABSOLUTELY love these.
review/text: I have greyhounds and these are a great addition to their teeth cleaning routine.  It is the only thing that helps other than actually brushing their teeth which I don't do often enough.  So what could be bad about this?  They help keep my dog's teeth clean and my dogs love them.  Win/win
