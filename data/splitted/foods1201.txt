review/summary: Excellent value!
review/text: My family loves eating this crisp bread.  It taste great plain or with butter, pairs well with veggies and cheese in appetizers, and tastes wonderful with soups.  Having said this, I'm really amazed at how difficult it is to buy this crisp bread locally.  I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  It arrived well packed, crisp and had an expiration of May 2013.  Even my picky 8 year old gave it two thumbs up!

review/summary: Rye Chrisp is Healthy!
review/text: I started getting the Crisp Bread from Amazon was I could not find it anywhere in this area.  Never thought of it as a health food, but one day found it in a health food store.  the size was shrunk over the years but it is still a great rye cracker.  Oh, it is cheaper from Amazon than the local health food store.

review/summary: Crispy & Fresh
review/text: Purchased directly from Amazon. I was glad to find these here, since my grocery store no longer stocks it. I ordered this in March 2012 and it has a September 2012 expiration. Plenty fresh, since I found my local store used to also have about 6-8 months on the expiration as well. The price was also comparable to what you'd pay anywhere else, so that's nice.<br /><br />My crispbread arrived with minimal padding in the box but it was completely intact. No broken pieces. I was worried they'd be a crumbly mess, based on an earlier review, but maybe I got lucky. I break them up anyway, so they'll fit in a ziplock bag, so I figured, no biggie either way.<br /><br />I prefer Siljans to all the other brands/styles of crispbread. It's made from 100% rye and it has a nutty flavor and crispy texture. It's not a heavy rye flavor, more like a wonderfully crispy piece of wheat toast. Fat free, with a good amount of fiber and protein per serving. I like to use it as a low-cal snack when I'm looking for something crunchy to munch on. I pretty much stopped buying sandwich bread and use the crispbread instead for sandwiches and whatnot. Good stuff =)

review/summary: why so expensive -- and what's with the texture?
review/text: I usually buy wheat berries in bulk but had no other choices yesterday and bought the only brand (Nature's Earthly Choice, packaged) carried in my local market. Not only is Nature's Earthly Choice about FIVE times as expensive as buying in bulk (even from the high-end national chain store), but Nature's Earthly Choice is also more expensive than virtually all other brands. And after cooking, Nature's Earthly Choice Wheat Berries looked awful - as if they'd been totally overcooked and every kernal had exploded. (Perhaps that's because they've been turned into a "cooks in 15 minutes" processed grain.) Cooking instructions on the package are almost non-existant -- no mention of medium or low flame, covered or uncovered, whether all the water was all supposed to be absorbed or what. The salad recipe on the package made it sound like there should've been no excess water, so after 20 minutes on an uncovered simmer I figured I was supposed to drain the berries. I know I'll end up feeling like I should apologize to fans (of my usual apple salad with wheat berries) about how it looks.  Very disappointing and a ripoff.

review/summary: My cat loves it
review/text: My 1 year old Siberian cat, Mimic, loves this stuff. He would prefer to eat only the dry Taste of the Wild for ever and ever. But I do worry about his urinary health, so I supplement with some wet food every day. He used to be on Merrick wet, but when my local store started carrying the Taste of the Wild wet, I gave it a try, and now it's the only wet food he'll eat.<br /><br />I don't know what kind of addictive substance they put in the food (my guess is it's the sweet potato, which is kind of an unusual cat food ingredient), but he loves it. I also know that his breeder uses it now, as do a few of my friends. And all of the cats seem to love the stuff.<br /><br />If you can find the canned, try it. It smells similar, so I'd bet that any cat who likes the dry would like the wet. It is a kind of chunky food in gravy, where the chunks are like tiny pieces of meatloaf.<br /><br />Ultimately, I have not found a better balance of price, quality of ingredients, and  palatability for Mimic.

Phew!<br /><br />Everybody loved this stuff from the beginning and ate it with a healthy appetite. They've eaten this exclusively for almost a year now with good results - glossy, soft coats and good health exams.<br /><br />Don't try the new flavor in the gold bag, though, the one with Trout and Salmon? It is disgusting and my cats wouldn't touch it. I couldn't blame them - stuff stunk and make their breath stink once they finally broke down and ate it for a few days. Stick with the venison and salmon flavor in the green bag.

review/summary: Good food, excellent value
review/text: Overall, I think this is a good food and an absolutely amazing value as far as grain-free foods go.  My cat certainly enjoyed it, I saw an improvement in her fur, and she became leaner and more active.  On her prior diet of Science Diet Light (high carb, filler food - shame on me!) she was becoming fat and lethargic.  The difference in feeding a grain-free, high protein food was almost immediate.<br /><br />My only problem with Taste of the Wild is that the amount of vegetables after the first ingredient (chicken meal) seems excessive.  Too many pea proteins and potato proteins.  The next meat ingredients, venison and salmon, don't appear until the sixth and seventh ingredient.  Recently I decided to switch my cat to Orijen, which I believe is the very best dry cat food out there - the first 6 ingredients are all meats!  Orijen, however, is also significantly more expensive.  For those who are on a budget, I think Taste of the Wild is far better than the vast majority of commercial dry kibbles out there.  Taste of the Wild is certainly better than the by-product and corn filler loaded (not to mention expensive) Science Diet that I fed my cat for the first 3 years of her life.

review/summary: Get the green bag
review/text: Time and time again I've heard it said to "get the green bag" of Taste of the Wild. What's the "green bag", you ask?<br /><br />Well, recently TotW came out with an "other" formula, called "Canyon River". And, while it's not bad by any means, it IS different. Some cats like it, some cats don't. My cat isn't picky. My problem was that it smelled so sordid that I couldn't stand to feed my cat (read my review on it here). Since my cat liked the "other" formula so well, I decided to try the original formula in the "green bag". I found a good price locally and the pet shop owner told me about how the "green bag" was far superior to the "other one".<br /><br />And she was right. The Rocky Mountain Feline formula has everything I'm looking for in a dry food, doesn't smell like a hatchery, and is priced fair.<br /><br />My cat loves it, and I don't have any complaints.<br /><br />I'm sticking with this from now on.

review/summary: My cats love Taste of the Wild
review/text: My 2-year old cat Ezekiel, adopted from a shelter 3 months ago, will eat NOTHING but Taste of the Wild dry food.  My first choice would be a raw-food diet, but I'm too lazy to keep that up except for supplementing. However, Ezekiel won't eat fresh salmon, chicken, chicken liver, beef, or anything fresh.  He won't eat any other high-quality cat food dry or wet.  He won't eat any cheap store brand.<br /><br />It's Taste of the Wild or starve.  I am comfortable with this formula because of what I have read, and because he is thriving, healthy, and has an especially shiny coat and is in altogether top-notch shape.<br /><br />Yet, since I believe wet or raw food is best for cats (I had a cat who required a PU after repeated bladder infections and who re-blocked whenever he had any dry food), no matter how high quality the dry food, I was eager to buy the canned food.<br /><br />At first, Ezekiel turned up his nose at it as he does at all food except Taste of the Wild Dry.  Then, we got a new 12-week old girl kitten, Ariel.  She is teaching him all sorts of adventurous things.  Is she does it, he does it (and vice-versa). She LOVES it, ergo HE loves it.<br /><br />Now they both lap it up quickly, and I'm thrilled that they are eating good food.<br /><br />So, I give both products several thumbs up.

review/summary: IMPORTANT INFO: DIAMOND PET FOOD RECALL
review/text: IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING "TASTE OF THE WILD" CAT FOOD, IT MAY BE PART OF THE CURRENT RECALL BY DIAMOND PET FOOD FOR SALMONELLA POISONING IN PETS AND PEOPLE HANDLING THE FOOD.<br /><br />"Taste of the Wild" cat food is made by Diamond Pet Food, a manufacturer who is associated with previous recalls. Their current pet food recall now also includes "Taste of the Wild" CAT FOOD with production numbers in addition than those currently shown on their website. I called them today after reading the news stories about the large dog food recall and learning that "Taste of the Wild" is one of their brands. I was horrified when the customer service rep told me my cat food bag was indeed part of the recall. This is the link to their recall website (although the recall information currently on there today is incomplete): [...] Also, the Diamond Pet Food recall telephone number is (866)918-8756.<br /><br />FYI, my cat has had bloody diarrhea/stools for a couple of weeks now and is currently taking a 2nd round of medicine prescribed by my vet because the 1st round was ineffective. A couple of nights ago, the sound of my cat vomiting woke me up. He threw up approximately 8-10 times over approximately 2 hours - very unusual for him. I now suspect that both of these issues may have been caused by the "Taste of the Wild" cat food. Thank goodness the recall occurred before he got any worse as pet deaths are being reported.<br /><br />If I had only realized "Taste of the Wild" was made by Diamond Pet Food, I would have never bought the stuff. Ironically, I switched to this food two months ago because I wanted a healthier food for my cats. My cats like it, but it is not worth the risk.

review/summary: amazing!  fixed all my cat's issues...
review/text: I have only ever left a few reviews on Amazon, so when I do so, it means I think something is pretty amazing.<br /><br />Our 9 yo cat Sherby has always been kind of sickly.  He used to have sores around the mouth, very dull fur, and a major shedding problem. His paws even itched so much, they'd start to bleed.  He'd get frequent UTIs.  The vet had diagnosed him with all kinds of allergies but never to food  -- for instance, the vet said he was allergic to mosquitoes.  He was given medication and steroid shots which never really fixed the issue long-term.  We even made him inside-only so he'd be away from the bugs.  Nothing helped.  Since we changed his food one month ago, he looks like an entirely different animal. His coat has now doubled in thickness and is silky soft. ALL of his sores are totally gone.  He can eat now without irritating the sores on his mouth.  He is friendlier and always wants to play.  Honestly, while I thought a better food would be healthier, I hadn't thought it would make a difference that I'd actually be able to see. I am kind of blown away.<br /><br />I have known about the importance of pet diets since we got young dogs a year or so ago and have always focused a lot on what I feed them, but had never been that way with the cats since they are so old and set in their ways. I didn't think they'd take easily to a food change and had tried Blue one time, and the cats did not seem to take to it.  So, we were just feeding the cats regular stuff from the grocery store.  I only changed them over to TOTW a month ago when Sherby got ill again with another UTI.  A emergency clinic vet I'd not seen before suggested a more allergy-friendly diet.  I tried Taste of the Wild for cats because I feed it for the dogs and they've always been great.<br /><br />I also like it because it's not as pricey as some of the premium/holistic typed foods, especially if you get it from a feed shop. We get it at Tractor Supply.<br /><br />If your cat (or dog) has ongoing allergy-like issues or just doesn't look their best, try this food -- or at least a higher quality, protein-based food.  I'm a total believer.<br /><br />By the way, the only other review I think I've left on here in the past year was for TOTW dog food!

review/summary: Great cat food!
review/text: My cat eats this food with no problems. I don't have much to compare because I try not to switch his food, but it's a high-quality cat food at a reasonable price for premium food.<br /><br />My cat has eaten this food since he was a tiny kitten. He's an F6 Savannah (hybrid breed, but 6 generations removed from his Serval ancestor, so he should be normal cat size), so I was concerned about his nutritional needs. I checked with his breeder, online forums and our vet, and there was general agreement that most kittens can be fed this type of high quality, nutrient-dense cat food; they don't need to start on "kitten" food and then transition into adult food. It helped us to avoid an unnecessary food transition, which is always good. I supplement with half a can of the same brand/flavor wet food each day, and he eats it all up. He's very muscular and sleek, with shiny and soft fur and no eye or ear problems.<br /><br />The only negative is that his litter box stinks to high heaven when he makes a poop, but I think this is true for all high-quality cat foods, maybe due to the higher meat content? It's a small price to pay for his continued health.

review/text: I purchased this food after it was recommended by a friend who noticed terrific improvement in her cat's vigor, coat and diabetes issue after switching to this food. We have always fed our cats primarily dry food, and generally Iams. However, they reformulated it recently and our cats' coats became dull and they often threw up undigested food. I've been searching for a dry food that they like and that doesn't cause problems. Another premium brand was my first choice and they liked it, but it gave our long hair diarrhea, and our other cat got a urinary tract infection. However, our two cats liked Taste of the Wild (Venison & Salmon) from the first day, and they have tolerated it very well with no health issues from switching over. We will be reordering.

review/summary: Thank Goodness my choosy cat loves it
review/text: I have a very choosy cat some dry cat foods it just refuses to eat, he will just smell, taste a few nuggets and walk away. I decided to give Taste of The Wild Rocky Mountain Formula a try for the main reason I read online that most of the store brands include grain which is very bad for cats and Taste of The Wild is grain free. After mixing with his favorite whiska's moist food my cat ate his whole bowl, and trust me if he did not like it he would not have ate it no matter what I mixed it with. Another thing I think my cat likes about it is the nuggets are small. During my cat's night feeding I wanted to try the ultimate test will he eat it dry without a mixture, and to my delight he ate his whole bowl, drank some water and was a happy cat. Considering all the health benefits of Taste of the Wild including no grain it may cost more but it is worth it for a happy and healthy cat.

review/summary: Excellent grain-free option for your pet
review/text: Taste of the Wild is a quality, affordable grain-free option for your cat. Felines have very little, if any, biological need for grains so it would make sense to avoid "supermarket brands" that are nothing more than the animal equivalent of junk food. High protein based products which get closer to replicating their "wild" diet is what most vetererinarians are recommending these days. With that said, a lot of higher end cat foods are overpriced. Not so with Taste of the Wild. I have found that from an ingredient standpoint, it measures favoribly to industry leaders such as Wellness and Orijen but costs considerably less.<br /><br />My cat is thriving on TotW and happily devours it on a daily basis. Very pleased that Amazon offers this via Prime shipping. That in and of itself makes it a terrific value :)

review/summary: Picky cat loves it!
review/text: We have an 11-year-old cat that has been eating Purina salmon and tuna for most of his life.  He has always thrown up food at least 3 times a week and I thought it was just something we had to put up with.  He also began licking his fur completely off his tummy.  After reading many reviews on different cat foods, I tried Blue Buffalo.  He did stop throwing up but he did not like it.  We tried the Taste of the Wild and he loves it.  It may be pricier but he eats less and doesn't throw it up.  I can't tell you how many rolls of paper towels and Resolve carpet cleaner we used to go through with the Purina food.  I think this food will actually save us money in the end.

review/summary: Improved the health of my cat
review/text: My vet suggested that a grain-free diet would help with my cat's skin issues.  I tried Natural Balance but she just didn't like it, so I gave Taste of the Wild a try and I'm really glad I did because my cat loves it!<br />Since starting on this diet over a month ago, Daisy, who was a spindly little stray when I adopted her, has gained strength and muscle mass, her fur is silky and smooth and her eyes look so bright.<br />I would rarely see her eat before, I even had to coax her sometimes but now she goes to her food bowl several times a day all on her own, she just loves this stuff and I do too since it's made such an improvement in my cat's overall health, she even has a lot more energy now!

review/summary: Good product for the money
review/text: I have a Siberian cat, and I am supposed to feed her a high protein diet. So when I found this, I was happy.<br /><br />The food does smell a little, but I suppose it could be way worse, We had fruit flies in the kitchen for a bit, and they seemed to enjoy the product.<br /><br />I noticed, however, that shortly after switching to this product my cat seemed to become a little more aggressive. Now I can't say for sure that it was the switch in food that caused this, but the timing was similar.<br /><br />I am going to switch back to Natural Balance Original Ultra Premium Formula Cat Food, 6-Pound Bag, as she really enjoyed this product, and was not aggressive then. Maybe it will work?<br /><br />I would reccomend this product still, just keep a watch on any behavioral changes.

review/summary: Great food
review/text: I had my 4 cats on Iams for years. I really don't know why I thought Iams was a good food. Anyway, one of cats seemed to develop a food allergy, he was always scratching himself on his neck and head. I decided to go to a grain free diet in hopes that it would help him. Not only did it help him to stop scratching, but he has also lost weight (which he needed to), and he has a lot more energy. He runs around like he is a kitten again. All my cats also have noticeably nicer coats. I highly recommend Taste of the Wild as a high quality food for your cats. I will never give them another low quality food like Iams again. I love my cats like they are my children and they deserve only the best! Also, Taste of the Wild is a great price compared to other high quality foods, like Wellness for example. So if you are like me, and love your cats dearly but don't want to break the bank feeding them, then go with Taste of the Wild!

review/text: This an excellent choice of food for a cat who has issues with grain products.  It even smells like real food, when many common cat foods smell like chemicals. My cat has routinely vomited about half of what she eats until now; with Taste of the Wild, she has hairballs, and now and then if she eats too fast -- but she's holding most of her food down, and she seems to be enjoying it.  I'm delighted! My problem now is to keep her from eating her way into becoming a fat cat!

review/summary: My kitty Caesar is very pleased
review/text: Doing a bit of homework really paid off in steering me to this product.  We had narrowed our choices down to five brands (based on price and quality), and this was the first that we found.  Caesar seems to love it, as there is seldom more than 4-5 little kibbles left by the next mealtime.  He's also gotten a bit more active than he'd been previously, which is also a good sign.  We've actually cut back a bit on one of his feedings, and he's doing great!<br />I buy this at a local pet store, and it's just a bit more expensive than Iam's Hairball/Weight formula, but worth every penny.<br />His vet had told us that Caesar is overweight, though I don't think it's due to this cat food (he had only been on this for a week at the time of his appointment).  He's due for a shot later this month and they'll weigh him again.  I hope that he's lost a bit, because I'd hate to have to switch him again.

review/text: My cats were on an all wet food diet, but because we went on vacation I had to buy dry food. I specifically wanted grain free food. They haven't had dry food in a year so I was worried, especially because this is a bit pricey (though still a lot cheaper than all wet food). My big cat of course loved it immediately, but what surprised me is that my little picky cat loved it right away! Definitely taking a break on the all wet food to save money and I'll be feeding them this food instead. I wish there was a Subscribe and Save option.

One cat was looking slightly skeletal.  When I opened this bag and a whiff of smell escaped they charged me.  They absolutely adore this food.  I am not sure about the large amount of sweet potatoes and peas.  But I have such happy cats I may just continue to feed them this.  It only took a couple of days for the skeletal one to look well fed again.

review/summary: Two big paws up
review/text: When I got my new kitten, I decided I wasn't gonna let him be a food junkie like my older cat. So I emailed around for samples, TOTW being one of them.<br /><br />I've had trouble getting my older cat to eat anything besides his low-quality wet food since I got him. I've tried several other brands (both dry and wet) and it was Friskies, Fancy Feast, or starve. For someone who licks his own butt and sleeps with his head in my shoes, he is surprisingly picky about his food. Well, I got the samples in and to my surprise my older cat gobbled it down. It was like I had filled his bowl with treats. Between him and the new kitten, they lick their dish clean every night. Before, dry food would sit untouched in that dish for a week or more.<br /><br />I haven't tried TOTW wet food yet, because there is no store around me that carries it. But I'm sure if I bought some my kitties would love it too.<br /><br />TOTW gets two big paws up.<br /><br />Edit 10/2011: I quit feeding my kitties this food last month, but forgot to write a review. My kitties had been on 100% ToTW for a full month before they began throwing up and developed severe diarrhea. At first I thought they were sick, but they are indoor only so contracting a disease was ruled out. The only change had been the new food. I looked up the symptoms linked with this food, and found that I'm not the only one who experienced vomiting and diarrhea after a full month on ToTW. Apparently, the high quality ingredients are just too rich for some cats. I took my kitties off of the dry and fed them 100% wet for the next few days. The vomiting stopped immediately, and within days the diarrhea was gone.<br /><br />I'm knocking the 5 star down to a 4 star, only because it is too rich for my kitties and made them sick. The company itself is great, and has been extremely helpful through all this.

review/summary: A grain-free, tasty option for grazing dry food
review/text: I can be a bit picky about what my cats eat. Maybe not in a cat-lady-crazy way but cats are obligate carnivores (i.e. they naturally eat and need only meat as opposed to humans who need other sources of protein as well) so I like to feed them something that works best with what evolution has told my cats to eat. In this case, it's grain-free dry food. I've heard keeping grain fillers out of the dry food helps cats stay thinner and my cats are definitely not 20lb monsters. It's not proof, but I like to think that it works.<br /><br />The second important point is that it's tasty (to them). My cats have no problem turning down food that doesn't smell good to them (trust me, it's been fun finding a wet food everyone can agree on) but they've never had a problem with Taste of the Wild.<br /><br />Plus it's got an awesome name, why get anything else?

review/summary: PAWS UP * * * * * *
review/text: When I adopted my two female kitties two years ago, this dry food was recommended to me by their veterinarian and by a cat-loving friend.  The grain-free formula made perfect sense to me - why would I feed them corn?  My two girls LOVED it from the start and still do.  When they hear me filling their dishes, they come running in excitement, whether they're hungry or not.  This is their main food, but I also supplement this kibble with about a tablespoon each of canned/wet food morning and evening. . .the wet food is more like a "treat" and a "ritual" for these two pampered puffs.<br /><br />Anyway, my girls rarely if ever throw up, and their litter box is odor free (I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X29WK">Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter, 40 pound bag</a> that I buy locally much cheaper).  My kitties are strictly indoor kitties, but neither one is remotely overweight - they are happy, healthy, frisky and thriving on their TOTW diet.<br /><br />My friend's kitties didn't take to this "cold turkey" when she tried to switch them from another kibble, so she started mixing TOTW with the cheaper grain-filled brand in increasing quantities until they fully transitioned.  They eat TOTW exclusively now and love it, and she tells me they actually consume less food and are healthier and more active.

No massive improvement over other foods or changes for the worst - the only downside is the bag is quite small.

review/text: After deciding to switch to a grainless product, I was happy to find this food.  I think the price and the ingredients are good, and my cats liked it when first introduced.  Now they won't eat it (after a couple of bags).  I have tried both flavors and they refuse it.  I don't know what has caused them to reject the food, but since I have more than ten cats and ALL refuse the food, it must be the product.  There was no problem with litter box odor and the change in their appearance was positive.  I am still looking for another product. By the way, the cost of the premium food is worth the improvement in the cats' appearance and decrease in litter usage.

Unfortunately my cats do not like this food - only one will eat the canned food and this same cat will not eat the dry, and oddly enough, vice versa.  The other cat will eat the dry but not the canned.  I have also noticed that their coats are not as silky as they were with another brand, which I will be going back to. I am giving it 3 stars as it is a good holistic food and conveniently available, just is not something my cats like.

review/text: I bought this as the first grain-free dry food once I decided to switch my cat's diet to grain-free.  I loved the ingredients of this food, but my cat is very picky so I was a bit worried.  I've never mixed her dry foods while transitioning to a new food, so I didn't with this one either - I probably should have and I would recommend doing it that way instead of just shifting gears all at once, especially if your cat(s) have always eaten grain processed foods.  It took her a couple weeks to warm up to it, she would eat it but wasn't excited about it and wasn't finishing the bowl.  Now that she's used to it though she eats it with more gusto, so that's good; if I could do it over I would probably start with a smaller bag so we could try different flavors and see what she likes best.  Overall we're happy with this food, and more happy that she is making the transition to grain-free!

Since we work at a pet store we got some samples of both Canyon River and Rocky Mountain feline Taste of the Wild to mix in with their CalNat, and they actually love it. It's the only brand we've found that they'll eat every time. They're both super healthy with really great fur, and they seem very pleased with the food we've found for them. I really recommend this if you're looking for a good grain-free diet for your cat.

review/text: I have THE pickiest cat in the world - he will not eat anything outside of the Purina Kitten Chow that his breeder started him on. I have been trying for the past 2 months to get him on a healthier dry food (he won't even touch wet food at this point!), and this is the first one he has taken to. As soon as I walked in the door he was all over the bag. I started out by giving him a couple pieces as a treat, and he kept coming back for more! I put it in his bowl and he chomped it up without even having to gradually introduce him to it. He loves it, and I love that it's not full of fillers like the other foods you buy. It's a little more spendy that Purina or other brands, but he actually eats less of it because it's a higher quality product. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Love it
review/text: I really find this to be one of the best quality foods out there and you can't beat the price! I usually go to Mud Bay for Healthy Dogs and Cats and they sell it for $15.95. Other comparable foods made with venison are upwards of $17 per bag (5pd). My cats seem to really enjoy the flavor and had very little issues switching from Purina Indoor Cat Chow. For those that find it too pricey, if you really think about it an average cat only eats about 1/2 cup of food per day. Any more than that can lead to obesity. So 1/2 cup per day out of a 5pd bag can last one cat about a month! $11 a month to feed you cat the healthiest possible food? Not too shabby.

review/summary: Cat adores it!
review/text: I can't believe this!  I walked down to the local independent pet supply on a<br />mission to get my 11.5 pound Siberian kitten a corner scratcher, but I found<br />Taste of the Wild (Rocky Mountain Formula) instead.<br /><br />I'd been meaning to try it for my kitty, but I couldn't find it anywhere!<br />I read some reviews about it, and was pretty convinced that it's nutritionally<br />sound, healthy, and tasty but nothing prepared me for my sweet, docile, if a<br />bit enormous kitten ATTACKING the bowl.<br /><br />I mixed a little in with his regular food (Purina Kitten Chow) because you're<br />not supposed to switch their food abruptly or their tummies could get upset.<br />He ate right around the kitten chow to get at the little venison and salmon<br />nuggets!<br /><br />I think cats are smarter than we are sometimes--they know what's healthy for them<br />and often prefer it to "junk-food".<br /><br />This is a total winner, and when I use up that Purina Kitten Chow bag, I'm getting<br />a huge bag of Taste of the Wild for my fuzzboy.

review/summary: A great food for cats.....
review/text: After the recent pet food scandals, and the melamine poisoning cases many people have been looking into better pet foods for their animals. Let me give you some assistance, and say that Taste of the Wild is not like the rest that puts junk fillers, artificial/chemical flavors and preservatives in their food. They use only high quality ingredients, and use mixed tocopherols to preserve their foods.<br /><br />I have given taste of the wild to my cat, and she loves it. It may very well be her favorite dry cat food (she prefers can food though). I haven't noticed any problems with her ability to digest the food, nor have I noticed any health problems as a result of her consumption of this food. Since this stuff is really made with real salmon and venison, your cats will most likely go bonkers for this stuff.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Note: If you also have dogs with sensitive digestive systems or allergies, then I would recommend having a look at the taste of the wild series dog foods. They don't use any grains or by-produts, which are both commonly associated with digestive problems and allergies. They also do not use any wheat, corn, soy, or gluten in the production of their foods.

review/summary: Great food at a good price
review/text: With five cats, buying premium cat food can get expen$ive, but we don't feel comfortable feeding our beloved friends anything less.  At least TOTW is the best priced of the premium, grain-free foods. Of course, a good price would mean nothing if the cats don't like it...yeah right, they literally face plant in the bowls when we put it out for them.<br /><br />Some people complain that the second ingredient listed is peas and not another meat ingredient.  Am I concerned?  Not really; the ordering of ingredients tells me little about how much chicken meal is present, only that there is more chicken than peas.  Lets look at two completely fake (and utterly unrealistic) scenarios to demonstrate this point:<br /><br />Cat Food #1 has 40% chicken meal, 20% peas, and a bunch of other stuff<br />Cat Food #2 has 20% chicken meal, 20% turkey meal, 20% peas, and a bunch of other stuff<br /><br />Although peas are the second ingredient listed for Cat Food #1, it has the same meat content as Cat Food #2, which lists meat as the first two ingredients.  Does TOTW have more or less meat that the other premium brands? I don't know, and I probably never will.<br /><br />Of course, all cats are different, and there can be problems any time you change diets.  Make a gradual change and watch closely for warning signs such as vomiting and changes in stool.

review/summary: Was not happy :(
review/text: I was told my cat may have an allergic reaction to the food I was feeding her before and that I should try grain-free, So I bought this.. She was pretty upset when I switched her food, she refused to eat it for a while, I tried mixing it with the prior food, since she seemed to prefer it, but she wouldn't eat it. After a few days she finally started eating, but for the first time in months, she's been throwing up. I was very unhappy with this product and had hoped that with so many positive reviews it would be helpful.  She hasn't even stopped scratching and now I just don't know what's wrong :(

review/text: Ordered these flowers for my wife for Valentine's Day nearly two weeks beforehand, only to have them cancel my order the weekend prior to V-Day.  Indicated that they were unable to fulfill the order at the price that I bought them at, even though they sent me confirmation that my order had been accepted and that my credit card was already charged.<br /><br />The other issue that happened is that their "cancellation email" was sent out in bulk, with my email address a part of close to 25-30 others - not sure why this wasn't handled individually or at least via bcc so that others wouldn't have my information.<br /><br />If this was indeed part of a pricing error, I don't have a problem with them cancelling the order, per Amazon's regulations for dealing with third-party vendors. I just think they handled this very poorly and ultimately aren't paying enough attention to details if so many customers were affected by this.<br /><br />Questionable business ethics - Buyer Beware!

review/summary: Cancelled - Never Delivered
review/text: Falcon Farms cancelled this order and many others, despite a promise from an Amazon CSR Supervisor that the roses would be delivered. Apparently what appeared to be a special sale was claimed to be a glitch, and refunds took several transactions - during which many customer email addresses were shared with others, already resulting in spam. In trying to mitigate the damages from either the glitch or decision to void the sales, customers were treated differently - some received the value of the sale, some were given future discounts, some were given nothing but an apology that was mass-emailed with many email addresses in the CC field, exposing customers to others despite having a published privacy policy that states they will never share customer data with others.

review/text: My experience with this vendor was absolutely horrendous.  They offered 2 dozen roses for a decent price with a Valentines Day delivery guaranteed.  After placing the order, and moving on to other Valentines purchases, I felt confident that I had all of the pieces in place to make it a special day for my wife of 10 years and my daughters.<br /><br />Shortly before Valentines Day, they canceled my order without providing any explanation other than "it was a price mistake."  As such, I was left scrambling to find roses that were not going to cost an arm and a leg to deliver on the holiday.  I was not able to locate anything, and spent a lot more than I had anticipated.<br /><br />This company provides horrific customer service and I would discourage anyone from considering making a purchase from them!!!!  They truly go against everything that CUSTOMER SERVICE is supposed to be.<br /><br />Stay clear of these scammers!

review/summary: Great, healthy dog food for dogs with food allergies
review/text: My dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy. She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it. But I'd rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste.

review/summary: Great for Dogs that Chew their Food
review/text: If your dog eats slowly & actually chews his food, then this food is fantastic!  We have 2 dogs, 1 that is a picky eater, so we added water and microwave his food for 30 sec.  He loves his dinner & keeps It down. ( full disclosure, he's not the dog with stomach problems.  Our Boston Terrier, who we adopted from a puppy mill situation, eats by gulping down her food, from her years when she had to fight for food.  She is the dog we were targeting by getting sensitive stomach food; she was having a problem with vomiting & regurgitation.  The good news is, if we get her to eat 2-3 small meals a day and try to get her to slow down, problem solved.  Yet, if she eats fastly, without chewing, regurgitation is still a problem.<br /><br />I gave the food 4 stars because. If we do make sure she chews it ( by feeding her a couple morsels at a time, like giving treats) the food stays down, therefore working for vomiting, which was a huge proplem! (she was vomiting 6-9 times a day.) since switching she has stopped vomiting. I don't think our dog is the only one that eats fast, and it does take much longer to feed her.

review/summary: Great alternative to "science diet" allegry diets
review/text: I have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years. The vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet.  I can't stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage. But simple is a good alternative, made with quality ingredients and the dogs love it too.  Great product!!

review/summary: Best dog food--no ear infections
review/text: Before my oldest golden started eating this food he got a lot of ear infections. He ate grain free food, but he still got them. Both my dogs like this food and their coats are nice and shiny and their ears are super clean. I really recommend it.<br /><br />While you can get it for $1 cheaper on other sites, you pay $18 for shipping.<br /><br />I only wish Amazon had more than 3 bags of it each time!

review/summary: Not so fresh
review/text: This is a very good brand of popcorn, but what we received from Amazon was quite a bit tougher than what we get from the local grocery store. Kinda sorry I bought it.<br /><br />By the way, it's just plain popcorn; I don't know why Amazon describes it as seasoned.

review/text: I stumbled across this product and thought I'd give it a try. I had been buying the Orville Redenbacher brand.  This popcorn has greater texture.  I add Kernel Season's White Cheddar and I'm in popcorn heaven.

review/text: This tea is not the best tasting, but it did make me feel better. I'd vote that you try it. It also helps with calming my itchy throat for allergies & gives me a little kick start in the morning when I feel a cold coming on.

review/summary: Problems with bbq sauce but seller very good about it
review/text: I had ordered 6 bottles of the Lum Taylor Riverboat style barbeque sauce from Healthy Heart Market. I have used this BBQ sauce for several years and we love it, especially since it is very low in sodium and also delicious. However, three of the bottles leaked terribly and were unusable, 2 bottles leaked slightly, and one seemed fine. Since my husband has had a heart transplant and we must be very careful about what he eats, I will have to stop ordering this item until the manufacturer figures out a way to seal the bottles better. Healthy Heart Market did issue me a credit for 3 bottles and for half of the shipping, so they were very good in the way they handled it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031DW704">Lum Taylor's Riverboat Style Barbeque Sauce 18oz</a>

review/summary: Makes Delicious Homemade Bread
review/text: I just started using a bread machine a few months ago, and bought this and the Honey Wheat flavor on Amazon.  This is a perfect (and economical) solution for me, as I make about a loaf a week.<br /><br />The flavor and texture of this white bread is excellent.  It slices well, and lasts almost a week without refrigeration.  It bakes up with a marvelous crust in my machine, an older Panasonic BT55-P.  Simple to use, and saves a lot of work over manual baking.  I use either unsalted butter or canola oil; margerine does not seem to work as well or taste as good.<br /><br />The only issue with the White Bread Mix is excessive rising.  I've solved that by using the 1-pound-loaf-machine formula, rather than the entire (1.5-pound-loaf-machine) box. My machine IS a 1.5 pounder, but this white mix is EAGER.  I tried using a tad less than the full packet of yeast with the entire box of mix, but the bread still got huge and stuck to the inside of the lid upon baking.  You can either throw out the excess mix, save it up and make a full loaf when you have enough remainders, or run the dough cycle and finish the baking in the oven in a proper bread pan. I have only had the excess rising issue with the white bread mix.<br /><br />The Honey Wheat variety is even more delicious than the white, but does not slice quite as well.  It's a tad crumb-y, and maybe a bit softer: excellent for sandwiches.  Both make superb french toast.<br /><br />Also tried the 9-grain, which is a somewhat denser bread, and again has simply marvelous flavor.  I'm sorry I missed this whole bread machine concept until now, and am enjoying having flavorful and healthy bread, with a wonderful smell filling the house, and saving about $1.50 per loaf over supermarket bread.

review/summary: Great quality for a great price
review/text: I add a few extra things to make cinnamon chip bread with this mix in my bread machine (a little brown sugar, Lorann Buttery Sweet Dough flavor, and King Arthur Flour cinnamon chips).  I used to use Krusteaz white bread mix but was unhappy with it so switched to this Hodgson Mill mix.  I didn't tell my husband it was a different brand, but he noticed the change with the first slice of bread.  It had a better texture and a natural from-scratch taste... he was happy with the change, and so am I.  My mom now uses it too.  It rises lofty and high, filling my 2 lb-capacity bread machine.<br /><br />It does say to use 1 cup + 1 Tblsp warm/hot water (in addition to 2 Tblsp butter), but I always have to use 1 cup + 4 Tblsp water to get the right dough moisture, even with adding 2 tsp extract too.  I live in the Pacific Northwest so it's not like we have a dry climate here.  Something to note if you've never made yeast bread before, as the dough comes together you'll need to check its consistency to see if it needs more water.

review/summary: Is pretty good
review/text: This bread machine bread mix is not as good as a few others I have tried but Amazon does make it available for purchase which makes it a good choice. I wish Amazon would carry Eagle Mills white bread mix. It is my favorite but I will settle for this brand because I cannot find the Eagle Mills bread at a good price. I have had problems with the honey wheat mix in this brand, I cannot get it to rise properly but all in all this brand is really the only option available.

review/summary: Hodgson Mill White Bread
review/text: I am so totally satisfied by Hodgson Mill products & I probably have purchased > 100 loaves at this point.  I used some as a present to my brother with good results, too.<br /><br />Never have I seen "old" smelling mix nor have I ever had a yeast failure.  Their taste & texture is wonderful. Never have I had a "slicing failure" where you can't get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down. The different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as Chopped Nuts or Sesame Seeds or Millet Seed or - - use your own imagination.  Coming in nice units of 6 loaves makes pantry storage easy, and once opened, the carton yields 6 boxes with "Best By" dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost "goof-proofed".<br /><br />Next time you walk a grocery store, note the prices there! Here again, I think you really can't beat the quality with a really fair price that Hodgson provides.  It seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce & the best shipping available for their customers.<br /><br />Buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last 2-3 years.  I hope this helps decision making.

review/summary: Best bread I've made!
review/text: This bread is so good I just placed an order for another pack of six. I bake a loaf and it doesn't last the day...and there are only two of us here! My husband gave it a thumbs up. If you knew my husband, you'd realize what a great endorsement that is! Hodgson Mill Wholesome White Bread Mix became a staple in our house when I made the first loaf.

review/summary: This is a family favorite
review/text: This is an excellent bread mix for bread machines!  It comes out perfectly each time.  Raises well, has a nice texture, and my family loves the flavor.  I usually use my bread machine for just the dough cycle, then transfer it to a bread pan.  If you grease your bread pan and sprinkle in corn meal or corn pollenta (if you want a little extra crunchiness)it gives the loaf a nice crispy crust on the bottom.  I also add a few tablespoons of milled flax seed and/or oat bran to boost the fiber and nutrition content during the mix cycle.  Overall it makes a great everyday bread, and it's yummy as homemade french toast. A great thing to keep in your pantry.

review/summary: Super Easy taste great,
review/text: This Wholesome White Bread Mix by Hodgson Mill Is the easiest bread mix there is. Not that any of them are two hard, but all you need for this one is Water and Butter (or Vegetable Oil) and the Mix, witch also comes with a packet of Yeast. I have a 2 LB bread Maker and this 1 1/2 Bread makes a perfect loaf in it. And It can be easily adjusted for 1 pound Brad Makers. And you can also make it in your oven. It makes very good, substantial, white bread; from natural ingredients. Most of the time if I make the bread early I just have it for breakfast all by itself, I love it. I highly Recommend this Bread Mix.
