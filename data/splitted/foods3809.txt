review/summary: Organic licorice?  You can't be serious!
review/text: Seems people will buy anything w/ "ORGANIC" stamped on it these days.  This pomtastic licorice was pretty tasty.  I like Twizzlers.  Ok, I LOVE Twizzlers, but this stuff gives the old mystery mouth chomper a run for it's money.  It's licorice, it's organic.  You feel like there's a benefit to eating it.  Try some, maybe you'll live longer because of it.

review/summary: GOURMET TWIST ON A CLASSIC PRODUCT
review/text: When I was a kid, I loved red and black licorice twists. But that kid never imagined there'd be such a thing as an "organic pomegranate" twist! Thanks to the Paul Newman company ("Newman's Own Organics"), there is now!<br /><br />I'd call this a gourmet twist on a classic product. I got a sample of the pomegranate licorice, and saw that there are Black, Strawberry and Tangerine flavors as well. I'd like to try them all.<br /><br />I would have given this licorice 5 stars - it's tasty - but cut two stars for these reasons:<br />1) there's corn syrup in it - and not organic, either. If you use Paul Newman's good name, and then add "Organic" to the title, you'd better be sure that everything in is either organic, or darn healthy. High fructose corn syrup is not it!<br /><br />The other lost star:<br />2) You have to buy more than $40 worth of one flavor of licorice to get this particular product via Amazon! I never bought $40 worth of licorice in my life.<br /><br />Just so you know, each one of 15 packs you get comes in a plastic wrap pack, about 7 x 5 inches, and the twists within are about 4" long (hard to tell from the picture, right?).<br /><br />The product, by the way, is made in Mexico.<br /><br />If you do go for this, once you tear open a bag, and you don't happen to eat all the twists at one sitting, you had better put them in a ziplock. I left mine open a couple of days, and they dried up.<br /><br />Another quibble: the print on the packaging is so small, even with reading glasses, I can barely make it out - I'd guess the point size is 4 or 5? But there's a lot of unused space on the packaging, so "Newman's Own" - would you please increase the font to 10 or 12???<br /><br />Recommended - with reservations.

review/summary: Tasty twister...
review/text: I'm not a huge candy fan... a little chocolate here, some licorice there.  That's why I tried Newman's Licorice Twists.<br /><br />Twists have always been a favorite of mine.  They harken back to the day of the Saturday matinee at the local theater.  Unfortunately, most of the twists I find today are heavily sugar laden.  They taste good, but I just know I've eaten far more than I should and it's because of the sweetness.<br /><br />Newman's Organics don't contain nearly the sugar I've found in others which makes them taste a little bland yet they are satisfying.  Like most twists, I could eat a Newman's bag at one sitting, but I find that three or four are enough and I don't feel like I've over-extended my craving. The flavor is not as prominent as other flavors, but I don't mark that as a major fault.<br /><br />You can find cheaper versions of candy twists, and we all know that, after all, candy is candy. On the other hand, try these. They are pretty good and you don't feel quite so guilty.

review/summary: Tastes more like cranberry than pomegranate
review/text: I love licorice and was curious to try out some Pomegranate licorice.  I got a bag of this licorice through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />The licorice is nicely packaged and the package was easy to open.  Everyone in my family tried a piece of it.<br /><br />The licorice is has a tangy taste that everyone who tried it thought tasted more like canned cranberries than pomegranate.  Then there is a slightly perfumey aftertaste, that wasn't unpleasant but just different.<br /><br />I thought the licorice was different tasting but fine.  The texture is similar to Twizzlers, but slightly tougher.<br /><br />My 4 year old thought is was horrible and refused to eat more than a bit.  My co-workers thought it was interesting, but didn't want more than a small piece.<br /><br />So overall an okay product. I personally like it fine, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again. If you like the taste of canned cranberries and like licorice you should give it a try.

review/text: This is a great product, but I expect nothing less of Newman's Own.  It has a real fruit taste, kind of like fruit leather.  It wasn't too sweet and I like that all they use are organic sugar and such to create this product.  The only problem that I encountered was the fact that a serving size had a slight laxative effect.  I would definiately purchase this again.

review/summary: Licorice, Grown Up
review/text: If there is such a thing as gourmet licorice, this is it.  These taste like red licorice infused with fruit juice.  I can't say that I necessarily recognized the fruit flavor as distinctly pomegranate- it could just as easily be a berry flavor or other similar fruit.  Still, it makes for a tasty combination.  The result is not too sweet, and a bit firmer and chewier than what I was expecting.

review/summary: A healthier version of regular licorice candy
review/text: I've always loved licorice, so I had to try these. I got the pomegranate flavor and really liked them. They're chewy and not too sweet, but full of flavor. The mostly organic ingredients and real organic sugar instead of corn syrup in other brands of licorice makes them a healthier option. They taste a little like fruit strips in the shape of licorice. The bag doesn't have a way to re-seal it or a ziplock on top, which would have been convenient, but as far as the flavor and taste go, they are something I'd buy again.

review/summary: Twizzlers for grown-up foodies, perfect candy for an indie theater
review/text: As a kid, I loved going to movies and chewing on Twizzlers as soon as the previews started.  It has been a long time since I've had the candy, though, and I haven't been tempted by it for years.  These pomegranate licorice twists, though, are bringing back old cravings by updating them for an adult.  When I first started one of the twists, I was not a fan - I didn't think that the pomegranate flavor blended well with the hit of licorice flavor at the end.  I kept going, though, to put in an honest effort, and I grew to love these strangely addictive little candies.  It's not that the flavors don't blend - it's that they're textured and nuanced, rewarding slow contemplative chewing.  The pomegranate taste is juicy (and trendy, yes), and the spices keep things interesting.  I also like that the package has plenty of short twists, so they're easy to share, and each one isn't too much of a commitment if your friend doesn't enjoy the flavors.

review/summary: Not bad!
review/text: Let me start by saying I absolutely love Twizzlers.  These are definitely not Twizzlers!  I've never tasted anything Pomegranate before this.  They do have a nice, sweet flavor.  I like it!  I don't usually "do" organic, I couldn't care less, really, so that doesn't matter to me.  I just wanted to see how they tasted.<br /><br />The texture is a little harder (tougher?) than the aforementioned Twizzlers.  LOL!  This results in more pulling on dental work but they're not so hard that it did any damage to my dental work, and I have alot of that to worry about!  I would definitely buy these, just not on a regular basis.  Kind of a treat with a unique (yummy) flavor!

review/summary: More sweet than Pomegranate
review/text: Most of Newman's Own products are delicious. I've been a fan of his pasta sauce for several years, so I was happy to try their Licorice Twists. I typically prefer black Licorice and expect licorice to have at least some licorice flavor, if not a texture that is somewhere between chewy and hard. I found the texture of the Newman's Own Licorice to be overly soft, but find the flavor to be overpoweringly sweet. So much so that the pomegranate flavor is nearly undetectable.

review/summary: OK, but not really "licorice"
review/text: I liked these Newman's Own pomegranate licorice because of their organic ingredients, and wonderful smelling pomegranate fragrance upon first opening the package.  However, I almost couldn't taste the licorice, so it would be a misnomer to call them "licorice".  I also found them a tad too chewy, and more importantly, was disappointed by the addition of corn syrup to its ingredients list.<br /><br />However, they are certainly a wholesome alternative to the artificial feeling and tasting Twizzlers.  Additionally, the pomegranate flavor is a nice alternative to the usual licorice flavor (which I don't particularly like).

review/summary: decent licorice, interesting flavor
review/text: This is a review of the pomegranate flavor of Newman's Own licorice.<br /><br />Basically the two qualities of a licorice twist are flavor and chew, and this product was above average on both counts, though not superb. The flavor is definitely pomegranate so if you like that flavor, you'll be happy with this. I thought this had a teeny medicinal flavor, but I think that is sometimes true of the flavor anyway. The chew was on the chewy end of the licorice twist range, but not unpleasantly so. The twists are shorter than typical, and each stick is about 25 calories, with zero fat and 5mg of sodium. Made in Mexico with organic ingredients. Based on the success of this flavor I'll definitely try the tangerine.

review/summary: Very tasty, but contains corn syrup
review/text: Taste-wise, these are a huge improvement over the popular brand of red licorice sold today. Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice is firmer and you can actually taste the real pomegranage flavor. These seem more lightly sweetened than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, as well. My only complaint is that this Newman's Own product contains corn syrup for sweetener. So if you are going to eat red licorice, these are tasty, but don't think of them as health food! They are candy.

review/summary: They're OK, but not great.
review/text: I was sort of excited to try these because licorice is one of my favorite sweets & I'm always eying up new flavors to try out. This just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes.<br /><br />The good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good. It's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft. It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.<br /><br />The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things "watermelon" or "strawberry" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate. Then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant. I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.<br /><br />One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention "organic" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have "made with organic ingredients" on it, just "made with organic sugar". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.<br /><br />Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion. If you have a cast iron stomach (which admittedly mine isn't as strong as it once was but is still pretty good), then you probably won't have a problem with this. This has to be the first licorice product that has remained unfinished in my house ever.

review/text: I'm not a particularly "organic" kind of person.  I don't have anything against organic products but I don't seek them out nor am I willing to pay a premium for something that is organic as opposed to other products.  I know a good product though when I experience one.<br /><br />This fruit flavored licorice stick simply has more flavor and a more pleasing texture than other types of the more generic, "waxy" licorice twist, rope or nibs that are out there.  Opening the package I was hit by a wave of fruity aroma that alerted me to the fact that this was not like most other twists.  The flavor was strong, bold and not "sugary"  Add to it that the texture was soft but still had a "chewy" quality to it without being overly sticky.  Occasionally such products in the past have been a challenge for crowns and caps and this wasn't the case here.<br /><br />Anyone who values organic products will no doubt be encouraged by reading the ingredient list and I certainly wasn't turned off by that in the least.  In terms of pure taste and quality of the eating experience, the word "organic" never really crossed my mind.  It's just good.<br /><br />5 stars<br /><br />bart breen

review/text: With each one that I eat, I appreciate them more! The pomegranate is very good, although I would have been hard-pressed to identify this as pomegranate - more of a mixed berry. This licorice is a little thicker and waxier than your typical Twizzler - more of a sophisticated licorice, but not lacking any of the enjoyment. Okay, so it sticks to your teeth a bit more than the mass-produced variety, but it's worth it... my only complaint... a bit pricey for my taste. If I saw these in the store, they'd have to be under two bucks a pack for me to buy them. But hey, I'm cheap. If you're not, give these a try. Tasty.

They are very chewy, a little chewier than Twizzlers, and the fruit flavor is strong but not overwhelming.  I would say "the pomegranate flavor" but I really have no idea what pomegranate tastes like.  I found it interesting that pomegranate is the next-to-last ingredient - I guess it doesn't take much pomegranate to make a pomegranate-flavored product.<br /><br />All in all, if you like "licorice twists" in general, and you have slightly adventurous taste buds, I think you'll like these.b

review/summary: Addictive --  I had the entire pack for lunch.
review/text: Newman's Own Organics POMEGANATE LICORICE TWISTS contains about thirty sticks of pomegranate "licorice." The sticks have the dimensions of 1.0 cm wide by 11.0 cm long. I started on these immediately after opening the package, and thus I am only estimating the number of sticks as about thirty. The weight of the contents is 5 oz (141 grams).<br /><br />The uninitiated consumer might find the flavor to be a grape flavor. According to the label, the flavor comes from ELDERBERRY EXTRACT, POMEGRANATE JUICE CONCENTRATE, and LICORICE ROOT EXTRACT. There is no indication that any of the flavors are artificial or synthetic. Based on my experience as a consumer, I sometimes do not like flavorings that are artificial or synthetic, because of the off-taste that comes with them, perhaps due to contaminating by-products made during the organic synthesis. Also, some products such as tea bags containing flavored tea, have an artificial flavor that is over-powering and that contaminates brewing devices, kitchen utensils, and such, in a way that causes them to acquire the chemical flavor. At any rate, Newman's Own Organics POMEGRANATE LICORICE does not contain any synthetic flavors.<br /><br />The licorice sticks are on the soft side. The color is a dull (not glossy) dark purple. This is in contrast to "red licorice" found in drug stores and supermarkets, which is hard and unnaturally glossy (like fingernail polish). Newman's Own Organics POMEGRANATE LICORICE TWISTS is a product that is unusual enough to be used as a component of a gift-basket, for example, as a holiday gift. This kind of gift basket may also include, for example, an expensive silver bell, embroidered note cards, and gourmet chocolates.

It's a lightly sweetened licorice twist, made with all natural, organic ingredients.  It has only a trace of fat and is low in sodium and sugar.  That I definitely like.

If you like licorice, I do recommend giving this one a try.

review/text: Oh I was so happy to find this. It is so good, and knowing that it is organic is awesome.<br />So good. If you want a comparison the texture is somewhat like Nibs. But way better.<br />At least if I have an addiction to licorice, it is so good.

review/summary: Yummy! Fruity! Delicious!
review/text: I adore certain kinds of licorice...I know I got this from my mom...she and I both loved this Englishy licorice called Allsorts.<br />I am not a fan and I do not indulge in foods...is licorice an actual food...that have artificial colors and weird long named preservatives in them...so when this product was offered to me...I pounced!!!<br /><br />It came yesterday and my husband and I each had two pieces after dinner...we were cautiously optimistic because it is a<br />Paul Newman product and we usually love these products.  They are usually excellent.<br /><br />We were not disappointed with this licorice.<br />It is not overly sweet...is 70% organic and just tastes really delicious.  We had the pomegranate ones and again...loved them!!!<br />We actually each had two more pieces before going to bed.  I am counting the ones left in the bag...so that we each get our fair share until I can find them locally.<br /><br />And now I am wondering...is an addiction to this licorice a serious one?<br />Since there are 15 pieces in the bag...who will get the extra one?  Hmmm...

review/summary: Tasty, simple candy.
review/text: Newman's Organics Pomegranate Licorice is a pleasing upgrade from traditional Red Vines. The candy has a satisfying mouth feel combined with a subtle pomegranate flavor that beats the waxy, sugary cheapness of other licorices. I shared my package with five coworkers and we all loved this candy.

review/summary: Not my cup of tea
review/text: I absolutely love junk red licorice, so I thought that I would try the Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists since they would probably be a much healthier treat.  The initial taste was okay, yet not quite right... they had a kind of weird wheat flavor and heavier texture, which is not the kind of thing you want to taste when you're thinking red licorice.  But it was the after-taste that left me thinking "yuck!"  It was just plain strange, almost minty, but again with a grain flavor.  I could not put my finger on what the flavor was, but then after looking at the ingredients list, it made sense: the number one ingredient is wheat!  Now this is much healthier than regular red vines that consist of mainly corn syrup, but I would not ever eat these!  Now, I should mention that all the rest of my family tried them too, some who love sweets and some that do not, and they all thought they tasted fine.  So I guess if you are looking for something sweet to munch on that is a little bit healthier give them a try, but don't think that they will taste like red vines.

review/summary: Can't say I'm a fan.  Oh well!  I still like  lots of other Newman's own products.
review/text: I am not a gourmet food expert.  I just know what I like and I didn't much care for the Pomegranate Licorice although in general I like most anything pomegranate flavored.  Even actual pomegranate.  Go figure.<br /><br />Upon first sniff of the product I thought:  This smells just like a scented candle!  It smelled nice.  But smelling a candle and eating a candle are two different things.  Just because something smells nice does not mean it tastes nice.  Anyway it kind of tasted like it smelled... like a scented candle.  It wasn't maybe that unpleasant.  But it was not as good as licorice should be.<br /><br />I thought it had a weird taste to it.  It to me tasted very much like you might imagine a scented candle to taste like.<br /><br />The texture was good- not too sticky.  But the taste was what is making me rate this at only 2 stars.  I just didn't care for it.  Taste is a pretty subjective thing though and I see so many other reviewers are giving it raves so perhaps I am just the odd man out.

review/summary: Pomegranate
review/text: Talk about awesome!  This licorice is so tasty, so good, and so satisfying.  It is pomegranate flavored and tastes so good!  Since it is pomegranate-flavored, I guess you could say it is fruity licorice, which, to me, is the best type.  This licorice has a tangy pomegranate flavor.  Heaveny fruity flavor.<br /><br />This licorice is so good, and I've already ate most of it.  I will have to hide the rest from myself.<br /><br />The texture is that of which is normal for licorice.  It is not too sticky.  Just perfect.<br /><br />Perfect texture, perfect taste, perfect flavor.<br /><br />This product is made with organic sugar, organic wheat flour.  It also has other ingredients.<br /><br />These licorice twists are so good, I will definitely be buying more.  Lots more.  It has been many, many years since I have had licorice of any type, but I am already hooked on these pomegranate licorice twists by Newman's Own.

review/text: The twists are wonderfully soft and chewy, and they stick in your teeth in a good way. However, the mix of licorice and pomegranate flavor is strangely medicinal, and the twists aren't really sweet enough for my tastes. Still, they're a bit addictive, which makes it impossible to give them a one-star rating.

review/summary: Somewhat Better Tasting Than Pencil Erasers
review/text: I have bought and enjoyed "Newman's Own" brand products for years.  This however has now changed with their "Pomegranate Licorice".  it may be "all natural" but apparently that also means "No Flavor" and a texture that could pull fillings..<br /><br />The smaller print mentions this is the "second generation" so I presume his kids are running it.<br /><br />I love licorice.  This however is only marginally better than gnawing pencil erasers.  The flavor is bland, with only a vague hint of something that might be called "pomegranate" if you had never actually tasted the real thing.  The licorice was stiff and past "chewy" and on into "stale" and is now sitting like lead in my stomach.  I am actually thinking of getting an antacid to counter this stuff.<br /><br />Save your money. "Newman's Own" made a major miss on this one and I don't think their dad would be proud.<br /><br />If you want a really good licorice, try this one on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7EIKO">Darrell Lea Red Strawberry Soft Eating Liquorice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)</a>

review/summary: Super Tasty
review/text: I am already a fan of Newman's Own Organics line of products.  I think they are generally high quality, reasonably priced and have a great track record as a charitable organization.  So, I was really looking forward to trying out the Pomegranate Licorice.<br /><br />When you first open the package, you can immediately smell the sweet sugary fruit scent of pomegranate.  The next thing you notice is the rich red, well pomegranate, color.  One thing I liked right off the bat is that the licorice sticks are not super long like a Twizzler.  They are shorter and more manageable to eat.  They are a also not overly sticky and do not leave a sticky residue on your fingers.<br /><br />Taste wise, they are great.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of this licorice is that they are not super sweet.  While they have a strong sugary smell, they are not obnoxiously sweet like Twizzlers.  The licorice has a nice chewy texture and trends towards soft.  The pomegranate taste is subtle.  At first you cannot taste it at all, instead tasting the sugar and gelatin flavors.  As you chew the pomegranate taste grows and by the end has a nice strong flavor.  The pomegranate flavor is also very good.  I haven't ate too many raw pomegranates but I do like the POM juice products.  This licorice compares well against the POM juice products.<br /><br />So, as a nice treat to share with the family, I highly recommend.

review/text: I have always loved just about any product that Newman's Own has put out but for once, I am disappointed. Everybody in our family sampled Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists but and the response was tepid at best and 'yuch' at worst. It's not that anyone hates pomegranate either as we often buy pomegranate juice or whole pomegranates.<br /><br />Our biggest complaint is that there was too much chewing involved for too little flavor and even then there was an unpleasant aftertaste. Sad to say, we are not likely to buy this product again.

review/text: I was intrigued by the idea of a pomegranate flavored licorice and wasn't sure at first if I would love it or hate it.  I was pleasantly surprised on my first bite and nearly finished a package all on my own!<br />I like that it has natural ingredients and is low fat.  Not all ingredients listed are organic but on the plus side there are no artificial colors or flavors added.  For a candy it's a relatively guilt free choice and can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike.

review/text: I haven't tasted licorice in a long time. What a treat this Newman's organic brand is. They offer a wide selection of flavors, and I found the pomegranate exceptionally good. It has an exotic taste, very deep and rich, and it quicky became evident that you can't eat just one twist. Fortunately, the calorie count is around 130 for 5 twists, so I didn't feel guilty at all. A nice alternative to gum, lasts long and holds its flavor to the last bite.

review/summary: Yum! Great Flavor!
review/text: I love licorice! Red, Black (real stuff!) and sometimes the alternative flavors.  But none of that Twizzler stuff for me, it's just a tease of flavor as far as I'm concerned!<br /><br />I was fortunate to recieve a package of this Licorice from Amazon to try and review.  I love this licorice! It's very flavorful! Has a medium sweetness along with a juicy tartness rather like a real dried fruit roll-up.  I expected it to be soft, like the Aussie licorice, but was pleasantly surprised at how it hits a midline in being firmer than the Aussie but softer than the traditional Red and black Vine.  Yummy! Ooooh! my mouth is watering for more, but mine is all gone!<br /><br />I do like the flavor of Pomegranate and like the medicial properties of the berry and choose this flavor often. So when I had eaten a few pieces of the licorice, I detected another flavor and took a look in the ingredients list, expecting that possibly some cranberry extract would be found.  But instead I was pleasantly surprised to find a listing for Elderberry extract up higher in the content list than the pomegranate! Elderberry is even more healthy...the berries contain more vitamin C than any other herb except rosehips and black currant.<br /><br />Elderberry is often used for its antioxidant activity, to lower cholesterol, to improve vision, to boost the immune system, to improve heart health and for coughs, colds, flu, bacterial and viral infections and tonsilitis. Bioflavonoids and other proteins in the juice destroy the ability of cold and flu viruses to infect a cell. People with the flu who took elderberry juice reported less severe symptoms and felt better much faster than those who did not. Elderberry juice was used to treat a flu epidemic in Panama in 1995.<br /><br />What a fantastic tasting snack, while being healthy organically with an implication of some medicinal properties! I'm going to have to find another bag at the market while I wait for my re-order from Amazon to come!

review/summary: Great texture, but a tad bland on flavor
review/text: I am normally not a fan of licorice, but I was eager to taste Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists, as I love pomegranate. First, the good news: its evident that these licorice are a quality product. They're fresh, soft, and chewy. And now for the bad news: there's no real burst of flavor. The pomegranate is lacking a prominent presence, making for a dull dessert.<br /><br />Despite the phrase "organic" that appears on the package, only three of the ingredients are listed as organic: wheat flour, sugar and tapioca syrup. Is this a deal breaker? No, but it does seem somewhat misleading, as most will perceive this treat to be entirely organic.<br /><br />Here's a breakdown of the nutrition data:<br /><br />Serving Size: 5 pieces (42g)<br />Servings Per Container: About 7<br /><br />Calories: 130  Calories from Fat: 5<br />Total Fat: 0.5g (1%)<br />Sodium: 5mg (0%)<br />Total Carb: 32g (11%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 2g (8%)<br />Sugars: 10g<br />Protein: 2g<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Corn Syrup, Organic Tapioca Syrup, Vegetable Glycerin, Sunflower Oil, Elderberry Extract, Citric Acid, Natural Flavor, Pomegranate Juice Concentrate, Licorice Root Extract<br /><br />All in all, there are certainly worse sweets available, so Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice Twists do make for a healthier alternative. But if you're expecting a sweet, refreshing pomegranate treat, you may be disappointed.

review/text: This licorice has a great pomegranate flavor. I love pomegranate, so I really enjoyed the unique flavor. This licorice is also a bit firmer and chewier than the soft stuff you usually get in stores (Twizzlers, etc.), but I like my licorice a bit firmer and chewier. I also like that it's organic, and part of the Newman's Own line (which donates a lot of it's profits to charity). I will definitely pick this up at the store again, and look forward to trying some of the other flavors (tangerine, strawberry, etc.). If you like licorice and pomegranate, this is highly recommended.

review/text: I'd been reading about this product in magazines for almost a year, and couldn't wait to try it. I finally got to and it did not disappoint. Pomegranate is not an easy flavor to capture and somehow they were able to. I have tried all the NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS licorices and this was the hardest in terms of chewing, but it was not overly hard. I have had some that I know would put any dental work at risk, and this is a good option if you like slighly harder licorice but still want something that is chewy. Not too sweet, but good if you need a candy fix. And of course, it's got all natural ingredients, so you can get your candy fix as I have been doing without feeling in the least bit guilty!

I was very excited to try the Newman's Own and thought pomegranate would be an awesome flavor to try. WELL...I was very disappointed. I thought the flavor was very strong, and really didn't taste much like pomegranate. It tasted more like liquid cough medicine. I definitely will not look for this flavor again, and may really hesitate to buy the brand.

Not sure where that comes from, but it was the only reason for a 4-star instead of 5-star rating.  Would I get more of these?  Possibly, but if other flavors had that same aftertaste, I wouldn't get them too often.

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists, 5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 15)
review/text: I wouldn't say I'm a pomegranate fan, but I do like good tasting licorice, and I did like this. It's rich and flavorful but not overpowering or sickeningly sweet like many brands.  The pomegranate flavor is a nice change from the usual "red" flavor twists out there. This is a bit chewier than other brands, however, but it looks like it may be from the ingredients (including organic wheat flour  and organic sugar and corn syrup instead of the usual high-fructose corn syrup), rather than from being stale.  I found it to have a mild sweet and tangy flavor one would expect from a quality licorice. It's a healthier choice, offering fewer calories and some organic ingredients, but be warned, it's hard to put down and easy to overindulge. I think it's one of the better ones on the market. In my opinion, if you're a licorice fan, looking for something a bit different, and want a tasty treat not jammed full of sugar and chemicals, this is worth looking at.

review/text: These tasty treats are absolutely wonderful. I tried the pomegranate variety and they had pretty much the same flavor as cherry, but that is nothing to complain about. The flavor is very addictive. They are sweetened with "naturally dried cane sugar," which is still sugar. I don't think there is any natural advantage to the dehydrated cane sugar fad. Sugar is sugar. The folks at Newman's Own ought to think about sweetening with stevia, which is both natural and free of any calories. Just a suggestion.<br />Even with sugar, this candy is a real delight and something to stock up on for Halloween trick or treat.

review/text: I am a big licorice fan, so I thought I'd give these a try.  The best thing about them is that they are made with organic ingredients, which makes them less guilt-inducing than most licorice.  Texture: a bit rubbery/chewy but fine. Taste: Takes some getting used to, but ok, especially because the pomegranate is not overly strong. Aftertaste: my least favorite part, it's pretty chemical and makes me want to drink lots of water.<br /><br />I would be willing to try the other flavors (black & strawberry, probably not tangerine) but I don't think I'd ever buy this flavor.

review/summary: Oh, man...
review/text: I'm not sure I even have the words to convey how good this stuff is. But take note: I say this as a twist purist. As far as I'm concerned, it's not a twist if it doesn't bloody well taste like licorice, or anise, or fennel, or Pernod, or whatever you want to call it and whatever variation of the flavor you're using. I want my licorice. But I figured, "hmm, pomegranate twists, might as well give it a shot. At least it's not those awful red things." And I got them, and I opened the bag, and...<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck recently said of the banana cream pie at Emeril's that "you put the first forkful in your mouth, and you can't think of anything except putting the next forkful in your mouth, and five seconds later there's none left!" Well, that's exactly what happened with these pomegranate twists. Good lord. I ended up wondering where they'd gone, and then going to the store to get more of them (unfortunately, they haven't hit the mistake on the lake yet). Deep, rich pomegranate flavor, perfect texture. Warning: when you go to the store and try these, buy the smallest bag available if you're watching your figure. They'll be gone in five seconds. *****

review/text: These didn't last long in this household! We both love licorice, but this was especially nice because it didn't have that cloying, oversweetness that comes with too much sugar or HFCS. That and the pomegranate is a really nice twist, if you'll forgive the pun--much better than artificial strawberry! Really good texture, too, softer but with a good chew to it. We have a winner!

review/text: "Newman's Own" has expanded into candy!<br /><br />Unfortunately, my family found this product to be merely "so-so".  One daughter, who is really into pomegranate flavors really enjoyed it; most of the rest of us could take it or leave it -- at best.  Personally, I found the flavor rather peppery -- not what one necessarily expects from candy.<br /><br />Nothing special here.

review/text: There are those of us with a sweet tooth, and there are those of us without.  I am of the first category.  I especially love fruity candies, like Twizzlers and gummies, so had to try these out.  They had a nice balance of sweetness, just the right amount of chewiness, and had a little more of a natural fruit flavor to them than any other licorice twists I've tried.  Plus, I'm always happy to try out Newman's Own products based on what I know the company - that they donate a portion of the proceeds to charity.

review/summary: The Best Licorice Ever
review/text: I really hate black licorice and there hasn't been a flavor of licorice I really adored since the old "Pull and Peel" Pech Twizzlers they stopped making roughly fifteen years ago. However, after trying the Newman's Own Organic Pomegranate Licorice, I feel in love with this age old candy once again.<br /><br />I'm always happy when someone creates a candy that is organic and flavorful, so right off, this own the licorice some points from me. Pomegrante has always been one of my favorite fruits long before it became a trendy product so I was happy to see this in candy form. I can't think of any other pomegrante candies that i have tried. Then there is the flavor. It doesn't taste exactly Pomegrante-y if you are comparing it to the seeds or juice of the fruit, but it does taste wonderful. It's a flavor you have to try to truly understand, but it is incredibly delicious.<br /><br />This is another great product by one of my favorite companies and it's definitely a treat I'll pick up again for long plane rides or the like.

I still like Twizzlers better though.

I, too, expected a different taste when I took my first bite, but after the surprise...... and another bite, I liked them.  They aren't as sweet as one might anticipate, but they have a nice, tangy flavor and are pleasing to my palate.  I do think they are a little expensive, but the profits go to charity.  I didn't experience the after-taste that some mentioned either.  I think if you bite into one without that red licorice paradigm in your mind you'll enjoy them as I did.  They are definitely worth a try.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Amazing Flavor for Licorice Fans
review/text: First of all you need to know that I'm a big licorice fan.  But, I'm really picky when it come to the licorice I chose to eat. I love the Austrian black and strawberry licorice, detest some of the so called licorice that really isn't licorice at all. Some of it leaves a bitter almost chemical taste in your mouth.  I was a little skeptical about Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice, but when I tried it I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a great flavor and added variety for licorice lovers.  The bonus is that it is made with lots of organic ingrediants, and real pomegranate flavor.  Ironically I just complained to Hansen's Naturals about their pomegranate green tea beverage, which contains no pomegranate at all.  To me if it says pomegranate and has a picture of a pomegranate on the can it better have pomegranate in the product.  So Hansen's Naturals are not natural at all and Hansen's is deceptive and dishonest in the products they offer.  Not so with Newman's Own.  I recommend Pomegranate Licorice Twists.

review/text: Wow, this one really suprised me! I've tried lots of other 'natural' or 'organic' licorices and this one by far beats them all. It has the best texture, most true to conventional licorice, not overly sticky or too soft like other naturals I've tried.<br />I also wasn't sure how I'd like the pomegranate flavor but found it very unique, in a good way! It didn't have a heavily artificial taste, just a light, natural fruity pomegranate taste. Traditionally I prefer strawberry flavored licorice.<br />One big bonus for me, I didn't have the same filmy feeling left on my teeth that other brands I've tried seem to coat my mouth with.<br />I only wish that the corn syrup used was an organic ingredient. I did contact the company and they reassured me that it was non-gmo corn.<br />Thanks Newman's Own! :) Can't wait to try the strawberry version!!!

review/summary: Flavor is OK, pricey
review/text: I received a sample pack of the Pomegranate Licorice from Amazon Vine to review.  I shared this treat with my sons & their friend.  Nothing was wrong with this, it didn't taste bad, it was just rather bland to me.  The boys gobbled it down and said it was OK.  I doubt they'd ever beg me to buy it for them, as kids do with favorite treats.<br />At this price, I'm glad they won't!

review/summary: A New Twist on Licorice Twists!
review/text: These really were quite yummy! I liked them every bit as much as the traditional strawberry. The "gumminess" (whatever that means) was perfect. Not to tough, not too limp. The Pomegrante flavor is something new but I found it refreshing.<br /><br />The only thing I might take to task is that I have come to that of Newmans Own products as being healthful, natural. WELLLL read the label.<br /><br />On the other hand, who wants healthy licorice!

review/summary: EVEN IF YOU'RE TIRED OF POMAGRANATE EVERYTHING,  TRY THIS
review/text: I'm an adult, I 've never lost my taste for junkfood, but I do try to upgrade the junkfood I eat. Though I am already bored with pomegrantate flavored everything, I gave this a try as I have liked other Newman's Own Organics products.<br /><br />On first taste the flavor was good, but left a slightly strange aftertaste.  This did not deter me I ate the whole package in about 15 minutes. The texture is nice and chewy and the flavor is interesting.<br /><br />Be aware, it is not all organic, but is 70% organic, and that's 100% more organic than most licorice.<br /><br />I'd like to try the tangerince flavor, but can't find it in stores.

review/summary: Three thumbs up!
review/text: My daughter is a huge licorice fan so I picked this up for her.  She'll eat red or black licorice so I wasn't too concerned with the pomegranate flavor because she isn't too picky.  Her first comment was that it didn't have any after taste and she liked that.  She said the flavor was good as was the texture.  Later, my father came to visit and tried it as well and also had nothing but positive comments.  As a mother, I like that it is organic and 70% natural.  I figure if my children want candy, at least this is a bit better alternative.  So, that is three thumbs up from two licorice eaters and one mom!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I finished off a package in under 10 minutes - these things are delicious! I've always been a fan of red licorice (Twizzlers and the like), but these Pomegranate ones are much tastier.  Slightly tangy and sweet, I would recommend these twists to anyone who loves licorice and loves Pomegranate.

review/summary: Tasty, Great Chew!
review/text: Nice idea -- that being organic and the use of pomegranate flavor -- but I would have preferred a more concentrated, stronger pomegranate flavor. It could probably use a little more sweetness. The licorice has a nice texture and great chew - just would have like more prominent flavors.

review/summary: Great for pomegranate candy lovers.
review/text: Until I saw this product, I had only ever seen licorice in black, cherry, or strawberry.  So it was refreshing to see Newman's Own come out with this new pomegranate flavor.  The flavor isn't strong, but definitely noticeable.  They aren't as long as Twizzlers, which is actually a good thing.<br />I still prefer strawberry flavor licorice, but these Newman's Own are definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Ribbon Candy
review/text: I purchased this product quite awhile ago. The pieces of candy were broken when I received it. I put it in the freezer to keep for Christmas and now, I have it out and it's extremely soft, sticky and although it looks nice, I won't buy this again. Not worth the price for the taste. Maybe it's because I put it in the freezer?

review/text: I have trouble finding other than clover honey where I live.  I did find one jar at Jungle Jims, put it didn't taste right, after all how many orange groves are in Pennsylvania where it came from according to the bottle.  I found it on Amazon amd was very happy to do so.  It tastes great, probably because it comes from Florida.

review/text: I highly recommend purchasing Schar's GF ciabatta. The rolls are parbaked which means you need to bake them for 5 minutes before eating.  Usually GF rolls are hard and dry, but not these. They come out of the oven fresh and wonderfully delicious! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00718VLDE">Schar's Gluten Free Multigrain Ciabatta Parbaked Rolls (6 Pack)</a>

review/summary: So good!
review/text: I tend to be a bread snob anyway, and have had a difficult time switching to gluten-free baked goods. I ran across these at a local store and decided to give them a try - I'm really glad I did,and even happier to see them here on Amazon.<br /><br />These are "par-baked" - meaning you need to pop them in the oven for about 5 minute to finish baking them. They come out crisp on the outside, and tender inside. The crumb is a bit softer than a classic ciabatta, but these aren't heavy or tough like many gluten-free breads or rolls. These are definitely an item I will keep in my freezer/pantry from now on!

review/summary: good miso soup :)
review/text: this is a great miso soup if you don't have time to make one. alot of these instant miso soup tend to have MSG, but this one contains no MSG. so i definitely recommend it. it's a little too big for me though, so it'd be better if it's smaller. but other than that, i like this miso soup since you can just add hot water, and drink it right away :)

review/summary: An Excellent Food
review/text: Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference and, as an added bonus, I have yet to meet a dog that doesn't like it! My only quibble with the senior formulation of this great food is that it is very dry - I really do recommend that you add at least a touch of a good oil and water to it to prevent dry skin - dogs get most of their hydration from food.

review/summary: used to love it, but a scary experience for my golden raised questions
review/text: I fed my two golden retrievers and cat Wellness products for a long time with good results. I really respect the approach Wellness has tried to take and always thought their ingredients were excellent.  Their ingredient list is outstanding-- human grade meats and veggies/ a holistic health approach.<br /><br />Then we had a strange incident. I opened a new bag and gave it to my dog, and shortly after eating breakfast she became terribly sick for about a week---severe, severe diarrhea. I thought this was a weird coincidence, so I discarded the bag just to be safe, and went through another bag of Wellness with no problems. Then about a month later I again opened a fresh bag and my dog became terribly ill shortly after eating the first bowl-- same symptoms.  (Both bags were not expired.)<br /><br />I can't help suspecting that something about how the ingredients were mixed in those bags made my dog terribly sick. I stopped feeding Wellness to my pets and we have had no further problems over the last 6 months. I should add that my dog had never had any allergy problems of any kind and has always been very healthy. She has never had a bad reaction to any food-- she is a chow-hound and does not have a sensitive system.<br /><br />I reported our experience to the store where I purchased the food and they agreed to notify Wellness. I don't know if the company has looked into this issue or not.<br /><br />If your dog stays healthy on Wellness I would still support it as a good choice given the ingredient list. However, if your dog has symptoms like my dog's symptoms, I'd suggest to you take that seriously and switch foods.
