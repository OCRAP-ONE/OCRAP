review/summary: Great ingredients, great bar
review/text: These Creme Filled Wafer bars taste absolutely amazing!!!  They do not have any of the chalky taste of most high protein bars and it is very light and crispy, compared to any other bar on the market. I have a very busy lifestyle with work, the gym, surfing, mountain biking, etc, so bars and protein drinks are a staple.  I have tried many bars and this one is my favorite.  I used to love zone bars because they were crispy and not as "Dense" as most protein bars, but then I discovered these bars and I will never go back.  These bars are the perfect snack when you need protein fast. I take no xplode before I workout so I can't eat anything 2 hours prior to my workout. My workout are usually 1 to 2 hours long and not eating for 4 hours can really put a strain on your goals of bulking up.  I take a power crunch bar with me to the gym and eat it during my workout. Its light enough where it doesn't reduce the pump I get from the no xplode and it's just enough to get the protein you need to build muscle.

review/summary: Great for trekking while on holiday
review/text: I was lucky enough to meet the creator of Power Crunch while on holiday in the Sacred Valley in Peru. We had 2 weeks of day to day trekking in the Andes and our in-take of daily Power Crunch bars really saved the day. The terrain, the altitude and the food were challenging while being of our normal whole-food diet. I felt like Power Crunch really helped my body adjust and get a little extra out of an eXtreme vacation and tour schedule. I'm so excited by the taste and texture I'm ready to find a distributor in Asia so that Power Crunch can be part of my active daily lifestyle. You only need to try one to be hooked; do it when you need a little extra boost and you'll be back for more.

review/summary: Tasty and light
review/text: If those dense, heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can't handle them after a hard workout, this one is worth trying.  It's very tasty and light.  The wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition.  I will say that if you're looking for a "super bar" this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars I like and a bit less protein and carbs, but it's worth buying because it tastes really good, it's light and easy to digest.  For me, this is a great meal replacement bar/snack or great after a light to moderate workout.

review/summary: These don't taste bad. They don't taste great, either.
review/text: They don't fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water. It's what my friend does with his nutrition bars.<br /><br />However, not only are these incredibly light, small, and I mean small, we're talking 3-4 bites, maybe 5-6 half-bites. Even if you chew 1-2 minutes(nearly impossible)<br /><br />They have a kind of sandy texture. Like you've just eaten caramel dipped in sand.<br /><br />The taste is alright, but I am disappointed. Triple Chocolate and I could not taste the chocolate. It barely tasted like anything...just had a kind of bland taste to it.<br /><br />At this price...I am disappointed massively. These were top rated by so many...<br /><br />But I think I will try the bar my friend has - his are 32g's of protein, 2.5x this ones, and only 30-40 more calories. Those are filling from what I've seen, have way more to them as well. Bigger, about 30% bigger size as well. To top it off? They are the same price and often on sale...they also have Vitamins and anti-oxidants.<br /><br />These, I don't know. If you down them with a Glass of Carnation instant breakfast, it goes well, kinda a good combo, not to heavy, just right. But this + water...not filling in the least.<br /><br />These are treats for after a meal, I suppose. I was looking for meal replacers. Ect, replace a breakfast here, or a lunch there. So I don't lose any muscle, just fat.<br /><br />I would recommend them if you want something very light to have as an after-snack to a small meal<br /><br />But these are not meal replacers. These do not go by themselves, you eat these + a meal. Just make sure you know that.<br /><br />It's my fault, I suppose for not researching.

review/summary: Not The Best Option Out There...
review/text: I had high hopes for these bars... I am a huge chocolate wafer fan! I am familiar with protein/energy bars and knew going into it that there would more than likely be a hint of that chalky protein bar flavor... but it hit me like a brick wall with the first bite. Luckily my husband has tastebuds that are muted to flavor, so he has slowly been able to work through this box of protein bars so we weren't just throwing money away... but wow. Just overall very disappointing. I went by reviews before deciding to purchase these, and most reviews were awesome...  so I can only assume that these are just one of those bars that is hit and miss. Some are going to love it, others are going to hate it. Unfortunately, I am in the latter group for this one. (And as a side-note, I shouldn't even call this a protein bar since it only contains 13g protein --- my all time favorite protein bar contains 20g. Granted, 13g is still a lot... but if you can choke this down, surely you can choke down a 20g bar with more flavor. In the future I will stick with my tried and true Chocolate Mint Builder's bars.)

review/summary: Mouth watering!
review/text: Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite.  It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies. Power Crunch does not have the thick, hard protein "paste" you'll find in most bars. The chocolate wafer style is soft and almost disintegrates in your mouth - quite a contrast from most protein bar offerings. I've eaten probably a dozen a week for the last six weeks and I still cannot get enough of these bars.<br /><br />In all fairness most protein bars have 30+ grams of protein - more than double the amount than the 14 grams in Power Crunch. So personally I consider Power Crunch to be a very healthy high protein candy bar rather than protein bar. But after tasting Power Crunch, it'll be a long time before I reach for another Detour, MET-Rx, Oh Yeah, South Beach, or any other bar.

review/summary: A *true* protein bar, does NOT contain hydrogenated oils!
review/text: My wife and I love these Power Crunch bars!  They have a great protein content and are low carb, which is great for our current exercise and diet routine.  Contrary to what's listed above, it does *not* contain hydrogenated *anything.*<br /><br />However, we're a bit concerned with the Palm Oil and Palm Kernel oils, and were told by BNRG that this was the healthiest alternative for the chocolately coating on the outside and the inside filling that would remain solid at room temps.<br /><br />My suggestion to them would be to make an alternative variety that has NO chocolatey coating (much like Bisco's sugar wafers), thus limiting the amount of oils that they'd need to use in these otherwise stellar protein bars.

review/summary: Cookies & Cream taste weird
review/text: I have had the vanilla, triple chocolate and PB versions of the power crunch bars and those are all very good.  The cookies & cream flavor however tastes very strongly of fake sugar.  For some reason the other flavors do a better job at masking this, the C&C  does not.<br /><br />I recommend having these with a hot drink, if you drink something cold while eating them you get a weird filmy coating to the roof of your mouth.  All flavors work well at keeping hunger away for 3 hours and do not cause gastric distress like some low carb bars can.  I prefer the other flavors over the C&C, but these are fine if the other flavors are gone and I need a quick bite with my morning coffee.<br /><br />I do not crave sweets after I eat a power crunch bar; sometimes sugar substitutes make me want to eat more sugar, but these actually cut my sweet tooth off at the pass.

review/text: I was looking for a bar to snack on that wasn't loaded with carbs and sugar. This was it. It only has 4g of sugar in the whole bar and the rest is STEVIA. I couldn't tell at first and i wondered why it still tasted sweet so when i read the label I found the stevia. LOW LOW LOW on carbs too. I hate the gummy yucky..chewy texture of most health bars or power bars. this was a nice change and crisp. I only eat the Triple chocolate and the chocolate peanut butter. Those are the only two flavors that use STEVIA. the other flavors use sucralose and tasted waaaayyyyy too sweet.<br /><br />I bought them online here becuz at the store they were usually 3/$5. SO this was a bargain.<br /><br />Love them, Thanks. Taste even better cold out of the fridge.

review/text: These bars contain hydrolyzed whey protein, which is the highest quality. It doesnt matter if a bar contains 100g of protein if you dont absorb any of it. Hydrolyzation "pre digests" the protein so it absorbs more completely and quickly. These bars are the only ones that contain only hydrolyzed protein that I've found. Hydrolyzed protein also gives less gas. They taste great as well. They are very light and melt in your mouth a bit.

review/summary: Delicious and Nutritious - best tasting bars on the market
review/text: These don't taste like good for you food, but they are. My 2 year old loves them. I wanted to clarify something written in one of the other reviews -  that these bars DO NOT contain hydrogenated oil. They contained hydrolyzed whey protein (I had to check it out for myself, as I certainly want to avoid bad oils). Here is the link to the nutritional information [...]

review/summary: Delicious, with a catch...
review/text: I love these things. Eating one of these bars is highly reminiscent of snarfing down a handful of those super-sweet wafer cookies in all their unhealthy, refined yumminess. The only problem? Despite the 14gr of protein, I find these bars utterly unsatisfying. As someone who needs to make sure every calorie counts bigtime, I can't afford to eat a protein bar that won't carry me over to the next mealtime. Unfortunately, I can (and have) devoured more than one of these at a time in a single sitting. I believe I purchased a single bar in the grocery store recently as a "treat", but I can never buy a whole box of these bars ever again. These taste great, no question (though I do detect the "protein" aftertaste), just don't get them if you shouldn't be cramming them down your throat two at a time. Unless, of course, you have more self control than I do.

And I recommend storing in freezer. :)  And i forgot the cookies n creme.... Also delicious!

review/summary: Quality Energy Bar!
review/text: I've tried these a couple times now, and first of all, they are delicious for an energy bar. Second, I've eaten them before and during workouts and I really do notice a difference in my energy level and stamina. There's no stimulants in it, as far as I can tell - and I don't feel a caffiene buzz or anything, I just notice myself motivated to keep going at times when before I definitely would have stopped. It's really fascinating! Plus, I didn't feel any gnawing hunger to consume high energy (meat, cheese, etc.) stuff at the end of the workout like usual. I'm a skeptic when it comes to different health fads and supplements and stuff, and this looked sorta like one of those that looked fancy but just were a waste of money. But after this second time of trying one right before a workout, I'm convinced this is quality stuff, and I just bought 2 dozen more!

review/text: I was looking for some protein bars that taste good and were soyless. These come close (soy lethicin is still listed).<br />Warning: don't order in warm climate/weather as the chocolate coating melts, even in your hands from holding it.<br />The stevia (sweetener) has a noticeable aftertaste that needs getting used to.<br />I still need to find a substitute protein bar that is good for you, not made of soy and tastes good.<br />I have to say, other than the above, these are light and crispy.

review/summary: Guilt-free and delicious
review/text: Most protein bars are either loaded with sugar (and if you are in the market for protein bars, you probably don't want tons of simple carbs) or sugar alcohols (which are an excellent laxative! it does let manufacturers say say 'low sugar' on the packaging though), have a strange taste to them, and honestly aren't as good as a source of protein as they may appear -- most contain Soy protein.<br />They also tend to have a texture that isn't very appetizing, either really chewey or really gooey.<br /><br />The main difference with these bars is that they taste amazing. They taste what they look like - a giant chocolate wafer, have very little sugar and no sugar alcohols either. They have a pure whey protein source, no soy protein in these (I always read the packaging on protein bars and sadly soy protein is very common). Nutritionally they are not too bad at all, they are definitely great for a pre-workout treat. They are fairly high in fat, very low in carbs, and middle of the road protein (for a protein bar).  But the fact that it has 0 sugar alcohol, very low sugar, whey protein instead of soy and taste delicious really does make up for the higher fat content.<br /><br />Now it isn't really a downside but they are dry and make your mouth water a ton - make sure you have something to drink with them. But really these are my favorite protein/energy bars out there.

review/summary: It's like a cookie . . . with protein!  Yum, yum, yum.
review/text: I stumbled upon these quite by accident: a co-worker left them in the kitchen (people often bring in leftovers or things to share).  I read the package and mused "Creme filled wafer bar?  Intriguing."  I'd never heard the words "wafer" and "protein" used in the same sentence.  But I remembered how much I used to love going to my grandma's house as a kid because she used to keep vanilla, chocolate and strawberry wafer cookies in the cookie jar.<br /><br />These tasty, light crunchy wafers do remind me of those wafer cookies from my childhood.  The peanut butter ones are sweetened with fructose and stevia.  Stevia is a natural swetener with a sightly unusual taste that might be jarring if you're not used it.  It's sweet, but doesn't taste quite like sugar, which is what I like about it.  These bars are just sweet enough to be enjoyable, but not sweet enough that I would want to devour a whole box of them like I would a candy bar.<br /><br />They are light and crispy, and perfect as a snack or a treat.  They're only 10 grams of carbs and 5 grams of sugar [just over a teaspoon] - perfect if you're watching your carbs and want a sweet[ish] snack.  I brought the chocolate one with me to the movies the other night, and while other people had their candy, I had my own "candy" to enjoy, without the suagr high and with the benefit of 13 g of portein.  I can't see a big, buff muscley guy getting a lot out of them [men need more calories & protein], but for me, they are the perfect addition to my health and fitness plan.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change [for nutritional purposes] would be to add more fiber.  But I suppose adding that would affect the texture and possibly the taste.

review/summary: Best Power Bar.  Low Sugar
review/text: I have been searching for a power bar with high protein and very low sugar do to health reasons.  This is the perfect solution.  Tastes great...no cardboard taste here!!  The whey chocolate tastes like chocolate.  I almost feel guilty eating it!!  During vists with family and friends during Easter I was able to contain my urges during desert time.  While everyone else was chowing down on sugary cakes, pies and chocolate, I whipped out my protein bar and felt like part of the group!<br /><br />Thank you for the awesome product.  I will be ordering a lot more.

review/summary: My Doctor suggested these
review/text: So far I have only tried the Vanilla and Chocolate and they were both excellent! These bars were suggested by one of the top weight loss Doctors in the country. Combining these bars for breakfast, having a protein and vegetable for lunch and a protein and vegetable for dinner and sugar free jello or sugar free pudding .for dessert I have lost 14 pounds in 4 weeks and I don't have much more to lose!<br /><br />My Doctor told me that you must multiply the grams of protein in this bar times 2.5 to get the true grams of protein, since the protein used in these bars are di- and tri- peptides, and you absorb 2.5 more of the actual protein than in a regular protein meal. Therefore the true protein grams are:<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cream: 32.5g Protein<br />Peanut Butter Fudge: 32.5g Protein<br />Triple Chocolate: 32.5g Protein<br />Cookies & Cream: 35g Protein<br />Vanilla Cream: 35g Protein<br />Wild Berry Cream: 35g Protein

review/text: Gave the vanilla cookie to my husband who is a diabetic. He has been missing the sweet baked goods he used to be able to eat. He said this tasted like a cookie. The carb count is good but the fat content is high so we only use this as a treat when he really needs something sweet and other low carb food is not satisfying him. Highly recommend it in moderation. We want to try some of the other flavors now.

review/text: I have tried lots of different protein bars but the main problem is always the same, they taste like protein bars.

review/text: Remember those Lil Debby peanut butter stick things? That's what these protein bars taste like. These are probably the most flavorful protein bars I have ever had. They aren't grainy like many others and they keep me full when I need it as an afternoon or preworkout snack. Sometimes there is a bit of dry after taste, but it is quickly solved with a swigg of water.

review/summary: Fantastic bar
review/text: I am recovering from pretty extensive GI surgery, so while I need a lot of protein, I have to be careful about what I eat to get it. I am on a bland diet and sensitive to many things right now, so I was having a hard time figuring out new things to eat during the day that are still somewhat healthy.<br /><br />I researched protein bars for days and all of them had either tons of sugar alcohols or were loaded with nuts or fiber. I needed one that would be easily digestible. I was SO glad when I found these but I only purchased one because I was still skeptical. Needless to say, here I am on Amazon buying them by the box.<br /><br />These bars are light, easy to digest, don't sit in your stomach like a brick, and one bar in the morning will curb your hunger until you're ready for lunch. I appreciate that they have 3 new bars that are sucralose free. I just wish they had more flavors!!!

review/text: Wafer is light weight but a package of french vanilla packs over 200 calories!  Weight to calorie ratio is important while hiking/backpacking.  This bar is lighter than most power bars on the market and tastes DELICIOUSLY like a desert!<br /><br />I only tried the vanilla flavor therefore I can't recommend other flavor but I am heading to my local Trader Joe's to get cookie n cream and the berry flavor to try (am tired of the chocolate and peanut butter varieties among all the energy bars).<br /><br />The vanilla wafer isn't too sweet and the crunch wafer is a great alternative from the usual soft/dense/chewy energy bars out there.

They are light and don't weigh you down, but are still enough to ease hunger.  Especially good after a workout or for a high protein dessert when you want something sweet.  They do however have sugar in the ingredient list, but only have 5 grams of sugar for the whole bar.

review/summary: JONES SODA CO. CARBONATED CANDY ORANGE & CREAM(Pack Of 16)
review/text: I took 2 stars off of this product for the following reasons: 1) Way overpriced being it comes in yes 16, but about 2 Tic Tac� size in length 50pc. tins which when received kinda disappointed me seeing as though the picture does not do it justice making it look larger. 2) The product itself is O.K. and does tastes like orange and fizzles on your tongue in this little round pill shaped candies, but fails to have any cream flavoring to go with that which was a big letdown, unlike Jones's actual bottled 12oz. Orange and Cream Soda! Not completely terrible and fun to take a tin in your pocket or pop some while playing video games or watching YouTube videos like I do, but don't overpay at your own risk, seeing as I purchased this through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com at $17.88(about $1.11 per canister/tin X 16) and ended up with a perfectly packaged and swift arriving product but felt like I paid too much given size at that rate(straight Amazon's is listed @ $24.49 just so you know)! It's now up to you?!

review/summary: nice cup of tea  :)
review/text: I had never tried this brand of tea & there are not very many reviews on it. But recently they ran a $10 off promo so i snagged this flavor along with some of the regular white tea.  It arrived yesterday & so far i have brewed 2 teapots with the same leaves.  Not sure how a third steeping will go but the 2nd one was as strong as the first.<br /><br />There are whole dried rosebuds mixed in with the tea, which consists of tightly rolled whole white and green tea leaves. (yes, there is green tea in this. it's not 100% white tea)<br /><br />There appears to be very little if any (i don't see any) broken pieces or tea dust like i see in many of the loose leaf teas i have purchased in the past.  This was a VERY nice surprise as usually a lot of little pieces of tea escape the strainer & end up in my tea cup. Well, not with this tea. :)<br /><br />The packaging is cute, it comes in the pink tin pictured here.  It has a metal lid that screws on/off.  Inside there is another lid (made of flexible plastic) to help keep the tea fresh. This inner lid has a tab so that it can be easily removed.<br /><br />The tea has a nice delicate flavor with a hint of jasmine in it.  I'm not sure if i detect rosebuds in the flavor (hard to say....what do rosebuds taste like???)  But they are definitely in there.  While the jasmine is there it isn't real real strong.  So if you prefer your jasmine tea to pack a punch this may not be for you.  I really like a nice cup of strong jasmine green tea. Of course i realize that this is a white & green tea mix.  Since white tea is much lighter & more delicate than green tea too much jasmine would probably overpower it.  Strong jasmine flavor or not, this tea is yummy. All i know is that i enjoyed everything about brewing & drinking this tea.  It is well packaged, has a pleasing aroma & flavor, and the leaves seem to be rolled with meticulous care.  It's a great quality tea & a nice addition to my collection.  I'm glad i bought it.

I eat it five to six mornings a week. I substitute once or twice a week with organic eggs, cheese & vege's. When I eat this cereal I mix it with organic frozen blueberries & a banana. What a way to start the day. My blood work at my last yearly physical was excellent, and my doctor let me know. I'm 52 years old and abused my body for 25 years with drugs and alcohol.
