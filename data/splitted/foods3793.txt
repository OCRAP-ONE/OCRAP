review/text: I was blessed by my mother-in-law with a delicious bag of these Wasabi Wow! trail mix. Eating the dried wasabi peas is quite mild because the mix contains sweet raisins and cranberries. Each bag weighs nearly a pound and contains 13 servings. Each serving is 130 calories (70 fat calories), but I could easily go through a whole bag in one sitting. If I wasn't such a cheapskate, I would be buying this stuff all the time. Don't be a cheapskate.

review/summary: Holy cow these are goooood!
review/text: This is the best snack of its kind that I've ever tried (and I've tried many!)  The wasabi has a little kick to it, but not enough to slow down the copious amounts of the snack that I find myself devouring in one sitting.  And the sweet cranberries are a great little treat in every bite.  There is a little bit of peanut dust and paper shells at the bottom of each bag which can be messy, but if you like a snack with a little 'bite' to it, this is your treat.

review/text: I stumbled on Three Dog Bakery's Vanilla Woofers at Target about five years ago, and have been buying them ever since.  For some reason, Target stopped carrying them, but I still order online because my Dog LOVES these things...Especially the vanilla and peanut woofers.  I have yet to try them all, but they are always fresh and last quite a while.  I was not disappointed and you will not be either. I also love that they support the Gracie Foundation!

review/summary: The SMELL and TEXTURE drive my dogs CRAZY!
review/text: These cookies look just like vanilla wafers only thicker and softer.  The Vanilla flavor smells just like vanilla and drives my dogs crazy.  As soon as I open up the jar, they come running.  And they are much softer than any dog biscuits I have ever fed them.  They are easy for any dog to eat, especially older dogs, little dogs or my Shar-Peis that have a lot of extra skin, especially around the mouth.  It is their favorite breakfast treat, afternoon snack or after dinner desert.<br /><br />Made from all human quality ingredients, just like I would have baked if I had the time, I know I am giving my dog a healthy and satisfying treat.  Just like all Three Dog Bakery products!

review/text: Our Aussie thinks it's cool that "Gracie" is one of the bakery founders because her name is Gracie too. I used to work for a company based out of Lenexa, KS and found these cookies in a local grocery store.  Every time we would go to Kansas (from Texas), we'd stand at the grocery store check out with about $100.00 worth of cookies.  The locals thought we were nuts.  We don't get to Kansas anymore but love it that Gracie's cookies are available through Amazon.  They're excellent cookies and we don't give her any other kind.  Now we have our son's baby great dane hooked on them too!  You will not be disappointed with Three Dog Bakery Cookies. Our Gracie also loves the sandwich kind.

All of the cookies are usually whole and not broken.  I like to give my kids their cookies outside so if they don't get to them fast enough the little sparrows will surely beat them to it. I must say that they look good enough for humans to eat.

Not only are these cookies free of all of the refined sugar and high fructose corn syrup, chemicals, artificial this-and-that, by-products and animal parts found in the majority of supermarket and chain pet store dog treats - they are over the top YUMMY!<br /><br />My only objection is the use of canola oil - I would MUCH rather see them use coconut oil!<br /><br />I taste everything I feed my dog (weird, but true) and these vanilla cookies actually taste like people snacks!

review/summary: Perfect Honeybush Herbal Tea
review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Bushmen's Brew Honeybush Herbal Teasan is a premium Numi herbal tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified honeybush. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "For hundreds of years, the Khoi and San peoples of Southern Africa hand gathered this plant from the mountainous regions of their homelands. This honey scented flowering bush creates an enticing rich brew with sweet honey over-tones. Rich in anti-oxidants, phytoestrogens and essential minerals, this new, organic African herbal is both delicious and healthy. One sip and the secret touches your soul." It is naturally sweet (but not too sweet) and delicious.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love herbal teas or honeybush in particular, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br />*****

review/text: Like another reviewer, I do not taste sweet honey overtones either; however, this is a great tea. While yes, it can be a bit bitter if it is overbrewed and made too strong (like caffeinated tea), done normally it is very satisfying. If you like black tea or love caffeine, but, like me, cannot (or do not) use it,  this tea is a gift. It is the closest thing to caffeinated tea, by far, that I have been able to find in an herbal tea (and far healthier).

review/text: First of all, this is a 10% Kona BLEND, it is not 100% Kona coffee!<br />Second, it is a 7 oz. bag, which is less than 1/2 pound.<br />For the price, you would do better to go direct to the Lion Coffee site. So much for rarity.<br />As for flavor, it's not much better than cafeteria coffee. I found it lacking in aroma and flavor.<br /><br />Granted, the lion is a great looking brand, and it makes a cool souvenir to bring back to friends but, like the Macadamia nuts, it tastes much better in the islands. Save your money and buy a keychain instead. If you're looking for a nice Kona blend, keep looking.

review/text: I have always loved the little rolls of Smarties ever since I was little and I'd get them from trick or treating at Halloween.  Most of my friends and I would have a bit of Halloween candy in our lunch boxes and we'd swap and trade and we always used the little bitty ones as 'medicine' to make us magical.<br /><br />I know, silliness, but when you're small you do goofy things like that.<br /><br />When I saw that these mega Smarties were available I had to try them because I had never seen anything like them before and if they were anything like their mini counterparts they would be yummy.<br /><br />Well, we've already reordered these and everyone loves them!  They have a wonderful flavor just like the little ones and seem just a trifle softer under your teeth when you crunch down on them.<br /><br />We have a lively debate going on in the family between chewing them up immediately and letting them dissolve slowly.<br /><br />I'm too impatient to let them dissolve completely, and as quickly as everyone devours these treats, I have a feeling that another reorder of these is not too far off in the future!

review/text: The cookies came packaged wonderfully.  Fast shipping, no problems at all with the company, but the cookies themselves didn't taste very good.  They were honey flavored, and that's fine, but they were so strongly honey flavored that nobody at the SuperBowl party liked them.  I thought it would have been a little more subtle.  I didn't eat more than a few bites.  Fancy presentation, but wish they had tasted better.

review/summary: used as an ingrediant
review/text: I purchased this item to make a hybrid burger. When you use ground sirloin there isn't enough fat in the meat. The butter gives that juiciness so you don't have dried out burgers. The truffles added a flavour unlike anything I had before. I have eaten truffles used in different ways, but in the meat they took on a whole new taste sensation. Really good product. I will buy it again.

review/summary: Hot tea at work will not be the same!!
review/text: After many years I finally admitted to myself that I can't stand the taste of coffee, no matter how much I cream & sugar it up it still has a bitter taste I can't stand. So now I've been drinking hot tea for the past few years, trying many kinds, and liking it a lot especially with just a bit of honey.  I've been to many, many convenience stores and coffee shops and found that the best portable single serve are the 0.32 ounce Heinz Honey packets.  Here in my area, the local WaWa stores carry this brand and I've been sneaking a few extra packs here and there to help me out when I would get tea from places other than WaWa.  There is another honey packet out there (can't remember who makes it, but its a white packet with a printed yellow area where the word honey is in black) that my local 7-11s carries and I've found that to be kind of funny tasting.<br /><br />Anyway, my situation at work has changed lately so I can't make it to the WaWas as much as I need to, so I needed to find a better supply of honey for my daily dose of the hot tea.  Finally got the bright idea to check Amazon and VOILA!, they carry the exact type of packets I prefer!!!  So I ordered a box to keep in my desk so I'll always have a supply when I need it.  I've had them a few weeks now and I'm happy to report that they are the exact packets that WaWa carries and taste exactly the same as well.  Now I happily enjoy my tea at work every day!!!

review/summary: Fun, Delightful Holiday Tea
review/text: ****<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings' Gingerbread Spice is a delightful holiday tea. It contains cinnamon, ginger root, roasted chicory root, roasted barley malt, natural flavors, and luo han guo. Luo han guo is a sweet fruit which is used as a natural sweetener and medicinal herb in China, believed to increase longevity. Gingerbread Spice does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea. Because of the roasted chicory root and roasted barley malt, it has a hearty taste. Sort of like gingerbread cookies---really! It is not as sweet as a cookie would be, but it's a delightful taste!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use "natural flavors" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called "effervescent decaffeination" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.<br /><br />On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, "A wonderful way to thaw a frosty chill is to step into a cozy kitchen warmed by the spicy aroma of fresh-baked gingerbread! That cherished old-fashioned recipe flavors our Gingerbread Spice Herb Tea -- a nostalgic medley of ginger, cinnamon and other good-for-you ingredients. Because it's naturally caffeine free, you can indulge in this festive tea anytime. And since merry moments are made to share, pour a steaming cup for friends and family, and toast to the season. Cheers!" This tea is only barely sweet and spicy but quite full bodied. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.<br /><br />I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday. It's perfect for a cold or wet winter day.<br /><br />****

review/summary: Best Mints EVER!
review/text: I'm a Philly girl and I've been eating Fralinger's goods since before I can remember.  Each year I head to AC (Atlantic City) to buy enough mints to last for a few months (if I hide them).  They are soft (not malleable or tacky) and creamy.  They're minty and delicious.  They're also addictive.  If you're in extreme humidity, you may have to keep them in the fridge.<br /><br />I'm not sure what 2 of my fellow reviewers were expecting.  If you want taffy, buy taffy.  If you want creamy, you buy creamy.  It's not that difficult.  Of course they crumble, with little pressure, what would you expect from a soft creamy mint?  If I bought something touting itself as creamy and it was hard, I'd send it back. Ever had hard cream? No. If you want a hard mint or even a butter mint, then you should buy something else.  If you want a soft creamy mint that actually melts in your mouth but doesn't linger there, you should love these.

review/text: These mints are not 'Creamy' as touted in the description, but somewhat chalky in texture. I expected something more like taffy, but these mints are almost exactly like the inside portion of a York Peppermint Pattie, just the white portion only, without the creamy chocolate coating to tone down the powder sugar mint center. I gave it 3 stars because the mint flavor is very good. I am concerned that over time, the mints will get even more dry and chalky, as this is quite a large bag, but as for now, they are edible.

review/summary: Beware: This is NOT traditional 5 spice power.
review/text: I am a big fan of Marshall Creek spices and love the fact that you can buy larger quantities of the ones you use regularly.  However, be forewarned about this Oriental Five Spice Powder.  Under normal circumstances, Five Spice Powder contains anise or fennel, cinnamon, cloves, pepper and ginger.  If you will read the ingredients closely, which I should have done, it contains cumin,coriander and orange peel along with ginger and cinnamon.  This produces a sort of Middle Eastern or Mexican flavor and does not give you a typical or even close Five Spice flavor.  The spice is fresh and I still trust Marshall Creek for spice purchases, but will not order the Oriental Five Spice from them again.  Check out the others for a truer flavor. You will be glad you did.

review/text: Glad that Amazon offers these now. Truly this is the best salt I've ever tasted anywhere. The taste is spot on and the texture is amazing, crispy, delicate and flakey! A pack of 6 is a lot, but you'll definitely be using it everytime you cook and need that extra dash of salt.<br /><br />Don't know what happened to my package but it got a little dinged up somewhere along the line. The seal was busted on one unit, but nothing major. I was considering returning it, but just said eh, forget about it. As for the 4.5 stars, that's only due to the dispensing end of these units, which can occasionally get jammed up with salt. I usually fix this with a quick slam of the shaker on the counter and it clear the holes. An alternate option is just to remove the plastic dispenser at the top completely which can be done fairly easily.

review/summary: Amazing Milk Chocolate Bars!
review/text: I ordered these milk chocolate bars because the chocolate I've had in Europe is so much better than what you find in chocolate bars in the US - EVEN if you buy the US Cadbury brand.  These bars are amazing!  They are exactly the same bars you get in Europe.  I don't think I will ever be able to eat any other type of chocolate candy bar again.  Even though they are just chocolate, they don't need anything else (like caramel, peanut butter, nuts, etc.) added to them.  They are rich and creamy and very delicious!  They were sent internationally, but they arrived within one week of me ordering them.<br /><br />Be careful ordering them during hot times of the year, or at least make sure they won't have to sit in the mailbox very long.  I made this mistake and by the time I checked my mail, the bars were all melted.  I put them in the refrigerator and they were fine the next day, just a little mis-shaped. :)<br /><br />I've already ordered another shipment of them for when I run out.

review/summary: Artificial flavor? Why?!?
review/text: Besides artificial vanilla Cadbury chocolate often contains artificial flavor, which, to me leaves an odd aftertaste.<br /><br />Artificial flavor is "flavor" created in a lab and tested on lab rats to keep them eating. Why does it need to be added to chocolate!?!?<br /><br />Poor disingenuous product as far as I see it

review/summary: Freshly Harvested!
review/text: At the wonderful Barry Farms facilities, the moment an order comes in they quickly go out and plant whatever grain it is. Then after some time has passed they are able to harvest that grain and take into the factory to be ground into flour where it is finally packaged up and shipped to the customer. And just for that extra spark of good customer service they don't even provide a tracking number, so each customer is pleasantly surprised when their items randomly show up one day.<br /><br />...seriously, the product is fine but expect to wait about three weeks or more for delivery.

review/summary: Easy crock pot meal for cool day
review/text: Ordered this on a whim, and it is quite tasty. I put it in the crock pot and let it simmer through the day and although the noodles were extremely soft, it was still a tasty soup. I added a little Italian sausage for added flavor and served with fresh french bread and my guests were thrilled. I'd give it five stars if there were a way to pull the noodles from the pack and add them shortly before serving, but you can also make it on the stove and the noodles wouldn't be soaking all day and therefore less soggy.

review/summary: Do not follow crock pot instructions!
review/text: This product is a nice, quick, and easy way to make soup that's not out of a can and very reasonable for the price.  The tag attached to the bag has crock pot instructions which I followed. By about hour 4 on low, the soup was done (hours earlier than the instructions stated) and the noodles were complete mush.  We ate it anyway and it was very tasty but the noodle problem could have been avoided.<br /><br />My suggestion is to separate out the noodles from the bag and add them to the crock pot about 30 minutes before you would like to eat.  I also added some frozen Italian meatballs to the soup which really made it a meal.<br /><br />Overall, the taste was good and the price was right.

review/summary: Convenient and a great mixer!!!
review/text: This pineapple Zuko is instant--it dissolves easily and is very convenient to use when making a soft drink for the family or to use as a mixer. Mixed with coconut rum, it's divine! LOL It is also good mixed with orange juice and coconut water...it's a little bit artificial tasting, but not overly in my opinion...it's like drinking the light syrup out of a can of pineapple. It's an awesome buy in my humble opinion because each "bag" makes a LOT of Zuko. I keep this in the pantry and sometimes mix it with the Jama flavor (hisbiscus flower flavor, and excellent!) and serve it over crushed ice. It's awesome. It's also shelf-stable. If you keep some in your pantry, you'll always have something good to drink (or mix with your spirits.)

My only hang up is the pineapple flavor has an artificial after taste that made me look at the ingredients for an artificial sweetener - ASPARTAME was found.<br /><br />The warning for  phenylalanine is one the package BUT not in the description here. Zuko's tropical flavors are appealing though and just an OK value buy at 15 bucks.

review/text: The pickles arrived packaged with fine care.  I was a bit disappointed in the taste upon trying them for the first time. They are VERY mild and are somewhat sweet tasting. I guess I'm used to a pickle with more pazazz and bite. It was a novel idea to purchase real german pickles thru Amazon.  However, for the price of these pickles, I'll forgo getting them next time I need pickles and go to my local grocer for Clousen or Vlasic.

review/text: My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names.

My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.
