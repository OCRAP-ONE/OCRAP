review/summary: Moisturizer
review/text: I don't cook or heat up oils of any kind, but I do have dark skin that can look pretty dry at times, no matter what kind of cleansing I use. Instead of putting the dozens of chemicals on my skin that come in even the healthiest of lotions, Nutiva's Coconut Oil does the trick w/ a single, organic content. It smells good, but the scent is so light, that it's disappears shortly. If you're looking for a long-lasting, healthy, simply 'made' product to give you a healthy glow, give her a try. I loves it!

review/summary: great quality oil
review/text: This is a very good quality coconut oil, with a clean raw coconut taste and smell (not toasty or cooked), light silky texture, and excellent shelf stability.<br /><br />I use it in smoothies, for some cooking and baking (mostly curries and sweet baking, it's fantastic in granola and brownies) and for body care. It's a very good moisturizer and you need very little, just a few drops smoothed over the entire body; and I use it for deep cleaning my facial pores once a week (google Oil Cleaning Method). When my hair was long, I used it for pre-wash conditioning and a few drops on the ends as a leave in conditioner. I use it to massage my stretched ear piercings and to rub into scrapes and cuts I think may leave scars.<br /><br />None of these things are uses exclusive to coconut oil, I could use many different kinds of oils and fats, or different brands, but why? the bottom line is just that it's a good price for a high quality oil that fits the bill all around.

review/summary: Like it a lot
review/text: This is my first time using coconut oil, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I must say that I like it very much.  I use it primarily for frying eggs and other pan fried things, and I love that the flavor is very mild and not overwhelming in coconut.  I was happy to learn that it's a healthy substitute for butter, so I look forward to using it in other ways.

review/summary: best oil for cooking
review/text: Coconut oil has become the only oil I will use for cooking, especially organic ones. It gives food just the right amount of aroma and flavor. Nutiva is a major brand you can trust, though I've tried & used other brands from local healthfood stores as well. It annoys me that some books & health professionals still knock coconut oil as a fat to avoid on the premise that it's a naturally saturated fat, when in fact it's a tremendously healthy product. SOme say that it helps your body converts fat into energy better as well.

review/text: A few months ago, I started using coconut oil. I have tried 3-4 different brands, but keep coming back to Nutiva. It is the best by far! Their coconut oil has a light, slight coconut taste, which is wonderful. It is delicious in cooking and treats as well.

review/summary: Excellent Quality Coconut Oil
review/text: I've tried lots of coconut oil over the years, but this brand is by far the best, so I keep coming back to it. The color is beautiful and white, and the smell is fresh and doesn't have the "off" scent some of the oils have. I love that it is organic and unrefined. I use it in cooking sometimes, but mostly, I use it as an after-shower body and face moisturizer. I rub it all over my body and then after about 20 minutes, use a dry washcloth to very lightly blot the excess off, so when I dress, I don't get oil on my clothes. This regimen makes a world of difference for my "chicken skin"--you know, those tiny red, raised dots a person gets on their skin when it's dry--keratosis pilaris, I believe it's called.  As a woman, I do NOT find them attractive at all. So, I highly recommend this oil for cooking, and for a wonderful moisturizer. Makes your skin feel young again--very smooth and not sticky at all. I find the price is great on Amazon too--what a bonus!

review/summary: Nutiva Coconut Oil is terrific--be careful ordering it from Amazon!
review/text: I knew my coconut oil had arrived because of the dark, oily spot spreading over the outside of the box. The two containers were bubble wrapped with no other packaging around them so they were rolling around in the box while in transit. I called Nutiva who said that Amazon was the seller and packager of their product. (The guy also said that Amazon has some of the worst packaging of items like this in the industry.) The Nutiva guy said that I got a really good price on their product, but with results like I had, I guess I didn't get a good deal as only one container was sealed and safe to use. I am a huge Amazon fan for many things, but unless I get assurances for packaging improvements, I will hesitate before ordering perishable items in the future.

review/summary: Great product at a great price
review/text: I was very happy with this product.  Coconut oil in mac and cheese gives it a little hint of tropical taste without overwhelming the dish. I ordered this in February (the cooler part of the year) and it arrived in perfect condition.  Some others have written that they were not happy because it apparently leaked all over the place.  This is probably due to the product becoming liquid at 76 degrees.  My oil was solid when it arrived and did not have this problem.  I hope Amazon can resolve this issue quickly.

I am greatful to Allah for this product. For my hair, it adds shine and strengthens my hair and conditions my scalp very very very well. Plus, it softens my skin. For cooking, it is way better than butter. I really like the taste of this product, fresh and pure. For me, it has replaced my hair conditioners and it has replaced butter!! Really like the health benefits of using Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. The product arrived on time wothout being busted up or dented. Product came with an under cap seal to lock in freshness. I am very very HAPPY with the seller. Excellent price (free shipping); and excellent product. I will buy more of this product in the future. Thank you again Amazon! :)

review/text: I've been using this as a moisturizer on my dry, itchy winter skin and have been very pleased.  It seems greasy at first, but within minutes it is absorbed and doesn't get on your clothes.  We had a leather chair that was getting too dry and was cracking so I thought, why not give it a try?  It worked great.  No more expensive leather conditioner for us.  I will be buying more.

I actually started using coconut oil for my skin as I have suffered with very dry skin my entire life. It absorbs quickly and since I love the smell of coconut, it was perfect for me. But don't worry, if you don't love the smell of coconut, it fades pretty quickly. I then started using it as an oil treatment for my hair with fantastic results. Finally, I'm starting to incorporate into my cooking. Needless to say, I am very pleased and will just put this on auto ship!

It was very very light and untraceable in some foods, yet added a very nice fragance and taste to one of my stir fry recipes. I hope the long term health benefits are as claimed. I am already pleased with the direct effect it has had on my skin and hair. I can already recommend it. Make sure you don't buy anything that's been processed, filtered or has additives. This is the real deal.<br />So far, so good.

There are just so many health benefits to using coconut oil, so its the no brainer oil of choice for cooking. Before finding Nutiva brand, which is a great value, I used several others brands - but Nutiva tasted the best and was the best value. Nutiva has an incredible flavor, and yes, it does taste like coconut.. which is a good sign that the oil is a good quality and not de-odorized with chemicals. If you're on the face, just order this and you'll never look back.

review/text: This is our favorite coconut oil. Excellent taste, and when you purchase with the "subscribe and save" option it is a very good value. Our local grocery stores charge nearly twice as much for one bottle. The health benefits of the medium-chain fatty acids (saturated fats) in coconut oil is what convinced us to try this oil. To learn more about the health benefits I recommend the Weston A Price Foundation's web site or Mark's Daily Apple web site as  good resources.

I've had it for a couple of months and am not even half done with the jar. As a hair conditioner it didn't work for me because it was too hard to rinse out, my hair was weighed down for days. But, I put this on my now baby soft skin religiously. I will buy another tub to try cooking with.

review/text: I had never tried this brand before, but I was looking for coconut oil, preferably organic, that was less expensive than I could find at local organic markets. Spectrum was too expensive, and I had tried Sunflower/Newflower's store brand but was not happy with it. This Nutiva is excellent, good aroma, good flavor, no off-tastes, and a very reasonable price. I will definitely be buying it again.

review/summary: Love this coconut oil
review/text: I, too, improved my good cholesterol level with use of this product.  I use this in all my baking.  To substitute for butter, use about 3/4 of the amount of butter since there is no water in coconut oil, like butter has.  No noticable taste to me, but much better for your health.  I've also used it as a moisturizer on my face and hands.

review/text: Oh my gosh....I've tried coconut oil before, but none of them have tasted as good as Nutiva. This is wonderful right out of the jar. I love using it instead of butter on toast (melts instantly) or spreading it on crisp bread. I will definitely be ordering this again and again. I am ordering a cookbook using coconut oil-can't wait to see what I can do with this.

review/text: It's just coconut oil.  I think I got two for $10 or $12, free shipping if you sign up for prime, you can always cancel later.  I use this to make vegan butter, mix about 1/2 (or slightly less) with olive oil, put it in your fridge.  You can also add lecithin if you have it available.  I only use it in the winter months to keep warm, it's too rich for warmer weather.

review/text: I cook with it.  It tolerates heat better than olive oil. For example: Heat two tablespoons of coconut oil in the skillet then add grated potatoes for hash browns.  Cook covered till brown on the bottom side.  Just serve them with the browned side up.<br /><br />I use coconut for oil pulling. Swishing the oil around in my mouth for about 20 minutes.  This helps rid the body of toxins.  I use several times a week.<br /><br />This oil is good for any skin problem.  I put it on my cuts, burns, scars, etc.  It heals the skin from the inside out.<br /><br />I just love getting it automatically via mail from Amazon.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Sarah Jane

review/text: Well I want to first say that I am not using this for cooking purposes so I don't know if it is awesome for that or not.  But I do use it in my hair for hot oil treatments and sometimes I put just a tiny bit on when my hair is frizzy to soothe it.  I have mid-back length, curly, Caucasian hair and this stuff really hydrates and softens my hair. It doesn't make your hair look greasy or flat if you use only a little bit when you have some wild frizz.  For hot oil treatments I get my hair wet then use enough to saturate my hair.  After that I walk around the house with a towel on my head (so if I lean on the furniture it doesn't make it oily) until bedtime when I shower and wash it out.  So awesome!

review/text: Great tasting coconut oil that we use in curries or most everything really! Very healthy alternative to margarine, or other 'fake' spreads. I have never used it as a replacement for butter or anything but I hear it tastes very good. The only downfall I can think of is that it comes in a plastic container, but I am sure the price would be more if the company decided to switch to glass. All in all, its a great price for a good product. Will probably only purchase if very cheap and on special on Amazon, otherwise there are several other brands that come to mind that I will use more regularly due to glass jar like Tropical Traditions which tastes amazing and is my favourite coconut oil! :) But for the price I got it for I was happy.

review/text: I bought this coconut oil to use in making low-carb homemade chocolate, and it works great!  It has a nice coconut flavor that goes well with the cocoa I add.  The only surprise was that after opening one of the jars and leaving it in my pantry (it says no refrigeration is needed), the oil turned to an opaque jelly.  I still use it, and it seems to work great still, but it must be reacting with the air around it.  My other sealed jar is still 'oily'-looking and clear.  I think this would go great with stir-fries and sauteed tofu as well.

review/text: this oil is great. smells just like coconut -- you would expect to taste sweet coconut from smelling this, but it doesnt taste sweet at all, its just the essence of coconut flavor. great for shrimp and anything if youre not afraid of some coconut. i like that it hardens at moderately low temperatures. good way to make fake chocolate, with some cocoa powder n sugar. hardens in about 20 min in the freezer. tastes and feels very much like chocolate this way. great oil, high fat content, which is cool if you need to consume fat.<br /><br />that said, the bottle they put this stuff in is horrible. both bottles i got felt all oily after first use -- and i was very careful taking it out. and they remained oily after i wiped them down thoroughly with paper towels. all my other bottled stuff stays clean n dry. i tested the bottle, shook it while completely sealed over my sink, and the stuff definitely comes out despite the twist on cap. thats the only thing i didnt like.

review/summary: I love this stuff
review/text: My daughter told me about all the benefits of coconut oil and I decided to order this one from Amazon and try it out. So far, I have used it for (1) extremely dry skin on my face and around my hairline. I could see an improvement after just one day and it's continued until I no longer have patches of dry skin and the skin on my face is glowing. (2) I severely burnt my tongue tasting some soup and the next day it was so painful I could not eat. I coated my tongue several tiimes that day in the coconut oil and it was completely well on the third day. (3) On my grand daughters diaper rash and on her dry flaky feet. Her feet were peeling they were so dry and we cleared it up in a week with the coconut oil. (4) I coated my dry hair in the coconut oil and left it on all day and then shampooed it out before going to bed. My hair was soft and shiny the next day to the point that several people asked me what I had done to my hair. Now I regularly soak my hair in the oil and my hair is beautiful. (5) I made a face scrub with the oil and sugar and it works wonderfully for getting the dead skin off my face and feet at a fraction of the cost of the expensive scrubs and works better and smells good too.<br /><br />The oil does not stay on your skin, it is absorbed quickly and does not stain your clothes or bedding. I ordered two tubs with Subscribe and Save and the price was a real bargain except my sister begged me out of one of my tubs, so now I have to re-order quickly. I don't want to be out. I keep a small jar of the oil on my desk and use it several times a day on my hands and elbows. Those rough ugly elbows will dissappear in a week and you will have smooth white elbows if you just rub some oil in once a day.<br /><br />I have not used the oil for any kind of cooking because that is not the reason I wanted it, but I have read that it is great for use as a cooking oil. I know my grand daughter loves to stick her finger in the jar and lick the oil off. She loves it and I know it will not hurt her.<br /><br />Would I order this again? Yes and yes. I would and have it on permanent order with Subscribe and Save. I don't want to ever be without it again.

Right now I am eating a piece of natural whole wheat toast with this coconut oil slathered on drizzled with honey; what a sweet treat. This is my first time ordering coconut oil from this seller and it won't be my last. This coconut oil has a light coconut taste and smell, I for one felt I was taken a tropical ride to the islands. I also tried the coconut oil on my face, the very moment my package arrived and boy was I in for a shock! My face instantly felt smooth, moisturized, calm, and I believe it gave me an instant glow,plus I tried it in my hair it was instantly hydrated and shiny! Next, I am going to try this in my homemade banana nut bread, plus count less other foods. This coconut oil is indeed a winner; a winner for my body, skin, and anyone who dares to try it. I dare anyone to try this product and you will be happy you did. Much love and blessings to all who make this product!

review/summary: Nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil
review/text: I am crazy for this product!!!!!  I know.  It sounds funny that a person would use this as you would vegetable or olive oil, but it is amazing.  I put a scoop in the pan and thought I would start slowly and try frying up some thin potato wedges to start and see what this oil was all about. It heated up quickly and the aroma was the beautiful smell of tropical coconuts.  My first concern after that was that the food would have a hint of coconut taste, but that was not the case at all.  The oil fried the potatoes perfectly.  I barely patted the potatoes. Didn't need to.  They were not greasy at all!!!!!!Nutiva organic coconut oil is my new favorite kitchen must have.  I am so impressed.

review/summary: Excellent Product, The Best Oil You Can Use
review/text: The health benefits of coconut oil have been reported widely by now. I now live in a place where there are more coconuts than people, but I brought the Nutiva Coconut Oil down here with me, because it's almost 10 dollars for half a liter here.<br /><br />I have found this brand to be the purest coconut oil on the market, at least among those I've been able to find and try. The price is fabulous, can't beat it.<br /><br />The oil will solidify at lower temperatures, it did that often when I lived in Texas. You just scoop it out and use it the same way. Once it sits in a room temp over 70 degrees, it tends to stay clear and in its liquid form. It hasn't solidified at all since I've been in subtropical Mexico. It's not white when in liquid form.<br /><br />I avoid all artificial fats and use coconut and extra virgen olive oil for most cooking and baking now. I have no problem with natural fats as I follow a mostly low-carb diet nowadays, but I still prefer non-animal sources for most fat. The fact that coconut oil has been shown to aid with lowering blood sugar is a big plus for me. I know a lot of people who stir it into their coffee or find other ways to ingest at least 3TB per day, I probably don't get that much, though I know I should.<br /><br />Be aware that this oil doesn't taste much like coconut, important for me because I LOATHE the flavor of coconut. It does smell like it, but I haven't found that it adds any taste at all to what I cook.<br /><br />A caveat: coconut oil has a smoke point that's about as low as olive oil, I believe it's 350 to 375 degrees, so this is not an oil that's suitable for deep-frying. You'll have to stick with peanut oil for that.<br /><br />I've had the second jar open for about 5 months now on the counter and have not noticed any degradation of the smell or cooking results for this oil. It should last quite well when stored unopened, as well.<br /><br />You can also use this as a moisturizer, I've tried it and it does leave my skin VERY soft.

review/summary: Best Brand for Coconut Oil
review/text: Update: February 2012 I told my friend about how to use this product for cooking and how it was helpful for weight loss result - May 2012 she has lost 2 dress sizes and she has more energy.  Before this she was not able to successfully lose the weight.<br /><br />Nutiva Organic extra virgin (actually in the field of coconut oil there is no distinction between virgin and extra virgin like the grades of olive oil)is the best coconut oil brand for quality due to its true essence of coconut flavor. This is one of the very few companies that keep with the tradition of producing it cold pressed by hand which allows the oil to maintain all of its nutritional benefits.  It's not an over powering oil.  It has a clean, tropical, nutty scent and delicate flavor.<br /><br />It is good for baking, sauteeing, frying, for smoothies, spreadable on bread/pancakes, great for creating frosting, and making dipping chocolate or added with chocolate for fondue, taken orally for weight loss, lip gloss, hot oil treatment for hair, hair dress, massage oil, skin moisturizer, nail/cuticle conditioner, make up remover,  a combatant for vaginal/infections due to coconut's antiviral properties, used to moisten the inner nasal membrane to protect against dryness, and great (especially when combined with olive oil)for making bars of soap.<br /><br />Coconut oil is extremely beneficial for your health because it has both short and medium chain fatty acids which promotes weight loss, increased metabolism, and healthy skin.  Many experience the lowering of bad cholestorol while consuming.<br /><br />It is the secret ingredient I use for sauteeing broccoli and cauliflower with a hint of ginger and nutmeg.  I use it for salmon, lamb, chicken, eggs (yum), and it brings out such a dimension to food.  I prefer it to butter and olive oil in cooking when I have it on hand. My cakes, brownies, quick breads turn out moister with coconut oil and rise better. Because it liquifies beyond 72degress F it may be necessary to combine coconut oil with a heavier fat (such as butter) when baking cookies.<br /><br />Due to it's properties, coconut oil absorbs nicely into one's hair to soften it and combat frizziness.  After trying other brands of coconut oil, none has compared to the remarkable pureness and flavor of Nutiva.

I use it in cooking...fave is to melt some on a piece of foil, toss sweet potato fries or tots in it and bake then sprinkle on some coarse salt. Yum! I have also used this on my toddler's tush when it gets pink from food related sensitivities... it'll clear up overnight. I'll use it on my skin, my hair, anywhere! Taste great, smells great. A+

review/summary: Used For Hair and Skin
review/text: This is my 3rd shipment that I received from Amazon and I have grown to love the product.  I use in on my skin and found that even when applied it does not leave your skin with a greasy residue.  It evaporates quickly but still keep your skin moisturized all day if applied right after showering. I purchased this product to moisturize the back area since I drive long distance every day.  It did the job by healing that troubled spot and with continuous use, the problem area is no longer there.  I also use this product in my natural thinning hair and I have found that my hair is becoming much thicker. I will continue to use this product as long as the price of the product does not increase dramatically.  I have also given away some of the product to family members who are requesting more from me.  To their surprise, I have told them that Amazon offers the best deal and they should purchase the product on this own.  Love it and will keep using it throughout the changing of the seasons.

review/summary: Clear skin after 30 years of acne
review/text: Don't overlook this product's antibacterial properties. I cringe when I think of the years I used antiseptic, drying cleansers on my skin for acne, when coconut oil cleared my skin and has kept it clear and healthy for almost a year. It is good for almost any kind of skin irritation, even for pets. It cleared up my cat's skin irritation from flea allergies, and we got to skip a trip to the vet.<br />Great to cook with too, or add to tea or oatmeal.

review/summary: Glad I made the switch
review/text: I've gone through three little tubs of EVCO, now, and it's great.  I use it in place of vegetable oils and butter (or part of the butter) in baking, and the results have been very tasty.<br /><br />The coconut flavor is light but present, so that's something to keep in mind.  Some people swear you can't taste the coconut, others say it overwhelming the base recipe.  So far, in cakes, breads, and a few candies, the flavor has been complimentary.  I like it.<br /><br />As well, it is a tad sweet, so I adjust the sweetener in my recipes down a bit more than usual.<br /><br />I live in a climate that is warm for most of the year, so the EVCO stays liquid. Though it is shelf-stable, it may be worth considering how you would need to store it, based on your climate, before you buy.  This particular container size is very manageable to handle on the shelf, and it doesn't take up a lot of room in the fridge.<br /><br />I'm really happy with this product.  I plan to have it as a pantry staple for all of my baking.

review/text: Nutiva does not make a bad product. I eat a strict Paleo eating regimen coconut oil is all I use for baking; well sometimes Ghee. I brush coconut oil on chicken breasts, sprinkle some hemp seeds on top, a bit of black pepper and then bake. The coconut flavor is not overwhelming it just sneaks in there. I also use coconut oil when I saute my spinach; also adding black pepper and hemp seeds. I am finding this the new oil in my life I really enjoy it.

review/text: I ordered this oil because I was looking for an organic cold pressed coconut oil and this fit the bill and had a lot of good reviews. I use this oil for my hair and skin and plan to try it for cooking which is why I bought a two pack - one for my bedroom and the other for the kitchen. I use this oil everyday and my first jar has lasted for months. I have used it instead of lotion and as a deep conditioner and a daily conditioner. My hair loves it and it creates nice shine and my skin loves it especially in winter time when its dry. I have already ordered a big jar in preparation for me running out since it is a staple for me now. I love that I am not rubbing chemicals on my body but a natural substance.

review/text: I am in love with this product. It is awesome. I use it as a hair treatment and a moisturizer. Sometimes I'll put it in my hair after shampooing it, wrap it in plastic and leave it in overnite. Other times I just run a handful thru my hair at the end of the day and leave it on for a few hours and then wash it out. Either way, I end up with the softest and shiniest hair.<br /><br />I also use it to moisturize my skin. Rub it on at night and wake up to soft, non greasy skin. Rub it on your legs in the shower and use it a shaving lotion. You wont believe how well it works.<br /><br />Cant recommend this product enough. Its non greasy, works its way into your skin overnite and leaves no residue, and has just a slight, but pleasant smell.

I like to mix a serving of pistachios, a serving of almonds, and a tbsp of oil together for a late evening treat. My wife makes a great low carb snack by heating equal parts oil, semisweet chocolate chips, and chopped nuts; puts them in cupcake molds and freezes. Delicious but remember coconut oil melts easily (I just pop the whole thing in my mouth).

review/text: Since I started cooking with coconut oil 2 months ago this is the first brand/variety I've purchased that actually smelled and tasted like coconuts.  The smell is amazing. Nutty and warm.  It does infuse the food you're cooking with it with a slight flavor of coconut too.  I am so glad we bought the Pack of 2 because it it is a winner. Other brands we've bought before are Jarrow (also avialable on Amazon) and Spectrum (from the grocerty store). Jarrow is a good quality brand but it did not have the same smell or flavor as the Nutiva. Spectrum, I learned after I bought it, is not great quality.<br /><br />I'm planning to use it to make my own "Magic Shell" chocolate topping for our annual homemade Labor Day ice cream.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this product for use in the kitchen or for the body!

review/text: I just love this product!!! I really like the fact that it comes in a 2 pack, I use one for cooking and have labeled the other "NFC", not for cooking. This is my new beauty product. I use it nightly as my moisturizer and have noticed that my skin is softer and my lines are less noticable. Even though it's oil, it doesn't make me break out (I tend to have oily skin) and I have rosacea, so I like the fact that it's natural. I've also used it as a deep conditioner on my hair with positive results. The smell is intoxicating, but not overwhelming, reminds me of Hawaii. It's great on any body part that is dry, feet especially. I even got my Mom on board, who has overly sensitive skin and she really likes it as well. Very happy that I found Nutiva.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: This is one of the easiest coconut oils to cook and bake with. The taste is not very strong so that you can cook non dessert like food with it as well.  I use it for almost everything. Food, skin, hair etc.

review/summary: Awesome product
review/text: I bought this product for my hair because of other people's reviews.  My hair was brittle and looked horrible because I color it often and use a flat iron almost daily.  I started using this product and my hair looks youthful and shiny again.  I have paid hundreds of dollars on conditioners and nothing worked better than coconut oil.  Love the fact that you get two of these, its a great deal!
