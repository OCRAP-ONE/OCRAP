review/summary: Works Physically, but not Mentally
review/text: After 6 or 7PM, I tend to be pretty worn out. I saw one of these in my brother's car, and he didn't want it, so I decided to go for it. I drank the whole bottle, and I felt the effects after about 30 min. I didn't have any weird side effects, but I noticed myself twitching a lot. It does some things correctly, as physically I feel decent, but mentally I feel awful. It's the kind of feeling you get when you want to go to sleep, but you can't. The best word to describe it is restless. It also tastes awful, but you can't really mark it down based on taste, as it's not obviously supposed to be something that tastes good.<br /><br />I'll give it a couple of stars for making me feel a little better physically, but that's still questionable, as it also made me very twitchy. Definitely not a product I'd recommend to anyone, unless they felt physically fatigued. A lot of people here seem satisfied with it, so maybe it's just me.

review/summary: more like 5 minutes of energy
review/text: I drive a lot and frequently suffer drowsiness on the road. I was hoping this product would be the answer. Unfortunately, it  was not. The effect I feel after downing a bottle is marginal. Maybe a boost in alertness for a few minutes but quickly back to the same level of drowsiness I was at. Two bottles does not help much either.<br /><br />I'm not sure how it seems to work so well with others but I wish I had the same effects. I am 6 foot 2 inches and around 250 lbs. Not sure if it works well only with smaller individuals.<br /><br />Despite not working so well for me, I still take it occasionally on the road for the small effect it does offer - though I do wonder if it's more placebo effect than anything.

review/summary: Placebo
review/text: My girlfriend and I decided to try 5-hour energy because we both like Red Bull but didn't like the "crashing" effect it can have after a little while. First off, Amazon's price is absolutely ridiculous. You should be able to get a 24 pack of this stuff for around $33 (at Sam's, etc.). Secondly, this stuff tastes gross (we had the berry flavored...more like vomit berry favor). Thirdly and MOST importantly: it didn't do anything except make us actually more tired. We couldn't stop yawning about 20 minutes after shooting our drinks down. I've read the negative reviews that other people have written...believe them and save your money! The positive reviews I am convinced are by people who are affected by the placebo effect. They think they should be more awake, so they "feel" more energized...

review/summary: Never again!
review/text: I don't usually drink energy drinks and I stopped drinking caffeine a little over a year ago, but had a long drive and I was exhausted so decided to give this a try. It worked great for the first 2-3 hours. I had a boost in energy, was more alert and felt fine, but into the 3rd or 4th hour my heart started racing, broke out into a cold sweat and was horribly jittery. When I got home my head started spinning and I couldn't sit down for hours. It was the worst feeling ever. I seriously felt like I was overdosing on a drug. Finally after 7 hours I felt a little better and was finally able to fall asleep, but all into the next day I felt horrible, entire body ached, felt unrested and still jittery. I know not everyone will react the same way, but be careful with this stuff. I did a little research afterwards and found information that suggest it is possible to OD on caffeine and Vitamin B. Maybe the percentages in this drink were just too much for me.

review/text: While this product works with many others I know, it doesn't work for me at all. The only reason I cite that stands out for me is I eat healthy, I maintain an active lifestyle and I get enough of rest, so in the mid afternoon when I have the 5 Hour energy drink, I still feel sleepy and I can sleep through it without feeling energetic (I work out in the morning). I'd love to hear comments from others who do have a healthy, active (vagan) lifestyle and still find this energy drink valuable.

review/summary: Quite possibly the worst product I have ever purchased in my life
review/text: I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the "discounts" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned.

review/text: The idea behind buying this is to have a natural pick-me-up in the morning.  The problem is they have doses of things in it that are too high.  Back when the natural supplement/remedies law changed allowing manufacturers to sell so call natural products it created a problem and this type of product is one of the symptoms of that problem.  They can claim it's herbal and natural etc.  and put out stuff that is not good for you.  I curse the day I signed that partition in a Whole Food type of store.  A already sick pharmaceutical industry is now even sicker.  I want a do over on that damn change.<br />If you don't like my comment good for you.  If you leave a comment I will not be reading it.

And then my friend Bill(you know Bill from those commercials) showed me this... and let me tell you, never has my wife been so happy, not only can I please her for a whole 50 second's but now I can please her for FIVE HOURS! At first she was just a fat repulsive whale who lost her charms, and pizazz! Now after taking 5 hour energy I can take on any challenge including my wife, and my next door's neighbors wife.<br /><br />Not only has if kept me great with my wife, I also can now power my car off on the sheer energy that radiates from my body, for 5 hours I was on a town rampage, robbing banks, hitting the gentlemen's clubs, spray painting my obscene terms on corporate buildings, you know the usual teenager stuff.

review/summary: Dangerous PLEASE READ!
review/text: My husband was driving 17 hours from Arkansas to SW Florida and decided this stuff would give him the boost needed to drive the distance. He took naps and ate food along the way. When he started to get tired he drank one 5 hour energy drink and arrived shortly after irritable and OUT OF CONTROL. He through a metal bar stool at my glass sliding doors of our new home. I thought he had calmed down so we went for a drive, he had a mood swing because I disagreed with him about something, he called himself stupid and started literally PUNCHING his own face while driving!!! He broke his glasses and started crying and gasping for air saying his heart was beating out of his chest. He then proceeded to do 108 MPH with our two young children in the back weaving on and off the road. He made an abrubt stop and got out. At that point I was scared to death and praying he would walk in front of a car. I started to dial 911 on my phone. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance as police feared he was having a stroke. They said drinking the 5 hour energy on a half empty stomach triggered a response when his saritonin levels started to fluctuate drastically causing possible suicidal/homicidal thoughts and frequent mood swings~ I was 25 years old at the time, my two children were 1 and 4 years old. We ALMOST died to a chemical imbalance that was caused by 5 HOUR ENERGY! Its IMPOSSIBLE to tell how a chemical will effect you, but with possible side effects as these, they are not worth the risk! I have currently filed a lawsuit against the company!

review/text: Bear in mind, different people have different metabolisms and different tastes.  From past experience, I avoid anything lemon-lime flavored.  I went with orange, which tastes like watered down OJ.  Just two ounces, small bottle fits in a knapsack or desk drawer.  When I'm crashing, caffeine just gives me the jitters and I still feel tired, no matter how much coffee or tea I drink.  I had a bad mid-afternoon crash and could hardly keep my eyes open so I drank a bottle of this stuff.  Instantly, I had mid-morning perkiness again.  Magic.  No after effects, but if you're dead tired to begin with you should probably treat the cause rather drinking energy drinks which relieve only the symptoms.  Also, if you have a high metabolism, take a small sip and wait 5 minutes.  Drink only what you need.

review/summary: The naysayers overstate the 'problems', and the bottom line is, this stuff WORKS. No sugar, no crash. It's true.
review/text: Alright folks, so I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table, because that's what you're supposed to do in an honest review right? I'm terminally ill, and I mean REALLY sick. I'm fighting hard, but it's a rough time. Part of that includes loss of muscle control, which includes the bladder, etc... Sheesh! LOL I was watching a review one morning on Fox News, after having been using this stuff for awhile, where the doctor they had on just TORE the energy drink business apart. He talked about how dangerous all of them were, and untested and how they basically don't work...<br />  Well I'm here to tell you otherwise. I went and got the EXACT bottle of 5 Hour Energy, Extra Strength, that I always buy, and which he was talking about. He was going on and on about how it was loaded with caffeine and was therefore bad for your heart. PLEASE! I've got the bottle IN MY HANDS right now folks. It states right on it, and this is the extra strength mind you, that it contains caffeine comprable to 12 oz. cup of coffee. That's not much! And yes, he was right that most of them work by being LOADED with sugar to go with the caffeine, and come with a REALLY bad crash afterwards. I experimented with some of the other products, and they taste delicious, but come with an AWFUL crash. This stuff doesn't taste so great because it has NO SUGAR, but it's just a tiny shot, and it works dammit.<br />  And then the doctor told the audience that it stimulates the nerves, and has been shown to cause nerve damage. I literally did a spit take. I was HORRIFIED. But low and behold, I talked to my own team of FIVE Neurologists that work on my case, and they disagreed. They said that a lot of the other drinks are unhealthy, diet-wise. This stuff causes what is called a Niacin Flush, and most of the energetic affects are from megadoses of vitamins. My Neurologists said that this stuff wasn't going to be hurting me, and at worst just might not work.<br />  But it DOES WORK! As I mentioned, I'm very sick. And that includes days when I am so weak I can't get out of bed or my chair. When I'm having nerve spasms, and can't control my muscles, I will sometimes have accidents when I fall asleep. I know the feeling well enough now to know, without doubt, when it will happen. Come on folks, I just admitted something really personal, and you can't get much more down in the dirt than that. LOL So when I feel that feeling, but am also really tired, I will drink one of these. It will keep me up and focused, and most importantly accident free, for between 3 and 5 hours while my nerve medications can kick in. And as those of us who have these problems can attest, that peace of mind, that time that is bought for us, ANYTHING to not make us incontinent if we can help it, is worth a LOT. Certainly the price of these little gems.<br />  The drink wakes me up, and it does NOT give me the jitters or make me edgy. I do not feel overwhelmed or hyper. It simply gives me the energy to get through my rough patch without falling asleep and waking up in a mess. LOL<br />  If there is one downside to this, it's the price. But I ask you this... How many of us are Starbuck's or expensive coffee fanatics? I was for YEARS. And we buy those mostly to help us to stay alert and awake through our day, and also because they are delicious. LOL These cost, per bottle, less than a Venti coffee. And seriously, they work. And that's what they are advertised to do, and that's JUST what they do. And that's all I NEED them to do. Not every product out there does what it says it will do. So that's a boost in my book right off the bat.<br />  I thank you for your time folks. Give these a try if you were needing a safe and least minimally harmful boost to your day during the more tired moments that we ALL have. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell

review/text: I usually drink about twelve 12 oz Coke Zeros a day, however the aspartame is bad for your diet.  Diet colas are worse for you than regular colas.  So I switched to 5 Hour Energy to replace the caffeine.  I also have Crohn's Disease.  This disease causes me to have a Vitamin B12 deficiency, which I normally have to buy and give myself an injection for.  Not anymore.  5 Hour Energy gives me 8333% (not a typo) of my daily allowance for B12, and also provides another crucial element that my body has a difficult time getting - Folic Acid.  Both of these are essential to the human body.  So, not only do I get jacked up from the 5 Hour Energy, it counters some of the effects of my Crohn's Disease by providing me with crucial elements and energy that otherwise are drained by this disease.  I am not a doctor, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, and drank 5 Hour Energy while I was there.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: First, let me say that I until trying 5 Hour Energy, I'd never tried any of the energy drinks on the market.  My main reason for not trying any of them was simple - most provide their "energy" boost from high levels of sugar or high-frutose corn syrup and caffeine.  Not trying to make a sweeping generalization here, and like I said, I haven't tried them - but I am an avid label-reader.<br /><br />I was in a convenience store one day and happened to pick up a bottle of 5 Hour Energy and read the label.  I was surprised that the ingredients were high in vitamins and amino acids.  But, I'm not one to try every "miracle in a bottle" product on the market and tend to be rather cynical when it comes to most of them, so I didn't buy any, but I was definitely intrigued.<br /><br />But here's the other thing.  I have MS and Fibromyalgia.  So as a result I deal with extreme levels of fatigue every day, and I'm talking about mind-numbing, like you can't even lift your head off the pillow, debilitating fatigue.  So quite honestly, I seriously doubted that ANY energy drink was going to have much of an affect on me.<br /><br />But one day, at another convenience store, I thought what the heck I'll give it a try, and bought 2 bottles.  When I got home, I drank half a bottle.  Within minutes, I felt better, like the 5 hour had taken the edge off my typical "my batteries are completely drained" feeling.  My initial reaction was that the sensation was purely a psychological placebo-effect sort of thing.  A little while later, I drank the rest of the bottle.  I still wasn't exactly convinced, but at the same time was thinking "wow, what if this stuff really works!".<br /><br />That evening I could feel myself starting to fade again. Not at all unusual for me after about 6 or 7, and when it happens, I'm usually worthless for the rest of the night.  Then I remembered that I had another bottle.  I know that they recommend no more than 2 bottles a day, but I had to know if what I had experienced earlier was the real deal or not.  So, I drank the second bottle.  Again, within a couple minutes I could feel my energy level rebound.<br /><br />Have to admit, that while this stuff isn't a magic potion, for me at least, it does what it claims.

When I can't nap because of committments, and know I will get very sleepy - this energy drink keeps me awake without the jitters from coffee.  The price at Amazon is great and it's handy to have available.

review/summary: fast acting wake up call
review/text: Great product , I've been an avid fun of hydroxycut hardcore from muscle tech for many years now. I have been also exposed to ephedrine for quite some time. I have a pretty high tolerance for most of energy drinks and being a 290 pounds athlete I require larger amounts of energy to get me going. I found 5H energy to actually work quite well. Make SURE to have 2H window between ur last meal and the time u drink ur energy shootl . Empty stomach is the most desireable environment for ur 5H energy shoot to kick in and in my case it does; within 5 min I already feel the surge of energy that continues for hours to come. Awake , alert , NO shivering heart palpitation trembling or similar effects.

review/summary: Gives the kick you need
review/text: 5 hour energy drink definitely works I have not experienced any side effects. Also it doesn't taste that bad for anyone to gag on it. That's definitely exaggerating. Within minutes of taking 5 hr energy drink my thinking is increased, I'm totally awake and I just feel so aware.  It's definitely great when you have to get up for work everyday at 5am and get home about 7pm.  I'm definitely not a morning person, but this helps me.  It's great for working out because it gives you that increased energy to actually get up off the couch and workout.  But there are some things you should remember. Try not to take on an empty stomach, because this drink increases your energy and your body needs something to burn to fuel that energy.  Another thing is only drink half of the bottle.  Why? because a whole bottle will have your hands shaking and your heart beating really fast.  I learned this the hard way. Maybe it's just my body that couldn't take the whole bottle, but to be on the safe side drink only half and see how you feel and if it's not enough then drink the other half.  I find that a half a bottle gets me through the whole day until I get ready to go to sleep that night.

review/text: I like 5 hr. Energy drink.  I have been drinking it for a couple mo.  I was doubtful at first but what the heck.I bought a couple bottles and put them in my fridge.  Couple days later I am busy in the kitchen and feeling run down.  I drank a bottle of 5 hr. Energy and layed down for a few minutes thinking of catching a small nap.  To my surprise I lie there about 15 min. and felt pretty good so I got up and went back to the kitchen and finished what I was doing and cooked something else also. Feels good to know I'm not the only one to run out of gas occasionally.flutterby2554

review/summary: Worked for me!
review/text: I had to drive 500 miles and the drive began late in the day when I was already tired and on a full stomach from lunch.  Needless to say I was feeling a bit drowsy.  A friend of mine suggested I try the 5 Hour Energy, and incredibly, I was wide eyed and alert for the entire drive.  The next day, I had to drive another 500 miles, and while it began earlier, I had a hard time sleeping.  Maybe it was the effects of the 5 Hour Energy still affecting me, or maybe it was because of the loud noises at my hotel.  Either way, I only had about 5 hours of rest, and I needed to cover 500 miles.  So I drank a bottle at the beginning of my drive and sure enough, I made it the entire way.  This is incredible for me as I have sleep apnea and although being treated with a CPAP machine, I still suffer from loss of energy throughout the day.  This has been the ONLY product that keeps me alert.  I do wonder what the health risks if any are though.

review/text: I've tried almost every energy drink out there and some work and some don't, but for the most part they all crash an hour or so later and leave you scrambling for some food or more energy drinks.  A never ending, ugly cycle.  I tried 5 Hour Energy and have been using it ever since.  It is truly a fantastic product.  If you need long lasting energy that wont make you feel hyped up or bring you crashing down an hour or two later, this is the product for you.

I'll usually take half<br />the bottle, or less, then a little more when I need it.  after opening the bottle, it should be discarded within 72 hrs.  :-)

review/summary: Seriously??
review/text: I honestly don't get the popularity of this item. It is nothing more than B complex in liquid form. I guess it's something to take if you don't carry around a small bottle of B vitamins. Maybe I drink too much coffee and that is why I can't appreciate the energy effects of a B complex, I think taurine and guarana are much better energy sources. Whether you prefer B vits, caffeine, taurine or guarana, below are products that will give you what this product gives you(or more) at a much more reasonable price.<br /><br />B supplements:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020HQAU">B-100 Complex 100 caps</a><br />Super Stress B Complex 100 Caps<br /><br />Liquid B supplements:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NOUDE">Nature's Bounty B-Complex Sublingual Liquid 2 fl oz (59 ml)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00125W1AO">World Organic - Liquid B Complex, 16 fl oz liquid</a><br /><br />Caffeine, Taurine & Guarana:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTM0WK">Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugarfree, 8.4 Ounce Can (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2O4YC">Diet Rockstar Energy Drink-Double Strength Energy Drink 16oz, 24 Pack</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DNBYXK">Monster Lo-carb Energy 16-Ounce., 27.5 LBS Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQSQ68">NOW Foods Taurine Pure Powder, 8-Ounce</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000703AU0">Super Guarana 1200mg - 90 tabs,(Good N' Natural)</a><br /><br />Personally, I  think it's silly to cough up two dollars for one shot of this when you can have the same level of energy, through the same vitamins at a much cheaper price.

review/summary: Wonderful stuff!
review/text: I am very leery of "energy drinks." I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this. Usually it starts with something like this: Them--"Does that stuff really work?" Me--"Yes! It's awesome, and it isn't like most energy drinks. This is really vitamins. Here, try this!" Them (two weeks later)--"Wow! That stuff really does work. I have been buying it now!"<br /><br />This is highly recommended for safe and healthy pick-me-ups! (Can I give it 10 stars?)

review/text: I am VERY sensitive to Caffeine. It can send me into a full blown anxiety attack.  This product, for some reason had NO adverse effects for me.  If this is usually an issue for you, I would suggest trying 1/2 a bottle and seeing how you tolerate it.  I had energy.  Since it has B12 vitamins in it, my mood was also enhanced. I felt excited and energetic.  The berry flavor tastes like Crystal Light Pink Lemonade.  Almost exactly like that.  There was no crash AND I was able to sleep well that night.  Sound too good to be true!? It was for me. I am SERIOUSLY trying to resist the urge to stock up and buy a whole case.  This stuff is great.  I was in a show with someone who had trouble focusing, was moody and forgetful.  We were on stage and he was often a mess... One night he did an amazing job, and I asked him what was different... He said... I took a 5 Hour Energy drink.  I was stunned and still not convinced... but saw the drink in a store and had to try it.  WOW!  That is all I can say! WOW! It's great!!!

review/summary: DON'T OVERDO IT AND ALL WILL BE GOOD
review/text: Dear Five-Hour-Energy (Berry Flavored),<br /><br />You came into my life when I was not ready for you.  I was still in a love-hate relationship with another woman, Coffee.  I loved Coffee's black taste, her bitter aroma, and her warm awakening after missing her for so long.  But she was not the one for me, my nights with her left me shaking, heart furious.  I felt manic and trapped.  My body would crash after tasting Coffee and my mind would race, too busy spinning to do anything useful.<br /><br />Then you came into my life, my sweet 5-Hour-Energy.  Coffee had stormed out, made a big scene at the cafe.  I met you at a gas station, looking alone and forlorn.  I asked you out to a club, and we danced all night long.  Later, I took you to rock climbing, swimming, kayaking.  My heart swelled with joy but you never made it hurt.  As our relationship prolonged, we sat with each other, working, sometimes writing tender missives.  My mind was alert, never spun thoughtlessly.<br /><br />Oh my love, I'd love to love you 5 hours more, my 5-Hour-Energy.<br /><br />Love,<br />Charlie<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- works!  you do get energy!<br />- minimal crashes (only occurs when i partake TOO excessively)<br />- berry flavor is tasty<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- there's a lot of vitamin B in this.  don't know if that is good or bad.<br />- can develop an immunity if you drink two or more every day, so don't do that<br /><br />As always, don't overdo any caffeine product.  If your body does not respond well to this product, cease immediately and maybe ask your doctor.  And then tell me if there are health risks.  Because I am not a doctor.  I am a warrior poet.  If by warrior, one thinks of programmers.

review/text: I am a serious runner and a cyclist. I am very skeptical most of too good to be true stuff but I do believe we landed on the moon and 9/11 caused by terrorists not by government. So I sacrificed  my body to test this product in the name of humanity. I run without 5 hour energy and then  I run with 5 hour energy. Difference is so obvious I really did get extra energy and power to shave off 2-3 minutes of my 5 mile morning run before annoying work day, as a matter of fact I still had gas in the tank to go another 4-5 miles if I had time. Same thing when I do road cycling specially 30-40milers, after 20 mile ride I take a shot of 5 hour energy and  double my distance. Having only 4 calories but giving you so much energy is a good thing. I recommended this for my fellow earthlings

review/summary: Works as the ads say it does...
review/text: This product is great and you get what the ads tell you about this product. You can definitely get through hours where you are extremely tired. Usually take it either in the afternoon to get through the rest of the day; small sip before a workout, half a bottle around 10PM when going out during the weekend. This product has a bit of an intense flavor - overall all of them do, so have some water ready as a chaser. This product will get you to a state like when you slept 10 hours and are bright awake and alert, however you wont have the jitters, shaky hands or anything like it. After the 5-6 hours it slowly fades away and you literally get back to the state you were at before taking this product - so there is no crash or anything. Aside from that your body will just extract this product after a bathroom run - it is not based on caffeine or taurine it actually works based on insane amounts of Vitamin B6 and B12 - one of them is at 8000% of your DV for food intake. Personally I have had great experience with it; though I have heard from people that they end up having to visit the bathroom due to some digestive issues.

review/summary: Other energy drinks don't work for you?  Try a bottle of 5-hour
review/text: First, as other reviewers here have already done, i want to emphasize that different bodies react differently to products such as this.  These are my own experiences with the products, and your mileage may vary.<br /><br />For this reason, I would encourage people try try a bottle at a local store (sold just about everywhere) before buying 12-pack's from amazon.<br /><br />Experiences with other products -<br />I drink coffee out of habit, but it doesn't help me to stay awake.<br />Instead, it makes me jittery and occasionally sick in the stomach.<br />Soda makes me bloated and deathly sleepy within minutes.<br />Energy drinks (monster, amp) makes me alert, but not at all focused.  The effect doesn't last more than a hour and the drink makes my stomach bloated and my body tense.<br /><br />5-hour energy -<br />The first thing that will hit you is the sourness, as if you're sucking on a lemon or warhead(though not as strong).  The sourness jolts me right up and then immediately after, it turns sweet and leaves no aftertaste.<br />It gets rid of the sleepy (the in-your-head, eyelids closing, can't stay awake kind of sleepy).. but doesn't really fix tiredness or exhaustion.<br />The thing I like best about this product is the -lack of- side effects.  Doesn't make my body tense or jittery, doesn't make me bloated or sick, doesn't make me more sleepy or crash.<br /><br />Does it really last 5 hours?  I've never tried chugging the whole thing.<br />I keep one in my bag and take a sip when needed.  It usually keeps me happy and productive for a day or two.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad at all imo.. call me crazy but i actually really like it.  Lemon-lime being my favorite, followed by pomegranate and berry.<br /><br />Price - yes, the drink isn't cheap.<br />BUT, the price is similar for any energy drink and i think that the price of this product is way overstated because you're getting a 2oz bottle instead of a 16oz can.<br /><br />However, for it's intended purpose (keeping you awake, not hydrated), (and if it works for you)i see it as a better deal for lasting longer, also I like the small pocket-able size.

They're all fine. After all, it doesn't take much more than a shot or less to do the trick, so the taste isn't that big of a deal. What's important is the "clean energy" without the plunge, addiction, stains or breath of coffee.

review/summary: I thought 5-hour energy was a scam until I tried it. It's unreal.
review/text: I'll be honest, I was a total skeptic of 5-hour energy for a LONG time. The TV ads seemed like a scam, no one I knew had tried them, and I just didn't buy into their marketing. Sure enough, I was browsing Amazon late at night one evening and decided to just try a box out. Why not, right? All I can say, is that these are unreal. Straight up. I don't know what else to say. I'm actually still trying to figure out how these are legal and the boost is amazing. Everything they claim is fact. There are not jittery feelings, no crash. The only thing they don't tell you is that the boost is so great that you'll want them all the time and they aren't cheap.<br /><br />Granted, I don't take these during the day at work - I'm a tea drinker and that keeps me going. When I head to go play basketball after work (3-4 times a week) I take one 15 minutes before I play. There is a noticeable difference in my energy levels out there when I have one, and when I do not. After a week of trying them out I was hooked. I'm an Ironman triathlete and consider myself to be in great cardio shape - knowing the performance edge that I seem to get from these, I would definitely use them on race day and again, can't say enough about the energy boost that accompanies these things.<br /><br />Anyway, you may not see a huge difference if you're sitting at your desk and take one - Honestly, I have no idea, I've just never used them that way. But...if you're going to work out, going on a run, going to play basketball or something to that effect, take one...and I think you'll be sold.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you'll need to sell your liver on eBay to sustain your habit...they are not cheap.

I've been taking them because during the week between school and work I average about 5-6 hours of sleep. When the commercial says feel it in minutes, they were not lying. It gets me going so much it almost feels like I've taken (illicit) drugs. I have a hard time sitting still in class these are so powerful.<br /><br />I will note that some people seem to get nothing from these, so before you go out and buy 24 bottles I'd say head to a gas station and pick one up for about 3 bucks. Also, energy lovers out there who have a Costco membership, you can get a pack of 24 for about 36 dollars before tax, and skip out on the shipping time.

review/summary: Excellent Product!
review/text: This drink delivers exactly what it promises. You get the energy boost you need without the side effects of a caffeine or sugar overload, which means you also don't get the crash when it wears off.  However, I would recommend taking it in small doses.  When I drink an entire bottle at once I get an immediate rush that eventually tapers off a bit and keeps me going for 5-6 hours.  However, it also makes me a little queasy.  I've gotten much better results by sipping on a bottle all day.  I sip about 1/4 quarter of the bottle every 2 hours.  This keeps me going all day without getting that upset stomach feeling. Highly recommended.

Obviously it's much smaller than a Red Bull but it gives you more boost. Not 5 hours as advertised but at least a bit longer than Red bull. He likes the taste too.

review/summary: Beats The Afternoon Crash! 8 )
review/text: I don't know about ya'll; but I work in an office and right between 2:00 -3:30, I experience an almost daily crash.  Really sleepy and lethargic, no focus.  This stuff usually does the trick.  One minute you're falling out of your chair, the next, you're good to go.  Alert and focused.  It's been a lifesaver more than once.  I'm also going to school online, and it has saved my bacon there, as well. I get the 12 pack and keep some at home and some in my drawer at work.  For me, its effect is usually about 3 hours, though.<br /><br />I seem to need the whole bottle, and I guess I'm one of the few that really prefers the Lemon-Lime flavor to the others.  The taste's not great; but it beats Red Bull and the like in taste, and effectiveness - and, you only have to drink the small bottle instead of a whole can.  Only 4 calories.  Sugarfree.  Not much caffeine.  I can honestly say the only time I've experienced anything close to jitters, is when I drank two in one day.  Even then, it wasn't the usual "too much caffeine" jitters.  It's the best thing I've ever found.  Tried another brand last month- tasted even worse and didn't work as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend 5 Hour!

review/text: I purchased this product late last week for my husband.  He had been buying it at a local mom & pop store for about a week.  He had been very pleased with its results.  When I placed the order, I told him I thought it would be here on Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.  On Tuesday morning, the UPS truck rolled into my driveway with my order.  I could not have been more pleased.  Not only was the speed of delivery fast from CA to ME, but it was well packaged, in a properly sized box with minimal packing materials(appealing to the enviromentalist in me).  I had also looked at other products on your site and will be ordering again soon.  The prices were very good as compared to the health food store where I generally get these products.  Thank you for your great service.  It is most appreciated.  Annette from Maine

review/summary: Gooood Stuff!
review/text: My brother (who's in the Air Force) loves this stuff, and eventually I got into it as well. I just sent him a 12 pack  as a gift to keep him going during his daily 12 hour shifts.<br /><br />If you have never tried regular 5 hour, I would try that first (especially half a bottle to see how it effects you). Then, if you feel like it's just so-so, try one of these extra strength ones and you might see a significant improvement. Energy products affect us all in different ways, and 5-Hour Extra is packed full with high amounts of B-complex and energy concentrated mixture (Gaurana, Taurine, Caffeine, Ginseng, etc.). I've read doctor's reviews of energy supplements like these, and as long as you aren't chugging down more than the recommended amount (2 bottles a day max), they are perfectly fine. Make sure you talk to a MD if you have high blood pressure, or have medications that might interact with a highly caffeinated shot such as these.<br /><br />I recommend putting these in the refrigerator and drinking them in the morning, or an hour before working out.

review/summary: As ineffective for me as sugar-free Red Bull...
review/text: First off, let me repeat what a few other reviewers have remarked:  different people are likely to have somewhat varied reactions to this product.<br /><br />And some background:  In the past I've had both Red Bull and Sugar-free Red Bull.  Red Bull works wonders for me.  If I take it at 10pm, I have great focus and concentration and I can stay up working all night long through to the morning.  But Sugar-free Red Bull has no effect on me whatsoever.  I can take it at 10pm and fall asleep 10 minutes later.<br /><br />'5-Hour Energy' has a very similar effect on me as Sugar-free Red Bull.  Which is, basically, nothing.  That said, '5-hour Energy' appears to be more likely to (1) give me a headache, (2) make me lethargic, (3) and make me want to go to sleep.<br /><br />So, if you are like me and need sugar for Red Bull to work for you, then likely this '5-hour Energy' drink won't do anything for you either.

My pet name for them is "baked hay".  But, I eat them because they help fill me up, give me fiber, and have only a few calories in each one.<br /><br />As long as I don't eat them "straight", they are good.  Many mornings, I eat them with a little bit of spray butter, cinnamon and Splenda.  Other times, I dip them in the soup I'm eating.  Yet other times, I melt cheese on them. They help fill me up and satisfy my appetite.

review/text: This product helped a friend lose 50 lbs and I have lost about 10 lbs on this product with some exercise and other diet changes (low or no carbs).  Basically this is a cracker, a bread product with low calories and high fiber and is very filling.  Before I could eat a whole box of low fiber crackers and still not feel full, with these I can eat three with my favorite foods, cheese, peanut butter, butter, cream cheese and feel satisfied. Melt some brie on these in the toaster oven. Wow.  I am waiting for the box of thirty on amazon but have regularly ordered the 30 pack on the bran crisp bread site, you pay around $2 per pack.  I keep these in my backpack for school or work and in the glove box of the car for handy use.  I love bringing them to the table at a restaurant for an alternative to bread.  At a Chinese restaurant they are a great alternative for the deep fried chips.  They provide the crunchy/cracker/bread feel with high fiber and low carbs.  I can speak more highly of this product.

review/summary: You want fiber?  GG's got tons of it.
review/text: It would probably be better to not think of these as crackers so much as a convenient fiber suppliement.  These crackers look exactly like particle board.  They are utterly without taste.  The texture is pretty crisp and sturdy, and be prepared to do some chewing and wash them down with plenty of liquid least they utterly dry out your mouth and throat.<br /><br />  This might sound like a negative review so far, but I actually like these things.  Their lack of any flavor renders them absolutlely neutral in terms of whatever you want to top them with. At different times I've put hummus, cheese, nuttella, tuna salad and peanut butter on them to good effect.  The taste like whatever you top them with, period.  I wouldn't want to eat these things plain, but I really see no need to try.<br /><br />  As far as the fiber thing goes, well, I'll try to stay away from TMI territory, but they work very well.  If you have any troubles at all with constipation you can do away with them once and for all with this product.  They also work decently as a filling snack if you are trying to cut back on calories.<br /><br />  These are definatly not my favorite cracker to eat, but as a fiber suppliment, they simply cannot be beat.

review/summary: This is delicious, nutritious, and can help with weight loss...IF...
review/text: I took a chance and ordered 30 packages of these.  2 net grams of carbs from a thick bran cracker...how could a low-carb dieter like me resist?  My first thought was to use this with peanut butter.  Yummy and yay!  It is delicious.  I use sunbutter, though almond butter could work too.  Even Smart Balance peanut butter is low carb--and goes great with this crispbread.  The secret...the big if...don't eat the cracker by itself!  I don't even eat saltines by themselves, much less a thick bran cracker.  Yet, I think some, who find this product untasty are doing that.<br /><br />There are some nasty-bad tasting diet products out there.  However, this crispbread, imported from Norway, is very good--again, with some nice spread on it.<br /><br />Final advice--shop around.  If you are willing to buy bulk, some vendors can get it to you for less than $3 a package.

review/summary: So Filling!
review/text: Bought these after receiving a sample of the other GG Bran product, the sprinkles (great for yogurt), and hearing great things about the crisp bread. I added two of these crackers with no-fat cream cheese to my usual breakfast this morning and what a difference! For an extra 60 or so calories (24 for the crackers and 30ish for the cream cheese)I am noticeably less hungry come lunch time. Usually by noon I am hungry, and on the days I work out in the morning by noon I'm starving. Today I worked out and at noon I wasn't hungry at all and it's 1:00 now and I'm thinking I might as well have my lunch because I have some time but I'm only barely hungry, could definitely wait another hour + if I needed. I will start taking these to work to use as an afternoon snack - I can't believe how filling and long lasting they are! They would be great with a bit of nut butter, low/non-fat cream cheese, or some other low cal spread like the laughing cow cheese wedges. Wouldn't eat on their own though because they are very dry, but great with a spread!

review/summary: Great Bread/Cracker standin.
review/text: If you just can't eat scrambled eggs, soup or a salad without toast or crackers this is just for you.  This size is for the serious folks who have tried the brancrisps and like that they are crunchy and have little taste.<br /><br />This is great if you are looking for LOW SODIUM, LOW FAT, HIGH FIBER.  An impossible to find combo!!  A great foundation for a snack; a great bread-like addition to a meal.  DON'T eat alone!!!  Crumble up in your cereal, munch on with just a little something on top.  These will stay fresh for a couple of years so I've bought the single pack at the grocery and went for the 30-pack box so I always have on hand.

review/text: I have been buying this for years. It's easier and cheaper to have a case in the basement whenever I need it. I took off one star because the manufacturer changed the packaging and removed the pull-tab (as pictured). Now I need to use a traditional can opener, which is a mess as the oil oozes out.<br /><br />But yellowfin is WAY better than albacore, so that's the most important thing.

review/summary: Very Good - Not Totally Mind-Blowing, Still Tuna....
review/text: This is very good canned tuna.  It's not the most mind-blowing thing I've ever eaten; I mean, it's still a can of tuna.  When I was a child we all did a lot of tuna fishing in Southern California, so I've had tons of fresh and personally canned yellowfin.  This isn't even close to fresh or personally canned; but then, it wouldn't be.  Anyway I just wanted to be sure to point that out.<br /><br />It says it's packed in 100% virgin olive oil, and I'm sure the manufacturer at least thinks that's the case.  Due to the recent massive international olive oil scam scandal that has finally been exposed, I'm not convinced this really IS 100% virgin olive oil.  That kind of olive oil is rare enough that it probably wouldn't be wasted on this type of use.  But I suppose it's possible that this is really 100% virgin olive oil.  Whatever the oil is, it seems to be of good quality.  (By the way, if you haven't heard of this olive oil issue, I suggest you Google it before buying any more "olive" oil.  And do the same for the "honey" scam too, which is even worse....)<br /><br />I don't mean to sound negative about this product at all.  I'm enjoying it.  It's meaty, nice quality, the can is well filled with product rather than filler oil, and the texture is good.  It comes in large chunks which you can use chunky, or moosh into more of a pate texture, depending upon your preference.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase this product again.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: I have been waiting anxiously for these new mish mash varieties to be released. We are big consumers of squeezeable pouches in this family because they are easy, fast, and nutritious. They are much healthier than giving a bag of some over-processed carbohydrate snack. If I'm in a hurry, which is always, I grab a few of these for the diaper bag and use them as on the go snacks. My daughter, 2, loves this new apple and oats flavor. I'm really happy to see grains incorporated into these new flavors to make them a little heartier and to help offset the effects of a diet with too much fruit. The fact that there is quinoa added as well is even better. This means a little boost of protein and a really, really healthy and slow digesting grain (all good things to add to a healthy diet). My only complaint is that the pouches are tiny at 3.17 ounces. My daughter can a eat few of these in one sitting. Most toddler geared pouches that I buy are 4.4 ounches, which seems more appropriate for a toddler-sized appetite. It seems silly to me that these are made so small. This small size is better for baby food, not toddler food. Oh well! Maybe Plum will change this in the future.

review/summary: Another great product from Plum
review/text: We have been a big fan of Plum products, so it's great seeing these offered on Amazon.  This particular product is great for my 14 month old son. I like the fact that they are organic, as well as have Quinoa for a little extra protein (better than just plain applesauce).  These are a smaller pouch than some of the other plum products, which makes it great for an on the go snack. My son can hold these and feed himself, so it is a great little snack for on the go. He gets so excited when he sees these that he starts bouncing up and down and laughing, so they must taste pretty good too.<br /><br />Plum products tend to be a bit expensive, but I thought the price offered on Amazon was a good one--especially when you factor in the subscribe and save discount.<br /><br />I like these but save these for when I feel he needs a 'heartier' snack. But we go through these so quickly, I like to have a more value oriented back up option. While it's not a complete substitute, I buy the go-go squeeze (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E0S4UW">GoGo Squeez appleapple, Applesauce on the Go, 3.2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 48)</a>)to have on hand in bulk because they are a little cheaper.
