review/summary: Fantastic butter
review/text: I am so glad i started using this butter to cook with, it just makes anything taste great. the flavor is really buttery. Baking is also fantastic i think it adds moisture and a wonderful texture to foods. A must have in any pantry and it doesn't need refrigeration, so it always ready to use and easy to spread.

review/summary: Excellent Quality , Best Source of CLAs out there
review/text: This is a high quality Ghee , superior tasting and above all made from grass fed cows' milk and certified organic by the USDA.<br />  We use it over lentils ,  eggs , sauteed veggies , quinoa , rice , you name it and we use it.  Tried it on whole grain toast too...YUMMY !! Being from grass fed cows' milk , it is rich in CLAs and boosts immunity and energy and is known to fight and obesity , especially trimming the waistline. This is my second time buying this and I am a consumer for life. I also introduced it to my friends and they are digging the taste.<br />  I really hope AMAZON continues to sell this product  ( prime delivery really makes it all the more special ).<br /> Please try it for getting healthier and also the incredible taste.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Hit or Miss
review/text: Overall, the bags of popcorn were just like those that you'd get in a regular package of 8 or 12 bags.  However, several bags did not pop correctly (or at all) and had to be thrown out.  Also, many other bags would have a burnt hole after popping.  I realize that some of this variability could be due to microwave wattage, but it was only bags from this large box of Orville Redenbacher's that would do this.  I think when you order such a large box, your chances of getting "dud" bags increase...just something to keep in mind!  Is it worth it to buy in bulk when more of the bags will be duds?

We have only 2 cats, a 3 year old male and a 17 year old female. They will eat only the Seafood flavor.  The male cat will eat only dry food and Temptation Seafood Medley and whatever he can catch outside.  The female loves can food with gravy, dry food and Temptations Seafood Medley. She doesn't hunt anymore but she will eat some of whatever the male catches.  I will definitely be ordering more. Thank you for such a good product and very good service. I recommend them to my friends with cats.

review/text: Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some "healthy" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.

(BTW, the CA law can be traced to one lawyer who made this his sole platform... google it.)<br />These PEARL drag&eacute;es are perfectly safe and do not fall under the same FDA restrictions and are still available in most baking supply shops (who've pulled the metallic ones off their shelves just avoid legal trouble.) While those who are looking for this product will probably already know this, those who are exploring new ideas for decorating will benefit from learning the truth. (The only reason I don't rate this higher is b/c of shipping rates.) Happy Baking!

review/summary: Arrived Open/Damaged and Was Not Allowed to Return/Exchange
review/text: I received this item and there was a tear in the packaging which had caused the dragees to spill all over the inside of the box they arrived in. This isn't very surprising due to the type of plastic it's packaged in -the sort which immediately rips open at the slightest puncture- but as such it should have been packaged for shipping more carefully. Perhaps wrapped it in small bubble wrap and taping it securely as I've seen done with other less fragile items I've ordered. I was especially annoyed however that there is NO way of returning it! That's just outrageous. Very very dissatisfied. I have now tried ordering similar pearl dagrees from Wilton <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N7ST6U">Wilton Sugar Pearls, White, 5 Oz</a> which incidentally, are less than half the price.<br /><br />I should say, that generally my experience with Amazon and returns has been excellent. The few dragees left in the package were beautiful, uniform in shape and tasty. I view this as an isolated incident due to the particular characteristics of this product/its packaging. However it could have been handled better.

review/summary: My cats LOVE this very healthy food!
review/text: When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' "spins" on this). Good books to get in this regard are "Foods Pets Die For" and "Protect Your Pet":<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive "premium brands"). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are "Made in the USA", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!<br /><br />But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.<br /><br />Oh, and hi, Ellen - and many thanks!

review/summary: Cats don't seem to go wild for it
review/text: After finding out what horrors I'd been perpetrating on my kitties with their expensive "premium" pet food, I set out to find something that wasn't full of by-products and unnecessary corn ingredients. Halo Spot's Spew definitely fit that bill and their ingredients are probably the best you will find in a cat food. My cats, however, weren't as impressed as I was and turned their noses up at their new food. They did eat it, but clearly weren't enthused.<br />Although I like the human grade ingredients used in Halo foods, I do wish they used more meat sources. There are only a couple protein sources in the food and as a result the protein content of Spot's Stew, around 30%, is also a little lower than what I'd like.<br />Overall, however, this is definitely a great food to feed your pets, though if you have a cat that's a finicky eater or that needs a high protein food, Halo Spot's Stew may not be for you.

review/summary: Fantastic for kitty's energy and coat, the key is introduction of new food.
review/text: I switched my cat to Halo's Salmon indoor formula and have noticed a marked difference in her coat and reduced smell from the litter box.<br /><br />Cats are snobs when it comes to food.  Switching them to a new food takes at least a week, more if you have a picky eater like me.  Start small and work more in each day. If you moved from a diet of Raman Noodles to a high protein, high fiber diet instantly you wouldn't want to eat it either.  :)  You get what you pay for when you buy food for yourself or your pet.

review/summary: Causes vomiting
review/text: I like the idea of getting grains out of cat food, but using peas instead doesn't seem to be the answer.  Carnivores (at least my cat) doesn't tolerate peas.  Vomiting began in about 2-3 weeks and is now instantaneous.  Eat some cat food--go right to throwing up. Both chicken and salmon.  So for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing.

review/text: My cats love this food. I have been buying the 3 pound bag, but with 3 cats, I will be switching to the larger bag. I am glad that Halo is available on Amazon, which makes it very convenient to order, but I also wish that more stores would start to carry this brand as well. I am always looking for the best for my babies and as far as I can tell, this is it.

review/text: I am not sure if my cat loves Halo, but whenever I try to change brands, my cat looks happier going back to Halo. Like other reviewers, the poop seems to be least smelly. Also, one noticeable difference when I feed Halo is that my cat seems to eat in a controlled manner- eats throughout the day. I guess that is a good thing? When I feed other brands, my cat eats it uncontrollably all at once.

She normally eats EVERY SINGLE BITE of her food but constantly turned her nose up at this. She really enjoys Bench & Field's Holistic Natural Feline Formula (from Trader Joe's) and also Purina's Naturals Cat Chow. Sorry, Halo, I REALLY wanted her to like this!

review/text: My little beasts love this stuff. I have tried this, turkey, and salmon. All get 2 paws up. LOVE the packaging, and if smell is any indication, this must be good and healthy for my cats. Some cat food really smells like.. cat food.  This doesn't. The little girl kitty loves the smaller morsels, so she is eating more. I had been using Iams and although it's great also, she had a hard time chewing the bigger pieces.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this brand.  It may be a bit more expensive, but I notice I am not filling the litter bowl as much. My little girl kitty is putting on some much needed weight, but I am not buying cat food as often with this brand.

review/summary: King Syrup Rules!
review/text: I grew up on King Golden Syrup back in Pennsylvania, and have missed it greatly since moving west in 1978. Until recently, I had depended on the generosity<br />of family members to ship me the occasional bottle, which we would then use so sparingly that sometimes I would forget that I had it on the shelf! So nice<br />to find an entire six-pack for such an affordable price.  Tiny bit of disappointment when it showed up in plastic dispensers, as opposed to the classic glass bottle pictured in the add.  Pleased to announce that the quality was still very, very high!

I always looked forward to my visit because the Midwest didn't have it. It one of those childhood memories that gives you the warm and fuzzies. I would be enjoying breakfast while listening to my grandmother tell a story. When my family would pack up to return to MO, my folks would buy a couple cases of King Syrup to hold us over to the next visit. To this day, I am "54", everytime I eat it, I think of her and the wonderful memories, a time when things were simpler but good. ;-)

review/text: I grew up eating King syrup in Delaware and as I moved several times I would always have family and friends bring me a bottle while visiting.  Recently, this syrup is no longer available in Delaware so I was glad to find it on Amazon.com.  Although it arrived in plastic bottles instead of the traditional glass bottles, the taste (quality) remains the same.  I ordered a six pack and only have 2 as family and friends grabbed bottles as I opened the package.

I used to have my brother send me 16 oz bottles, but most stores only carry it in 32 oz. bottles.  One 16 oz is just right for two pies.<br /><br />My complaint is not with the syrup.  It is in the way it was shipped.  I ordered two boxes of 6 each.  I wanted one for a gift.  However, you sent the 12 bottles in one container.  The UPS man left it on my porch and I couldn't lift it to get it in the house.  Bad call on your part.

review/text: I had a good experience with other Amazon grocery products and these were a good deal, so I bought a three pack. They weren't horrible but they don't taste the same as the ones you buy in the store. They taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies. Which is not necessarily bad, but not what I expected for the price and Chips Ahoy brand.<br /><br />They are cheaper tasting, a little stale and much less chocolate chips. I haven't had store-bought Chips Ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies, but if not, then these seem to be cheap knock-offs made with cheaper ingredients.

review/text: I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.  As a tonic for health and energy, I now find myself drinking it daily instead of my usual afternoon coffee. It perks up the body and brain without the jittery effects of caffeine. I find I get a delightful pick-me-up later in the day--when I need it--without the negative affects of keeping me up at night.  While a tad expensive, I will continue to buy SPORtea and enjoy its delicious brew.  It is now a part of my every day routine.

Buying them from Amazon with our prime shipping is so much cheaper than buying them from our local grocery store.  Nuts keep nicely in the freezer.  Toasting them in a 350 degree oven for 10-12 minutes makes them taste gourmet-ish.

review/summary: these walnuts are fresh and are chopped to the perfect size for  topping ice cream and yogurt, etc.
review/text: I enjoyed these chopped walnuts very much. They are fresh and crunchy and are perfect for use in trail mix or as a topping for ice cream, yogurt, etc.<br /><br />I like the small eight oz. bag.  It's a very convenient size that doesn't leave me wondering how to keep a whole pound of nuts fresh if I have to open the bag just to use a few walnuts on my granola in the morning.<br /><br />However, for some uses (i.e. making chunky chocolate chip cookies), I have found that the shelled walnuts work much better for me than these chopped walnuts do.  The small pieces (chopped walnuts are really just walnut crumbs) seem to blend more into the background of baked goods than the big shelled walnut chunks do.<br /><br />For that reason, I prefer the Diamond shelled walnuts to their chopped walnuts.  However, both products are very good.

review/summary: Best of the florentines
review/text: This one seems to be flavored more to a cat's liking than the rest of the Florentine varieties.  They're expensive, so buy one of each to see what floats with your cat but here, one will eat this and the other one won't.  It is gobbled up quite quickly too, I might add, by one of them so there you go!  Anyway, the greens addition is great for cats, they seem to like it in their other varieties, and they're high on the nutrition scale. So, if you're looking for higher protein and better nutrition all around, be sure to give these a go.  In our house, the pates have fared the best over the shreds and particularly, these florentines.  The egg soufles seem to be the favorites here - they "hoover" them down so fast they barely come up for air!  Recommend!

review/text: The garden greens added to this product was the reason I bought it because my cat was trying to eat any twigs she found in my yard in addition to the twigs in trees she climbs.  My cat was a stray cat who obviously had not been getting a balanced diet.  I believe the Fancy Feast florentine style is changing her eating habits because she chews fewer twigs and has begun nibbling on any available green plants.

review/summary: Ok solution, depending on your kitchen set up
review/text: I purchased this product over a year ago, and the best I can say is this is an ok product for me, but could be perfect for you.<br /><br />I used to always reach up to the top shelf, grab my box of k-cups, sift through them to find what I wanted, and then make my coffee. I tried to use the wooden box, but when you can only hold 20, and you use multiple k-cups per day, I just felt like I was always filling it, and didnt have enough room for variety.<br /><br />I bought this thinking it was perfect, holding 36 cups should last me a few weeks minimum. The Keurig would sit right on top and take up less room. What more could I ask for? Then when I brought it home though the truth came out.<br /><br />The draw is very well made and works perfect. However you are adding about 3 inches to the size of the keurig. Due to the height of my cabinets, it raised the machine just enough to not longer be able to open enough because the handle hits the cabinet. For a few days I was pulling it out and using it like that, but that got too annoying. Instead I now use the draw, but not with my coffee maker on it. It now holds my knife block instead, since those can still come out just fine.<br /><br />If your keurig is set up with no cabinet above it, this option is beyond perfect. However for me, I feel like it just added a bit of clutter, but I am willing to deal with it for the convience of the drawer.

review/summary: Great tray for storing various K-cup varieties
review/text: Before I begin my review, let me say this... I read the product specs, ESPECIALLY THE DIMENSIONS...<br />I measured the space I have, and armed with that knowledge, I ordered the item.<br /><br />The item is exactly as described and pictured... and because I pre-measured, I KNEW it would fit (unlike other reviewers who apparently couldn't be bothered, and then give it a low-rating as a result).<br /><br />It's a simple design, and well built.  It's sturdy enough to hold the weight of my LARGE Cuisinart k-cup brewer, with a full reservoir.  It's a solid wire-frame build, and the rails the drawer runs on are part of that wire-design.  The mesh walls are a tad light-weight, but they aren't load-bearing, and are only meant for aesthetics and to contain the k-cups. (I also store Splenda packets in one column of mine.)<br /><br />Other than my 'normal' blend, I tend to have up to 5 additional flavors for a weekend treat, or just to mix it up on occasion... keeping these loose on the counter, or bouncing around mixed up in a box made it a pain to pick through them... but now I keep them in line in the segmented rows in the drawer.  Having a lack of storage space in my cupboards and kitchen drawers makes this the natural and ideal choice.<br /><br />Many have been disappointed that it didn't "fit" -- but all you need to do is measure your brewer's footprint, and it's height beneath your cupboards (if applicable).<br /><br />It's not a PERFECT item (the mesh could be a tad better grade, or the price about $5 lower) but otherwise highly recommended purchase.

review/summary: This is not necessarily a "space saver"
review/text: So, I bought the Coffee Pod Drawer thinking it was the answer to my cluttered coffee area on my kitchen counter.  Not exactly.  First and foremost, let me say - this is a great product.  It does hold the pods neatly.  It has a nice, durable, slip resistant top that lets you feel comfortable that your Keurig won't slip or tip over. This is why I gave the product 4 stars.<br />My issue is this:  I purchased this simply because I thought it would use up less space on my counter if my K-Cups were stored inside this drawer and underneath my Keurig, as opposed to my (somewhat) bulky K-Cup Carousel.  (Which by the way, is chrome, and I really despise chrome.)  Anyways, what I did not consider was the fact that it raises your Keurig up by about 3.25 inches.  Before I bought this drawer, my Keurig had just enough space on the counter under the cupboard that it sits under, for me to lift the top of the Keurig open to put new K-Cups in, and to fill the water, etc.  That additional 3.25 inches really makes a difference.  I can no longer open the top of the Keurig all the way without banging the cupboard.  We all know that you don't NEED to open it all of the way, but when that's what you were used to doing, well, you can understand...  I pretty much bang the cupboard every day now.  Another drawback to the idea of purchasing this soley to save space, is that you can't keep anything in front of the drawer, since obviously, you need to open the drawer to get the K-Cups out. I used to keep the coffee condiments in front of my Keurig, and now I can't.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: This is a great product in the sense that it gets the carousel (if you have one) off your counters.  But, I would only buy this if 1.) You have ample clearance above your Keurig now to be able to still lift the top open once you set this up, and 2.) You don't need to use the space in front of the drawer.<br /><br />Happy Coffee Drinking!<br /><br />Update:  02/20/12:<br />Almost a year later - I am still using the Storage Drawer.  Yes, from time to time I forget and still whack the cupboard, but the Keurig and the cupboard are no worse for the wear.  I still keep my eye out for better storage solutions, and none have really looked like they would be any better.  While the product is well made and has been durable (still looking practically new, and is heavily used in my kitchen) - I still think it's a bit pricey for what it is.  I just checked online and it still ranges from $25 to $45.  (I am hoping that nobody pays $45 for this when you can get it for $24.99, plus use a coupon for 20% off at Bed Bath and Beyond.)<br />Of all the reviews I have written on Amazon, this one seems to bring some not so nice comments from people. Which is kind of odd to me.  But everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I still hold firm at 4 stars.  As I mentioned in a reply to one comment - to me, that's a B+. There's nothing wrong with a B+ product.  I think most people that buy this product will be very impressed with it's durability.  Thanks for reading!

The whole thing feels very sturdy, and has a nice modern look to it.

review/summary: Was expecting better quality for the price but love the storage!
review/text: First off I very much prefer this look to the rotating holders, plus it holds MORE K cups than they do.  I also like that it takes up less storage space than those carousels plus a machine.  I have limited counter top space and it is already crowded.<br />A minor issue, as I had read before, was that the added height to the machine causes lid to hit the cupboards while opening and closing. I am OK with pulling it away from the wall a bit and will eventually place my machine in a more open counter space to avoid this.  It does bother my husband more though.<br />I was disappointed with the product a bit.  My main problem was the material on the top of the drawer, that you rest the machine on, was not done very aesthetically.  AS soon as I opened what stood out to me was that it had to have been hand cut, and was cut slightly wrong on my product.  First I can still see the pencil mark all across the front.  Then it was cut too short and  coroner was not cut squarely.  It happens to h ave also been across the front edge of my product so it just sticks out to me and lessens it's appeal.<br />I find the drawer to operate smoothly and easily.  you can not reach the back row of K-cups while full but that is not a big deal to me at all.
