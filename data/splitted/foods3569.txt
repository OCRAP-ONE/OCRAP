review/summary: BEST K-CUP!!!!
review/text: Fair warning: if you are not looking for strong coffee, this isn't for you! This blend is much strong than my previous favorite "black tiger". While it is strong, it doesn't have the bitterness that you get with coffee from other k-cups or Starbucks. It has a nice sweet taste that is perfect for those who take their coffee black (tastes great with milk, cream and/or sugar too!!!). I have recommended this blend to a few friends who bought it after I gave them one to try. Try and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Good Coffee That Packs a Little Punch
review/text: This is a good-tasting coffee that does pack a punch or jolt.  I'd recommend NOT drinking this as your second or third cup, as after I (and three other people) had one in the afternoon, we were wired for a while - that's what you're looking for with something named "jet fuel," and it lives up to its name.  Combining this trait with a good taste - as well as the good pricing here on Amazon vs. CostCo - is a pretty good deal.

review/summary: Try a sample first if you can
review/text: I like strong coffee/espresso and was excited to try Jet Fuel after reading the reviews here.  After a week of drinking this coffee however, maybe I have a different definition of strong coffee.  Every day I drink this very average coffee on the way to work and say to myself, write a review so others don't do what I did, and buy 50 cups of the stuff.<br /><br />It has a bitter taste with not a lot of anything else going on, and maybe that is what some people consider strong.  Maxwell House crowd perhaps.  I prefer coffee with more depth and complexity, i.e. Starbucks, and Jet Fuel misses that mark by a wide margin.<br /><br />My favorite K Cups so far have been Donut Shop, Kona, and Caribou Blend.  Caribou is a great choice if you like bold and rich coffee, but now I am stuck with 50 cups of Jet Fuel.  Don't believe the hype.

review/text: I am a fan of extra bold coffees - this one is very good without bitterness.  The last time I purchased this it was $21.00 for 50 - I can not justify the cost any longer....

Starbucks has lost a customer.  I don't need to pick up a good cup of coffee at starbuck as long as I have my jet fuel.  The price is fantastic.  I even save money.

review/summary: Pretty decent cup
review/text: Not your gourmet cup of coffee, but a decent, strong, satisfying cup.  My last purchase was the Coffee People Donut Shop- if you like that one, this is similar, but a little stronger.  The reason I switched from Donut Shop was bc the flavor was very weak. This one is definitely a step up, however there is definitely more bitterness to it so it's not as tasty as some others. I am still looking for that strong, flavorful cup... haven't found it yet, but at least Jet Fuel will buy me some time to find it!

review/summary: A good strong cup of coffee, not quite as smooth as donut shop
review/text: Overall I've enjoyed the Jet Fuel coffee, those of you who use your Keurig's regularly will know that just by the nature of the k-cup, if you want a larger cup of coffee (by k-cup standards, not even approaching the size of Venti from Starbucks) you have to go with a lot stronger k-cup just to get a reasonably medium-boldness cup of coffee.  With this need comes the Jet Fuel, it produces a strong cup of coffee even at the larger settings on the Keurig, and it's pretty good, it does have a touch of bitterness to it and doesn't go down as smoothly as their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] which is my favorite k-cup.  The Jet Fuel coffee definitely lives up to it's name and will wake you up in the morning perhaps better than any other k-cup, I've gotten into the habit of having a Jet Fuel cup in the morning and a Donut Shop in the afternoon after lunch.  I will caution you to avoid the Jet Fuel too late in the afternoon or evening or (unless you have a really high caffeine tolerance) you're going to have a very hard time falling asleep.

I tried several of the K cups, searching for a coffee that was worthy.  This is it!!  I love waking up in the morning , sticking the pod in the warmed up machine (I set it on the timer), and brewing this delicious cup of bold - not bitter - coffee!  My very favorite!!  By the way.. some of the reviewers say it is super strong.  I don't agree.  I've had stronger, and still very delicious cups of coffee!  Don't let it scare you.  It's not THAT strong.  Enjoy!

review/summary: BEST FOR THE KEURIG BUT KEURIG NOT THE BEST FOR COFFEE TASTE
review/text: I tried many, many coffee beans for my new Keurig and settled for Jet Fuel as "best" tasting using the Keurig.  However, I still have my cheaper Cuisinart burr grinder coffee maker.  My wife and I decided to do a side by side taste test.  We used the Keurig with Jet Fuel and the Cuisinart with Starbucks French Roast.  The results?  I say the Cuisinart slightly beat out the Keurig, it just tasted better.  My wife says the Cuisinart is definitely better.  Not a strict test since we didn't use the same coffee bean.  But it's interesting to note that the initial Consumer Reports ratings for the Keurig are not favorable.  Looks like our household agrees with the folks at CR.<br /><br />The Keurig is less messy but it generates all those plastic cups as waste.  The Cuisinart just leaves behind a non bleached paper filter.  And the $99 Costco version comes with a gold filter.<br /><br />One other thing about the Keurig.  Google Keurig to find other owners who have complained about it failing after a few months or year and the poor customer support from Keurig.  Mine has not failed so I can't attest to those other owners but they are out there with an opinion.

review/text: If you love strong coffee with good rich, full flavor, then Jet Fuel is one you should try!  I have also found that I like it a little weaker sometimes.  I brew it on the large mug setting, lift & lower the lever, and brew another large mug.  The second brew comes out brown in the mug like the first.  This method gives me a 20-ounce travel mug of delicious coffee, tamed down just a bit.  :-)  And if you order with "Subscribe and Save," you'll get this coffee at $0.36 per K-Cup!  What's not to love about that?!

review/text: I've got a Keurig for my dorm room and I usually just buy a sampler box because I don't really have a preference for any one of the coffees. However it's not the most money wise way to buy the k-cups, so I thought when I saw these on sale I thought I would give them a shot. I have to say I'm absolutely infatuated with Jet Fuel. I definitely like my coffee strong, as a previous Starbucks Barista, and the undertones of chocolate are wonderful for my sweet tooth. I highly recommend these for anyone who likes bold coffee, people who prefer something like a breakfast blend would probably find Jet Fuel to be too bitter. I also like that there's no excess packaging. I ordered the same size box of breakfast blend for my mother and I swear I could have fit in the box it came in!

review/text: The first sip I had of jet fuel coffee was from a local coffee shop and I was not sure I liked it as it has a very strong sharp flavor at first.  This is then quickly followed by a deep richness that I find myself craving regularly.  The K-cups produce the same flavor I was used to at the coffee bar and can give me my jet fuel fix at home.  So although it may not be for the Sanka crowd and has a very striking intitial flavor, I find it rich, well balanced adn interesting.  Definately my favorite K-Cup to date.

The first thing I noticed when I pulled one of the K cups off the brewer is that there wasn't an aroma like I was used to with other K cups, which translated to little smell in the cup.  The flavor is strong and bitter, like I say it wakes you up.  Not one to sit and enjoy in my mind.  I prefer the other bold coffees available in K cups to this one.  They at least have an aroma and taste of coffe vs. this one that has bitterness to offer.

review/summary: Jet Fuel K-Cups, just OK
review/text: I have found the quality control of my recent purchases of K-Cups to be marginal, at best.  I look for cups whose foil covers bulge at the top.  Unfortunately, many of the cups seem to have their seals breached, and the cover is flat and sometimes concave.  The performance of these cups is often terrible, with grounds escaping both within the coffee maker and into the cup of coffee and coffee even spilling out of the maker beyond the bounds of the rim of the cup.  Worse yet, the taste of the coffee is lifeless and insipid.  In a word, it is stale.  When the packaging seems intact the coffee tastes fine, and there is no mess or clean up necessary.  I'll keep searching for a more reliable provider.

review/summary: Love the coffee - HATE Amazon's price hike
review/text: This is one of our very favorite K Cup selections -- bold and deep flavor.  It HAS been a staple in our household, but no longer.  I'm not sure what Amazon's reasoning is for the huge and sudden price hike.  I read that they claimed it's an increased price from the manufacturer, but all other retailers that I count on for K Cups have kept the same price, so that seems like an excuse.  At $27 a 50-ct. case, I can walk into any number of retailers with a basic sale or easily accessible coupon and get a MUCH better deal.  Sorry Amazon!  I love you, but I won't be buying any more K Cups from you unless you bring back the reasonable pricing.

review/summary: Too much of a bite for me.
review/text: I love a good cup of strong coffee, but this has way too much of a bite for me.  Even my husband, who does like it a little bolder than I do, thought the same.  If you are looking for a smooth, full bodied coffee, this is NOT it.  If, on the other hand, you want something that is bound to curl your toes in an attempt to wake you up, this will do it.  Not what I look for in coffee though.  I like to be awakened with ease, not a jolt.

review/summary: Passable, but muddy
review/text: NOTE: This is a review of this coffee in the K-cup format, not of Amazon's packaging.  However, I have never had trouble with the Frustration-free packaging; I simply cannot comment in this case.<br /><br />Reviewer's preferences: Strong, medium-dark roast coffees, mid-to-heavily sweetened with whole milk (4:1 ratio or a little heavier toward the coffee side).  I occasionally add a hint of vanilla syrup and cream or half-and-half if a coffee is overly bitter.<br /><br />I picked up this coffee in a large sampler box of Coffee People "Extra Bold" K-cups, which I have just finished off.  The collection contained the following blends/coffees: Wake-up Call, Jet Fuel, Black Tiger, and Organic.  I have had each coffee multiple times.  From the four, I give the Organic blend the top spot with a slight edge over Black Tiger (we're talking 9.1/10 over 9.0/10 here).  Both the Black Tiger and Organic were strong and bold in flavor but not too bitter, while the Wake-up Call tended to be a little more harsh on the palate.  The Jet Fuel blend was appropriately named, as it almost always required a little vanilla and more milk or even heavy cream to make it palatable.<br /><br />Qualities of Coffee People Jet Fuel:<br />Dark, almost burned coffee flavor (think bad Sumatran roast).  Heavy bitterness that overwhelms the flavor, harsh on the back of the tongue and a fully bitter aftertaste, but probably drinkable if you are a fan of Sumatran or French Roast coffees.  Medium acidity, a little tangy but not really sour, with an earthy flavor that tends toward muddy.  Flavor envelops the entire mouth, but generally overwhelms the palate.  Heavy body, but not sludgy, though your mouth may be convinced otherwise from the flavor.  While I can and sometimes do drink other coffees black (mostly full-bodied medium roasts), I can't imagine anyone drinking this black even if they take their espresso that way.  Requires sweetener and cream/half-and-half or a heavy addition of milk.  Personally, I had to use a small splash of vanilla syrup to hide the bitterness.  Drinkable, but just barely with better choices available. Hard to find the good qualities in the disappointing profile.  Certainly not the WORST dark roast I have had, however.<br /><br />I give this 2 stars for one reason.  If you were using this coffee as an ingredient where you wanted the coffee and perhaps the bitterness to not be hidden too much, then this would be an excellent choice over many harsh Sumatran and French Roast coffees.

review/summary: Coffee taste alright
review/text: This is my first shipment for this coffee.  I'm on a subscription basis.  Each K-Cup is flushed with nitrogen and then sealed in an air-tight, moisture-tight cup.  This lid is adhered to the top of the cartridge as soon as it is filled with fresh coffee or tea grounds, and the K-Cup remains air-tight and moisture-free until the needle of your Keurig brewer punctures the foil.  However in this shipment 35 of the 50 k-cups were deflated and lost there seal.  Not sure how fresh this coffee is since the seal was broken prior to shipment.  If the next shipment returns the same result I'll go back to paying more for a fresher product.

review/summary: Love Coffee People, but Not Jet Fuel
review/text: Let me begin by saying I am a huge Coffee People fan.  My wife is from Oregon and anytime we visited her family my first priority was visiting one of their shops.  I was deeply disappointed to see their stores absorbed by Starbuck's (nothing against Starbuck's, they make a good cup of coffee and are a very responsible company).  Having tried Jet Fuel, I find it tastes like it sounds, with a bitter and chemical finish.  I'm no connoisseur, but I know what I like, generally bold coffees, and this may be bold, but also harsh with an unpleasant finish.  I'd recommend passing on this one and explore their other excellent coffees.

review/text: I'd like to give the manuafacturers the benefit of the doubt, but this stuff is hard to swallow (no pun intended).  I love strong coffee, from the Sumatras to the other dark roasts.  That's why I purchased the Jet Fuel.  I also purchased the Kona coffee from the same coffee co. - that is a great roast and I would recommend to anyone.  But this coffee actually has the aroma of old cigarettes...not too appetizing.  I could have just received a bad batch and I'll look to return what I have left (I did give it a few tries).

I hate to say this but neither of these brews are stronger than any other "extra bold" brews I have tried. If you get this just know that you still need to use a smaller amount of water to make a strong cup of bold tasting coffee. I think the new Starbucks bold brews actually make a stronger cup of coffee.

If you are a breakfast blend with cream and sugar kinda person, maybe opt for the Donut Shop K-Cups instead.

review/summary: Harsh flavor, and yet still  not strong coffee by my standards
review/text: I went out on a limb and purchased this 50 pack of Jet Fuel because of so many good reviews.  Let me start by saying, I like STRONG coffee.  Espresso is fine with me, and when I make my own coffee I make it as strong as can be.  If all I have is instant I  at least quadruple the amount of coffee to water.  In other words, I like a strong coffee, and Jet Fuel by my standards is strong in flavor only.  Okay strong isn't the best word; HARSH would be a better word.  It's not a pleasurable drinking experience.<br /><br />I took some to work to let a coworker try it, and I think he nailed the aroma and flavor of this Jet Fuel coffee.  He said it's like a dirty ashtray.  After he said that it clicked in my mind.  Dang, yes that is what it tastes like.  Now, I will give the benefit of the doubt that I got a bad batch, but so far since I was a sucker and bought 50 of them, I keep drinking them usually adding instant coffee, or another nicer flavored coffee to it to kill the ashtray flavor because all of them taste the same so far.<br /><br />Be warned, I'm no stranger to harsh coffee, but this IMHO is not a pleasant harsh.<br /><br />J

review/summary: Coffee for adults
review/text: I put a sign up at my workplace that reads, "There is no strong coffee, only weak men." Alright, I'll admit that there are some coffees that are stronger than others, but not very many that are stronger than Jet Fuel. And, this is actually my wife's favorite brew, so no more excuses girly men! This has a very dark, strong flavor with just the right amount of bitterness to round out the flavor. However as mentioned in the title, it's for adults. We drink this as our every day coffee, but also keep some more milder flavors for guests and "weak men".

review/text: When I could no longer find Wake-up call K-cups, I switched to Jet Fuel. I will admit the name made me nervous. I like a bold, strong, tasty coffee and Jet Fuel is just that. I can't give you details of the taste, such as caramel, licorice, or the other terms people use to describe coffee. I just can tell you this is about the best cup of coffee I've ever had. Try it and you will enjoy.

review/summary: Jet Fuel got me through Air Force Pilot Training
review/text: Got Jet Fuel because I thought it would be a funny drink to have in the cupboard while going through Air Force Undergraduate Pilot Training.  Turns out this is pretty darn good coffee, strong enough where I can brew it in a large cup add a little milk or creamer to cool it down, add a little more cold water if I need to pound it before I get out the door, and it still tastes great.  I'm no coffee snob, but I know what I like, and I'd definitely recommend this to a friend.<br /><br />Kept me alert enough to get through pilot training, and will definitely keep on having it to stay alert and keep the skies safe.

review/text: If you are tired of the traditionally weak K-Cup coffees, then the "Coffee People Jet Fuel" brand is for You. I steered away from using my Keuring Brewer because the other branded, so called, "Extra Bold" coffees I brewed were not Strong enough. I tried the Jet Fuel and this coffee brought me back to using my Keuring Brewer on a daily basis. This coffee is Strong, Extra Bold and NOT Bitter. Highly Recommended!

review/summary: I had to change my review.  No longer a good coffee (in my opinion)
review/text: Update to my review:  August 2012:  It appears they have changed the formula for this coffee.  It now tastes very thin to me.<br /><br />It used to have a good film of oil on the top after brewing (I don't know what that oil slick is called - but I see it on all the good coffee I drink).<br /><br />Anyway, oil spill is not there any more...<br /><br />Nor is the taste...<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />First Review...<br /><br />For my taste buds - this is it.  Rich and full - with no burnt taste.  'Hint' of sweet finish - i.e. not bitter.<br /><br />Hard to believe this is pod coffee.<br /><br />Five stars!<br /><br />------<br /><br />About my tastes...<br /><br />I have been drinking K-Cups for two years and tried about 2 dozen types of coffee.  Most recently, Timothy's Espresso, which I found it to be thin - and almost undrinkable (after my experience with Jet Fuel).<br /><br />I just order Black Tiger - but not in yet - so no comparison.<br /><br />Also, I often drink Newman's (my wife picks up at Sam's Club).  I thought that was pretty good until the Jet Fuel.  Newman's is fairly rich - but has a slightly over-roasted taste for me... again,compared to the Jet Fuel.

review/text: Jets don't leave the atmosphere, right? Well, this stuff will put you in orbit!<br /><br />I prefer a 60-cent cup of this to what $4 would buy at Starbucks. At that rate the savings will pay for the entire Keurig coffee maker in less than 10 weeks.<br /><br />The flavor is strong (but good), so you might want to add creamer to mitigate it.

review/text: I've been a huge fan K-Cups for the past 6 years at first I started buying from Bed Bath and Beyond but the selections were very few. So I decided to try something different and found Jet Fuel. The taste is amazing with a rich, strong bold flavour. Its very comparable to some of the Starbucks and Kona brand coffee but at half the price.

review/summary: Jet Fuel...the name says it all!
review/text: Out of all of the bold K-cup coffees that are available on Amazon, I drink only two.  Jet Fuel is one of them.  It is so smooth and flavorful, but without the bitterness that some bold coffees exhibit.  Coffee People has done a great job of formulating a coffee which will "kick-start" you in the morning, but I must confess that even if Jet Fuel was de-caf, I'd still drink it just for the exquisite flavor!

review/summary: The best K-cup so far!
review/text: We bought a Keurig for Christmas and have gone through the 80 cups that came with the machine along with well over a dozen cases of other flavors that have been 'highly recommended'.  Jet Fuel has been our favorite thus far.  In fact, we've reordered it twice already.<br /><br />That said, we prefer strong coffee.  Jet Fuel tastes perfect no matter which size you make.  There is NO bitterness or aftertaste that you find in some of the other k-cups.  I'm picky, I'd be the first to complain!<br /><br />If you like strong coffee, try Jet Fuel.  Other flavors that have been superior are: Green Mtn. Espresso (hubby alternates between these two), Emeril's Big Easy Bold, Revv, Timothy's Parisian Nights, and Paul Neumann's Organic EB.<br /><br />Donut House and Timothy's Midnight Magic were EB's that were highly rated, but I found them to have bitter/weird after tastes.  I have not enjoyed the flavored coffees at all.  GLoria Jean's Butter Toffee was particularly dissappointing.<br /><br />If I had to buy only one flavor of k-cup, Jet Fuel would be it.

The price was 37c but now is 47c per on Subscribe and Save and 56c otherwise.  Costco is selling at about 44 cents per.  Costco unfortunately does not sell Jet Fuel, but we may have to switch to Tully's if the Amazon price doesn't come back down.

The Jet Fuel is strong enough for my taste to allow me get away with this on one cup and not lose the flavor.  Works for me....

review/summary: Jet fuel
review/text: I like home made espresso, starbucks bold drip coffee and bold coffee that's not bitter. Jet fuel is bold, but not strong as home made over the gas range espresso or starbuck's bold drip. It is much smoother than black tiger though, and the strength is similar to black tiger. If you drink black tiger after jet fuel, you will definitely notice Black tiger's bitterness. When I use one jet fuel with 4oz water serving choice,  it gets pretty close to starbuck's.<br /><br />Before buying from amazon, I used to buy emeril's big easy, but jet fuel is stronger, and through coffee people and amazon's club, this is the cheapest way to purchase coffee for keurig machines. Cheaper than Costco or sams club.
