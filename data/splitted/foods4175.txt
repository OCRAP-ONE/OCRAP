review/summary: Great coffee!
review/text: I had this coffee in a restaurant and loved it so much that I order it through Amazon.  The dark roast is also quite good.  For the first two bags, the shipping was almost as much as the coffee, but if you order more the shipping costs don't increase, so it's best to order multiple packs.

review/text: I ordered this after having my first experience with Douwe Egberts at a local restaurant.<br />Although this isnt exactly the same (the restaurants use a concentrate that the machine measures precisely) it was damn good none the less.<br /><br />I'm not much of a coffee drinker because I hate the bitterness in most coffee's but this had no bitterness at all and was very smooth.<br /><br />I'll be ordering this again.

review/text: First, I LOVE Plum Organics products!  This is not a review against the company, just this particular flavor. Its not really a banana flavor to me. Very mild. The blueberry/purple sweet potato and strawberry/beet have the most flavor with apple/spinach being the third.  I'd say this is the 4th and the least flavorful is the mango/sweet potato.  My son still ate them but not as well as others.

review/summary: no taste at all
review/text: Bought diff flavors while the local store had them on sale. This is the first time I tried Plum's brand. I only opened the yellow one and the purple one. The yellow one is supposed to be banana and peach... Tastes like nothing but just rice waffle in star shapes. No banana or peach flavor or smell. I understand it is supposed to be organic but ORGANIC doesn't have to be tasteless. The purple one which is supposed to be purple potato and blueberry, which tastes like cough syrup. I drank water and still had the weird taste in my mouth. So disappointed. Will return the unopened one back to the store and try other brands instead.

review/summary: Power Puff for Digestive Health Leads the Pack!
review/text: Searching for a low-sugar wheat-free puff to offer my baby girls, I discovered Plum Organics with much joy. Clearly superior to all other major brands of baby puffs for digestive health, who's better than Plum for my family? I've successfully battled to contain a serious digestive disorder called Ulcerative Colitis for over a decade in part by special attention to diet. In that time I've learned even moderate amounts of wheat causes problems by creating an overgrowth of Candida yeast in my system. Some know this as a sensitivity to gluten or sugars, others suffer without realizing as so many foods contain wheat or high amounts of sugar. For me it's cumulative folks, a little in nearly everything really piles up. I notice my body getting too much as soon as I begin to heavily crave breads or sugars.  Before you know it, that gummy gluten renders me 90% incapable of absorbing nutrition altogether.<br /><br />Back to the Puffs... wheat is high in gluten, but the oat and rice based Puff offered by Plum Organics stands out with ingredients more gentle on digestive function. This is in addition to providing all the stuff HappyBaby remains conscious of, like sugar and vitamin content. Rice is gluten-free and minimally processed oat may be too, but many still leave it off the list of gluten-free foods due to typical cross-contamination issues with lots of wheat growing and processed alongside oats. Small amounts are ok with me anyway -- I'm looking for regulation rather than elimination here. So I'm happy to introduce all these foods to my daughters at healthy levels.<br /><br />How about the sugar content? Super low, and only natural organic fruit, vegetable or cane juice is used (not corn-syrup as another reviewer erroneously reported -- [...]). And can we really get upset about a little blueberry or sweet potato juice temporarily staining a cloth when you account for their health properties? Regulate, read the labels for yourself and take joy in offering your kids a simple, low sugar, high vitamin, low gluten snack.<br /><br />Oh and must say, I love that they're mainly just puffed air with a fantastic balance of nutrients. 1/2 cup or about 75 pieces per serving keeps my little dears engaged in motor development and feeding skills for a while without concern for dietary imbalance.<br /><br />Bunch of facts, all packed up to help someone out there enjoy a little extra peace next time they offer Plum Puffs to their kids.  Live well!

review/summary: Perfect drink on a warm day!
review/text: I was very skeptical about buying this as I have never been a fan of any tea. I decided to give this a shot as I was looking for some new k-cups for my maker and for a new drink as I was getting tired for my packets of flavor added to water. After reading several review I made the purchase. I am very glad that I did! I make this over ice but have learned by trial and error to find the perfect combination of a 16 oz double walled cut filled to the brim with ice. From there I make it on the middle setting. Some people say you can use the pod twice for tea but I only like to use it once and I like the full flavor.  This is a great drink with a good amount of flavor and taste even if you ate not a tea drinker, it is not too sweet either which I like as well.

review/summary: Good mix that everyone enjoyed
review/text: We tried this on vacation and everyone in the family ate it - even our picky daughter.  It made a great all in one dinner after we added browned sausage and steamed green beans.  The big seller was that it had no MSG listed in the ingredients.  Some of the ingredients contain components of MSG, but no MSG explicitly stated as an ingredient.  All the other mixes we looked at had MSG.  We also noticed that the Tony Chachere's yellow rice mix had no MSG.  We'll be trying that one next.

review/summary: A little too salty, but spiced just right
review/text: We love dirty rice and eat it often.  I got Tony Chachere's Dirty Rice Mix to try it, and was pleased with the Cajun seasonings.  I did find it too salty the first time (800+ mg sodium per small serving!), but the second time I added the water to the mix in a separate bowl, mixed to dissolve and then poured a little of the salty water off.  I added fresh water to make up what I poured off, then added it to the browned hamburger.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars if it hadn't been so salty.  As a comparison, Zatarain's Dirty rice has 600 mg sodium per serving, and Luzianne Dirty Rice has 680 mg per serving.

review/text: I usually try to glance at the ingredients list before posting about food products but I'm relieved to see that someone else has already verified that this contains no overt MSG (though the purveyors of chemical additives have a million euphemisms for it in an attempt to continue selling MSG).<br /><br />This cooks up in about half an hour, total time. Preparation is simple. Although the ingredients to be added list ground beef, I find that sausage works better. Still, I tried it with ground beef and if anything can make that boring staple edible, it's in this box.<br /><br />As you might expect, it's spicy, so I didn't even bother giving it to the kids. Their taste in food is limited, bland and boring. I am just done with having to settle for mac-n-bleah or rice-a-bleah anywhere on the plate so I cooked this for my wife and myself last night. I will be picking up more of this Tony Chachere's Dirty Rice even if I have to cook a batch and eat the leftovers for breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day. Matter of fact, I think I'll heat up some of last night's leftovers right now! Mmmmmmm!

review/summary: Very good hot sauce.
review/text: I first tasted this product at a local Mexican restaurant, and I was hooked.  Right after I left the restaurant, I went to my local grocery store and looked for this hot sauce, but to no avail.  I then though, maybe Amazon.com has it, I was right.  So I ordered two big bottles of it.  Everytime I went to a takeout Mexican restaurant I would use my Bufalo Chipotle Hot Sauce in stead of the restaurant's hot sauce.  Needless to say I love this hot sauce, and I would recomend any hot sauce lover to try this sauce at least, you owe it to yourself.

review/summary: A very HOT sauce lacking any other redeeming quality.  A vague hint of tomato with a bitter aftertaste.  Impossible to recommend
review/text: The Harbinger is one of the hottest chiles know to man.<br /><br />So it comes as no surprise that this Harbinger based sauce is quite hot - a few drops will go a long way. Yet, despite its considerable heat, it offers no other flavors beyond a vague hint of tomatoes combined with a very nasty and bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Ingredients - as copied from the label: Water, Harbinger pepper, tomato, salt, spices ... etc<br /><br />Conclusion: there is a LOT of heat in this sauce but little else --- except a vague hint of tomato and a very noticeable and bitter aftertaste!<br /><br />If you want even more heat (for some bizarre reason) there are other Habanero sauces where the Habanero chile is the major ingredient rather than water. There are also pepper extracts where gloves and eye protection are recommended if pure heat is what you are after.  I frankly don't understand the logic that hotter is always better but tastes vary.<br /><br />Conclusion:  High heat, a bitter aftertaste and a vague hint of tomato. NOT recommended.<br /><br />Watch out for high shipping costs from some sellers.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: Bought this at Costco - good stuff - tastes almost as good as the juice off of my lemon bushes in the backyard.  Read the ingredient list- no mention of grapefruit (or anything but 100 percent lemon juice) as a previous reviewer indicated.  If you like fresh squeezed lemon juice for your drinks or baking, this is a good way to go.

review/summary: Appears to be adulterated with grapefruit juice...
review/text: ...as this brand causes the same drug interactions as grapefruit juice, and Sicilian lemon juice is known to be adulterated in this manner to increase yields. Be very careful if you are using any drugs that bear grapefruit warnings - this product will be dangerous to you.

review/text: I received my order very quickly from the vendor, which was great. The brown rice itself is also of great quality, because coming from a family that only consumes brown rice, it tasted like the delicious brown rice back home. I would definitely order this product again once I am finished with my first order.

review/summary: So that's why they call it Holy Basil!
review/text: I've been adding Tulsi Tea to my diet.  I love the peppermint flavor and drink it daily along with my other great teas.<br /><br />I didn't really care for the flavor of this honey chamomile tea.  I don't think it was the honey flavor that was bothersome- actually the Tulsi just seemed at odds with the chamomile.  It actually tastes a bit like basil, which I hadn't experienced with the peppermint, I guess because the tastes meshed so well together.  In this cup, I actually felt like I was drinking Basil-Chamomile tea.<br /><br />I can say I've never tasted the anise flavor that people find prevalent in Tulsi teas.

review/text: Over the years we have tried fruit clubs from several different vendors.  Golden State is the best value for the money, hands down.  Fruit is ALWAYS of outstanding quality - superior to what can be purchased in the grocery store or even at the farmer's market.  Just bursting with juice and flavor.  Delivery has ALWAYS arrived timely and in excellent condition.  Fruit arrives either ripe and ready for immediate eating or just days away from being so.  Along with the fruit the company provides some information about the fruit and suggested recipes, as well as tips on how to keep the fruit in its prime condition so it can be enjoyed over several days' time.  Take it from someone who has tried three or four other vendors - Golden State is the best overall product, especially for the price!

review/text: HORMEL CHUNCK WHITE TURKEY IN WATER, 5-OUNCE, PACK OF 12, looks to be a tasty type of turkey.....for those who like white meat turkey.  I have nothing against them -- "chaque un a son gout", (or "each to his (or her) own taste") as the French say.  However, the DARK MEAT TURKEY, (and also the DARK MEAT CHICKEN), lovers in this country, (and probably in other countries too), have definitely been given short-shrift by the food industry today!  DARK MEAT TASTES BETTER....at least to me.  Yes, Dark Meat DOES have a few more calorie -- but what of it?  Calories can be cut in many, many ways -- and to me, giving up DARK meat turkey, (or chicken), should NOT HAVE TO BE ONE OF THEM!  Please, food industry execs -- give us DARK MEAT lovers a chance, and make more products with DARK MEAT!  (At the supermarket, I buy DOZENS of Honeysuckle White GROUND DARK MEAT turkey -- but will NOT TOUCH the light ground meat, as to me, flavour is just NOT IN white meat!)<br /><br />Thanks for reading this!  Hope it helps the legions of DARK MEAT turkey and chicken lovers out there, (and also raises profits for food companies, who hopefully will now cater to this "forgotten clientele" -- of which I am one!)

Great news!!! He found them.  We immediately ordered a case of them.  I'm happy and my family is happy.  Our tradition continues once again.  Thank you!!!!!

review/text: These crackers are nearly perfect. I generally don't like multi-grain or whole-grain foods, but even though these are marked as such, they taste great! The texture is also perfect, not too dry, not too soft. They don't fall apart when you try and spread cheese or other toppings on them like some crackers.<br /><br />My only con is that the crackers are quite huge--about two and a half inches in diameter--bigger than any toppings I could think of putting on them. When I ate these crackers with summer sausage and cheese, I had to break them in half (they are not designed to be broken in half) to have the proper meat-to-cheese-to-cracker ratio.<br /><br />Give them a try; I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.

review/summary: Excellent Matcha for Beginners!
review/text: There are so many good things to say about this matcha as well as this company.  Let's start with how awesome Red Leaf Tea is.<br /><br />The customer service is prompt and friendly.  They listen to your suggestions and opinions and take action to please their customers.  It's a sad world when decent customer service is a novelty, but Red Leaf Tea brings some joy back into a bleak world with their courtesy.  Thank you, Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />Now, this matcha...it's great for beginners!  The price is perfect and you get a good amount of tea so you can experiment with  how you like to drink it.  The basic flavors here are sweet, green and minerally.  THe texture is pretty smooth with only a hint of a powdery texture.  It's a pleasing beverage hot, prepared in the traditional way.  Yes, the quality isn't the best, but it is definitely a good introduction.  It is not bitter at all and completely inoffensive.  I used to be scared of preparing my own matcha because the one time I did it before Red Leaf, it was with a horrible matcha that was extremely bitter.  Now I make myself matcha drinks all the time!<br /><br />After trying this tea the traditional way to fully appreciate the flavors you're working with, you can use the powder to add flavor and healthiness to pretty much anything!  Like the Starbucks green tea latte?  Now you can make your own at a fraction of the cost!  Breakfast smoothie need a healthy caffeine kick?  BAM! Starter Matcha to the rescue!  Want some green tea cookies to go with your green tea latte?  You know where I'm going with this.  :)<br /><br />My favorite way to have this matcha right now is to add it to my Almond milk, banana smoothie.  It was also awesome in my amaretti cookies.  :)<br /><br />Conclusion?  Highly recommended!

review/summary: JUST WONDERFUL!
review/text: Everyone in my family tasted these with a bit of fear in their eyes - but everyone ended up loving them and we ate 2 bags the first evening!  They are small bags, but worth every penny.  Healthy and tasty, a cross between a wheat cracker and a tortilla chip with the added sweetness of the carrots, but with salt - sounds strange, but it REALLY is good!

review/summary: Unique and delicious!
review/text: These chips used to be carried at our local health food store. I sampled some before buying because products like this are expensive. I loved them from the first bite, but I understand that for some this flavor would not appeal. I'm now ordering them from amazon and I have no trouble with the large quantity. If it's a new treat for you, I'd say start with a small amount to see if you like them. If you have expectations for how they will taste, you may be surprised. I can't liken them to any other chip. Truly a unique flavor.

review/text: If you like pineapple flavor in smoothies. snow cones, mixed drinks, this is the stuff you are looking for. Great natural taste. Not quite yellow color.  Brownish yellow color,like real pineapple.  Pour out some in a glass, add a little water and yellow food dye and you have perfect yellow pinapple smoothie.  This stuff is concentrated and  potent.  A liitle amount is all that you will need for the flavor.Very sweet and high calories.

review/summary: New favorite!!
review/text: I came across this coffee recently on amazon after shopping for Cafe du Monde coffee with chicory and some Keurig K cups. Somehow or another this coffee popped up on the bottom of the page and I clicked and read the reviews. Decided I would give it a try before purchasing another can of Cafe du Monde or any of those weak tasting k cups. I have always noticed the coffee in Kroger and was alsways hesitant on getting it. When Cafe du Monde was no longer available locally and I live too far to go to the local Asian market, I started getting it here. Well, let's just say I am very glad Chock full o'Nuts was introduced to me!!! Oh my, I was hooked after the first cup. You can clearly see the major difference when you pour it! So dark and rich, nothing can compare to it! I purchased a small can that day just to try, I mean let's be honest who wants to spend $12 on a can of coffee that you may hate. After that morning cup, I went back to Kroger and picked up 4 of those large cans and have been brewing away ever since. I have a Keurig brewer and will be brewing this coffee instead of all the other weak coffees I have ordered.

review/summary: By far the best mass produced coffee
review/text: I've tried nearly every single mass produced preground coffee from terrible cups like maxwell house and folgers swill to nicer espresso roasts and I've found that this is by far the best mass produced blend on the shelf. I only buy the small cans so it stays fresher, there is no question that grinding the beans yourself is the best way, but sometimes we don't have time for that and this is where this coffee really shines.  The cans are made of metal and vaccuum sealed with a metal piece of foil to lock in that freshness--Sara Lee always makes a quality product.<br /><br />I make my coffee with just under boiling filtered water poured into a coffee press, stir to bring up the froth, and steep for 4 minutes before pressing.  I drink it black or with a bit of real heavy cream for a different flavor.  The New York Roast is amazing and my favorite, it's a dark and smokey flavor with not a hint of bitterness--Starbucks doesn't have anything that's even close to as good as this coffee.  This coffee is also good in drip machines, but the real secret to good coffee is throwing the drip machines out and making either a 12 hour cold brew or pressed coffee--it can take a mediocre cup to a good cup and a good cup to an amazing cup.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you aren't interested in spending big bucks on coffee, you owe it to yourself to try this coffee.

review/text: This is by far the best manufactured coffee. It's been New York's coffee for decades.  It's rich and robust. It's also much cheaper than the premium labels. And no, it DOES NOT contain any nuts! The name comes from the fact that the creator owned a nut shop prior to coming up with the coffee! The only thing I miss is the plastic scoop that used to come in every can. I have a couple that are decades old I'm sure.

I have a Keurig machine but I have the insert so I can still use this coffee.  Wish they would put it in K-cups.  You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Best Medium Blend Coffee On The Market
review/text: My family has been drinking Chock full o' Nuts for years now and it is certainly the best mild/medium coffee on the market. Good flavor, NO BITTER AFTERTASTE, and the you can find it fairly cheaply in most grocery stores. The Original and City Blends are good for those who prefer a more mild coffee, while the the Columbian variety has a deeper, richer flavor for those who like their coffee a bit stronger. I'm not normally much of a coffee drinker but I can drink this stuff black thanks to its mild but pleasant taste. We always serve this to guests and always get asked what kind of coffee we use. Sure to please any coffee lover.

review/summary: My Favorite Coffee
review/text: I was introduced to this coffee a couple of years ago at a friend's house and I've been buying it ever since.  Sometimes I buy 8-o'clock coffee at the grocer's and grind it in the store, but I much prefer Chock Ful O Nuts Original Blend. The house smells heavenly while it's brewing and I am very pleased with all aspects of taste, strength, and smell - I don't care for weak tasting or bitter coffee.  I once bought a 33.9 oz can of this coffee from Walmart and the taste was "off" - not as great as usual.  I called Chock Ful O nuts in New York and spoke to customer service and they sent me two coupons in the mail for the 33.9 oz or small bags and I replaced it with two of the 33.0 oz cans.  Love it love it love it!!<br /><br />To those who complain about the price, it's not unreasonable on Amazon to pay a higher price that includes shipping.  Locally I buy it at Target and look for sales at my local grocery store.

review/summary: The best coffee in the consumer market.
review/text: Meaning that you can walk down to the store and pick this up by the lb.<br /><br />Chock Full O'Nuts is the KING! There's not even a close second, maybe JFG<br />Special but even JFG takes a big backseat to this magic stuff. Full bodied,<br />magnificent flavor, an almost sweet aftertaste, and very consistent from one<br />can to the next. If you hassle with grinding your own beans and paying for<br />exotic and expensive coffee, you may want to try this on a day when you're<br />rushed and don't have time for all that.<br /><br />I've been drinking this stuff for over 20 years, and still miss the "Gourmet"<br />that was pulled from the market in 92'. Bring it back is all I can say, but<br />until then I'll keep drinking what I can find locally. BTW, "smart shoppers"<br />can find this in their back yard for under $10.

review/summary: There Is No One 'Mole.'
review/text: 'Mole' is a generic term for a very wide variety of sauces found throughout Mexico. They can be very spicy and very mild. They can contain a few or a great many ingredients. Most people think that Mole has to contain chocolate, but that really isn't so. Some Moles are very complex with up to 50 different ingredients including such things as banana, pumpkin seeds, etc.<br /><br />This fairly simple Mole is made with figs and a cocoa and is not overly spicy, but quite mild to my taste, but I like spicy food. I've used it on fish and the sweet and smokey taste works very well.<br /><br />I've traveled all over Mexico and eaten all sorts of Moles. Some I do not really care for; for example most of the Mole on the Yucatan is too 'complex' for my taste. This one is excellent for a bottled Mole and I recommend it.

review/summary: Crunching with a Smile!
review/text: Enjoy Life Foods sent us four boxes of their new crunchy cookies to taste test. Dr. J now recognizes their label! He wanted to taste test the Double Chocolate first, and of course this chocoholic mommy did not protest!<br /><br />Remember, Enjoy Life Foods products are free of the top 8 food allergens. Could that kind of product make a double chocolate cookie that tastes "real"?<br /><br />Um, YES! My mouth waited for the rice aftertaste, but it couldn't find one. Enjoy Life Foods created a chocolate taste on par with homemade, and the crunch satisfied! The boys loved them, as you can see, but I was elated! I confess I hid the rest of the box and saved them for me, though guilt did kick in later and I shared one more with them, ha!<br /><br />Now, it would have been very easy to gorge ourselves and eat all four boxes at once, but I needed to test these cookies on a non gluten- and dairy-free eater...Daddy! The next night we had another taste test, this time trying two cookies: Chocolate Chip and Vanilla Honey Graham. Again the boys loved them! And Daddy? My pickiest taste tester of all things allergy-friendly? What was his verdict?<br /><br />Good! He preferred the chocolate chip, but said the Vanilla Honey Graham was decent. There's an ever-so-slight after taste to the graham cookies, but Meatball didn't seem to mind!<br /><br />If you've been counting, there is one more flavor left--Sugar Crisp. Now, I grew up with a Type 1 diabetic mom. The sugar cookies she made were reduced sugar, and I loved them. Most other sugar cookies were always too sweet for me. I figured this would be the case as well, and Daddy and Meatball would get the bulk of the sugar cookies.<br /><br />Wrong! When I bit into my first Sugar Crisp, I was amazed. There was a buttery flavor to it. I grabbed the box--was there some mistake? Was dairy hidden there and somehow Enjoy Life Foods missed it, marketed it wrong? What were the ingredients? How did they get that flavor?<br /><br />I don't know! But there's still no dairy in there! The Sugar Crisp had just the right sweetness, and of course the same satisfying crunch. I ate a lot of them. At first Dr. J didn't want them because they looked a whole lot like another sugar cookie he had tried and not liked. I asked him to please try a bite, and of course he didn't like them. However, after two days of watching Mommy and Meatball eat them, he finally gave them another taste, and was quite happy to consume some himself!<br /><br />I think we can happily say Enjoy Life Foods Crunchy Cookies will definitely be a back up plan for when Mommy forgot to make cookies and we need to take a treat somewhere. My flavor preferences in order were: Double Chocolate, Chocolate Chip and Sugar Crisp tied (seriously, who would have thought!), and finally the Vanilla Honey Graham. Some of you will be able to find them in your local allergy-friendly grocery stores now, and some of you will need to be watching (and ASKING) for them as Enjoy Life Foods continues to get them into the market. You all have my permission to eat two Double Chocolate cookies when you get them--one for you, and one for me!<br /><br />Enjoy Life Foods sent us their Crunchy Cookies for taste testing and honest review. All opinions, and cookie crumbs in the keyboard, are my own. You can learn more about these cookies and their other new products here at their website. I also want to thank them for donating crunchy cookies to our Southeast Michigan Spectrum Moms family picnic in May.
