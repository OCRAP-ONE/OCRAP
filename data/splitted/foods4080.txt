review/summary: a good tea, hot or cold
review/text: I was looking for a mellow green tea that I could drink on a daily basis either hot or cold. This one fits the bill. It is neither bitter or grassy tasting like a lot of other green teas that I've tried. I balked at buying a 6 pack, but now I'm glad I did since I'm down to the the last box and have not seen this blend at my grocery with the other Stash teas.

review/summary: Stunning Flavor and Antioxidants Too
review/text: Flavorful and full-bodied, this tea is made from green tea leaves flavored with a hint of pomegranate and raspberry.  It is caffeinated but does not bother me at all the way caffeine in coffee does.  A civilized way to start the morning.  And Subscribe & Save makes it a bargain!

review/text: I love this tea, but I find the new box design annoying.  I don't really like the photos on the boxes and I have gotten two different types, this one and the Hazelnut one and both of them had flaps that ripped and they don't stand upright like the other style did, the old style with no picture.  I don't know why this is, but it bothers me enough to tell others about it.

review/text: This is one of my favorite teas.  Stash's mix of green tea and chai spice is the best I have found.  It is aromatic, yet milder than regular chai.  Tastes great both plain and with milk. This deal on Amazon is by far the cheapest way to buy it, especially if you "subscribe and save."  I drink this almost every day during the fall and winter, so it is a great opportunity to stock up.  If you enjoy green tea, this is a must have.

review/summary: My favorite iced tea!
review/text: I've never had an iced tea that I like better, and I LOVE iced tea.  I make it in an iced tea maker using a little less ice/water than the markings on the carafe, and I use 6 tea bags which produces just slightly less than 2 quarts.  When it is done brewing, pour it over ice and be sure to squeeze in a little lemon which rounds out the flavors - it makes it the perfect beverage.  The fact that it is healthy is just a bonus!!  (If you don't have an iced tea maker, it's a really worthwhile, inexpensive investment if you drink a lot of tea)

review/summary: Good tea blend. Not 'the best there is' but it's more than decent
review/text: The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this line of teas, you are just a tiny little bit above the average 'value' curve. The Stash Premium teas are not my 'number one' white teas but they are a solid 'number two'. The kind I drink almost like I drink water, several cups a day.<br /><br />I drink the Green-White (this one) and the 'all-white' versions alternatively for a little variation. They are both good and this combination reminds me that I used to be an all-green tea drinker until some 2-3 years ago when I switched to all-white. Now... I'm in a more moderate mood :)<br /><br />Oh, I subscribed for one box delivered every other month. This takes another 15% of the price and you get free shipping even when you are under the $25 limit. And you can cancel any time.

review/summary: Best Tea Ever!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this tea.  I am a huge iced tea drinker (more than a quart a day).  I have tried lots of different brands over the years and gradually gotten into lighter and lighter tasting teas.  For many years my tea of choice was darjeeling, which is the cadillac of teas; very light and refreshing.  Then one day I sampled this green and white combination and WOW.  It is light, refreshing, and since it is green, also good for me!  I've been hooked every since.  I even bought special mugs (16 ounces) so I can drink a decent amount and not have to refill so often.  Occasionally I see it in the grocery store but they can't keep it in stock (so the word must be out how wonderful this tea is!).  I now get my fix through Amazon's service where they send 6 boxes every other month.  I don't have to worry about 'when' the grocery is going to get their next shipment anymore.  So if you enjoy a light tea give this one a try.  I am sure you will be very, very pleased at the refreshing taste.

review/text: I really wanted to like this tea because it is full of antioxidants. I was hoping for a fruity flavor, but instead it tastes just like cough syrup. I do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child, so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine, I can not drink it. I tried to drink it anyways, thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti-oxidants outweigh the flavor, but I just couldn't do it! Well, that is just my 2 cents. If anyone else has tried this and agrees with me, let me know!

review/summary: Astringent, weak tea
review/text: I didn't really care for this tea that much. I've been trying out teas to find which ones I like, I've tried about 30 so far. I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time, then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried.

review/summary: Stash Premium Green - The Best Of The Best
review/text: After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!

review/summary: Not as good as I had hoped
review/text: I've been hooked on NOW's spearmint tea for awhile, and when that was unavailable for a time, I found this. I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6.

review/summary: Very good blend of primarily green tea
review/text: Both my best friend and I LOVE this tea.  Embarrassingly, we are quasi-tea snobs each in our own way.  We have tried all forms, brands, etc including the very pricey varieties, and we agreed that for a white/green blend this is perfect.  It is not too mild or smooth, nor is it too astringent or bitter.  It is a nice golden color with a tempting, soothing aroma.  It has good mouth feel - light but not too light.  It is very good plain or with some honey.<br />It contains white, green blend (Chinese, Japanese, Darjeeling and Assam from India, and organic green from Sri Lanka).  It is really a very nice tea.  Please note that of the teas that are blended into each sachet, only one is organic.

Ease of ordering and shipping generally excellent.

review/summary: Better than decent tea blend, affordable, not top of the line
review/text: The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this line of teas, you are just a tiny little bit above the average 'value' curve. The Stash Premium teas are not my 'number one' white teas but they are a solid 'number two'. The kind I drink almost like I drink water, several cups a day.<br /><br />I drink the Green-White (this one) and the 'all-white' versions alternatively for a little variation. They are both good and this combination reminds me that I used to be an all-green tea drinker until some 2-3 years ago when I switched to all-white. Now... I'm in a more moderate mood :)<br /><br />Oh, I subscribed for one box delivered every other month - check the grocery section if you are interested and the option is not available on this page. This takes another 15% of the price and you get free shipping even when you are under the $25 limit. And you can cancel any time.

At zero calories, it is the perfect snack to get me over a craving, and decadent enough to feel like a treat. I love this tea and will definitely order more. If you want to add steamed milk, I would recommend you stick with the black chai tea- it is a bit too much for the green.

review/text: I always buy Bigelow's green tea (which aside from the need to use two teabags per cup due to weakness, is satisfactory). Still, I thought I'd give Stash's a go. I immediately knew that I would soon regret doing so when I opened the first tea packet-the smell! Like a stagnant swamp! To make matters worse, it taste like what I would imagine swamp water would taste like. Honey doesn't do much to improve upon the flavor, either. Perhaps this is what people mean when they describe a green tea as "grassy"? At any rate, I won't be revisiting this one.

Recently, I ordered green tea in a restaurant and was served Bigelow, which is a good brand.  I put the Bigelow tea bag in the cup of hot water and then took a Stash green tea bag out of my purse and put it into the glass decanter of hot water.  This was a good comparison...the Bigelow tea was brownish in color, the Stash tea a beautiful, clear GREEN.  My husband commented, "that is why it is called green tea!"

review/summary: My favorite Green Tea
review/text: I used to drive to an out of the way grocery store for Stash Moroccan Mint.  When they stopped carrying it I  was so upset!  It did a hard core internet search and finally found out I could order from Amazon in bulk.  Yay! I drink green tea for the health benefits, and have been drinking various kinds for about ten years now.  Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha! One more thing, I replaced green tea with coffee and it was not a difficult switch.  If I can do it, you can too!

review/summary: Very nice green tea blend, fine flavor, great value
review/text: ****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its caffeine effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas.  White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the bulk packaging of six tea boxes, for an incredible Amazon price break!<br /><br />****

review/summary: Very good for what it is
review/text: We've been "product testing" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama "Sushi Bar" tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea "taste" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. "Sushi Bar"-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.<br /><br />As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However, it's idiot-proof and, like the title alludes to, this is teabag tea and for that, the Stash is very good stuff.

review/summary: overpowering lemon grass
review/text: This tea sounded great. I lived in the middle east and love the real moroccan mint tea. The real tea includes spearmint and green tea only. Honey is typically added. In this case all you can taste is lemon grass and the only hint of mint is peppermint, not spearmint. I really regret buying a whole case of this stuff. I would highly recommend buying Twinnings green tea with mint. It doesn't have "Moroccan mint" as a title, but it is a lot closer to the original namesake. Stash has a little bit of false advertising going on here. It should really be called lemon grass green tea with a picture of lemon grass on the box. It is anything but Moroccan.

review/summary: As far as bagged teas goes, this is DELICIOUS
review/text: The taste and smell essence of Jasmine is aromatic and wonderful, and the green tea portion is not bitter at all, but rich, a bit nutty (as far as green tea nuttiness goes), and slightly smooth (especially when combined with the wonderful Jasmine aroma).<br /><br />I've also been able to re-steep the same tea bag about three times in a row using about 2 cups each time (this is USEFUL information for you cheap folks).

review/text: I drink this tea almost everyday with a bit of lemon. It never fails to satisfy. I used to drink straight green tea but the grass-clipping flavor eventually began to nauseate me.  I'm glad to have found this tasty alternative.

review/summary: Soft, Lovely Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea has a fragrant bouquet, and an unusual taste that comes from the blend of red tea and white tea. The red tea taste is more dominant, the white tea taste subtle. I have to say that I like the red and white blend more than the red alone. I still probably prefer white tea more, but this blend is lovely, and lower in caffeine (the red tea has no caffeine, the white tea a bit). This tea contains only South African rooibos (another word for red tea) and white tea.<br /><br />The package says that it contains a hint of sweetness, and I'd agree, although the taste is very hard to describe (if you've had red tea before then you understand). The package also says that this tea is full of "potent antioxidants", which of course is very healthy.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea unless you do not care for rooibos or white tea; otherwise you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Very tasty - Could it also help me lose weight?
review/text: I got this after reading about a study that said four cups of white tea a day - and no other changes to diet or exercise - could result in 4 to 8 lbs of weight loss in a year, and would actually reduce the number of fat cells in a person's body!  The study suggested that green tea was also good for weight loss, but not as good as white.  (http://www.naturalnews.com/026220.html is one article about the study, but Google it and you'll find lots."<br /><br />So?  I split the difference and got both.<br /><br />For those that think that four cups of tea is a lot?  You're right.  But this tea is mild enough, and tasty enough, that I've been doing it for over a week and haven't gotten sick of it yet.  We'll see if that keeps up!

review/summary: Delicious green tea
review/text: The trouble with many mint teas is that the minty flavoring overpowers the underlying tea leaves. Too often, mint is used to make inferior tea taste palatable. Stash's Mint Green Tea is different. It has a rich and well-rounded flavor, which I prefer to that of their flowery plain green tea. And the price is quite reasonable for such a refreshing beverage, especially if you use Amazon's Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />As the weather warms up, this versatile tea is well-suited to both hot and iced brewing. I would recommend it over any other bagged tea.

review/summary: Wonderful mix of green tea and chai flavor
review/text: I like drinking green tea for the health benefits, but I find that many are either boring-tasting or bitter, especially without the addition of added sugar.  Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.  Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!

review/text: Before trying this tea I'd been drinking the packets my husband brought home from Japan. The stash had the same nutty flavor of the good japanese green tea but the bags were fragile and leaked tea leaf into the cup. Just a personal pet peeve. I bought the Stash green tea based on a review I read in Men's Health magazine that rated Stash as having the highest level of anti oxidents (and Caffeine) in those tested.

review/summary: Nice mild minty tea, actually makes an enjoyable cup.
review/text: I've been tasting along several green tea's trying to find one that I liked.<br />I was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks. One would be too strong, the other too bland.<br />I think the spearmint in this tea adds an really nice note with the peppermint and lemongrass, making it actually enjoyable rather than a necessary evil.<br />I found the mint to be nicely pronounced, and the lemongrass to be only barely detectable, with a little bit of honey it's really good.<br />So if you're looking for a way to incorporate green tea into your daily routine, and like me you like it mildly paired with mint. Then give this tea a shot.<br />(I do agree that maybe you should try with a single box first, so that you're not stuck with 6 if your palate is more refined than mine)

review/text: I am not a very big fan of green tea. I have always found the flavor to be a bit strong. I have had real Moroccan mint tea and found that to be a bit strong as well (in the mint direction). This tea was the perfect mild blend of both for me. And because it is all natural (no artificial or "natural" flavorings) I have been able to drink it every other day on my detox.<br /><br />Please Note: I did not purchase through Amazon. I purchased a box at Target. I would recommend trying it before investing in 6 boxes. I do plan to order this offer thru Amazon once my current box is depleted.

review/text: I do not find this tea to be overly sweet and I take it hot or cold without any sweetener. I prefer it hot I find, but have tried it iced and found it to be quite pleasant.  This tea has a lightly fruity taste.  There are many ingredients, which I have found to be true of all of Stash's herbal teas.  To fear the ingredients, they are all top quality and marry well.  I wondered what "goji berry flavor" was and contacted the company.  Here is a transcript:<br /><br />Email reply from Stash when asked about goji berry flavor:<br /><br />Unfortunately it's proprietary information with our suppliers; however we do require natural statements from our suppliers. We use the Code of Federal Regulations as far as our definition of natural<br /><br />According to the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), the term natural flavor means "the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive,  protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juices, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible years, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in t food is flavoring rather than nutritional."<br /><br />There you have it, essential oil of goji berry.  Not so mysterious after all.  I recommend getting the superfruit sampler where you get to try this flavor and five others.  I have found them all to be outstanding and go back for more all the time.

review/summary: Clean and subtle rather than grassy, a stand-out flavor in a crowded field
review/text: I drink STASH PREMIUM MOROCCAN MINT GREEN TEA all day with no adverse "overdose" effects from caffeine.  The flavor is not grassy like some green teas, but very clean.  I don't normally like mint taste in anything other than gum or toothpaste, but this mint is subtle and goes great with the clean taste of the tea.  Besides green tea, the ingredients are spearmint, lemongrass, and peppermint.  Lemongrass is another ingredient that can be overwhelming, but if it's truly in there, I can't taste it.  So as I write this, I am realizing it contains a lot of flavors that shouldn't work for me, but they do!  In fact, I enjoy it so much, I get a little anxious if I let myself run low.  It's a great thing to be able to order it in bulk from Amazon.<br /><br />I do want to note that the tea can get a little bitter if steeped too long.  I try to go no longer than five minutes, but I often forget about it at work.  For me, it's drinkable but noticeable.  On the other hand, I'm not an aficionado.  I don't worry about the temperature of the water I use to brew the tea.  At home, I use the hot water that comes out of my Keurig coffee maker; at work, I use the hot water out of the filtered water dispenser.  As evidenced by the amount I consume, the flavor comes out great!
