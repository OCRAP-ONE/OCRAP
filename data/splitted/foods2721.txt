review/summary: Very Good Product
review/text: Great taste and texture. Bought this on a whim and didn't think it would be as good as Oat Meal due to the higher fiber content (but did it any way given it's healthier). I actually prefer it to Oat Meal after my first bowl. Strongly recommended!

review/summary: Rich, mellow flavor; not clumpy; lots of fiber; no gas
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Cereal can be described in both flavor and texture as somewhat akin to cream of wheat. It is also darker than and tastes richer than Quaker Oat Bran Cereal which, I believe, contains some of the whole oat making it pastier and clumpier. Quaker's oat bran cereal cooks very much the same way that steel cut oats cook which have been ground in a coffee grinder; i.e. very clumpy. Bob's Red Mill Oat Bran cereal clumps a lot less and does not taste pasty. It is a very good cereal and very high in fiber. Furthermore, I eat it twice per day without any unwanted digestive fireworks, whereas the equivalent of oatmeal or steel cut oats would, to say the least, overwhelm. I highly recommend this cereal.

review/summary: Better than expected (and I always have high expectations for Bob's Red Mill products)
review/text: Texture of the cooked product is simply wonderful. Despite the instructions on the back I double the cook time (to about 5 mins.) so it gets more creamy. This is an oat bran, so you shouldn't expect much flavor, but I usually add a tablespoon of maple syrup during cooking, throw some fruit on top afterwards and it is beyond good. Btw, I use milk to cook it in, not water. I only bought this a day ago, but I'm already loving it. Oh, and it's ridiculously cheap too (for what you get).

review/summary: Oatbran reduces LDL cholesterol
review/text: Many 'health foods' are controversial, do they really improve your health? Not oatbran. All doctors and medical tests have shown oatbran reduces 'bad' types of cholesterol. You have to eat lots of it, a half cup a day some studies show.<br /><br />The easiest method is switching to homemade bread. Pure oatbran is not a good flour because it will not 'raise' nearly as much as say white wheat flour. The reasonable method to use it is to substitute oat bran cereal for other flours directly, volume per volume. We have done this for years at our house in all bread recipes. We use 1/2 oatbran and 1/2 white flour. For odd number amounts we use the extra number of oatbran (example: 5 cups of flour called for in recipe, we use 2 cups white 3 cups oatbran cereal).<br /><br />Bread takes time and kneading so our homemade bread is really biscuits. We use store-bought bread for sandwiches and homemade biscuits for everything else.<br /><br />=======================<br />Offtopic bonus:<br /><br />Here is our daily recipe for 6 biscuits made in toaster oven in 6 cup pan.<br /><br />1/2 cup white flour<br />3/4 cup oatbran cereal<br />1/2 teaspoon sugar<br />1/8 teaspoon salt<br />2 teaspoons baking powder<br />3 ounces milk<br />1 egg<br />1 tablespoon cooking oil<br />some spray-on non stick oil<br /><br />spray pan cups with spray-on oil<br />bake 20 minutes 425 degrees.<br /><br />chopped nuts, vanilla flavoring, nutmeg, cinnamon etc<br />can be used to flavor.<br /><br />salt, sugar substitutes can be used (healthier?)<br /><br />2 eggwhites instead of 1 whole egg can be used (healthier).<br /><br />Powder milk and egg powder allows storage out of a refrigerator and for camping trips.<br /><br />PAM is too thin to stick to cup sides,<br />all other brands spray-on oil tried are<br />thicker and sticks very well.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran works astoundingly well!
review/text: When my husband and I started the Dukan Diet from dukandiet.com we were told to buy Oat Bran and eat a couple tablespoons of it every morning. So we did.  The results were and still are amazing. The necessary fiber that we receive from this product is just right for our bodies to react the right way.  The Oat Bran is filling and provides that fuller feeling of satiety for hours until lunchtime.  We both are very pleased with the flavor of the Oat Bran and a half packet of Splenda.  It's a perfect combination, gentle on your stomach and bowels, a pleasant alternative to sugars and is much more healthy for you than any other Oat Brans out there that we've tried - and we've tried quite a few.  We now buy this product in boxes of 4 bags each and have no intentions of stopping its daily use, even after the diet is done.  Thanks to the company that makes it, thanks to Dr. Pierre Dukan for the knowledge on using it, and thanks to Amazon.com for recommending it with the purchase of the Dukan Diet book.

review/summary: a quality product cheaper on Amazon then in health food stores
review/text: The Amazon price can't be beat because four plastic bags cost nearly eighteen dollars in the specialty health food stores and only about half that if you take the annual subscription on Amazon to have them automatically mailed to your home each month and faithfully stay with it until the price drops. A very healthy product which may take some effort at home to transfer to regular containers to keep the supply fresh after opening the plastic bags, and also to soak in water before cooking, but is more than worth it for the special ingredients which are hard to find outside commercial food supplements if you seek them elsewhere.

review/text: This is my favorite oat bran, and I've tried many many brands. I like that this is a slightly larger bran flake, so it doesn't get so mushy when you cook it. I've had some brands where the bran is practically powder, so when you cook it, it turns to wallpaper paste. This is not that kind! It really holds its own, and I eat it every day: in the morning, mixed with Scottish oats, and I also use it to make my own granola. Love it!

review/text: My goodness. For me, this is one of the great discoveries in my life. I've been trying to get my fiber some way. I've been forcing myself oatmeal for all these years, rolled oats, steal cut, you name it. I eat whole wheat pasta which gives me some fiber and eat beans occasionally but how I longed for something that was quick and easy and provided the fiber I needed. Well guess what. This isn't just quick and easy. Bob's Oat Bran is like eating dessert. A delicacy you never get tired of. And it's EXTREMELY good for you. What's the catch you say. No catch. Just plain incredible goodness that will improve your life.

Then I add Splenda and a little Silk - yum!

review/text: I've recently bought this oat cereal cause buying them at the supermarket was getting too expensive, since I basically eat it everyday. I personally don't bake it. I like to eat it together with my cereal, generally granola. It tastes really good (this oat, so don't expect much of its taste), although not the most appropriate since it's not old-fashioned oats. Being almost like a powder it sometimes sticks to the bowl and makes it a little annoying to bring them back together with the milk and the cereal. I'll probably be buying this product again, since it's cheap for how much you get of it.

review/text: I absolutely love this product. Plus, it's good for you too! I find the price on Amazon better than the groceries stores. You can't go wrong...either way you win! The flavor is great alone or you can add whatever you like. I eat it for breakfast every morning, which is the most important meal of the day. (so don't skip it)I have it with maple syrup or yogurt...YUM...I love this stuff and just can't get enough of it! I highly recommend it.

review/summary: What's Not To Love?
review/text: This is so amazingly good, nutritious, super fast and easy to prepare, and the price is right.  I'm a diehard "steel cut oats" fan, but this is SO much faster to prepare anytime of day or night.  I add whole flaxseed to mine right before eating, which gives it a wonderful nutty crunch, substantial texture and extra health benefits.  Sometimes I pour a bit of Premier Whey Protein drink (vanilla, premixed, easy to use, available at Costco and/or Sam's) for more complete nutrition, sometimes a bit of fruit.  Really LOVE this stuff!  It's hard NOT to overdo it.<br /><br />Even cooking just one humble little Tablespoon of this (in 1/4 cup water) in the microwave works well, is super-fast, and a satisfying meal or snack when adding flaxseed or a high-protein whey drink to it.<br /><br />All that, plus its extremely versatile--use it raw, or make muffins, add to baked goods, soups or stews,

review/summary: Oatmeal that makes you want to wake up to eat breakfast
review/text: First, I think the instructions that they give you on how to make the oatmeal ("Oat Bran if you wanna get technical on me") in the microwave is bogus because it exploded on me pretty massively while it was heating up in the microwave.But, that's not really what matters.<br /><br />This oatmeal is definitely healthier tasting than the Quaker Oatmeal that I eat on a normal basis. I'm already fully convinced to switch over and though it kind of tastes like Grits, I some how like it a lot. The texture is a lot softer than other oatmeals and I think the Fiber per serving is 7g, which is pretty dang good.<br /><br />I will continue to get this oatmeal until something better comes along.

review/text: This is truly delicious; and it's quick and easy to prepare. I make it with water, almond milk, sugar, salt, cinnamon and vanilla. Then I top it with strawberries, raisins or slices of banana.<br /><br />Years ago I used to order an oat cereal from a gourmet shop that tasted very similar to this. I had tried to duplicate it but nothing came close until I found this oat bran.  I love the smooth texture. It tastes like oatmeal and a bran muffin rolled into one.

review/text: I know, oat bran doesn't sound appealing.  Trust me, you'll like it.  This stuff is creamy like grits, but has a lot of fiber.<br />I have it with maple syrup, pinch of salt, milk, walnuts, and raisins/fresh apples.  Just throw everything into the microwave and heat until the milk bubbles up.<br />Note that as it cools, it will get thicker.  So, experiment and add a bit more milk before heating to keep it runnier.<br /><br />Better than oatmeal!

Once it's chilled, I cut it into 9 servings (3 rows x 3 rows), and then I can easily remove one serving at a time to reheat in the microwave.  Cook once, eat for 9 days!

review/summary: A delicious alternative to apple jacks
review/text: Sometimes, although almost heretical to say, I get tired of apple jacks every morning for breakfast.  On those days, I'll usually turn to some form of oatmeal or cream of wheat.  Organic oat bran is quite delicious.  It reminds me of the days when we'd go to visit grandma and she'd have a hot bowl of mush for us (i think it was this stuff).  Really good.<br /><br />My wife doesn't like the steel cut oats because the texture is too lumpy.  This oatmeal is much smoother and she loves it.

It is easy to cook (just add water and microwave) so it is perfect for a quick breakfast in the office. Sometimes I like to add raisins or cranberries for additional flavor or nuts for more protein (great for the pre-workout meal).<br /><br />The price is pretty affordable especially with subscribe. One bag usually lasts me about 5 days.

review/text: The Amazon 4-pack comes packaged in the original Bob's box, put inside an amazon box for shipping.<br />The price is great. I could not find this item at my local grocers even though they carry other Bob's products. Amazon has everything! And great price, too. The oat bran is delicious. Creates a creamy hot cereal. Totally delicious with milk and a light dusting of brown sugar. I also tried the Dukan Diet pancakes made with greek yogurt and egg whites. I made the savory herb ones. They were wonderful...even my husband, who wasn't dieting, enjoyed them. Oat bran is also filling and keeps me full all morning. It has less calories than oatmeal...and more fiber. Great for digestive health! I particularly like that the bran is in small packages. I open and use one at a time. I feel like it stays fresher that way. I can also give them to friends and family to introduce them to the benefits of oat bran.<br />I highly recommend this product and buying it from Amazon.

I make our two servings on the stovetop - I think it comes out better this way.  I use a lot less water than called for.  For 2 servings I boil about 2 1/3 cups of water with a dash of salt,  then whisk in a heaping cup of oats and cook for two minutes. I thin it out in my bowl with a bit of milk and some brown sugar - yum! Fills us up for hours.

I originally intended to buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5U3I">McCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, 28-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)</a>. During my search I found this and saw all the stellar reviews for it. Those reviews, along ith a great price, and a personal history of always being satisfied with countless Bob's Red Mill products over the years led me to buy this. It arrived yesterday and I was anxious to try it so I made it for lunch.  I can assure you, all the great reviews for this cereal are warranted. It's absolutely delicious, and very satisfying.<br /><br />Serve it to yourself and others just as you would oatmeal (e.g., with raisins, butter, honey, maple syrup, milk, etc., whatever tickles your fancy). If you like Scottish type oatmeal - it's not as thick as the Irish steel cut, I'm confident you'll like this. You'll probably like it even if you're accustomed the thicker steel cut oats.<br /><br />Buy with confidence and enjoy this hot delicious cereal.

review/summary: Takes the static out of my hair!
review/text: I have very dry ends, and I also have very fine hair.  My long hair becomes static even in humid weather.  It drives me crazy!  I got a sample of this stuff that I was able to try before I bought a bottle.  I love it!  I put a little bit specifically on my ends, then I spread it lightly throughout the rest of my hair, and the static is gone.  Because I have fine hair, I can only use a little of this stuff, or it weighs it down, but a little is all I need to control the static.  The instructions say to use a quarter size portion, but I use a little smaller than a dime size.  It has a very light scent that smells kind of like citrus.  I have tried several other products, and this is the best I have found. Gels weigh my hair down, make it crunchy, and the static is still there.  Hot oil treatments really weigh my hair down, for several washings.  This stuff washes out well, and eliminates the frizzy, fly-away static ends without leaving my hair crunchy.  I just went and bought a bottle and I will be set for about 6 months.  It is relatively inexpensive, and since I only need a small amount, it lasts me a long time.

review/summary: Super Product
review/text: This product has made my hair super soft and shiny since I started using it. I find that using the quarter size amount is to much for my mid-back length hair. I use about a nickel size amount and it seems to do great in my hair. I moved to Germany and my hair started to feel rough, frizzy, and dull. This product, along with Mane&Tail Shampoo and TRESemme Thermal Recovery Conditioner, brought my hair back to life.....soft, shiny, and no more frizz! Highly recommended!

review/summary: Just wanted to give this coffee a fair shake...
review/text: I don't usually write reviews, but I felt I needed to come back and write a positive review of this coffee. I ALMOST didn't buy it based on the 1-star review from the previous purchaser. But, after reading a positive review on another site, I decided to take a chance on it. This is very good coffee, and if you are looking for a blueberry flavored pod, you should buy with confidence. The previous reviewer is either using the wrong brewer, or is looking for over-the-top flavor you might associate with coffee flavored with a blueberry syrup. I use a Bunn My Cafe single cup pod brewer and this brews a very aromatic cup with a nice hint of blueberry. May actually be too much flavor for some, but it's just right for me. I'll definitely buy again, and if this is what you're looking for, again, I say buy with confidence!

review/summary: Blue Bad Coffee
review/text: I bought this coffee after falling in love with Dunkin Donuts and 7-11 blueberry coffee. This unfortunately was not it. Not only is the flavor of blueberries not present, this coffee has an odd smell to it. The pods are small and will be too small for even single brew coffee makers. I have a 4 cup brewer and a single cup brewer. I tried it on both. No bueno. One pod was too little and the coffee was watery and not good. So I tried two pods. Still no blueberry coffee. The coffee was very very watery and although the box was supposed to be a medium roast it falls well short of that. This is a colossal waste of money even if you do get three boxes. I wish I could find someone to just take it off my hands.<br /><br />Flavor: no blueberry flavor whatsoever<br />Taste: coffee was very watery even with 2 pods and 8 oz of water.  I actually measured to be sure<br />Value: none<br /><br />Now, it's possible that I got a defective batch (maybe they forgot the blueberry?). Maybe I should return it and try again. But I just don't have energy for that.

review/summary: Lemon Mixes Well -- In More Ways Than One
review/text: We all know by now, if only from reading reviews, that these puddings are easy to mix.  The sugar-free part eases your guilt of pouring pudding down your gullet.  But what makes this lemon flavor special?<br /><br />It's one of the best flavors, and I think many or most will agree with that; it's vibrant, comparatively speaking.  But consider mixing it with others!  For example, it really can pick up the rather bland cheesecake flavor and improve on them both.  You'll make at least two packages anyway, right?  So, one of each works.<br /><br />Use your imagination!

review/summary: A great healthy snack to keep around for the kids
review/text: These have become staples in our house. I first picked up the "Blueberry Blitz" from our local super-market, but the only other flavors they carried were "fruit-only". I really liked the fact that you get at least some veggies in these (albeit a few places down on the ingredient list). So I came to Amazon and ordered "Carroty-Chop" and "Beetbox Berry". So far the kids (boys aged 4 and 6) love them. They are an easy snack to throw in the lunch box or to take on the road. I also like that they have a long shelf life and they are certified organic by the Oregon Tilth, one of the more stringent organic certification agencies.<br /><br />Here are the ingredient lists since I don't see them on Amazon:<br />Blue-Berry Blitz: organic apple puree, organic blueberry puree, organic carrot puree, organic purple carrot juice, organic lemon juice<br />Carroty Chop: organic apple puree, organic carrot puree, organic mango puree, organic orange juice, organic lemon juice<br />Beetbox Berry: organic apple puree, organic strawberry puree, organic carrot puree, organic beet juice, organic lemon juice<br /><br />They are all 60 calories and have 11 grams of sugar.<br /><br />I've also taken to buying the "Peter Rabbit Organics" which have more vegetables mixed in with the fruit and are a little larger. My kids prefer the Mashups, but they also like the Peter Rabbit brand, so I just have a big basket of them all mixed in and I grab what makes sense. If we've dined out and they didn't get a lot of veggies I give them a "Peter Rabbit" for bedtime snack. If I'm just adding a little something to their lunch box I'll throw in a Mashup. It does help keep the kids away from the junk food, particularly at snack time. A great tool in the "trying to feed the kids healthy stuff" arsenal.<br /><br />And to be honest I've been known to grab one when I need a quick snack. They taste pretty good, and it's better than grabbing cookies or chips.

review/summary: My kids love these and I am a fan too.
review/text: I have two four and 1/2 year old boys and some days I just don't feel like having the eat your vegetable fights.  These "squeezies" as we call them, are perfect to get a quick veggie/fruit in for a meal or to use on the go.  My sons would not even attempt to eat a beet - I love them personally and talk them up like they are candy to no avail - but with these, I can give them one and they will eat it within 2 minutes.  For us, they are a quick way to get in a fruit and vegetable and I get no arguments.  We tried the Peter Rabbit version and for some reason they didn't care for them.  We also eat the Carroty Chop and the Blueberry Blitz as well as the yogurt versions.  We still eat our vegetable at every meal, but when we are on the go or in a hurry it is good to have these at hand.  There are no artificial sweeteners and they are only 60 calories per serving.  I've tasted them all and they are all quite good. I don't replace our fruit and vegetable servings with these but use them as an add on or we have them at meal times when we are home late and need a quick nutritional meal or are on the go.  We like them so much we get them as subscribe and save so I don't run out - though we do anyway most months.

review/summary: Best I've had in years
review/text: Some of the other reviewers who have given lower stars don't say if they require gluten free...if they don't I can sort of see where they're coming from.  Gluten free food tastes different from non-gluten free food, AND it's significantly more expensive in almost all cases ($1.50 to $2.00 per bar is typical to what I've seen in stores).  I have been gluten free (Celiac) for over 7 years, and these bars are absolutely one of the best GF bars I've ever had.  I'm not a huge fan of the fruit flavors, but I don't really like fruit flavored bars in general, so I think it's just me.  I have a freind who loves the chocolate covered strawberry flavor.  I adore the peanut butter and all of their chocolate flavors (brownie, fudge, mudslide) are good, too. I don't think that Think Thin can MAKE a bad GF product, at least I haven't found one yet.  They are high in protein and make a fantastic breakfast that fills me up - add that to low in sugar and fat, and you just can't lose.  My only comment is that I would order from [...] directly during the summer - their packaging has insulation and ice packs and it's free if you order over $75 in product.  I ordered through Amazon in the middle of July, and all my bars melted in transit.

review/summary: Best I've found in a long time!
review/text: I first read about these bars in a magazine article written by a personal trainer.  She stated that she always keeps one in her travel bag or purse in case of emergencies.  Then when I read the reviews on Amazon I just wasn't sure what to do.  I purchased a single bar from my local health food store and fell in love.  That's when I decided to make a bulk purchase here.<br /><br />I have tried all of the flavors in this package as well as the creamy peanut butter.  They are not only healthy but also delicious!  I do not require a gluten free diet but have tried other gluten free bars and have not been satisfied.  These taste incredible!  I have even used a bar to satisfy my sweet tooth!<br /><br />What I normally look for in a protein bar is the ratio of protein to sugar.  Unfortunately a lot of the higher protein choices out there also contain high amounts of sugar.  Not these.  At 20g of protein (a lot higher than the average bar) and 0g of sugar, you simply cannot lose.<br /><br />Finally I would like to mention that several users seemed to have given a low rating simply because of the image presented.  Perhaps that should be changed but I had no problem noticing the fact that some of the bars were the 100 calorie, thinkThin bites (which I find to be the perfect snack) while some were the full size bars.  This is clear in the image.<br /><br />My bottom line:  I HIGHLY recommend thinkThin bars.

review/summary: Nice and thick
review/text: Very good quality syrup.  Nice and thick, doesn't splash all over when I pump into my coffee.  Flavor is like almond cookies.  Not my favorite flavor but that's personal preference.  This syrup is very good.
