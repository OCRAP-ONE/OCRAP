review/summary: Perfect size but smells less than perfect
review/text: My 5 month old Lab mix enjoys these treats (but he seems to enjoy any food) and I love the small size since we're still training him.  The smell isn't so great so you can't just stash a handful in your pocket unless you want your pocket to smell like them.  I knocked off 1 star in my rating just because of the smell, but if you keep the bag sealed at all times, you won't smell anything and it will keep the treats fresh.  I found the same item at my local pet store in NYC (Tribeca area) for $1 less than Amazon so I was a bit shocked that it's cheaper there than Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent Training Tidbits
review/text: I purchased these based on other great reviews, and I'm glad I did! Our newly adopted 40 lb, 9 month old Amstaff/Lab mix is very food motivated and I feel great using these for training without worrying about their health factor. Plus they are absolutely tiny (pencil eraser size). I am surprised other people cut them up, when they are so small already! I also prep and freeze a Kong for her overnight to have while we're at work, and these are the perfect size to plug up the smaller hole in a Large sized kong!<br />We have only tried the chicken flavor so far, and she loves them! They do dry out if left out, but that doesn't seem to decrease their delicious-ness factor with her. Finally, Amazon does have the best price around on them, so if you're looking for healthy, dog approved treats, go for Zuke's minis!

review/summary: Perfect for training!
review/text: I have a 7 week old APBT/Golden Retriever mix who is very tiny and not so good with crunchy treats. Even small crunchies are too big and I have to break them in half an it gets pretty messy! They're also a bit too hard for her baby teeth.<br />Zuke's mini naturals are awesome because they are so small, and they are soft enough without being mushy or greasy. The ingredients are great and my puppy (and other dogs I've given them to) loves them! I bought the salmon and peanut butter ones, so far we've only tried salmon, but she goes crazy for them! Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great treats, Great price
review/text: We picked up a 6oz bag at petco at first (for like $7), but since our puppy loved them we committed to a bigger bag, and this was the best price around (amazon prime wins every time).<br /><br />Highly recommended for training, but remember that hotdogs are better than pretty much anything (though gross...).  These treats will dry out if left unsealed for a pretty long period of time (many days, a week?), so don't take out too many at once, but even dried she still loves them.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, definitely get them :)

review/summary: His second favorite flavor....
review/text: He really loves these treats more than any other treats out there. He flips backwards just to get these LOL. These are a just a little bigger than a pencil eraser. They are great for training. I like to cut them in half to yield even more. I tried cutting them in quarters but they seem a little too small for my dogs big mouth. They come in a resealable package so that helps to keep them nice and fresh and especially soft. I forgot to close the bag one day and the treats got pretty hard but the dog didn't mind.

review/summary: A Great Training Treat
review/text: My dog has agility training two days a week, so we are always trying new treats for her to assit in motivating.  We use the Zukes on a semi regular basis.  I like it because it is easy to tear the treats down to smaller sizes to make the product last.  The treat is semi smelly which is good because it helps focus are dog.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 stars is that my dog is very picky and she will defintilty try harder for certain treats.  She does like the Zukes but  she does respond better to more raw types of meat treats that we get at a specialty dog store.

review/text: Love these treats. They are the perfect size for quick nibbles as training rewards. Just be aware - they reek! However, I don't consider this a negative as this makes my dog want them even more!<br /><br />Only other thing is they dry out fast, so make sure to re-seal the bag after each use. If you do this, though - they last fine.<br /><br />I'll be buying many many more of these!

review/text: The ingredients in these treats are healthy and natural and Horton, my Tibetan Terrier loves them.  So far we've only tried the chicken flavor.<br /><br />I like them for training because they are small and soft and have only a few calories so you don't have to worry about giving lots of them while teaching your dog to behave.  (I'm a puppy spoiler, so I could easily end up with a plump pup, if I'm not careful).  I couldn't find any other treats that even had the calories listed.<br /><br />The only downside to these treats is that they smell really bad. (to me, that is.)

We are also giving the puppy the chicken flavored ones and mixing it up for her.

I haven't tried the other flavors yet, but will definitely give them a shot.

review/text: My dog does agility so we give her Zuke's when we train. The treat is pretty smelly which is why we use them (a smelly treat will keep her attention).  She will pefrorm for Zuke's they dont seem to be her favorite treat (she performs best for bellyrybs a freezed dried liver which is too big to give as a regular treat)however in training she may eat 10 -15 treats so perhaps she gets tired of them.  The reason for the 4 stars is the treat is semi moist they do tend to dry out if left exposed for too long or if you improperly seal the bag.  Also my rating is based on my dogs preference for several other types of treats (on treats she will love she will knock our other dog down to get the treat).

Within a few samples of the treat, my dogs were doing whatever I asked, quickly, and for quite a long time.

So, I would suggest buying more of the smaller bags as opposed to the 1 pound bigger bag that they sell, unless you have several dogs and will go through these pretty quickly.

review/text: I bought these at a pet store prior to amazon and paid probably double the amount ($6 something). My dog loves it, and I give it to her as a reward for staying while being groomed, or pooping and peeing outside. She always wants more. Of course I only give her 2 at a time. These would last forever since there are so many in a bag. Amazon has these for like $3 something, great for getting up to $25 free shipping thresh hold too. My dog loves these and they do not irratate her stomach in any way as the ingredients are natural, meaty, no filler and healthy for her. The treats themselvesa re moist and smells like meat. Dogs do love moist treats more than dry treats, so the yare great for training. Highly recommend it.

review/summary: great yummy treats
review/text: Although I think they 'stink', my dog absolutely loves these treats. They are small and easy to carry in your pocket. If you are having trouble with your dog heeling or following you around the house, just keep a few of these in your pocket and she'll follow you everywhere! My dog absolutely can't wait for 'training sessions' with these treats and because they are so small she can be rewarded often for following commands. I highly recommend them.

review/summary: My sheltie love these treats
review/text: My 30 lb shetland sheepdog is picky.  She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats.  No "doggie junk food" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, chicken, comes from chicken being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.

Yes, they're stinky if you stick your nose into the bag, but otherwise, they're not stinky (of course, I'm comparing these to other treats, like dried beef lung... whoo, stinky!  Dried beef lung stinks up the entire room until she consumes it all).<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.<br /><br />UPDATE: Apparently the ingredients have changed for the PB flavor... the 1st two ingredients are now ground barley and rice, with actual PB coming in as the 3rd ingredient.  My sheltie still loves 'em though!

review/summary: Best dog treat - great for training
review/text: We have a 10-month-old boxer and found a trainer to work with us.  The trainer recommended these treats for training because they're small and the dog doesn't have to stop and chew and chew between activities.  Also, these chicken and salmon treats seem to have healthier ingredients than most other dog treats.  Truthfully, I am not an expert on what's good or bad for dogs nutritionally, but I'm sitting here looking at two dog treat bags.  One has dried whey, palm kernel oil, sugar, dicalcium phosphate, maltodextrin, defatted peanut flour, salt, soy lecithin and caramel.  Basically sounds like candy.  Mini naturals have chicken, ground barley, ground rice, lots of vitamins...no detectable sugars.  Maybe dogs don't need the grains, but the protein-based, no-sugar recipe seems like a better choice.  Try a bag and if you don't like them, you can return the unused portion to the company for a full refund.

review/summary: Great for Training!
review/text: This is one of the few brands that have treats appropriately small enough for my Chiuaua-mix. But, having been the owner of a large dog, these would also be great for training large dogs.  Dogs don't really have a sense of size- they're as happy with a small bite as a much larger treat! And you don't want you're dog to be too busy chewing when you want to keep his/her attention and repeat a behavior.  These treats are just the right size!

review/summary: Best dog treat ever
review/text: Finding these treats was a complete fluke. When on vacation in Hollywood, FL we stopped in a gourmet pet store. There was a cute yorkie that we were petting and we told the owner we had Chihuahuas. He was buying Zukes and absolutely raved about the treats. He recommended the chicken but we purchased the peanut butter treat. We keep the treats in the fridge. My dogs LOVE these treats. If we open the fridge they are right there. The size is perfect for training. I can't say enough great things about the product, healthy and it makes my dogs happy.

review/summary: Great size for training but absolutely unbearable smell
review/text: I thought these looked perfect for training so I gave them a try.  The problem is that even in a sealed bag inside a separate sealed ziplock, the smell of these treats is unbearable.  We tried keeping them in the car, but the car would retain the horrible smell for days.  We eventually ending up keeping them in a sealed container in the back yard until the bag was gone.  If you touch them with your fingers, your hand will smell of them until you can wash your hands.  Disappointing as they are a perfect size for training, but I will not buy them again.  I wish they would make a similar treat without the odor.

review/summary: Great for training and dogs who just love getting treats!
review/text: I originally bought a 6 ounce bag of these treats at my local pet store for 4$ a bag.  The owner recommended them because they are made from healthy items, and they are only 3 calories a treat.  The low calorie and healthy ingredients are a big plus when you are feeding them to your dog as a reward for training.<br /><br />The treats are moist, but do not leave a greasy residue on your hands if you are holding a bunch as rewards. The treats have a slight smell, but not anywhere near as much as some of the other moist treats on the market.  They are small in size, but provide quick satisfaction to my 50 pound dog and have really helped her learning process.<br /><br />As an amusing anecdote, my 6 pound Siamese/tiger mix loves the treats as well! Whenever she hears the bag, she comes running and will sit and "assist" me in training the dog, as long as she gets her fair share as well!

review/summary: They sound great but...
review/text: They smell HORRIBLE!  I bought a bag of these, expecting them to smell like chicken but instead I got a huge whiff of some gross chemical smell.  I didn't even give them to my dogs because I felt like the smell was just too wrong.  Call me crazy but "natural" dog treats shouldn't smell like chemicals at all.  Plus, what the heck are all of the chemical names at the end of the ingredients list?  Doesn't sound very natural to me.<br /><br />I think I'll be sticking with Natural Pups since their treats actually smell like the flavors they're supposed to be and they're way healthier.

review/summary: Salmon Treats have strong smell
review/text: Sadly my dog is NOT fond of these even though she does like salmon and anything smelly! She will eat them (the first treat she rolled on as she'll do if I give her lox) but she won't do tricks for them and acts as if they were a run of the mill dog food instead of a treat. Both my mate and I found the smell rather unpleasant similar to old B vitamins or really old liver treats, not like salmon..<br />(FYI My is dog is medium sized black mutt.)<br />UPDATE:My dog seems to be getting used to these to some degree she will now do some tricks perhaps she prefers them a little dried out (they are still soft)or even maybe she was addicted to other treats though I usually only give her wheat and gluten free treats like freeze dried liver and dogswell treats..Perhaps she's stil not crazy about them because these treats do have natural gluten in the form of malted barley and ground barley (Not that good for me in terms of cross contamination as I am gluten sensitive and perhaps she is too?) Left a message for Zukes' but never heard back from them.. They are convenient in that they are small

review/summary: Perfect treat for training and other things
review/text: I've bought Zukes Mini Treats, chicken for such a long time.  I heard about it on TV series.  So when I checked at a store, they, to me, were expensive, some sites are better.<br /><br />BUT Amazon, so far, beats all prices.  I never thought that these treats would work so fast, it's amazing. Yes I saw it on TV, since I'm not sure one is allowed to say which series it is, I won't say what it is.<br /><br />First time I bought Zukes, 1 pound, (got two dogs), I bought it long ago, with other products, and like I wrote, both dogs learned fast, everytime I train, or make sure they always are good, mainly outside, they actually know I have those mini Chicken treats...probably the smell, and we have 2 Labs, so I guess it's the smell.<br /><br />First time I used them, it was only when they gave positive reaction.  I was quit surprised it didn't take long as dogs do remember, so when I give command, and they listen, I praise them, give them each the treat.<br /><br />I also got one of those treat packages, comes in handy outside.<br /><br />I have to say they remember better than I do, meaning when I say something new, a new learning thing, it seemed, at at least to me, that they knew if they did it, they'd get a treat.<br /><br />I want to make clear that although on occassion on some dogs, it takes longer to learn, but they do.  But also, there WILL come a time that they just do what they're told, like "not try to dig under fence, or try to go after Cats", that they actually do listen, but when they come inside doggie door when I call them, they sit and wait before going in the house.  So, yes, I give each of them one mini chicken treat.<br />Then they go in the house, and they both play.<br /><br />But in the house, if or when things get out hand, like door bell ringing, the best word for me that I taught was a stern "NO!" that takes their attention off the door.<br /><br />Here's a tip, another thing I used a long time ago...because dogs do what dogs do, meaning we have so many cats in the neighborhood, not easy to get them in the house.<br /><br />I started with a clicker, inside house, they know that clicking sound they get the mini chicken treat.  That, at last for us, WORKS ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />I really don't know what else to say, other than if anyone is going to try the treats, make sure you try the chicken first, they seem, at least our dogs, love that chicken.  One pound of those treats are far better price than 8oz.<br /><br />Just make sure it comes from Amazon, anything over $25.00 you don't pay postage. (unless you don't care about postage, or you're rich..lol )<br /><br />The 3rd parties also, I found, but ONLY SOMETIMES, they also don't charge postage.  What I'm trying to say is if economy is hurting you, then just take the time, as I do, and just check out the prices.<br /><br />If anyone has any questions, or even suggestions as I always like suggestions, please feel free to contact me.<br /><br />Now I feel better doing the review. I should have done more reviews, I plead guilty to that.  In a way, this was fun to do.  Thank you for reading my review, and hope, especially if you have hard time training, hope you try these treats.<br /><br />Just remember THIS, never YELL, or NEVER EVER hit your dog, that is so wrong, especially if it's trained, and somebody wants to pet him/her, the dog will DEFINATELY think he or she might be hit.  Dogs are, indeed, smarter than people realize, and from 1967 til present, I always find out new things about our dogs, as we adopt them, they are wonderful animals to have, they WILL protect you, LOVE you, and do anything for you.<br /><br />I know this to be true..., so believe me when I say Dogs are great, my view is GREAT for us Senior Citizens, they do protect us, and in my case one literally saved my life in July, 2008.<br /><br />So reminding you if anyone has any questions, please ask, or recommendations, that's cool too, always listen to recommendations. :-)

review/summary: Sour Smell emailed company
review/text: I received the Zukes Chicken Mini's a couple of days ago. I opened the bag and the smell that came out of it was a sour almost vinegar smell, much like pickles in away. I fed the dogs one each then thought I better not give them anymore. I emailed the company and asked if that was normal. Matt the contact sent this message:<br /><br />Hi Kerrie-<br /><br />They are definitely strong in smell. If you have not smelled them before<br />they may seem a little odd smelling. The dogs think they are candy! They<br />should be perfectly fine. One thing to check is the bottom/underside of<br />the bag and make sure the "best by" date is still good. If that is in<br />range I would say everything is good to feed to your dog. Thank You for<br />your inquiry and for supporting Zuke's!<br /><br />Matt Porray<br />"Bone Counselor"<br />Customer Service<br />Zuke's<br /><br />They date on the bag is for November 2013 so they are well within the expiration date.<br />But I emailed a friend (who in the past has donated many bags of Zukes treats to the dog club I used to belong for training classes) and I asked her the same question she felt they were not safe to feed with them smelling sour (vinegar like). I had never fed the chicken flavor before.<br />I think Iwill be sending these back. I am very disappointed, I don't mind treats that stink I feed a freeze dried green trip treat those really smell. The Zukes didn't smell like something even dogs would eat.

review/summary: Who Says Dog Treats Are Just For Dogs?
review/text: Once again, Zuke's has made a snack that'll give you an attack. I have always been a fan of dog food for as long as I can remember. It is cheap, delicious, and for the most part very easy on the bowels. Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals remind us all that dog treats are yummy for people, too.<br /><br />Zukes is taking us back. Back to the basics. 16 ounces of pure chicken delight, crisp and crunchy. And if you happen to have a dog, this is a treat you can share with your pet. It does not actually taste like chicken, more of a seitan meatloaf, but it tastes better than most chickens I have eaten. (I grew up on a farm in Virginia, so that's a big deal!)<br /><br />Treat yourself to Zuke's chicken-flavored treats. And maybe you can give one to your dog, too!

review/summary: Zero stars if I could
review/text: Less than 24 hours after my four year old dog ate a Zuke's "all-natural" bone, she developed pancreatitis!!! There was no other change in her diet, environment or anything but that Zuke's bone. When I took her to the vet, she was dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea... and she had to stay at the vet for three days. Over $1,000 in vet bills later, I gave Zuke's hq a call to let them know. While symphathetic, basically Zuke's gave me a $15 check to cover the cost of the bone, but failed to take responsibility for the incident, even though the vet wrote a note saying the bone was the most likely cause. Stay away from this and all Zuke's "all-natural" products!

review/summary: Bite sized heaven for your dog - good value per pound
review/text: This Zuke chicken flavored mini naturals dog treat bag is natural, my labrador puppy loves them, and it's a good portion. I bought this for about $6. For one pound (16 ounces) this is perfect in the $5 - $7 range. Most 16 ounce treat bags cost upwards $10.<br /><br />Other thoughts<br /><br />* Just the smell gets the attention of my labrador puppy<br />* Good for training and as treat<br />* Pinch finger sized.<br /><br />Treat your dog with this delightful and delicious brand. An excellent addition to any dog owner's arsenal.

review/summary: First Ingredient: Peanut Butter.... My Dog Loves Them
review/text: WOW.  NOTE:  No Wheat, Corn, Soy, Artificial Colors, Flavors and no Added Fat or By-Products.  On the Label, the first ingredient is Peanut Butter.  Made in USA.<br /><br />My chihuahua loves these things.  Although they are small, they are not as tiny as the berrybuddies we tried first (I don't even know what to do with those, they fall out at alarming rates from the buddy-toys hole).<br /><br />These - - he can chew, it's like he's eating peanut butter for a moment.  He doesn't just woof them down - he actually eats them.  I give him one at a time, and he sits and chews it for 10-20 seconds - much like peanut butter I would imagine.  They fit perfectly in the KONG toys (but not the busybuddy ones, they are smaller holes).<br /><br />The chicken ones were a bit too flavored for him - so I pinch them in half and add a few to his food - then he loves it - mixed with his food & warm water.  I want to try all the flavors!<br /><br />I also like that the company supports a cause with each bag purchased.  Very natural, very chewy little things, and my dog LOVES them.  Very good value.  Will be keeping these around for sure.

review/text: Excellent little treats about the size of the tip of your little finger.  I even cut them in half for my Italian greyhound so I can give him "more."  He can "count," but doesn't recognize quantity.  He's very sensitive to certain ingredients, especially corn, and Zuke's treats don't make him ill.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: The Zuke's Chicken Flavored Treats are just what I was hoping they would be! I got the chicken flavor (despite other claims of serious odor) because it was the cheapest flavor. My dog LOVES them. Her affinity for them, coupled with their size makes them perfect for training.  They are small little cylinders which are about 1/4" thick and less than 1/2" wide. They are enough to keep her interest, but not too substantial that they distract from training as she's chewing, as usually happens with a biscuit-type treat. They are also great for use inside the Kong Genius Leo (I have a size Large). They are thinner than a similar treat by a different brand which I found at my local Petco. I like that they're smaller because the other ones would get stuck in the tube of the Leo. These slide in and out without much friction at all. I don't find the odor to be as offensive as others have described. The odor is about average for moist treats, in my opinion. In fact, they smell very similar to my cat's treats.  So much so that my cat tries to steal them when I lay them on the floor while the dog is practicing "stay."  Also, you really can't beat the value! Treats can go so quickly when used during training and it's nice to find a quality treat that doesn't break the bank! I will definitely be buying these again!

review/text: These treats are relatively healthy when compared to the competition. They could be better by excluding grains and salt but they are treats after all. These are made in the USA which is a big bonus and they do not contain ethoxyquin which is a harmful preservative found in many dog foods and treats. I usually split these treats into 2 pieces, which is easily done just by squishing the 2 ends together. This makes my puppy feel like he's getting more treats.

The small size of the treat is perfect for training. I hated breaking up other treats into sizes appropriate for his 20lbs. I put them into tupperware instead of using their bag and carry a small amount with me on our walks. My dog has not had any adverse reaction to the combination of seemingly health ingredients. We're very happy.

review/text: Zuke's Chicken Flavored Mini treats are perfect for training dogs, especially a puppy in my case.  I picked these treats for my new 8 week old goldendoodle puppy.  She immediately loved them.  Since puppies have such short attention spans and require so much training, I need to use them frequently!  They are very reasonably priced compared to most products found in pet stores and have all natural healthy ingredients.  The small size of these treats allows you to get great use out of them, while giving them to your dog frequently for good behavior.  You won't need to constantly replenish your supply either.

review/text: A pound of training treats at this price is a good deal. I like everything about the treats including the size. They are NOT too tiny for my Great Dane and I can use a lot of them without filling him up and expanding his waist.  He loves the flavor, the smell is strong enough to entice without being offensive. The peanut butter flavor has not upset his sensitive stomach. They arent messy on your hands or in your pockets. They will dry out if left outside the package for any length of time so I usually separate some into a small tupperware type container for home and into small ziploc bags for carrying to classes or on walks. I will sometimes put a handful in my pocket and these actually survive the washing machine (not sure if that is good or bad).

He has also always completely destroyed any stuffed squeaker toy he has ever touched in a matter of minutes.  Not with these babies around. One whiff and the toy is forgotten; no fighting, no biting, no stuffing to pick up.  These are magic!  I only wish I'd known about them a decade sooner. Thanks.

Now that she has a baby sister (Bleu, a miniature Blue Heeler) I started to look for a new type of treat to help reinforce the training.  When Bella was little I used small pieces of hot dogs but I wanted to switch to something healthier.  Zuke's mini treats seem to work really well.  I use the chicken flavored ones and I am really impressed with both how much the dogs like them and how much they smell like real food.  I thought that I would make this quick video to show the treats (and my dogs) in action.

review/summary: Not up to expectations, more like gelatin than chicken
review/text: Our dogs love chicken so, after reading all of the positive reviews and noting that the first ingredient was chicken, I was really hopeful that these would be their new favorite treat. They sometimes will play with them for a minute but will not eat them and are not the least bit excited about them. They even lost interest in the sound of the treat jar that normally gets them very excited. These treats feel and look more like a wad of gelatin than chicken and have been relegated to the trash bin. They would be a little on the expensive side if they actually were mostly chicken but they are way overpriced for sort of chicken gel wads.<br /><br />While almost everything "tastes like chicken" these treats don't, as evidenced by the fact that our chicken-loving dogs do not like them one bit.

review/summary: would be okay if they didnt get hard after 5 minutes
review/text: I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: I was so excited about training my 4 months German Sheperd/Boxer mix.<br />First time she did me a favor swallowing it. The next day she wouldn't even open her mouth, complete lack of interest.<br />I feed her Blue buffalo dry food mixed with canned food daily.<br /><br />Despite all the positive reviews don't just assume your dog will like it, until dogs can submit a review on Amazon  :)

review/summary: Dogs love 'em, I love 'em
review/text: My dogs love them. They smell pretty intensely which is always good. They have three calories per treat. About pea-sized.<br /><br />I used them for training and when they go to their areas when I head out to work in the morning.<br /><br />There's really not much more to be said. I did set up the amazon subscription on a two-month basis and may bump that up to monthly eventually. I will see.<br /><br />I can only recommend these because the price and value are excellent and they are great if you have does. Light, small, portable.

review/summary: great little treat
review/text: These treats are made from high quality ingredients, and are made in the U.S.A.(two things I look for). They are the perfect training treat, low in calories, small enough to carry in a pocket. I use them daily as a "reward" for proper behavior. My cavaliers absoultely adore these treats, they are by far their favorite.

review/summary: LOVE IT - and so do both my dogs, even the picky one!
review/text: Both my dogs love these treats.  They have both tried the salmon and the chicken flavor.  The only reason we didn't try the peanut-butter flavored ones is because they already get peanut butter in their kongs as a treat, so we used salmon and chicken as a "variety."<br /><br />Great for treats in general, and also perfect for training!<br />For training purposes - we actually cut them into fourths (we have a picky yorkie and a puppy who will be a medium sized dog).  At 3.5 calories per treat - cut into FOURTHS - I am happy to give them as many as they need during training sessions without worrying too much about feeding them too many treats and spoiling their mealtime!  Very easy to cut into the right size.  Even after cutting them into fourths, my yorkie and puppy still have to chew a little.  So it's actually a little necessary for us to cut them or else we have to wait too long for them to chew it and swallow before continuing with the training session.  So cutting it makes it a better bite-sized morsel that makes them happy but quick to gobble up.  I'm sure once our puppy gets bigger we will only cut into halves and then not at all later.  But currently he still likes to take a few happy chews of his 1/4-zuke!<br /><br />They are quite odorous (which is probably why the dogs love them so much) - so it maybe takes some time to get used to the first few times you are digging into the treat bag.  But it gets better later  :)  But whatever the dogs like and is safe to eat works for me!
