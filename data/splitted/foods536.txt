review/summary: I Love Salt, So I Love These
review/text: Okay, first of all I accidentally ordered two boxes of these, so I am now the proud owner of way more pork rinds than anyone should have in the house. Luckily, they are pretty darned delicious. I microwaved mine for almost two minutes (because my microwave isn't the most powerful machine out there), and what resulted were hot, crispy, puffy pork rinds that taste like they should be way worse for you than they are (I mean, they're not great for you, but come on, they're pork rinds). They are quite salty, but I'm a salt fanatic, so that's a-okay in my book. Anyway, I recommend. Just don't order two boxes, or you'll be stuck wondering if microwave pork rinds are an acceptable Christmas gift. . . .

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These pork rinds are delicious!  They taste so fresh, plump up nicely, and have the right amount of spice.  Plus, cooking them in the microwave, just like microwavable popcorn, is a breeze.  I store them in the freezer, along with my popcorn, to keep them fresh.  There is only 1 carb per bag, which makes a perfect snack for my diabetic lifestyle.

review/summary: Pork Rinds
review/text: I'm diabetic and manage my weight and blood sugar levels medicine free with a low carb diet.  They don't sell these anywhere I've seen locally but in the "south" I would think they would be a hit!  They're a good product and blow away any already prepared pork rinds and if you're on a low carb diet it's really hard to find a crunchy snack and these fit the bill!  They are flavorful and tender yet crisp.  Thumbs up.

review/summary: Delicious for Adkins Dieters!
review/text: I've been low-carb dieting and I like pork rinds so I couldn't wait to try these. They're not really "spicy", they're more like mild in my opinion. They are good, they taste just like the pork rinds that you buy at the store, not "bacon-y" at all to me. The only downside is that your house will smell like hot pork rinds. It's pretty bad, I don't normally notice things like that but it's pretty smelly and hard to get rid of.

review/text: Giving the other 17 bags of these to the local food shelf just seems too cruel, better to throw them away.<br /><br />I don't know what good the 'popping' does except make them sort of hot. They're too salty, have a hideous flavor, taste nothing like pork rinds. They don't even taste as good as _bad_ pork rinds. They're also loaded with chemicals I want to avoid (probably part of the source of the hideous flavor).

review/text: These are so good, especially when they are still hot.  I love the way they still sizzle and pop while eating.  Sometimes I sprinkle some hot sauce on mine straight from the microwave or a little parmesan cheese, depending on my mood.  However I eat them, they are really good.  Remember to shake them well for a minute or two before nuking them.  The bags do not puff up as much as microwave popcorn, so don't expect them to.  Only cook for the suggested time on the bag.

review/text: I have ordered about 6 boxes to date, I have only had a few times that they seemed salty, I think the shaking of the bag helps much on this. You also have to watch your own Microwave as to the time needed to cook, do not over cook them or they will burn and become hard. I like to dip in Vineger as well after cooking.(You hear the SNAP CRACKLE POP)Some like hot sauce on it too.<br />I found these in a food store the first time and I bought them as a joke, but after the first bag I was hooked! I'm glad Amazon has them because I can not find any local stores that sell them anymore.<br />I myself prefer the original flavor but this is more of a personal taste then anything else, many of my friends liked the Spicy. you have to love the warm Rinds.

review/summary: Hot and Fresh !
review/text: If you enjoy pork rinds you are going to love this product. Hot and fresh pork rinds beat the socks off any of that bagged stuff from the grocery store that taste like steyrofoam packing peanuts. These little gems cook up light and crispy right from the microwave. They have a mildly spicy flavor that builds up as you make way through the serving but the heat never gets too powerful. The key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking. That will distribute the pellets evenly. Then you have to find the "sweet spot" for cooking time. Mine is 2 min 30 sec which leaves me with no burnt or uncooked pieces. I only have two minor criticisms: 1) The serving size is a little small and 2)the spice mixture is a tad bit too salty for me. Otherwise, these things are tops !

review/summary: Wonderful if you can handle salt
review/text: I was delighted to be able to order these, since local stores no longer carry them.  The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure.  Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking.  They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.  A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat.  This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use.  One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult.<br /><br />I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together).  Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you.

review/text: I do not like pre-cooked pork rinds, not even made fresh in the Mexican Carnecerias, but hubby likes them, so I decided to buy these.<br /><br />I was shocked to find that they were light, airy and crispy. Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right.<br /><br />The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.<br /><br />Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring.<br /><br />I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic.

review/summary: Great snack
review/text: These are an interesting and tasty alternative to microwave popcorn, well worth trying. The spicy version is not very spicy, but has a little kick. Be careful to even out the contents of the bag before microwaving and to make sure the bag rotates freely in microwaves with a turntable. Microwave time is short, about 90 seconds. They come out hot and fresh tasting. Pieces are relatively small, about an inch square. They have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds, but having them hot helps compensate. Amazingly, pork rinds are becoming "diet food." They have no carbs, there is a lot of air in them that minimizes the calories for the volume, and relatively small quantities are satisfying. Anyway, it is a good story to go with a tasty snack.

review/summary: Not just another pretty reheat
review/text: Microwave pork rinds?  Figured it was just a bag of the guilty pleasures heated up to add taste appeal.  So I popped a bag into the microwave and surprise!  The bag popped back!  It even puffed up like Orville Reddenbacher's best.  All that in less than 90 seconds.<br /><br />Turns out the little treats are bagged raw and freeze-dried and they actually cook and puff up in the microwave.  The difference between these guys and an off the shelf bag is the difference between bagged and freshly popped pop corn.  And since they're cooked without frying or oil they are -- dare we say -- healthy?  Well, maybe not raw carrots, but a third of a bag total out at 60 calories and 2 grams of fat.<br /><br />Not so guilty a pleasure after all.

review/summary: Nothing special
review/text: I bought this out of curiosity after seeing it on the Food Network.  It does taste good.  You do have to carefully follow the directions on the bag.  This doesn't work the same as microwave popcorn.  The "bake" time is quite short, and overcooked pork rinds aren't pretty or tasty.  I think that in the future, if I want warm pork rinds, I'll try warming up a small batch of my usual brand in the toaster oven for a couple of minutes.

review/summary: good, not great
review/text: I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.

review/summary: Wayyyyyyy too salty
review/text: They're ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. You'll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. Also, no matter what you set the timer on the microwave, you will have little burn/hardened pieces. So you're not even getting a whole lot out of one bag.

review/summary: Great snack alternative...particularly good with beer.
review/text: These are a great alternative to your usual "par-for-the-course" snacks as well as traditional, bagged pork rinds. I had the same issues with some of the others who've bought them in that finding out how long to microwave them with your particular microwave is a trial and error process on the first bag or two. On my first attempt, they "fluffed-up" fine, but I ended up microwaving them too long and some of them started to scorch (leaving a bad burnt smell, though not quite as bad as popcorn when the same thing happens). Spreading them out inside the bag before you start to microwave them is probably the single most important thing you can do. It's a little tricky, but you can get them to move around a bit with minimal effort. If you just throw the bag in the microwave as if it's popcorn, you won't get a quality product, but if you take the time to spread them out (as stated on the bag) and then watch the bag until it stops expanding (again, stated on the bag), they're quite good.<br /><br />Once you get the hang of it, the Bacon Curls are pretty delicious, especially paired with a beer or two (something pale and drinkable, from a "yard work" kind of beer to something like an IPA). The curls/rinds are light and fluffy, but very crunchy (surprisingly so, I was halfway expecting there to be some kind of greasy sogginess, but there isn't). They're on the salty side, but again, with the beer, that's a good thing. I like how they come out of the package sizzling and popping a bit, warm (not hot) and delicious. If you already like pork rinds, then this is almost a no brainer, as this is the same thing, only better (fresh, warm, delicious and with less fat).

Always keep an eye on the bag once it blows up to its full area DON'T let it go for any longer than 20 seconds or they will burn and with the hot and spicy your kitchen and your eyes will feel like you have been pepper sprayed. Little more difficult to cook but its worth it. Enjoy

review/summary: I hate to admit it...
review/text: ...but I love these things!  Bagged pork rinds from the grocery are beyond disgusting.  They don't look, smell or taste appealing.  But fresh nuked pork rinds are a very different story.  These pigskins come out toasty and, dare I say it?  Delicious!  Significantly lighter and more airy than their grocery store counterparts.  "They" say you can use them to scoop up salsa or dip, but they're very good on their own, and I think the porky taste wouldn't go well with salsa anyway.  Maybe french onion dip - I'll have to try that.<br /><br />These pork rinds seemed fairly salty to me.  But when I crave chips and such, it's usually the salt (and crunch) that I'm really after, so it wasn't a problem.  Microwaving pork rinds - who knew?

review/summary: Great product, BUT!
review/text: Great product, BUT!!!!! It's a little tricky to figure out the best time needed for YOUR microwave oven. Ours is pretty strong, and 1 minute 40 to 50 seconds is about right. However, BE WARNED! If you have an inexpensive or "low power" oven, the results will be very poor at best. (Just ask the crew where I work) When I tried to make a bag in the company cheap oven, it was SUPER slow to expand, and after the better part of 4 minutes, the burnt smell forced then to keep the door to the break room open for the rest of the afternoon! Bottom line....if you don't have a quality oven, don't buy these. One last word. After you remove the bag from the oven, carefully open, shake, and simply blow on them until they stop crackling. Otherwise they will seem stale until they cool. All this sounds like a pile of work, but after the first couple bags, you will NEVER buy pork rinds at the store again. I get a discount on the price because I have a box sent automatically every month. Works out to just under $13.00 a box with free shipping. Enjoy!

The heat is just enough to slow you down so you don't consume the whole bag in less than five minutes.<br /><br />I also love to hear the crackle sound when you pull them from the microwave.  It adds to the experience.  :)

I was a little skeptical, at first, but since I ain't too picky when it comes to eatin', I said, "OK."<br /><br />Just put the package into the microwave and 2 minutes later, you're about to feast on fresh tasting crispy pork rinds.  Be careful when you take them out of the microwave, though.  They're hotter than a Coal Miner in the Month of June.  You can see the steam emanating from the package, and they're cracklin' hot.  But, Guys and Gals, this is the real deal!  They're crispy and Oh, Sooooo good, that you'll be heating up another package before you know it.<br /><br />Now, I can get them and eat them when traveling (as long as I have a microwave readily available).<br /><br />This innovation is as good as microwave tater tots.<br /><br />Mmmmm Mmmmm, Good!

review/text: I'm on a low carb diet, and it's very difficult to resist temptation when my family has freshly popped popcorn.  Now I have found the solution.  Lowry's Microwavable Pork Rinds pop in the microwave exactly like popcorn, and only 1 carb per serving!  Plus, I love the way the curls keep making the popping sound in my mouth as I eat them... like Pop Rocks candy!  I got the regular which is salted just enough for my taste.  I also eat them with salsa as a snack (which replaces chips). Crumbled on a salad is a great replacement for croutons. Thank you Lowry's for coming up with a product that is such a life-saver to my diet!

review/summary: Great Porkrinds
review/text: These are great snacks.  Being able to cook them fresh really makes them taste better than the average pre-cooked store bought ones.  Great alternative to popcorn.  I ordered both the Hot & Spicy and the Original.  I prefer the Hot & Spicy, but I like spicy foods.  You can't go wrong with either one.

review/summary: Not bad, but hard to get right
review/text: I like the taste of these but they are inconsistent in texture (some are really really hard, while others are what you would expect).  You have to be careful with the microwaving part, but even when you are, it's hard to get consistent results. They also could be a little spicier for my taste.

review/summary: Great Taste-Tricky procedure
review/text: These pork skins have a great taste. Very fresh "homemade" taste. The cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. I have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. The first bag I tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully "explode" or "bloom".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.<br />My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway.  The jury is still out on whether the "healthy" claim can hold water.  I will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.  Good Eats!

I showed these to my nutritionist who was very impressed and planned to recommend them to other patients as a snack. Warm from the microwave, they are so much better than the regular rinds.

review/summary: Micro pork rinds freshest you can buy.
review/text: When I saw the price of the pork rinds plus free shipping, and since I had never tried the micro rinds before I decided I would give it a try. I ordered a box of the Spicy and one of the Original.<br />They were here in no time.<br />We have a 1000 watt micro and we experimented a couple of times and found that 92 seconds was perfect for us. If we have a few that do not puff up (which rarely happens) you can put the few on a paper plate and put them back in the micro and it takes just a few seconds for them to puff up.<br />Because I am not a spicy food lover I wasn't as crazy about the Spicy as the Original but my husband loved them. So that made it possible for each of us to have a box of our own. Wahoo, I didn't have to share with him. Worked out great.<br />I would liked to have had a little less salt on them but was able to knock some off just by tapping the rind on the plate as I ate them.<br /><br />I would give this an excellent rating, in fact I am going to order 2 more boxes after I finish this.

review/text: The Lowery's Original and Hot & Spicy Pork Rinds are great.

review/summary: Great diet snack also
review/text: Great taste no carbs (I am diabetic) and low cal also. Only drawback may be sodium content. When you need a cracker for a dip I use them. I just make the dip from fat free sour cream and onion soup mix. The dip has more cal than the pork rinds. I n short they are a cracker substitute for me.<br /><br />Most complaints are  improper  cooking  results. Hate to say this but it is your microwave not the product. There are microwave ovens that have a real bad hot spot and this burns them. I had an oven like this (older model)and the problem went away with  the new  microwave.<br /><br />But the biggest thing in their favor is the taste. Love both kinds.

review/text: I love these things, but they're no longer sold in grocery stores.  (Believe me, I've searched.)  It was great to find them (and for a reasonable price) at Amazon.<br /><br />I know, I know... they're junk food.  However, compared to the pork rinds you'd buy in a bag, the microwave version is considerably lower in fat.  As far as flavors go, I prefer the "Hot & Spicy"; it's a lot more interesting than "Regular".<br /><br />Suggestion:  Eat them while they're still warm, they're much better that way!

review/summary: great snack for after those late nights drinking
review/text: You need to make sure the pieces are evenly distributed throughout the bag before you microwave it. With my microwave I find 1:30 on high is the best, shake bag well when you first pull it out (for at least 10 seconds). This ensures the hot and spicy seasoning to be evenly coated. Then enjoy, I eat em with a beer.

review/summary: Tastes like feet!
review/text: I normally rate whatever items I buy but rarely offer words of advice. Well, these things changed my mind. I love pork rinds. Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, "Hey, that's the perfect solution!". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.<br /><br />I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth. I'm still shuddering from it. If you like the taste of feet, go for it. If not, I'd suggest heading to Sam's to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love.
