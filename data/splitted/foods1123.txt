review/summary: Tassimo's Best Brew
review/text: This is my favorite brew for my Tassimo.  It has good flavor - robust but not too strong for first thing in the morning. What I like the most is that it makes a 16 ounce cup which is great for morning. As far as I know, it's the only T-Disc that makes a cup that large.  Enjoy!<br /><br />(Updated 5/15/11) I continue to be surprised that there are people who call this brew "weak", "metallic-tasting", and "watery".  I like a fairly strong cup of coffee and have always found this to be pleasant. So, after numerous cups and many re-orders, I still find this to be my go-to brew in the morning. I also continue to wish that other brands and brews were available in this larger size.

review/summary: good not great makes a nice large cup
review/text: I am new to Tassimo and got this particular coffee at Bed Bath & Beyond as part of a sampler pack.  I generally like a medium blend coffee, which this is, it is not a dark roast like most of those available at your neighborhood Starbucks.  I can't compare it to the Starbucks Tassimo brews since I have not tried those yet other than the Latte which I liked.  Anyways, this did make a bigger cup, not sure it was really 12 ounces of coffee as advertised, but definitely a good sized cup of coffee. The resulting brew was nice, i gave it 4 of 5 stars since it had a somewhat synthetic instant coffee flavor as compared to a true drip cup.  I do like my coffee strong, and this Tassimo brew was almost strong enough for me.  I think maybe the amount of coffee in the disc is a bit too little to do a large cup right.  I would compare it to Starbucks Via brand of instant/regular coffee, except that it makes a much larger cup than one Via would.  It had a little of the same instant coffee flavor, and maybe Gevalia is adding some instant coffee to get the large size serving (Gevalia is owned or at least the t-discs are distributed by Kraft which makes the Maxwell House products too).  I would recommend it if you like a medium roast and want a larger cup of regular coffee to get the day going or get an afternoon pick me up.  And the price is a little better than some competitors especially considering the larger portion size.<br /><br />Edit 12/17/2010:  I continue to like this t-disc, it does make a large cup (although there are less in the package than other t-discs).  I also find that if I let the full amount of water come through the t-disc it ends up too weak, like some other t-discs I have tried.  So I pull the cup out a little early to keep the brew stronger.

review/summary: Gevalia Morning Roast vs Dunkin Donuts coffee
review/text: I like Dunkin Donuts coffee and tried a bunch of T-disc offerings to find something similar.  I think this is the most similar I've found so far.  It makes a 12oz serving though and I don't have a cup large enough but that's an easy problem to fix.  It's not very strong, it's not bitter, I like it. I use one teaspoon of sugar and skim milk.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WDCCU4">Gevalia Morning Roast Coffee (Medium, 12-Ounce Servings), 14-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: A decent, large-sized coffee
review/text: I find the Signature Blend from Gevalia to be the best, but these Morning Roast discs are fine when you want a larger, travel-mug-sized serving. The flavor isn't as nice as the Signature Blend (which I find to be excellent), but it's still OK. It's a little milder than a normal cup of coffee, but I didn't find it overly mild or tasting watered-down. And it does make the right amount for a travel mug, filling it to a good level.<br /><br />If you like taking a travel mug of coffee with you when you leave in the morning, then these discs will serve well.

review/summary: Starbucks, no; Folgers, maybe
review/text: If you are searching for a replacement for Starbucks coffee discs, keep going.  These discs produce a very weak cup of coffee, possibly because they put in enough coffee for 8oz but this makes 12oz. I brewed/tasted two cups and threw out the remaining discs.<br /><br />That said, not everyone one likes Starbucks coffee.  This may work for you if, like my mother-in-law, you think all Starbucks coffee smells like wet goat and prefer Maxwell House or Folgers.

review/summary: Disgusting flavor and after-taste
review/text: How a supposed Swiss company can create and call this "coffee" is inconceivable to me.  Gevalia's Cafe Crema is acceptable, but this stuff doesn't even qualify as coffee in my book.  Even with milk this tastes like burnt metal.  I've had better coffee out of an army ration.  Anyone who rates this higher than one star has either never had real coffee, or drinks their coffee while smoking a cigarette.  Disgusting.

review/summary: My Favorite T-Disc
review/text: The Gevalia Morning Roast is my favorite T-Disc for a few reasons:<br /><br />First, the large size.  During the week I want to fill my travel mug as I head to the bus and this disc makes the perfect size cup.  Big enough to satisfy my coffee fix but also leaves just enough room for a little milk.<br /><br />Second, it is a great mild flavor.  I'm not a coffee snob and I don't need anything fancy.  Just an easy to drink cup and this works great.  I've never had a chemical taste like another reviewer mentioned.  I like some of the Starbucks discs, but I don't think their flavor really makes them worth the extra price you need to pay - especially since you need to make two discs for one full travel mug.<br /><br />Finally, this is the disc that I have the least problems with exploding.  I like the Tassimo system in general, but I frequently have problems with grinds getting into my cup.  The Starbucks discs almost always have some sort of explosion which leads to a mess in the machine and grinds on the bottom of my cup.  I don't have that problem with this disc.<br /><br />If you are really picky about your coffee then this might not be the brew for you.  But if you just want a nice, standard large size cup then this is really great.

review/summary: Very Good coffee
review/text: Gevalia is our favorite coffee for our Tassimo. The Morning Roast brews a 12 oz cup, which is nice as you run out the door in the morning. It's lighter than their Signature Roast (which I probably prefer), but that brews a smaller cup. We'd had a Keurig previously, and I like the coffee with the Tassimo better (largely due to the availability of Gevalia); it's brewed hotter and stronger and the cups are larger (more fluid ounces). I do wish they'd make organic coffees, though!

review/summary: "Bigger" ... NOT
review/text: No flavor at all.  If you want watered down cofee then this is for you.  Despite making a "larger" cup all they due is push more water through the same amount  of coffee as their other products (almost too little as it is IMO).  I expected the discs to be larger with more coffee but unfortunatly that was not the case.  They just send more water through which ends up watering it down and then they have the nerve to label it as "medium".  I suppose if you want a mild coffee then this is the one for you, but not if you want something with even a shred of taste.  My only solution has been to swap the cup out about halfway through the process and dump the second half of it.  Otherwise it would have been a complete waste.

review/text: I normally order our Tassimo beverages from Amazon since it ships so fast via Prime, but this time the Gevalia morning roast we received had a really bad, metallic taste to it. Not sure if that's because the coffee itself is old or if it was just a bad batch. Other pods we had in the cupboard (Starbucks espresso) tasted fine, so it's not my machine. I'll order straight from Tassimo direct going forward.

I'm glad to report that there were no heart palpitations, no jittery  nervousness,and no restlessness.  (with coffee I'm bug eyed for the majority of the night) What I did experience was mental alertness.<br /><br /> Since the morning is not my "cup of tea" (pardon the pun), and "the night of the living dead" (or more precisely "IT rose from the bed")  describes my attitude toward a new day more than the phrase "rise and shine"... this is a welcome relief.<br /><br />  There is a slight bitterness to the flavor, so you might have to aquire a taste before you can enjoy it. However, to be truly awake first thing in the morning without all of the nasty side effects is worth the effort. Yes, to the horror of some, and the amusement of others..I can think first thing in the morning again.

review/summary: Best "Chocolate milk" you can have
review/text: My three year old son loves this and drinks about three glasses a day.<br />We both have malnourishment issues so I try to make sure any food we eat<br />is as healthy as possible. This drink mix has made it possible for my son<br />to not need supplement in a pill form. It does not taste like Hershey syrup,<br />but my son doesn't mind because he has never had Hershey syrup. It is hard to dissolve in cold milk so I mix it with warm water first then add the dissolved "syrup" into the milk. I make it in a shaker cup and I make enough for at least one day and that works well. Oh and once it's open it needs to be kept in the refrigerator. You can buy it at Whole Foods and some Vitamin stores but it's cheaper on Amazon. We have been using this for about two years.

review/summary: Great taste, glad it is healthier than regular chocolate milk as well
review/text: I bought this at Whole Foods and was really pleased with the taste.  Though I have tried the other powders made for adults before, I always found them hard to drink.  This tastes just like chocolate milk, and it is just an added benefit that it has added nutrients.

review/summary: Great item....Horrible waste of money on amount that is actually in the container! FILL IT UP!!!
review/text: Hello! I agree that the fact that the can is not full is a waste of money and I think that they should fix that immediately.  The taste is different and maybe not so sweet like actual chocolate milk but that is why its good for the kids.  I have never used this with only water because its chocolate and it just seems gross! I always use 1 oz of water and mix the powder in and it completely dissolves then i add in the milk and mix it and my very very very picky fussy 2 year old son loves it!!!! He wont touch veggies no matter how i season them or cook them, he eats only a few fruits but not enough to satisfy the daily suggestions.  So this is quite a life saver for me! I have used it for my self not the kid version and i love it to although i have tasted this version as I taste most things before i give them to my son and it wasnt bad at all.  So the only complaint i have is that the can is not full and the amount of money spent on one can is really outrageous! FILL UP THE CAN AND MAKE IT WORTH THE MONEY YOU CHARGE US FOR IT!!!!

review/summary: best way to get my kid his veggies!
review/text: maybe this is just coincidence but since starting to regularly drink the wild berry amazing supergrass for kids, our 8 year old has slowly started to develop a taste for vegetables.  a couple of years ago he would only eat fruit but refused any veggies--particularly the green leafy kind that are so good for you.  not wanting him to just depend on multi-vitamins for complete nutrition, i found the amazing supergrass products and decided to give it a try.  it was a great decision.  the wild berry flavor was perfect for him because he liked the fruity taste.  because it is actual wheatgrass and veggies, the superfood powder does not completely dissolve like koolaid would--there's still a sediment that remains after you mix it with water.  i thought this might be a problem, but my son just chugged the whole thing and liked it.  needless to say we were delighted and kept giving it to him.  we still tried to make him try some veggies, and after he drank the superfood for awhile he became more amenable to it.  now he eats spinach, broccoli, onions, and carrots!  now i'd never make the crazy claim that this superfood will make a kid like veggies, but whether it was pure coincidence, acclimation to digesting or tasting the veggie "sediment" that is leftover, or psychological acceptance of ingesting vegetables and feeling perfectly fine--it worked!  we will continue to supplement his diet with this wild berry superfood.  as a parent i seriously couldn't be happier with it.

review/summary: Kids love it, and think it's a treat!
review/text: I bought this product in hopes of getting some vegetable nutrition into my kids. Being vegetarians I have always worried about them getting enough vitamins and nutrition to grow healthy. Since they are only 2 and 17 months old, lets just say they are less than pleased with all the veggies! So after finding this i gave it a try. I was shocked at how much they love it! The nice thing is that it has a great chocolate taste, they think they are getting chocolate milk everyday... which is just like a treat to them. I have noticed a vast improvement on they amount of energy they have and there immune system even seems stronger. I would greatly recommend this product for kids or adults. Getting your kids there greens has never been so easy, and prices you can't beat!

review/summary: I drink this every day
review/text: For close to 2 years now, I have been drinking this every morning.  When the entire family gets a cold, I still get it, but mine starts later, and ends before the rest of my family.  I have found that the powder needs to be mixed with a little bit of yogurt before adding milk.  It just doesn't dissolve in milk very well.  But does great in yogurt.  I used to get hungry by 10am and need to constantly snack until lunch.  But between the super food drink and maybe a muffin, I can eat lunch a little later (1:00 instead of 11:30).<br /><br />I know this is the kids version, but I enjoy the taste of this one so much more than either the chocolate or berry in the adult version.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it would be nice if Amazon would carry the larger 100 scoop size of this.

review/summary: My kids like it.
review/text: I have two children ages 5 & 6. They used to love fruits and veggies until they got subjected to undesirable eating habits at school and outside our home.  Suddenly the broccoli, bananas, apples, whole milk (only wants chocolate now, thanks public schools!) and whole wheat bread WITH crust on it became a daily struggle at our house. They learned that many kids get away with being a picky eater and now it's war at our house.  They now try and demand crust to be cut off sandwiches.  Won't do it. They ask for Koolaid and sugary juice boxes.  It's a fight for a moment until they realize they're not going to win. (Makes me want to homeschool at times or raise my kids in some kind of African village far away from civilization!) Our kids get their fair share of junk food but this culture is innodated by sugar and unhealthy foods at every turn, in everything down to "healthy" kids yogurts. I got desperate to find something like a health shake for them to supplement what they're not getting..  I had read the reviews on Amazing Grass for Kidz and thought I would try it out. Because our rule is that they need to try something once, they loved it.  Matter of fact, wanted seconds right away.  We make it with banana and milk to make it into a shake. Now, they get one everyday.  And, watch out, it helps with their bowel movements. ;)  I'm happy to have found something like this and had friends buy it for their kids.  My husband and I bought the adult version of the same thing.  I'M SOLD!  It's still a struggle to get them to eat as healthy as we would like but I'm happy to know they are getting some of what they're missing in this powder.

review/text: My kid loves chocolate milk. Or did until I got this, thinking I could sneak some veggies into that little stomach of his.  Mixed it up, didn't tell him I had made the swap and handed it to his little smiling face.  He ran away, came back and gave me a full glass back, telling me it was "icky".  Later, out of the blue he declared "mommy, I don't like chocolate milk!" I'm now trying to figure out how I can sneakily hide this stuff in other foods until I get rid of it.  Maybe chocolate cake?<br /><br />If it tastes as bad as it smells, I can't blame the poor guy.<br /><br />I also do agree that the packaging is terribly wasteful.

review/text: I have to put this in a travel cup for my 5 year old or else he won't drink it.  He is too use to the smooth and chocolate colored chocolate milk.  It turns milk into a greenish cast and no matter how you mix it, it is a bit gritty but it does taste good.  I think its worth it for the benefits but when it comes to young ones, the way it looks matters the most.  It might just be my son but he totally thinks greenish milk is not cool (maybe because he associates it with veggies that he doesn't like).  I will still purchase it in the future because the positives out way any negatives.

review/summary: Love it!!!
review/text: I've tried many diff kinds of green powder and had to choke it down by mixing it with a strong flavored juice. It would defeat the purpose! All these nutrients in a processed sugary juice.  No good.  So i decided to get this chocolate flavor at whole foods... to my surprise it blended very well in a smoothie with only a HINT of a green taste.  Oddly enough, when mixed with milk it has zero after taste and actually tastes quite like chocolate milk.  It tastes more like an ovaltine than a nestle quick. But if kids don't know the difference they should take to this pretty well!  The key is to dissolve in water first then add the milk.  I've been adding to almond milk and drinking it right up without having to have a "chaser."  Today I mixed with a half a scoop of "super seed" fiber (also purchased on amazon) and threw in some hemp seeds with almond milk and it tastes great! Like chocolate covered nuts.  Really enjoyed it and will be using this method to get in my daily vegetable intake.  I also would like to mention the amazon price is most definitely the best deal-- especially when you do subscribe and save. 5 stars!

review/text: I bought both the Berry and Chocolate drinks for daughter; however, she preferred the berry since it is sweeter.  I love the facts that it has a rainbow selection of vegetables and fruits some of which my daughter doesn't like to eat like spinach and sprouts.  Like another reviewer, I am also not thrilled with the fact that the powder drink contains "Natural flavor" which could mean msg.  When I approached a sale person at a major health food grocery store, he didn't even know what natural flavor is.  Since we ran out of the powder, I am hesistant to buy this same drink and feed my daughter because of the "Natural Flavor" ingredient.  It will be while until I find a good wholesome powder drink for my daughter since originally I planned to replace this drink with her vitamins' intake.  I give 3 1/2 stars since it has the natural flavor ingredient.

review/text: This product does not disolve easy with just stiring, I threw mine into the blender to get it mixed well. I would highly recommend anybody interested in this product should go to their local healthfood store and buy the individual packets first. These packets are single servings of the product and sell for a dollar something, this is a good way to try the product out to see if it suits your family without wasting a ton of money. This is what my husband and I did, we bought two of the chocolate flavor and one of the berry flavor and have tried both out on my preschooler. She didn't seem found of either of them, the choclate has a very light chocolate flavor and it had an overpowering after taste of the greens. The berry was just way to sweet I've read people compare it to koolaid and that would be about right if you like your koolaid with 2 extra cups of sugar in it. I have used the second chocolate packet in a breakfast smoothie for her with bananas and peanut butter and that seemed to get ride of the after taste and she seemed to enjoy it.If you don't mind being creative and doing a little extra work to mask the flavor of the greens this product could be a healthy addtition to your childs diet.

It's great because my 4 yr old son does not like to eat fruits and veggies so this sort of helps supplement his diet given the fact that the powder is a blended mixture of fruits/veggies (he does not know this!)

Well, insert Amazing Grass Wild Berry here. He drinks it in juice and has even done it with just water. Yay! Even our younger son likes it in his sippy cups.

review/text: I just opened the canister.  It was seriously 1/3 full.  What a waste of space.  I like the product, though.  But I may have to look for something else.  I have purchased greens for myself from a variety of companies over the years.  I have never seen anything like this.

review/summary: Kids don't like it
review/text: I have a 5 year old boy and 3 year old girl.  I mixed it with water.  The girl refused to drink it after one taste.  The boy drank a little, but didn't want to finish.  He then tried it with apple juice, but just couldn't enjoy it.  My wife and I tried it and didn't like it either, so I can't blame the kids.  This stuff doesn't dissolve completely either, so it looks like your drink is full of sand (I swirled diligently).  I don't know what I'm going to add this stuff to so that it doesn't go to waste.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the can is half empty, which I think is deceptive marketing.

He won't touch a single thing that I put this product into. I have tried mixing with yogurt, in a smoothie, in juice, in a PBJ, etc. No luck. I guess my son is just very pickey because this has a ton of positive reviews about taste. I have even tried the chocolate flavored and he turns his nose up at it. I even tried mixing the chocolate powder with chocolate milk and he still doesn't drink it!

review/text: The ingredients are pretty impressive, but I am not sold. First off, the packaging of this is very wasteful, 3/4 of the container is empty..making you feel totally ripped off! My 7 year old wont drink without being mixed with some sort of milk, which you really have to blend because the powder doesnt dissolve well. A well balanced, largely plant based diet is really the best route to go in the long run. The quantity and price of this product is a joke.

review/summary: Excellent Juice!
review/text: You have to try this juice! I love pink grapefruit for its intestinal cleansing and weight controlling effects on my body. Even in California, though, it is not always available. Here is a non-alcoholic cocktail that is exciting to behold, then imbibe. In a stemmed water goblet place some cracked ice, then cover with this juice nearly to the top. Also have on hand Lakewood Organic PURE Black Cherry or Lakewood Organic PURE Concord Grape Juice. Pour the dark juice down one side of the goblet. The effect is that the dark juice goes to the bottom, but swirls throughout when you tip the glass to drink. This keeps the two flavors separate but complementary. I feel as special when I drink this, as I have whenever having drunk a 20 year old port! Once you have tried Lakewood's Organic PURE Juices, you won't want to spend your money on anything else. BTW: Whole Foods doesn't carry the Pink Grapefruit, but Amazon PRIME does!

review/text: I was actually first introduced to Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning during my first visit to China back in 01. My wife's former teammates are from Louisiana, and apparently they brought this stuff anyplace they went. Although we don't bust out the Tony Chachere's at restaurants, my wife does use it in a lot of meals she prepares. It has a very slight kick to it so our girls (ages 4 and 7) do not like it, but we are definitely fans of this seasoning. It's great in eggs, mac 'n' cheese, soups, Mexican meals like tacos and burritos and more.

(Those who reviewed it there complaining of too much salt don't use it as sparingly as I do, I suppose . . . I use it as the description says, "instead of salt.")

The only real contender is "More Spice" Tony's, which has less salt and more spice (as you might guess from the name, see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00161DVFS">Tony Chachere's More Spice Creole Seasoning - 7 oz.</a>), but they're essentially the same.

review/summary: This stuff is amazing!
review/text: Take something simple like a bowl of plain white rice. The taste on a scale from 0 to 10 is probably a 5 (i.e. neutral). Add a little bit of Tony  Chachere (and perhaps some olive oil?) and right away the taste jumps to an 8 or 9. This stuff is amazing. It really brings up the flavor of your food and it goes well with so many different food items like chicken, turkey, or even vegetables. The only negative is the high sodium content and I have not tried the sodium-free version as I haven't seen it in stores. The regular T.C. adds less sodium to your diet than regular salt and tastes a lot better :) Amazon usually has great prices but for some reason this product is overpriced here so I would just buy it at Walmart for less than two bucks.<br /><br />1/24/12 update:<br /><br />I finally found the sodium-free version in a health food store and all I can say is WTH??? It doesn't even taste (or look) remotely like the real stuff. My advice is to stick with the original recipe.

review/text: I discovered this seasoning while searching shopping one day. I was looking for another seasoning and realized I own a few dozen hot sauces but basically no pre-made seasonings. I spent a good 20 minutes in the aisle looking at stuff as other shoppers walked by. There's are so many choices out there that it's hard to made a decision on what to buy! This was the first item I came up with, it has the most ounces and is also the cheapest! The taste is amazing and the best of the four seasonings I bought. Nice and spicy!! I've used it on pizza, soup, chicken, pasta, etc. and it's been amazing every time. It's become a favorite and I think the possibilities of using it on food are endless.  I give it 5 stars! Great product! Glad to have discovered it!!

Depends on your personal tastes, I guess, but we both really like the moist, chewy texture and they're really sweet without any added sugars or other sweeteners.  I can see where they would be great for baking, but we buy them for snacking -- I like the fact that because they don't need to be refrigerated after opening, I can take them on long car drives for a healthy snack (and one that doesn't make a mess and leave crumbs in the car!)  A serving of these along with a bottle of water makes a perfect mid-morning snack - quick, easy, healthy, and filling.

review/text: If these are as nutritious as they are tasty, it's a fabulous alternative to real apples. These are NOT the fully-dried apples you may have had. They are partially dehydrated, with a nice chewy texture. They are a little tart, but I'm not sure if that is the apples or the sulfur dioxide. It's a pleasant tart, in any event. Hope sulfur dioxide isn't a dangerous ingredient, as it's all there is except apples.<br />Quality of the source fruit is excellent - no core, seeds, skin or other "bad" bites.<br /><br />I should also mention that this is a rather large serving.<br />I snack on these in my office, and one bag serves as about four 120-calorie snacks for me.<br />So it's a much better buy than it might appear.

review/summary: The bag lied
review/text: I bought this thinking I was getting a bag of dried apples. It even says "DRIED APPLES" in the ingredients.<br />They're good, but this isn't what I wanted.<br />Dried apples are hard and crispy, not soft and chewy.

review/text: The flavor is ok, but, the product contains sulfiting agents.  Good product, just not a "whole" food.

review/text: I was surprised by the lack of quality and taste of this product.  I thought it tasted of the chemical preservatives.  I was however able to use the product in baking.  I would not buy the product again.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: As others say they are rubbery and all the crisp texture is gone.  The taste is "fair".  The remaining quality is ok, just a few harder pieces from the inner apple made it into the package.<br />The inside packaging also has a soft chemical smell as well.  Maybe too much preservative?  Not sure, but I'm not terribly happy.  I've had better luck with other brands that are similar but seem to retain some level of crispness and seem much fresher.  I will go with something else next time.
