review/summary: My dog loves these!!!!! Much easier to chew than old formula!!!
review/text: My dog really loves these and she is old, so it really helps with keeping her teeth clean.  The original formula did cause a some dogs to have bowel obstructions and die in a very unpleasant way, but this is a new formula, easier to chew, but still helps keep the teeth clean.  They are not cheap, but my old girl absolutely lives for these things.

review/summary: My Dog Loves Greenies
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S9K4PY">Greenies Treats for Dogs Monster Treat-Pak 50 Petite, 30 Ounce</a>My little Jack Russell loves Greenies! The new and improved Greenies are much softer than the earlier variety and I give them to my terrier as a special treat. She loves them more than any other treats. I like that they don't stain or leave any residue and they don't smell like some other dog treats. My other dog is indifferent to them so you might want to try the smaller package to see if you dog likes them or not.

review/text: I bought these as a treat for my dog and he started vomiting about an hour later.  I thought it was something specific to that dog but when I tried giving them to my other two dogs- they both got sick too.  I think they eat them like a treat rather than chewing on them and then they block their digestive tract.  Whatever is going on, I wouldn't purchase them unless you don't mind dog vomit.

review/text: I was a bit doubtful about the product when I bought it, but I wanted passion fruit for a recipe and could not find it anywhere else.  However, this frozen pulp is great.  The sugar content is 10%, so it does not require much adjustment to use for cooking.  Compared to the cost of the raw passion fruit the price is also reasonable.  I will be buying this product again

review/summary: Another Excellent Hodgson Mill Product
review/text: I went online to purchase the Hodgson Mill Whole Wheat Lasagna noodles with ground flaxseed, but Amazon was out of stock on the product.  Reluctantly, I opted for this product instead, and I was not disappointed.  My wife and I both love these noodles.  While we prefer the flaxseed noodles, these noodles do offer one benefit.  If you are cooking for others who might not be health nuts, they probably won't even know they are eating whole wheat noodles.  Our usual flaxseed noodles are unmistakably different from regular lasagna noodles.

These noodles boiled very well, and tasted amazing in my lasagna.<br />I used a little extra olive oil in the pot while boiling - they did tend to stick a little more to the pan than regular lasagna noodles.<br /><br />I used the extra noodles to make soup. I just boiled and cooled noodles then cut up into smaller peices to put in soup.<br /><br />I also tried these noodles in a dessert recipe that I love - and it was a big hit!<br /><br />I'm happy that there are alternatives for health available on [...].

review/summary: Ice Cream, anyone?
review/text: If you've never thought to drizzle a little Balsamic Vinegar over your vanilla ice cream, chances are good you've never had authentic, aged balsamic vinegar.<br /><br />The difference between this and the typical grocery store balsamic vinegar, is night and day.  I honestly can't tell the difference between the $3 and the $15 dollar vinegar at the store, because neither are quality, just prettier packaging for the $15 bottle.  That's truly NOT the case with this superb 14 year old vinegar.  It's delicate, slightly sweet taste is absolutely heavenly.  Though admittedly, at this price, we use it only about once per week . . .but are signed up to receive it automatically every three months.<br /><br />If you enjoy balsamic vinegar, there's absolutely no doubt you'll notice the difference immediately.

review/summary: GOOD cookies if you like peanut butter
review/text: I love peanut butter, so i did enjoy these cookies. i'd never ordered this brand/type of cookie b4- there were so many fabulous reviews i decided to try. the cookies weren't 'fabulous' or the 'best in the world'_ but they were good. i think those reviewers who said they were the best probably ate them when they were younger- and the cookies remind them of simpler/better/good times- along with tasting good.<br />The cookies are rather large, and almost 100 calories per cookie. they're rectangular in shape. crispy. 1.5 grams protien per cookie because of peanut butter. they're large enough to take the sandwich cookie apart- top and bottom and eat it like 2 cookies- the peanut butter creme tastes good. each cookie is about 3 bites. 2 bites if you take large bites, 4 bites if you take small bites. since i separated the sandwich i got about 6 bites.<br />_I ordered mine June 2012 and the 'best if used by' or 'expire' date is Oct. 2012.<br />they were $10 for 4 bags of cookies, so it was a great deal with the free s/h. only a couple of broken cookies total. i would recommend and buy again

review/summary: Makes a superb middle of the road curry,
review/text: I've tried Patak's curry sauces in the past and don't think much of them, they're too sweet for my liking. I have had a lot more success with their curry pastes. They do need a little more preparation than a simple cook-in sauce though and this is perhaps their strength & weakness. This particular dish requires you to marinade the diced meat (overnight in the fridge is best) in the sauce - half a jar for 4 chicken breasts. You then brown the meat in a wok with the marinade, add a tin of chopped tomatoes and finish with some plain yoghurt.<br /><br />As you can see, it's not something you can throw together at 5 minutes notice, but neither is it a complicated dish. However, the end result is a very convincing curry. My family are sissies when it comes to currys, but this is a perennial favourite. Not too hot for them and not too mild for me.

Divided into 4 it is an excellent appetiser. In 2, a very flavourful dinner. Serve with or without rice though, no gravy; no need for rice!<br /><br />Patak's have taken an Indian dish and, given the irregularity of the spices, standardized it as much as possible. Given that you can actually get Tikka that isn't as dry as the Sahara (read: most US Indian Restaurants), it's certainly worth a try.

I believe they may have used bad yogurt.<br /><br />This was a good grocery solution to tikka masala at home. It's not going to be as good as your favorite Indian restaurant but, if you follow the directions and go with the recommended overnight marinade, the chicken will be tender. I did not go with the optional 1/4 cup yogurt added in at the end of the cooking process. It was still very flavorful and unmistakably tikka masala.

review/summary: Its alright
review/text: Let me begin by saying that this is my first review of ANYTHING on amazon even though I have been shopping here for more than 4 years. I usually like negative reviews of products because too often people will give glowing reviews to mediocre products that don't deserve them. I myself am not the type of person to whole-heartedly endorse anything without reservations - everything has room for improvement in my opinion.<br /><br />With that said, I liked Patak's Tikka Masala Paste when I used it; however, I did not follow the directions on the package. I was following a Chicken Tikka Masala recipe from America's Test Kitchen when I used it. I had alread spent 3 hours cooking other things in the kitchen and I was dead on my feet. When I realized that I did not have any tomato paste in the cuboard, it came down to using this or a can of Tomato soup. I chose this. I used less than the recommended amount on the jar because I had alread included my own spices in the curry. Also, I used about 2-3 times the amount of other ingredients (such as cream/yogurt/chilies/stewed tomatoes) than the Patak jar calls for.<br /><br />My Tikka Masala came out wonderful(there is the endorsement), but - as I mentioned - I used it as an additive to my spice blend not as the whole thing (there is the disclaimer.)

The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: A Treat My Dog Loves
review/text: Happy Hips are one of my little monster's favorite treats.  She is a very finicky eater but she will obey and be sweet for a chance at these chip like treats.<br /><br />This product was recommended to me by another dog owner as a healthy treat because it contains no fillers, byproducts, antibiotics, or added hormones. It also has vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy joints, which for a French Bulldog that has problems with hips and joints, is a plus.  I feel better about giving the little critter a healthy treat instead of the garbage contained in brand name treats on the market.<br /><br />One huge red flag is they are made in China, which certainly gives me pause, but I will keep buying them.<br />I have only tried the beef liver variety and will stick with it since my little creature likes them so much.

review/summary: Three out of Three Dogs plus one Cat love these
review/text: I have been buying these chicken jerky treats every month via Amazon's subscription for the past six months and the bags aren't enough for the three dogs and one cat who love these treats.  All I have to do is shake one of these bags and all four come running into the kitchen.  Even the well-behaved old girl walks in hoping for her treat.<br /><br />These are the only treats I feed my dogs.  They don't get junk dog biscuits or fake sausages that smell like turpentine.  All they get are these treats, two a day per dog.  When I take them out hiking, they get extra treats for extra energy.<br /><br />The cat always insist on his own slivver, too.<br /><br />These treats are easy to pack, don't spoil easily, don't smell and are a lightweight and healthy treat for any four-legged pet. Sure, the treats are a bit pricy but my pets are worth it.<br /><br />UPDATE 24 Feb 2012:  My subscription over the past year kept going up, from a very reasonable USD 19 to a shocking USD 28.  That last price hike was just too much so I cancelled my S&S and am now buying a competitor's product that is much more affordable.  I took a star away because this product is now longer affordable.

review/text: My 3-year old Akita is very picky when it comes to food, and usually refuses most of the standard dog treats. This is the only thing he visibly appreciates; BTW, when offered Chicken Happy Hips of the same brand he's not as interested.<br /><br />The only downside is the price; don't ever buy it in retail stores - they charge 2-3 times more than online retailers. Even then it's rather expensive.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

review/summary: GREAT results with continued use at the prescribed dosage!
review/text: My 10 year-old black pug has problems with her back left hip and knee. Sometimes, the leg goes out on her and she ends up on her butt, unable to get moving again. I started feeding these Happy Hips treats to her a few months ago, but did not realize that I was not feeding as many as prescribed which is 1 jerky treat for each 7.5 pounds of body weight. She did show some relief at the lower level. However, after realizing my error and increasing the dosage to the recommended level, she now shows FANTASTIC results. After 3 weeks, she chases her squirrels, she and her cat brother play chase, and she hops right over puddles. She has not had her back leg go out on her this entire past month. She's a real dog again! Just know that you must be patient - it took 3 weeks of daily use at the recommended level to see the full results. This product has worked so well, I now have it on auto-order.

review/text: I came across these treats months ago in Target when I was looking for things  to make my dogs first vet experience a more pleasant one.<br /><br />They were the healthiest things in the store, believe you me!<br />My dog really liked these.<br /><br />I did go on the site and everything looked kosher but I was eventually scared away from them b/c of the whole 'Made in China' issue. She is eating other treats right now but...I'm willing to give Dogswell another try.<br />H*ll, look at all of the recalls occurring within OUR borders....and the bulk of us are still eating beef.

review/summary: Price is right and my dog loves them
review/text: My Jack Russell has problems with patella luxation. I decided against surgery after researching the success rate of it and 5 years after it was diagnosed she is still OK. I keep her weight down and give her plenty of long walks to stengthen her ligaments. The vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so I give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread. My dog loves the chicken strips, the price on Amazon is better than me buying the indivdual packs from the store and having the glucosamine in it is another way for me to administer glucosamine to her in a way that is tasty.

Since my original review, I have checked this product at Consumer Lab. According to their lab results this product has only 6% of the glucosamine and 14% of the condroitin that it claims. Don't buy it expecting to help your dog with joint problems<br /><br />  MJG

One of my dogs has very bad allergies, he can only eat certain foods, specifically lamb and rice, and not chemical fillers. The Happy Hips fit the bill, they are quite wholesome.  My dogs are getting a bit up in years also, and it is good for them to get a dose of glucosamine and condroitin.

review/text: We have three dogs. One (Shaunty) is a Bishon Frise. Shaunty has had a tendency of developing "hot spots", a dermatitis type problem. Our vet recommended we switch to a duck and potato dog food, which we did. All three dogs love the  duck and potato dog food so the switch was easy...although the dog food is expensive. Anyway, when I saw these duck jerky treats I had to try them. We've been buying them monthly on Amazon's subscribe and save program and all our dogs look forward to their daily treat. You can buy this product with confidence.

review/summary: Caused diarrhea in one dog, vomiting in the other
review/text: I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product.

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: We've been buying happy hips for a while - online and at stores. I feel that if I'm going to give my dog a treat, one that's closest to something "healthy" should be it. My dogs LOOOOOOVE them, I think it's their fav. Treat by far. I'm subscribed to Amazon's delivery so you do get them for a little less money and you don't have to think about going online and buying them, you will automatically get them. I love that feature - would recommend using it if you buy these regularly.

review/summary: Happy for Happy Hips!
review/text: I have 3 very active McNab...working cow dogs.  The oldest two have shown a vast improvement in their flexibility and agility.  Kessler and Hootie are "just like new", and they are 13 and 14 years old!  Rita, our 4 year old loves Happy Hips too.  I think it's good to start them on these while they are young. These "treats" are so pure and nutritious.  I don't ever give my guys rawhide, but like rawhide, the Happy Hips are a little tough to chew and that helps clean their teeth.  Our guys like the duck as well as the chicken.  I'd like to recommend that you subscribe to these so you don't ever run out!  I get a monthly shipment of each flavor and we're good to go!  Thank you Happy Hips for helping my guys live a happy, flexible life!<br /><br />Deb Phelan<br />San Luis Obispo, California

review/summary: My dog is addicted!!!
review/text: My great dane has two torn acls and has arthritis in her hips... and she is ONLY three. Well we have done one surgery and will be doing the second next spring when she is healed. In the mean time I needed to find some DIFFERENT way to provide her with Glucosamine. Since she is so picky I needed something in a treat form. These are her FAVORITE thing to eat! I went to Petco and was going to buy ONE bag for $35 and realized this offer was for THREE bags at the same price. I could not be happier and neither can she. She has only been eating them for three weeks and is not even limping on her surgical knee (its been 8 weeks and it takes 12 weeks to fully heal). Even our vet is surprised she is doing this well and the only change was these treats! I recommend them to anyone who needs to help their pet enjoy their life to the fullest! BUY these! You wont regret it!!!!<br /><br />PS - I also bought the duck and she loves those too :)

review/summary: Too dry and sharp
review/text: I had previously purchased the chicken and the duck from this line so I wanted to try the beef liver.<br />Well, my dog likes the flavor but I don't like how dry they are. They have very sharp edges and I had to be creative to soften them a bit so that my dog wouldn't suffer from a rapture in the esophagus while eating them as they are. The other 2 (chicken + duck) are a little chewer than this one. I would not buy this again unless texture improves.

review/summary: Ok for an expensive treat; not for a supplement
review/text: Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label. The dosage amount of Glucosamine/Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere.

review/summary: Not so sure because
review/text: I hope this may help others whose dogs love this treat like my fussy Lhasa Apso but she's nearly 16 yrs. old and I found she suddenly developed an insatiable thirst; which then caused so many frequent late night forays to go outside to relieve herself we lost hours of sleep. Thinking it was her age we let it go for awhile then I decided to take her off the varied brands of dehydrated chicken breast (all without additives) and within a week she no longer empied bowls of water and had to go out all night long. It may react on her differently because of her age but for others who may experience this problem you may need to take your dog off this type of treat...I'm now using the Purina Chicken Carvers (I know chemicals) but she no longer is having problems..go figure... I guess dogs are all different too huh?

review/text: My 60 lb dog LOVES these.  She is very picky about food and treats, but eats this readily.  She needs the glucosamine/chondroitin for her knees and even if I hid the pills in cat food, peanut butter, you name it- she wouldn't touch it.  She also has allergies to a lot of common ingredients (chicken, beef, wheat), so really this treat is a lifesaver!

The cost here on Amazon is fantastic too because the stores have been charging me $7.99 a bag. (NYC prices yikes)

review/summary: Great made in China product for dogs.
review/text: I've noticed that quite a few people don't seem to believe the labels of products made in China, when it is usually a U.S. company that dictates what goes into the product.  Besides read the labels of products made right here--a vast majority of them contain toxic to humans & animals ingredients--everything from paint & varnish to the food is tainted with these toxic chemicals & all made right here in the U.S.A.  So, if you can trust a U.S. label--why not trust a Chinese label?  These treats are sure a hit with our dogs--all 7 of them love the chicken, lamb & rice, & the duck with glucosamine & chrondroitin.  We buy this type because of our older dogs with severe arthritis.  Our 15 yr. old was almost beyond walking until we started feeding him these snacks & our 9 yr. old Chihuahua's hip problems are much improved. On S&S these snacks are the cheapest price that we have found & with free shipping--Keep 'em coming Dogswell & Amazon--yes, even from the dreaded China.

We started her on Happy Hips and in less than two weeks, she was a pup again... running around and enjoying life.  And, she runs to the kitchen in the morning to beg for her "treat" because she loves the taste.  What a great product.  Thank you so much.

No matter how fussy your dog, or how limited his or her dietary restrictions, these treats not only drive them wild, but have added goodies to improve their health. Ya' can't go wrong! I also would try the other varieties (heart health, breathies, vitality) each has a lil' something to address your dog's specific needs, and above all, they will love 'em.
