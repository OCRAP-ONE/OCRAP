review/summary: Be Careful!! Made in China
review/text: My bull terrier loved this toy. It's long lasting and the only toy that my dog didn't destroy in 10 minutes. I thought it was great until he came down with a fever and intense diarrhea and a low grade fever after getting a piece of it out of the toy.  The vet said that it was recalled a few years back but couldn't find out why. She said to stay away from any pet things made in China as there are no regulations on the making of them.  I won't be giving them to my dog - please be warned and make an informed decision before buying it.

review/summary: My dog loved these but they are far from everlasting.
review/text: I have a 1 year old lab/australian shepard mix, 65 pounds, and she tore through the Everlasting treat in 5 minutes.  She liked both the beef and the liver flavors, but I was expecting more from this treat.  I figured the treat would at least last an hour.  I still like to give this treat to my dog because it breaks into small pieces versus a rawhide bone that can tear into large pieces and cause choking or digestion problems.  Ordering the treats save about 40% of the price I pay at my local pet store.

review/summary: Worst Smelling of the Lot, but the Dog Loves Them
review/text: First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really "everlasting" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a>.<br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: The liver discs SMELL. Well, they ALL smell, but these are pretty pungent. I try to make the dog play with it across the room, whereas the other flavors aren't nearly as off-putting.

review/text: I have a golden retriever who loves these treats and they are a good chewing alternative since she has started having some anxiety when left alone.  They last longer when placed in the treat balls but it can be a pain to get them into the ball so I have given them outside the ball as well.  Like I said doesn't last as long but still keeps her busy for a few hours.  If you don't have a power chewer it should last longer but a few hours is the max around here. My dog enjoys the different flavors and she rarely puts it down until she has finished it!

review/summary: Liver licious
review/text: I bought a 2-pack of the chicken flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very "everlasting" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (Liver and Vanilla Mint). I've got a Chicken and a Liver treat in the ball now and she enjoys them both. It takes effort now to enjoy it, and she works on it for over a week until there's nothing left but a treat disc left in the ball. The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it. The Vanilla Mint is her fave though.<br /><br />Two paws up!

These were pretty good, we didn't have the treat ball, but my dog had to work at this and he enjoyed the chewing (he goes into some sort of zen trance when he's got a nice hard chew).<br /><br />I am happy to learn that the manufacturere has done independent testing to assure that these treats are safe and made with unadulterated ingredients as well.<br /><br />They didn't make too bad of a mess while my dog at them either, no stains on the rug where he was chewing it. I'll try more and maybe try the treat ball too.

review/summary: Great treat for a great toy !
review/text: My dog LOVES this flavor, though he also loves the other flavors as well!  I swear by these treats and the Everlasting Treat Ball which these cookie treats fit in.  I have to keep a constant supply of these cookie inserts on hand just to insure that I don't run out.  It takes my dog about a week just to get through one of these cookies because the dog's can only scrape off small amounts of it at a time rather than gulping down big bites quickly.  If it weren't for these cookie inserts and the Everlasting Treat Ball, my puppy would have chewed through all of my furniture, so I can not say enough good things about them.  I will not be without them and have recommended them to my friends, whose dogs love them too.

review/summary: Good treat, but only safe with ball
review/text: This is a good product to use in combination with the treat ball. My Cocker Spaniel uses a medium size. Probably wouldn't be good for a large dog, with a stronger jaw.  The ball itself is made of a sturdy rubber/plastic that is flexible but enduring. My dog's a chewer, and she hasn't destroyed it yet. The Everlasting Treat disks used in combo with the ball seem safe. I wouldn't give the dog the treat on its own, because of the choking hazard. But when in the ball, my dog can only lick and get small bits of treat at a time. It's a good toy and treat to keep a dog occupied. As for the price - I can get a 2 pack of these treats for $7 in a pet store.

review/summary: 11lb dogs: Ball + 2 treats (1 on each side) good for 2/11hr spans of time
review/text: My dogs are obsessed with these.  First I bought the wrong ball - don't be confused with the treat ball where you put small treats inside.  I nearly died when I realized that i needed to buy TWO balls that were more than TWENTY DOLLARS EACH!!  (thinking: "these had BETTER be good")<br /><br />My dogs are 11 lbs each and I got the medium ball.  I think that's the right size.  I gave them each a ball with a treat in both sides.  After two days gone to work (22hrs in total) they've eaten the treats.  So I have to spend at LEAST $7 per dog to utilize these balls for 2 days out of the week.<br /><br />Hmmm...this is like a smoking addiction or something.<br /><br />If you need for shorter periods of time; i.e. while you watch a movie, dinner, gone for  coupla hours, GREAT toy.  I do have to be careful because my two dogs will fight over one ball when another is sitting a few feet away.  I guess they REALLY like them.<br /><br />Good luck.

review/summary: Not everlasting but long lasting, the second time around.
review/text: We have a 5 year old Saint Bernard. It's hard to find treats that can stand up to her for more than 20 minutes so I thought I'd give these a try. First one disappeared literally within 5 minutes. Disappointing. Gave her the second one and it lasted for 2 hours. I suspect the first was broken into pieces and chewed that way, whereas the second was chewed on as a single piece making it last longer. She did enjoy them - a lot. As for it I will buy one again, I'm unsure. She did enjoy it but not enough for me to buy the ball that goes with to make them last longer. So my opinion, go ahead and buy it and your pooch is sure to enjoy it - but it's  50/50 if it's going to occupy them for 5 minutes or 2 hours.

review/summary: Keeps my dog busy!
review/text: I have been ordering the everlasting treats for a while now and they really are a great way to keep my Goldendoodle busy.  I have a very bright and powerful chewer who likes to be part of the action at all times.  I only bring these out every few weeks or so because she looses interest if I give them to her too often.  The only down side I would say is that she works on them for so long her paws do have a tendency to get a little smelly and wet so they do need to be cleaned off afterwards.  The key is a treat ball - keep an eye on it.  Once they get stretched out the refills are too easy to pop out.

And they tried to pull the treat out, but there was no way that was going to happen.  Eventually one dog figured it out -- Lick it, like a liver popsicle.

Mine came shaped in the "fence" design as advertised, but also had two pieces of bamboo shaped into a heart!<br /><br />I liked that it was sold without a vase, so I could pick out my own design.  I bought a really nice rectangular vase and black river rocks at Target for less than $20.00.  I would absolutely recommend buying this for yourself or a friend!

Maybe because of the taste.  I don't want to put it on salad and drag it out, and it is just very hard for me to swallow a tapblespoon of oil.

review/summary: Dream Water works for me - at half dose.
review/text: I am a nurse that works night shift and travels frequently. Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.<br /><br />Then, at the airport in Long Beach, CA I found Dream Water. I was a little shocked at the price but decided to try it anyway. Because it was expensive, I tried half a shot and it worked, well, like a dream. A whole shot makes me do weird things in my sleep, but a half shot makes me fall asleep and get a good 6-8 hours with no hangover effect - even during my severe episodes of insomnia.<br /><br />As a nurse, I would like to recommend that you be careful taking it every day. One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case. I haven't had any side effects, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Also, be careful mixing it with certain other meds used to adjust mood (anxiety/depression meds) or other sleep aids - even natural ones. Just a heads up.

review/summary: Pricey but effective
review/text: I have used every sleep aid under the sun (& moon ;) from Ambien, Lunesta, to Diphenhydramines, natural remedies and more.  None were effective, and unless you enjoy the bizarre side effects from the prescription options (personally I found rather unpleasant and gave a hangover) nothing got me to sleep or stay asleep.<br /><br />As a huge skeptic I considered "Dream Water" to be another load of over promises, but bought one anyway, probably because of the neat packaging and weirdly appealing "Snoozeberry" flavor.  Well in short, I am writing this review because after a week, it has worked for me.  Though I do not feel particularly tired by midnight, I am able to fall asleep and stay asleep with this product.<br /><br />The ingredients listed (Melatonin etc.) are nothing new to me, so I am unsure why it is effective or the mixture of their "Proprietary Sleep & Relaxation Blend 150mg) but I cannot complain.  Zero calories and tastes nice too.<br /><br />So overall, I give it 5/5.  Should it stop working (fingers crossed it does not) I shall revisit this review later.  Best of luck to the other insomniacs out there, and sleep well.

I've taken all three of these supplements contained in Dream Water together, and they still didn't pack the punch of Dream Water. Truly an amazing product. It delivers.

review/summary: SOPORIFIC SHOTS!
review/text: According to the National Sleep Foundation, 63 % of Americans don't get the recommended eight hours of sleep a night. Not good. As well as screwing up your work day, being tired can lead to getting fat! Sleep deprivation can have neuro-hormonal effects. Studies show it leads to elevated levels of serum ghrelin, which is our appetite-stimulating hormone, and lower levels of leptin, a hormone that tells our brains when we're full. As a result, we take in more calories and thus gain weight. Not to mention, fatigue can also make us sedentary.<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter and on Facebook and on Google+<br /><br />there is a relationship between sleep and health, including weight. So as hard as it is to get seven to nine hours a night, your health depends on it. Prescription sleeping pills are usually the go to to treat insomnia but they don't provide the kind of sleep your body needs, not to mention their serious addictive properties. I'm always on the hunt for non habit forming, all natural sleep aids and I've found a great new item that seems too good to be true.  It's called Dream Water. And it really is a dream. In fact, celebs are snatching it like diet pills. Even Bill Clinton is a fan!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001V75LHS">Insomnia</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00137ZKIQ">Insomnia</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451184963">Insomnia</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805089586">Say Good Night to Insomnia</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456492543">The Effortless Sleep Method:  The Incredible New Cure for Insomnia and Chronic Sleep Problems</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402765746">I Can Make You Sleep: Overcome Insomnia Forever and Get the Best Rest of Your Life!

review/summary: He Likes It, But....
review/text: Our toddler went on a visit to the grandparents last week. When they brought him back they brought along a gallon of whole milk and a container of Nestle Nesquick Strawberry Powder Drink Mix. They said he liked the drink mix. Well, I don't doubt that. The kid just loves milk of any kind. I've never found a taste enhancer to be necessary.<br /><br />I'm probably not going to be using the strawberry drink mix. Right on the front of the container it states that it is 25% less sugar. Hmmmm. Less than what? Out of curiosity, I turned the packet around and found out that sugar was the only food ingredient, if you count sugar as a food. All other ingredients are additives. Well, why should I be giving my kid heaps of additives including sugar with his food when he already loves the pure milk? Our doctor told us to cut down on the boy's sugar intake. All this does is add to it. Oh sure, it might supply a few extra vitamins and minerals but, let's face it, the only food ingredient in this product is sugar. Look over the nutrients yourself, if you like. On the back of the package, it even states that when mixed with low-fat milk, the resulting mix is filled with protein, carbohydrates and happiness. Well, I don't know about the happiness, but all the protein and carbohydrates are coming from the milk, not the sugar-based mixing powder. Personally, when I'm in charge, he's going to be getting the pure milk.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Hardly the best I've ever tasted
review/text: I am an enthusiastic fan of Sorghum. Have spread it on toast as if it were jam or jelly for more than 50 years.  And I was down to the last eighth of an inch in a jar a friend had picked up for me at a farm stand in Ohio.<br /><br />When I unpacked my 42 once jar of Amish Sorghum I noticed the label message that "Cirtric Acid added to prevent crystalization."<br /><br />That puzzled me, but I was looking forward to finishing off the old jar so I could try the new sorghum. When I dipped my spoon in I found it to be very thin,similar to a rich pancake syrup.  Most pure sorghum is much thicker and doesn't need to be treated by citric acid for any reason and I have had an open jar on a cupboard shelf for months without problems.<br /><br />This tasted fine, but at the end it had the aftertaste if honey. I believe these folks may be cutting their sorghum with honey. This is not the first time I have purchased a jar that was not pure sorghum. I have purchased it direct from farmers and found it was not the real stuff.  And that's what I think is the case this time.

review/text: Had a craving for the "sorghum molasses" that I grew up eating on biscuits in the morning and there's really nowhere in California to buy it.  Just received 2 jars with high hopes.  Taste is not what I remember.  If you grew up in Kentucky, Tennessee or the western part of Virginia, this product may not be what you are expecting.  Don't get me wrong; the taste is not really bad, it just doesn't have the texture or true tang of the "molasses" that used to be so common in Appalachia.  Could be the addition of the sugar-cane molasses, or the citric acid that gives it a texture and aftertaste that's not familiar.  Maybe it'll make good cookies.  Guess I'll keep looking.

It will be mostly blank yellow with raisins here and there.  There will be very very little citrus peel and they will all be orange and not green.<br /><br />The picture looks more like a dense fruit cake with dried cranberries, raisins and citrus peel in equal portions filling the inside with some green citrus peels here and there to add color.<br /><br />I happen to like raisin bread so it tasted fine to me, but I've also had the real thing with the citrus peels which looked similar to the picture at a party before, it looked presentable and tasted great and sadly this was not it.

As soon as we arrived home we ordered two tins along with a waffle iron.  They cook up perfectly and the flavor is just right.  Flavorful, but not enough to overpower the taste buds.  We have only tried the original, but will try the other flavors when we grow tired of it (not likely).  By the way, we also overheard many other guests at the hotel commenting on the delicious waffles as well.

review/summary: Awesome taste and low in Weight Watchers Points
review/text: After trying the waffles at a hotel, I bought the mix.  The first time, I made it per the package.  They were delicious.<br /><br />But then, I joined Weight Watchers and figured my waffle days were over.<br /><br />Not so.  I tried making them without adding the melted butter that the directions call for.  I was shocked to discover that it made very little difference in taste.  Still delicious!<br /><br />My recipe (which makes 3 plate-sized waffles) is:<br />1 Cup of the waffle mix<br />3/4 Cup of water<br />1 egg<br /><br />All of that equals a 3-point waffle (makes three servings).  To save more points, add sliced strawberries and Cool Whip Free and it is a very big tasty breakfast.<br /><br />I've had these waffles about once a week over the past six months and I'm down 44 pounds!

review/summary: Carbon's Golden Malted
review/text: I purchased this waffle/pancake mix from Amazon because when living in south Florida we went to Disney World over 100 times and then moved to hillbilly NC (unfortunately). We still drive down to Disney though. When staying at Caribbean Beach Hotel (our favorite due to restaurant/food choices) I asked a chef what type of waffle mix they use for Mickey Mouse waffles. He told me what they use which is Carbon's Golden Malt. The mix is delicious, light and great waffle mix.

review/summary: must Be Tweaked
review/text: I bought a 3 pack shortly before I bought my new waffle iron.  With both items being new I was open to experimentation.  The mix in my opinion is 4 stars only after you add milk not water and eat it with butter and syrup.  Adding so little water makes the batter really thick and the water really brings out the malt.  Skip the water add a generous amount of milk and only then will you have a tasty breakfast.

review/text: My Husband & I stayed at a Inn in Branson,Mo this summer & they served waffles at breakfast using this mix! They were delicious & I vowed to purchase a waffle iron of my own just so I could whip these up at home! We got a waffle iron before I ordered this mix though & bought Krusteaz waffle mix from our local Wal-mart in the mean time to test out the waffle maker. Krusteaz mix is easy (need eggs & oil) & doesnt require melted butter like Carbons Golden Malted & tastes awesome, much like what we had at the Inn in Branson! Yet I couldnt wait to get my Carbons Golden Malted waffle mix in the mail & had ordered 6 tins of it! Thats How much we loved it at the Inn where we 1st had it! Now I know how good it was which is why I am shocked to be writing this review... We made our 1st batch of waffles using this mix & was sort of put off that we had to add melted butter unlike the Krusteaz store bought which uses oil instead! Aside from that the waffles didnt come out full like all the others we had using the other mix & tasted VERY BLAND wasnt even a little bit malted flavored like we remembered. Had a almost bitter bland flavor, we thought maybe we did something wrong & made a whole new batch & yet again tasted awful! We did use water & not milk however thats what we used with the Krusteaz brand too & it was very good! I cant imagine milk making it have a better or sweeter flavor & am sure that the Inn where we stayed used water rather than go through the expense of using that much milk for a free breakfast for their guests!!! My husband even said next time we should try milk & add some vanilla extract to the mix, which perhaps will make it taste better however that is just to mask the awful bland flavor it has! I considered giving the rest of my tins to people for Christmas however wouldnt want to embarrass myself now knowing how bad it tastes! =( I hate that Im giving the mix a bad review because like I said it was wonderful when we 1st tried it in Branson, maybe some how we received a BAD batch or something either way we are sitting on 5 1/2 tins of UNWANTED mix!!! We Really want to send it back, but waited to long!!! Hope this helps you all as for us we will be buying th yummy Krusteaz mix from our local grocery from now on & I only gave it 2 stars because I know how good it supposed to be!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Very little dark chocolate - mostly some kind of artificial cherry flavored caramel-like filling, which made the whole thing taste the same so had to look to see if there was a cherry in there at all.  The shell had broken and the liquor leaked out of some of them and dried in the trays.  Packaging is very wasteful, with plastic trays that could contain twice as many candies, though at least they're recyclable.  Definitely not the chocolate cherries of my youth.

review/summary: A family favorite
review/text: For many years for Christmas and birthdays our family would buy a box of Queen Ann Cherries.<br />I don't know how it started but our children would buy a box for daddy every year and for almost any reason.<br />He just loved them, they were filled with a nice liquid center and hardly every crystalized, that happened a few times but for the most part the centers were nice and  juicy.  The kids used to watch dad get all gooey (on purpose to make them laugh)  then when our children grew up the little grand kiddies would take on the roll of candy givers.<br />Sadly grandpa is gone now but we still buy each other Queen Anne cordial cherries in his memory.  It has become part of our lives and it would not be Christmas without that red box under the tree or on a pile of birthday gifts.

review/summary: Tastes great and great for you!
review/text: First off let me say that I have been eating vegetarian and soy made meals, burgers, and other concoctions for nearly half my life, from the really great tasting to the not so great tasting. So when I stumbled on this burger mix in my local bulk foods section I jumped on the chance to taste this stuff and am VERY happy I did.<br /><br />Making the burgers is very easy, just add the same amount of warm/hot water to burger mix, stir well, let sit for a while, then form into a patty and cook. Very simple and easy to make. What I like to do is make a bunch of the mix ahead and stick it in the fridge so you can enjoy one almost anytime you want.<br /><br />Now these burgers aren't meant to taste like a beef burger, I would say they are an alternative to the "real thing". They are well seasoned and have a great hearty texture to them. Throw them on a bun with some fixings and you have yourself a very health lunch, snack, or dinner.<br /><br />So in addition to my regular veggie burgers that I buy, this mix has become a staple in my health lifestyle and would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to meat or even some of those really untasty soy burgers that are out there (there are a few, I know because I ate them for years).<br /><br />PROS:<br />Easy to make.<br />Doesn't taste like beef or any of the frozen soy burgers out there, so if you don't like beef or any of those soy burgers give this stuff a try!<br />Can be made ahead of time and stuck in the fridge.<br />Very healthy, low sodium, yet tastes very well seasoned.<br />Other things can be added to the mix.<br />The mix can be added to regular hamburger to create really tasty meatloaf.<br /><br />CONS:<br />If not mixed with the correct amount of water patties tend to become extremely crumbly and fall apart.

review/text: We like this because it is simple to make, use it at home and camping.  Low calorie and fat, decent fiber and protein.  Cant find it locally, so we order from Amazon.<br /><br />It can get dry and stick to your hands when forming the patties- oiling your hands with olive oil when forming the patties makes it much easier.  We also add a little oil to the mix.  Fry slowly in a little olive oil in skillet or on an electric griddle type grill.  Add more oil to mix if the patties end up too dry.

We make our Fantastic Burger mix into small patties and freeze them.  Its then easy to take what we need for each meal from the freezer. You can microwave them on high for about a minute each to get a firm texture.  We're going to try baking them as well as making a "meat" loaf with the mix.  We really like this product.

review/summary: Nature's Burger - I love it
review/text: One day over 20 years ago I detected a wonderful smell in my kitchen and it turned out to be some Nature's Burger mix + water being prepared by one of my house mates. He was letting it soak in preparation for frying. Eventually I bought some in bulk at the local market and I've kept some on-hand ever since. Occasionally I make a Nature's Burger instead of a hamburger when I have the impulse. Since I only make this occasionally, I keep the mix in a bottle in the refrigerator to ensure freshness. It seems to stay fresh for years if kept this way. Today I glanced at the list of ingredients posted where I buy it in bulk for $2.99/lb:<br /><br />1/4 cup (47 g) Nature's Burger:<br /><br />170 calories<br />25 calories from fat<br />8 grams protein<br /><br />I figure that these burgers cost less than 1/3 of meat burgers, are very tasty and nutritious. What's not to like?<br />- - - -<br />Feb. 24, 2011 edit:<br /><br />Today I went to replenish my supply at the Berkeley Bowl and see that the price/pound has been jacked up to 4.29. Argh! So, I inquire if they have the boxes (I remembered that buying it at Amazon was barely more than the bulk at the Berkeley Bowl), and was directed to where it would likely be if they had it and sure enough they had a selection of various Fantastic Foods products in 10 oz boxes. The price/pound was about the same as bulk, so I got a box. Currently, Amazon's price (comes to 3.33/pound) is easily the best I can get so I'm buying 12 boxes here.<br /><br />This is cheaper than ground beef, and I figure better for you in a lot of ways, though it's probably a bit lower in protein content. Anyway, it's quite delicious and easy to prepare. Lately I soak 2 oz in 3 oz water for a few minutes. I don't bother to use my hands to form patties, I just scoop it out of a rounded bowl using a rubber spatula and press down with utensils to form the patty right on an olive oiled cast iron skillet. Fry on one side and press lightly with a spatula to flatten somewhat after turning, then fry the 2nd side. I like them between toasted whole wheat bread slices with a little mayo and some lettuce and perhaps a slice of red onion.<br /><br />Edit 3.11.12: Lately I think these are definitely on the salty side, but I'm still eating them very regularly. I get a box of 10 boxes sent to me every 3 months, it's 15% off that way, with free shipping. I'm now adding 10% by weight of egg whites powder and storing in a bottle, once I open a package. This adds some protein, and the fried patties come out nicely. My formula to form a patty is to boil 2.6 oz water and pour over 1.55 oz of this mix, stir, and after sitting about 30 seconds, pour onto a hot skillet, flatten a bit, fry both sides over low-medium heat.

review/summary: NB is a delicious breakfast patty too!
review/text: Not just for lunch, snacks, and dinner, but anytime!  I'm having a delicious NB breakfast patty right now.  Shelf life is positively incredible: This box said Best by Sept 2006 but is still just fine! Today I've cooked up the last of the mix I had made up in the fridge for about a week. Sometimes I've kept on hand some NB muffins as grab-n-go snacks or as quick entrees-for-one, since my family won't even try it. (all the more for me!)  Last week I made and savored a Nature's Burger Patty Melt, toasted crispy whole grains bread, toasty/caramelized onion, crispy NB patty, a smattering of mustard to bring out the zing of the (imitation) cheddar cheese. Serve with kosher pickle and baked chips, so good and satisfying. Another way I like NB, I have some super zesty relish and NB takes the inedible heat off the relish so I can enjoy the pepper flavor. Very important: veg oil will keep patty from crumbling and/or sticking to hands and pans.

review/summary: 1 box enough for 3+ meals, tastes even better as a leftover
review/text: I used to be able to find these locally but the store stopped carrying these. I was wondering if they stop making them, which would be a shame.<br /><br />1 box of these will make at least 3 very filling adult meals. I shape them by hand into approximately quarter pound- sized patties. (the size a quarter pound ground beef patty would be) and it makes exactly 6.<br /><br />It's one of those foods that tastes even better as a leftover, reheated in the microwave.<br /><br />If I had to pick nits about anything, I'd say that since this is for a box of a dozen boxes, you will probably (unless you are a total veggie burger addict) need some pretty generous expiration dates. In the past when I got them in the grocery store, the dates are typically 2 years off but these came with 6 months to expiration. I don't know what exactly would go bad with them but I'm just sayin'.

It is low fat though and I am more than happy to feed it to my family it was just not what I was expecting from the claims on the box.

review/summary: Great taste and healthy too
review/text: I have slightly different method of using Nature's Burger. . .<br /><br />I found that I could never cook the burgers enough to keep them from tasting too mushy - unless I fried them so long they started to burn. And that's not very healthy.<br /><br />So, I cook the mix as if it's a kind of scrabble - just put the hydrated mix in the pan with a little oil and stir fry it until it's as brown as can be without burning.<br />Then I set it aside for an hour or so to cool. I find that setting it aside lets it dry out a bit, and reduces any mushy consistency - I prefer the texture of this result.<br /><br />I make enough for a few days. Then I pull it out of the fridge and put a layer of "scrabbled" Nature Burger on a slice of bread with some fixings like mayo, tomato, ketchup, honey mustard, etc..<br /><br />The mix tastes quite good on its own - sometimes I just nibble on it - but it's really good if you make a burger and doll it up a bit.<br />It also works well for burritos or shawarma.<br />My housemate says it makes the house have a great aroma.<br /><br />I'm giving it five stars because I like the taste and I practically live on it. If you look at the list of ingredients it's all really good stuff.<br />Also I don't want to be the only one not giving it five stars  ;-)

I just wish there were more recipes out there!<br /><br />Also, for people that have had probs....the trick is as it is spelled out on the box.  One part Nature's Burger to one part boiling water.  Let it sit for like 15 minutes.  Rub oil on your hands when making the patties if it is too sticky.

review/text: I'd bet that this is pretty good- my dogs thought so! ha!<br />Bought some of this in bulk from the local natural food store, and planned to use it last weekend.<br />I'd not purchased this before, so only purchased ~ 0.5 lb, and was going to make 'meat' balls for spaghetti for dinner.<br />Unfortunately, I had placed the bag in a location accessible to (normally non-foraging) canines. (Am not irresponsible- just didn't think they could reach there!)<br />I arrived home (granted- one hour late from the pups' normal feeding time) and found only a thin plastic bag and the twist tie left, with the bin number written on it.<br />The mix had been COMPLETELY consumed by three medium sized dogs (likely just two, knowing their typical behavior), with only a very light dusting on the carpet left to give a clue as to what had been consumed.  It was a POPULAR find, as they often just don't finish off their 'kills', as the sport alone (conquest/capture) is largely sufficient without complete consumption.<br />A call to the natural food store ('just what was #96?') confirmed that it was this mix, and a websearch confirmed relatively benign contents that did indeed 'pass in the night' (and for the next few days)- and all is well.<br />Would not recommend this method of ascertaining quality/palatability, but am looking forward to my next (SECURE) purchase to try this mix!

review/text: The chocolate covered fruit is a nice treat.  Although they have a variety of fruits in every bag, my favorite is the chocolate cover apricots. I've ordered this product more than once, they make nice gifts, which my recipients have loved.

review/summary: somewhat misleading...
review/text: I saw this product recommended in a cookbook, and couldn't wait to try it.  I am a vegan, so I went to the product website to check the ingredients. Surprisingly, the website did not have a list of ingredients, but it did specify that the product is "a zero calorie, zero fat, vegetarian and kosher seasoning that makes everything taste like bacon."  I ordered the BaconSalt, but was very disappointed when it arrived.  The ingredients are extremely unhealthy...I would never put this on my food.  Among other things that I can't pronounce, this product contains corn syrup, monosodium glutamate, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, hydrolyzed corn and soy proteins, artifical flavor, yellow 6 and red 40.  So YES, it is vegetarian (not vegan...it contains lactic acid, and the red food coloring is derived from insects), but NO, it is NOT a healthy product.  So unless you're one of those vegans who lives on french fries and diet soda, this is NOT a product you want in your spice cabinet.  I wish there had been a product review on BaconSalt when I researched it on Amazon.  I definitely would not have bought it if I had known how unhealthy this seasoning is.  You'd be better off eating bacon!

review/summary: best salsa ever
review/text: All  of Bonnie"s country classics are fabulous. The Peach corn salsa however, is absolutely the best we have ever tasted. It makes you want to eat it out of the jar with a spoon.

review/summary: Very Bland
review/text: As per other reviews, I find this coffee to be strangely without flavor. I say strangely because it looks like coffee and smells like coffee, but tastes more like water. I really hate to leave a bad review and I never have before, but this one is a "no go".

review/summary: Good value but not for the discerning palate
review/text: As mentioned by another reviewer, this did not arrive vacuum packed and I suspect this item may have been older stock.  Grinds into a decent cup of coffee but not one to savor.  Perhaps I am a bit jaded having been recently spoiled with several pounds of rich full bodied coffee beans.<br /><br />I give this the benefit of the doubt and 4-stars.  Although bland, it is drinkable and not overly acidic.  The most important factor for me, is that I got a great price for this.

review/summary: Surprisingly Tasty
review/text: I've tried several flavors of Hormel Compleats (not because I adore the stupid spelling, let me assure you)); and this Meatloaf flavor I think is the best of what I've sampled.  If it weren't a Compleat (which by Hormel's own apparent definition must me edible and little more), this would get my five-star applause.  I grade on what is offered.<br /><br />Yeah, the potatoes are OK.  The gravy is at least better than some others.  The surprise?  The meatloaf has some real flavor!  I'm not normally a big meatloaf fan (didn't care for the singer, either); but this really ain't bad at all.  Has spices and tastes like somebody really tried on this one.<br /><br />I don't mean to slap Compleats around, really.  I actually eat a lot of them; but not because I'm looking for delicious meals.  I'm looking for quick and easy meals.  As an old fart living alone, I don't much like to spend time cooking things up.  And I can't eat stuff from Schwan's all the time, nor can I too often pop in on neighbors at mealtimes.  These Compleats re generally fine for what they are (though please note my review on chicken & dressing).  I appreciate most cultures.

review/summary: Delightful surprise ...
review/text: I wasn't expecting this to be as good and filling as it is. I do have a modest appetite. I discovered that the meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and gravy actually satisfied my appetite. The meatloaf is nice and firm, not mushy, and the potatoes were definitely better than the frozen portions in things like tv dinners. I'll eat some veggies later to round it out.<br /><br />If it had less salt I would definitely give it five stars. Then again, I've had saltier foods that are labelled 'healthy foods'.<br /><br />This is a real bargain, especially if you order under 'subscribe and save'.<br /><br />Coming up ... the chicken and stuffing/dressing.

review/summary: good meatloaf, so-so potatoes, TONS of salt
review/text: I do understand that meals like this are typically high in sodium, and I didn't expect this one to be any different. I didn't score it down because of the sodium content.  The meatloaf here is quite tasty. Very soft, nicely flavored. Not like the meatloaf I make at home, but good in its own right.  What I didn't like so much was the side of mashed potatoes. The meatloaf nukes quickly, but the potatoes seem to stay "hard," and what I ended up doing was taking the plastic cover off, putting the whole mess on a regular plate, smushing the potatoes with a fork, and heating the whole thing up for about 30 seconds more. That seemed to do the trick, and I enjoyed the potatoes then. I liked the gravy, too, but it was a bit salty for my general taste. I ended up scraping off most of it and tossing it rather than eating it.<br /><br />I do like the idea of having these in my office for an in-a-pinch situation where I can't get out to get something  healthier, but I'd say that no one should eat these with any regularity if salt is an issue or if healthier options are readily available.
