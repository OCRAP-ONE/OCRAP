review/text: I received a birthday gift of these chocolates and was eager to dive in. Unfortunately they were a gloppy mess having melted during the shipping process by US MAIL. I don't know if they are good or not. What a disappointment. Shouldn't perishables be shipped another way? I won't order these chocolates again till maybe November.

review/summary: Great Cat Food!
review/text: I have a diabetic cat. I tried dry prescription foods only to see my cat gain or lose very little weight. When my vet recommended<br />a prescription wet food that was $2.00 per can, I was curious as to what made it worth that much and determined to find an alternative.<br />After going to said prescription food website and copying down the nutrient percentages, I was off to find something comparable. What I found however, was much better. The prescription food was full of liver and by products as the first ingredients on the label. Before Grain lists Tuna as the first ingredient and has no by products or liver in the list. Before Grain also has the protein, fiber, and moisture content that the prescription food boasts. I was also shocked that my veterinarian prescribed food was NOT even approved by the AAFCO. Before Grain IS an approved food. My cat goes nuts for this flavor and he has lost some weight<br />as well. Although if your cat is diabetic like mine, I do not recommend switching your cats diet without the consent and guidance of a vet as diet changes can change insulin needs. This food has worked well for my cat and I will continue to purchase it.

review/summary: My cat loves it!
review/text: I wanted to make sure that I gave my little one products that had little to no fillers and that definitely had no grain.  I grabbed this at a local pet store and am very happy that I did because my cat loves it.  When I tried giving him the chicken formula, he decided that he rather go hungry than eat it but this flavor, he gobbled right up.  I do have to mash it down a bit and mix in some water so that it has a gravy-like consistency that is more appetizing.  Once he's done, he just lays there contently licking his chops.  It makes me feel great knowing that I'm giving him something that is a healthier alternative to some other brands.<br /><br />ETA: I forgot to add in that the reason for the 4 star review is because of the consistency.  I wish it had some type of gravy with it to entice my cat to eat it without me having to fiddle around with it.

It is not my favorite to have "plain", that is to say with just butter and Parmesan cheese.  For that type of meal I prefer the brown rice pastas over the corn.  All in all I do enjoy and recommend this pasta as a great gluten free option to add variety to your meals!

review/summary: Corn! Ewww
review/text: I am a goof ball, I was so happy to find a gluten free pasta with all positive reviews, and was so fast in buying the pack, so I didn't notice it was made of corn! I dislike corn with all my heart, besides, I am slightly allergic to it. I have tried it though to try to make it up for stupidly buying something I should have not. And it tastes bad - I mean, it has NO taste whatsoever. I thought I would have a gluten-free alternative to a nice taste of pasta, instead I have got the corn horror with no gratification to my pasta cravings. I am very, very sad, but it's my fault: I should read "labels" better. I would have returned, it, but it's way to heavy to pay for shipping. Sadly Sad.

review/summary: Grain of the earth
review/text: I ordered this grain because I am following the Ultra Metabolism 21 day detox phase...ok, stop the eye rolling. It's basically about removing potential allergens (diary, etc.) and cleansing yourself from processed foods -any sugar, hydrogenated oils, white flour...and although I dont eat that stuff in general, it's amazing how many "all natural" foods have high fructose corn syrup (many Marie's dressings, etc.)<br /><br />Anywho- my amaranth arrived quickly but one bag had burst open - the packaging was a joke! Amazon shrinkwraps books so they sre sealed air-tight, yet bags of grain soar freely in their big Amazon box, begging to explode.<br /><br />The other bags remained in tact - the stench from the grain takes getting used to. It smells swampy to me, but my sister says that's just "earthy."<br /><br />It's a complete grain and it cooks up nicely as a hot cereal - and it pops like popcorn, too.

I then added the split peas, the entire seasoning packet and the amount of water the recipe called for...threw in a couple of bay leaves for good measure... and cooked, covered on low, according to the instructions printed on the box. After simmering for about 30-minutes, I added a couple of fistfuls of cubed ham that was left over from our Christmas dinner. This is the best split pea soup I have ever eaten. My husband has always claimed he does not like split pea soup so he was more surprised than anyone to discover how much he really likes THIS split pea soup. I plan to stock up on more of this soup and some other varieties from Buckeye Beans & Herbs. Since I can make soup this good with practically no effort, I cannot wait to taste Buckeye's other soup packet mixtures.

It is not earthy at all, which for my mouth is a very happy thing as I find earthy teas to be quite reminiscent of brewed dirt.<br /><br />If you like mild teas, you'll love this one, but if you tend to prefer stronger tasting teas, I wouldn't recommend it.  I brew it double strength for iced tea (two teaspoons per 8 ounces instead of one) which makes a great flavor, but I have tried to make it stronger and using more tea really doesn't add more flavor.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good, Surprisingly Effective
review/text: My throat was killing me today, and on and off this week.  I decided to make myself some tea despite the heat and sort through my old tea collection to cull some teas that the food pantry can use up better than I can.<br /><br />The Yogi cold sampler nearly went straight into the food bank box until I saw "Throat Comfort."  I scanned the ingredients and liked what I saw:  all recognizable and nothing that I'm aware of being an allergy risk for me.  (eg, no lemon grass . . . though companies can change their ingredients, so check the label on your box!)<br /><br />The relief was immediate.  I made a little surprised, happy noise at the first sip.  The pain relief doesn't last long between sips, but oh my, this feels good on a sore throat!<br /><br />This tea has an almost artificially sweet aftertaste to me, though there are no ingredients I recognize as sweeteners on the box.  It's probably the organic fennel seeds and organic licorice root, which are the top two ingredients.  I have strongly mixed feelings about licorice and will skip black jellybeans, but I always liked fennel.  This tea is delicious, and maybe a little too sweet or anise-y to take seriously as a regular daily tea, but for a sore throat it's heaven.<br /><br />I wonder which ingredients get the job done, as I have to confess I'm now a full believer in the product.  I drink green tea almost every day at work, and it's wonderful stuff but didn't help my throat like this did.

I may go off on a taste testing spree to find "others" that I might like, but I know that I can always come back to Vanilla Cupcake and it won't disappoint!  I will add a packet of Splenda and a dash of cream to make a delicious "dessert".  It satisfies my craving for something sweet and I don't have to feel guilty about it!

review/summary: Delish!!!!!
review/text: I am not a very big coffee drinker, but do like to have a cup every once in awhile. I definitely don't like a bold, strong coffee. I like a very faint coffee taste. So I figured I would try this brand and flavor to start. I really like it. It has such a nice, rich, warm vanilla taste to it. Depending upon how much milk and sweetener you put in it, it could almost be like a vanilla latte. I am glad I tried it out, it has a great taste.

review/summary: One squirt is all it took
review/text: I had never tried this product before nor heard of it until I came across a vegan recipe I wanted to make.  Incredibly, low sodium soy sauce has an astonishing 575 mg. per tbsp.  Bragg's Liquid Aminos only has 160 mg. per 1/2 tsp.  One squirt adds a lot of flavor.  The first time my husband and I tasted it, we were impressed.  It is better than soy sauce.  Has an all natural mild taste loaded with flavor, but not too salty.  Would be excellent on vegetables, soup or  rice.  Liquid Aminos also contains 16 essential and non-essential amino acids.  I had a hard time finding this product in a regular grocery store.  There are no health food stores near, so I was delighted Amazon carried it.  I will never go back to soy sauce.

review/summary: Umami Flavor Without the Sodium
review/text: If you have to watch your sodium, this is the product for you. It seasons your food with a nice umami seasoning, sort of like pot roast, just a nice hearty "beefy" flavor that is kind of hard to describe but you know it when you taste it. It is especially good if you are transitioning to a vegetarian diet and learning to get along without meat. This will help you feel like you aren't missing a thing. Add it to soups and casseroles, put it in stir fry, season the water that you cook rice or quinoa in. There are so many things you can use it for. Best of all if you have to watch your sodium for health reasons, this product will season your food without adding sodium the way soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce does.

review/summary: Deliciously different little wafer cookies
review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

This cookie is amazingly delicious.  I like sweets that aren't too sweet, with just the right hint of sugar.  These are cookies just like that.  Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies.

They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies, but they're a little richer and a little moister.  I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.

review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/summary: So delicious
review/text: This very crispy sugar wafer is perfect with ice cream, or with coffee or tea.  It's got a lovely burnt marshmallow flavor.  I really like these- they seem to harmonize with anything.  I'm allergic to GMo cornstarch, so it is hard for me to find cookies I can eat.  This one is lovely, and it's safe for me to eat.

review/summary: Absolutely Wonderful!
review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

review/text: If you've had these cookies already - no one needs to sell them to you. I would just recommend that you keep them in the freezer. That way they're sort of hidden from you (and others) but for some reason freezing them brings out the taste and consistency of the chocolate. Try it!

review/summary: Bahlsen Dark Chocolate Cookies -  A Treat
review/text: I don't know what Bahlsen was thinking over the last several months, but I looked high and low for these cookies in supermarkets and specialty stores...none were to be found. Then, after checking with Amazon (and its tracking mechanisms), Voila! I ordered a whole case and that should satisfy our deep appreciation of these cookies... a perfect blend of high quality dark chocolate and a crisp, thin "chocolate vehicle"--i.e., cookie.

review/summary: Good with coffee
review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.

Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad.

I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!

review/text: I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.

review/summary: Another great Dorset product, with tons of raisins and a berry twang
review/text: I am on the record <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00269FEIG">elsewhere</a> saying that Dorset Cereals are the best mueslis in the world, and I'll stand by that. For my personal taste, however, the nuttier mueslis outpace the fruit-packed ones -- such as this one.<br /><br />This muesli has a strong fruit taste, but despite the "berries and cherries" name, the fruits are mainly raisins and related types like sultanas. Berries, blackcurrants and dried cherries provide a distinctive and tangy flavor that outweighs their relatively small volume in the overall product mix. Still, I docked a star from the review because I feel the name is a bit misleading. Berries and cherries actually account only for a very small percentage of the fruit mix.<br /><br />Despite my nitpicking, however, this muesli -- with its walloping 50% ratio of fruits, nuts and seeds -- still stands head and shoulders above most other types, except the nuttier Dorset brands. If you prefer a fruity to a nutty muesli, jump all over this one, it's made for you.

review/summary: Excellent cereal, if a little expensive.
review/text: This cereal is one of the best available. In fact, all the Dorset Cereals are worth a try. From a nutritional point of view this is a well balanced breakfast that you can feel good about eating. My only gripes are: 1. There's almost too much fruit, making it sweeter than I'd like, and 2. It's still a little expensive compared to other breakfast cereals, although I realize that it's not necessarily fair to make such comparisons. A price of less than five dollars a box would be ideal. Highly recommended, buy with confidence.

review/summary: Cheese Sauce Makes the Meal
review/text: We used to pick this product up retail but it seems all three stores we patron stopped selling it within the same week. I suspect collusion on their part... Anyways I was thrilled to find that Amazon not only offers the kit, but at a subscribe and save discount.<br /><br />Some have mentioned that you could piece this together yourself cheaper/better/healther, and that is a valid point, but one thing you cannot buy in a store (I've looked) is the old el paso somewhat spicy cheese sauce that you cover the top tortilla with. Without this sauce the kit is worthless, it's a great balance of spice and salty cheese and comes out so smooth when baked. I usually separate the bottom two and top two layers of my portion, I eat the bland-er bottom layers first (with frank red hot sauce) and save the top layers for last since this concentrates the cheese flavor even further.<br /><br />This is also a good dish to experiment with. Adding some black or pinto means to stuff the layers more, or whatever shredded cheese might be lying around the fridge, is a great way to increase it's yield and flavor. Between me and my girlfriend we split one of these for a meal, it's probably our entire sodium intake for the day in one meal (maybe 2x) but I can see how adding some sides like refried beans and rice would let us feed our family of 4 when the time comes. (Luckily the little ones are still at the formula/baby food stage, so we can hog it all)<br /><br />Overall, if you haven't tried it yet and as such aren't addicted to the cheese sauce, make it with your own ingredients, if your already hooked then this is likely the cheapest way to get your fix.<br /><br />P.S. I do have to mention that the S&S price did just jump up about $5 in one month (from 10.80 to 15.08) but at almost $3.xx a piece retail the price still comes out better from Amazon.

I believe it's the Corn that helps it retain it's texture.  I even fed it to about 10 people for an impromptu party and they couldn't believe it was GF!
