review/summary: Organic and Soy, not many other options
review/text: You would think with so many people leaning towards organic and natural products they would be available in more places. My family history (asian) includes lactose intolerant stomachs. My daughter inherited this trait and needs soy or goat milk. Simple decision for us to order this online. Could not find this product in brick stores in California or Hawaii.<br /><br />Not much to compare it to, but it works great for my family.

review/summary: Great formula
review/text: This is great formula for those who aren't successful in breastfeeding or those who are transitioning their child off breast milk.  The only downfall of this product is made with corn solids.  Baby's Only offers the only formula without corn solids but it's hard for baby to digest at a young age.  My daughter loves this formula and it's better than a cow's milk formula.

review/summary: Soy organic formula by Earth's Best is the best.
review/text: We have used soy formula for all of our three children, but chose to use organic soy for our third child.  We think the quality is great.  Our son had a lot of vomiting with milk based formula, and with regular soy he still spit up some, but with this organic soy he stopped completely.  He has no problems keeping the formula down, which is a relief to parents.  We use all of the products made by Earth's Best.  It great to know you are not putting all those chemicals in to your baby. Also, I would like to mention that if you use auto delivery through Amazon you get a discount, and you pay no shipping(they give you express shipping for free, so you get it within two days).  They also carry this formula at all Toy R Us, Babys R Us, and Whole Foods.

review/summary: THIS IS NOT ORGANIC!!! TOXIC hexane still in it!
review/text: RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website!<br /><br />"Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be "agricultural ingredients." Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as "necessary vitamins and minerals," which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and "other" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from "natural"<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: "includes mutant organisms" and "recombinant organisms", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is "extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane."<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: "genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid" and "extraction with solvents such as ... hexane." Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA.  All of them include GMOs.  GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />  Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.<br /><br />Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom<br /><br />The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health.

review/summary: Good but it's NOT Vegan
review/text: I am a vegan whom unfortunately had to choose this to feed my daughter because I can't and won't starve her. There are currently no vegan infant formula on the market in the US (or anywhere I know of). This is the closest to vegan that I could find, plus it's organic. It's not vegan because it contains vitamin D3 (oil from sheep skin; like all soy based formulas). My daughter, who is now 5 months old has been drinking this since the beginning without a problem. I breastfeed as well part time. I'm a full time working mom so I have to supplement with formula. I planned on pumping breast milk and freezing my supply to feed my daughter but it became too overwhelming for me.

review/summary: Organic SOY Formula
review/text: This soy formula helps reduce gas problem for my baby but made it harder for him to poop.  His stool became more solid rather than liquidy (probably diarrhea) when he was on Enfamil Gentlease.  Other than that - it's o.k.  Something else you should know about this formula is that you want to follow their directions and use warm water to mix otherwise you get clumps.  Whole Foods and Babies R Us charge $29.99 for each can - so expensive!

review/text: I just purchased one from whole foods.  There is a soy based formula - whole food 365 brand, right next to this Earth's best one.  I carefully compared two side by side.  All ingredients are the same.  I checked their bottoms, both texts are the exact same format and font, other than the different exp dates.  I remember the color of the 365 package is purple.  I believe it kind of explains the repackaging situation.

review/text: Our daughter is getting close to 10 months and has been thriving on this formula. I breastfed her and supplemented for the first 6 months. I'm so glad we had this formula as an option, since our baby is not able to handle cow's milk. As others have said, we'd prefer something other than corn syrup, but for now this is the best we could find after doing a lot of research.

review/summary: Earths Best Soy Formula Purchased Through Amazon Mom
review/text: We have used this formula for three of our children and they all have thrived. The Soy formula has been easier for them to digest which helped with the fussiness & upset little gas bellies. The powder formula is easy to use, more cost effective, and our babies got the nutrients they needed. We buy store bottled water, keep it at room temperature, then poor into a bottle with the appropriate water oz; add the applicable amount of poweder formula; then shook it to stir it. The little ones would suckle it down as if it was mothers milk. All three children have done well at their doctor appointment checkups (well-visits). We have found that the best pricing for the 25.75 Ounce cans is through Amazom.com "Amazon Mom". We did the subscription purchase and locked in a low price.

You know the taste you get in your mouth right after you have thrown up?  Yep thats it!  No wonder she hated it. I threw it out and we have been using Baby Only organic soy forumula which tastes much much better and she loves it.  Don't force your baby to drink this!

The price on amazon was almost half the price of what I was able to buy the same product for locally. Unfortunatly, while the formula was perfect for my previous child, this baby has had trouble with it. Gassy, crying for no reason, screams out of no where, and not-so-pleasent diapers. While I think Earth's Best makes great products - finding the right formula is not that easy. Unfortunatly, this didn't work for our newest little one as we had hoped :(

When I called to follow-up and provide the correct information, I was told the product would be shipped but the estimated time came and went and still no product. As my baby was running out of formula, I called again to follow-up that same evening and was given a bizarre story that the listing was a fraud and that I would not be receiving the product and should cancel my credit card. I did so and about an hour later, the product arrived. In the meantime, I had cancelled my credit card and had to wait for a new card and re-establish all the connections.

Unfortunately, the Campbell's name draws a higher price even though the product is excellent and extremely handy.

review/text: I love Campbell soups.  I grew up on them.  But the Soup at Hand versions are often subtly different from the canned versions.  This is also true of the Creamy Tomato and Classic Tomato versions of Soup at hand.  They are better!  Very tasteful!  Remember the old ad "Bet you can't eat just one!"?  Well, that's true here too.  I can never stop at just one.  They need to make a bigger size, just for me!

I have a small stockpile in my office for days I just can't afford to leave for lunch. This tomato soup is pretty close to the canned stuff you might prepare from the original on your rangetop (bonus nostalgia effect), without the mess. Heats up nicely, evenly. And hey, if you can get free shipping, why not send it directly to your workplace...even avoid toting a case in from the parking lot!

review/text: I was really reluctant to give these treats to my cat. It's really important to me that she eats a very healthy diet, and while I'm not doing the raw food diet, I do scrutinize labels for meat by-products, BHA, and useless fillers. With that said, my cat couldn't care less for those "healthy" treats that had passed my inspection. I have a cupboard full of treats I felt comfortable giving her that she ended up saving so she could play with them later. So, out of desperation, I bought these; a treat is, after all, a treat. And she goes berserk over them. She's runs to the kitchen whenever I simply open a cupboard, hoping I'm about to give her one of her precious treats. I've also finally taught her to Come on command! And, to be honest, other treats (including this brand's regular treats) have a lot worse ingredients.

review/summary: It's a Miracle!!
review/text: I have 4 cats and finding a treat that all of them will eat has been impossible for years.  I decided to try these, and every cat, including the finickiest of the 4, LOVES these treats.  I give each cat 2 of the treats in the morning, and they gobble them up.<br /><br />I gave these 5 stars because they serve their purpose well, which is making my cats think they're getting something special every day.  Keep in mind, these are not as healthy as some of the high end treats that contain no meal or by-products, so I don't want to mislead anyone on the health value.  Moderation and coupled with a high quality food, these make a nice little treat.<br /><br />Once these are gone, I will try some of the other flavors in the All Natural line; however, the Free Range Chicken Flavor will always be in my cupboard.  If you try these, I hope your cat(s) enjoys them as much as mine do.

review/summary: My fat cat....
review/text: spoiled little sensitive stomach shelter kittie, begs for these when the bag is first opened because the outside IS crunchy and theinside is creamy. He carefully studies his little cache of 3 or 4 and nibbles each one slowly, savoring w his eyes closed. He dropped one and with a petulant mew jumped down from his chair and went searching for it. He 'talks' to himself all the time, mewing and grunting if things are out whack...he couldnt find his little nibble so I pointed to it and he snatched it up like a greedy little thing. These treats are so loved and comforting, given along with Pet-Ease Paw Gel which I use for anxiety. This little guy was a litter runt and caged alone when I was at the shelter. These huge blue eyes and the worst smelling coast-he was sick and it seemed the vets had given up. He's a roly poly muscle bound little smarty pants now at 6 yrs and these treats keep his coat shiny and the paw gel keep him calm...if frustrated or bored he will shred paper or find some clear manner to show his upset.

review/summary: Definitely gets the cat - and human - seal of approval
review/text: I volunteer at a cat shelter so over time I've had some experience with what cats like and what they don't.  With a few rare exceptions, it is hard to find cat treats that are popular with mostly all of the cats.  So far, Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor, Natural Temptations Tuna Flavor and All Natural Temptations Chicken Flavor are proving to be three of the rare exceptions.  Just about all the kitties love these things and will follow me around when I'm handing them out so they can cadge more.  Because they are all natural and only 2 calories per treat, they are a reasonably safe and nutritious treat.  Because they are inexpensive, I can afford to bring enough for everybody at every visit!  And apparently they taste awesome.  I can buy these at my local grocery, Target, Walmart or pet store for around $1.50 to $2.00 a packet and each packet contains enough treats to provide every kitty in the shelter with a generous serving of treats. There is one negative - these treats contain a lot of grains and as a result some kitties will vomit them up after an hour (some kitties tummies will not tolerate food or treats containing grain, or more than very small amounts of grain); over the last few months I've had 3 or 4 kitties through the shelter with this issue.  Once I've identified a kitty who is grain-intolerant, I naturally do not feed it these treats or anything similar.  Note that there are several versions of the Whiskas treats that are not all natural; the kitties like them also but I prefer to feed the all natural version.

review/text: I have one cat who is addicted to these Temptation treats. Either the tuna of the salmon, I dont know what's in these little crunchy pillows, but he forsakes all food if he thinks there's any possibility I'll cave and slip him a few for being the cutest little meatball. His companion, a snooty long hair wont touch them and if he smells them on meatball's breath he gives him a swat for snacking between meals. So his coat seems very shiny, some months back he had flakiness which seemed to be dry skin, but the treats seem to have alleviated that. One thing I would caution is they're probably high in fat so offer them sparingly. (...right)

review/text: Prior to ordering on Amazon, I purchased the canned tomatoes from the local grocery stores. Thus, I am familiar with and like Muir products as a whole. Overall, you pay a few cents more per can than the local grocery stores (of course that depends on geographic location). The only complaint about my order is one of the cans was dented. Unlike other grocery items that I have purchased from Amazon, this order actually was packed correctly and arrived without anything spilling out. The only warning I have for customers ordering food via Amazon is to be aware of cheap packaging by Amazon.

review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: Fantastic healthy natural alternative to typical store-bought pudding mixes
review/text: My family and I discovered this years ago via a natural foods buying club when it was first introduced.  Once the kids were grown, we got away from buying it.  However, I decided recently to see if it was still available, and was thrilled to find Mori-Nu still made it.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with tofu or got turned off by it previously, try a packet of this with a package of tofu.  Unless you're a "super sweet foods" sort of person, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />BTW, Mori-Nu's own product works the best because it comes out the smoothest with the least blending.  However, other brands will work.  You just have to blend it longer.  You may also want to experiment with the amount of liquid you use per batch.  The recommended amount seems to work fine with Mori-Nu tofu, but you'll probably find you need to add more liquid with other tofu.

review/text: I don't typically buy tofu-based desserts (this would be the second time ever) but I was walking through a whole foods when I bought 1 packet of vanilla mori-nu mates with the intention to try it. I later bought the tofo, blended it together & was honestly surprised how good it was. It doesn't taste "like tofu" at all, it's just sweet enough and not overpowering.

review/summary: How do you say Excellent in German?
review/text: I started eating this Mestemacher bread several months ago, buying it in a local store, Meijers, from their international foods aisle.<br /><br />Note- !!!THIS IS NOT YOUR ORDINARY BREAD!! It is real food!!!  It is a dense, heavy bread...You don't just eat it....you savor it,like you might a wine....Seriously...Even our 2 teen sons love it and our 2 daughters who are in their 20's...If you are looking for the best Ham and mustard sandwich, you need to try the rye or pumpernickel version of the Mestemacher bread, toasted or at least warmed a bit.  It's to die for!!  Another note -The other Mestemacher breads have a stronger body to them. This Rye Bread with Muesli has more crumb to it than the others, but its flavor and texture is well worth it...I know I will order it again!! The shelf life is fantastic....my 12 loaves are good till April 2011.(They will be gone long before then - my daughter already took two loaves back to New York with her)  No preservatives are used...It is because of the type of bread it is and is pasteurized in its production.<br /><br />If you need a quick delicious "Pick up breakfast in the morning", cut a slice of this bread, (any variety), toast it and put peanut butter on it (or whatever you prefer). That toast and an apple or banana with water or coffee takes me from 7:30 AM to noon with no problem!!! and I'm a good sized guy at 57 y.o., 6 foot and an undisclosed weight!!...;-)...<br /><br />Give it a try and enjoy!!!

review/text: NO STARS.<br />  I read it keeps a long time and is very healthy as well as tasty.  So, I took a chance.  This stuff makes anything you put on it taste bad.  I put premium canned crab meat with a little miracle whip on it...yikes, the so-called bread made it taste like garbage...makes anything you put on it taste terrible. I tried to eat this...YUCK...I doubt anything will be edible on this bread.  The bread tastes like it was made a hundred years ago. It looks and tastes bad. It tastes sour, has a hard to identify, horrible taste. I wonder what those things in there are that look like nuts, they are the only bearable part of the experience. I am going to stop wasting my ingredients, am throwing away the other 11 loaves. I wonder if I got a bad batch or if they all taste like garbage...toasted garbage.<br />  I am mad I wasted over thirty bucks. I expected that money to be spent to have a healtful stock of some type of bread product for the whole winter...something I could eat with eggs or put my tuna on and eat with my parmeganna reganno hunk. Now what?  I cannot believe all the people who stated it tasted good.  How can they say that.  It tastes like a concoction of garbage in slices that smells to high heaven.  I tried very, very hard to eat it.  I was a second away from running to the toilet if I ate one more morsle, so gave up on it.  I think I got through around two and a half slices before I decided to throw out the whole box of replusive dark loaves.

review/summary: Splinters anyone?
review/text: I have a couple of dogs, one of which, loves to chew on bones. I gave it to my dog as a Christmas treat and it went to town. But later I found little splinters on the floor. It did not register to me at first since it had lost the meat flavoring color and it was pure white. Still being oblivious at the time, I tried to give the same dog another one, seeing how he loved the first one, and he just walked the other way. Then after my dog threw up, the bone splinter riddle was solved.<br />Later, my daughter, who works at a dog adoption organization, told me that I should have never given my dog pork bones... at least not the dried out variety. Perhaps this won't be a problem for your dog but my dog can really chew thru bone... so maybe that was it. In any case, lesson learned for me with my dogs. And perhaps a heads up for you and your dog if you have any concerns.

review/text: My dog almost died from this product. The bone splinters and the company knows it. They have a liability statement on their product because I am sure I am not the first dog owner to have gone through the hell that I went through. I bought a smoked bone from the grocery store because I thought it was big looking, met the size required for my dog and I thought since it was American made it was a quality product. It is far less than quality. Would anyone give arsenic to their dog, absolutely not. So don't spend your money on this killer product. After 3,500 dollars in gastronomy surgery, emergency care,I spent a sad and scared Christmas tending to a poor puppy whining and whelping in pain from their defective junk. Please take this review to heart, I want to spare you what I went through.

review/text: Gave my Dachshund this Hartz "Premium" bone for "aggressive chewers" on Sunday afternoon.  By dinner Monday she was not eating or drinking.  By Tuesday morning (this day) she was throwing up bright red pools of blood!  I had her to the Vet within an hour and $354.32 later learned that this Hartz "Premium" bone for "aggressive chewers" tore up her intestines.  She is now on 3 medications and a special diet for the next week.  The vet advised me to contact Hartz to let them know what happened.  I plan on doing that AND sending a copy of the bill.  I don't expect them to pay it (they'll likely file it in the circular file) but they need see it and hear about it. I purchased these Hartz "Premium" bones for "aggressive chewers" from Walmart so did not have the advantage of the WARNING reviews on Amazon. You do.  Don't do this to your dog.

review/summary: Sharp Splintering
review/text: I purchased this bone at a local supermarket and gave it to my boxer. I walked in the house to literally make a cup of coffee and my dog devoured the bone. What a surprise, when the packaging clearly says: "...this long last chew satisfies your dog's instintive urge to chew." I didn't think anything about it until 2 hours later when after a walk, my dog regurgitated twice! I checked the vomit and sure enough, there was shards of the bone inside. This stuff was so sharp it actually cut my latex glove! BE CAREFUL. If it could cut my glove, it can damage a dog's stomach, colon, intestines and/or esophogus. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET AND NOT SOLD! There is a disclaimer on the product packaging, "This is a natural product and may be prone to splintering." Are you kidding me!? I have been monitoring my dog, whom regurgitated two more times since. Still not sure if I need to go to the vet yet. Gave her 1/3 can of pumpkin to coat her stomach and 3-slices of white bread, which I read will gum up and help her pass any shards in her stomach. Why any company would sell such a product is beyond me. This american made item, lacks the quality to sell in america. I am appalled it is even being sold on the shelves. STAY AWAY. Read the other negative reviews. $3500 for stomach surgery and chances of fatalities. Is it worth it to risk the life of a loved family member over a $3.00 bone! Absolutely not. DO NOT PURCHASE, IT IS UNSAFE.

review/text: OMG, I gave this to my 1 year old, 110 lab and he ran outside with it. I got distracted and when I went to check he had already eaten the entire thing. The only thing I could find were two horrible splinter pieces!! Now I'm at this moment terrified!!! I read the other reviews where some dogs have had to have surgery because of these...I'm hoping and praying my dog will be okay. It's only been a hour since it happened and now all we can do is wait and watch. I've given him some bread and he gets pumkin every night anyway. Plus he had already eaten his dinner so I'm hoping his "full" tummy will help the bone to pass. Needless to say my husband is mad at me for not showing it to him before I handed it out. But we've been going through some major life issues the last couple of weeks and I'm not thinking clearly as it is. I soooo wish I could turn back time and have never given it to him!! Please stay away from this bone and please, if you are reading this and have any good thoughts to help while I wait, I'm open to them as I am worried sick!!! I've already lost my 14 year old lab in Sept and this one we got in Oct and he his my Angel!!! I would die if anything happened to him!!!
