review/summary: really disappointed
review/text: though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did

review/summary: Did Nothing
review/text: I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.

review/summary: Tastes like sweaty gym socks
review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

review/summary: Worth the price...
review/text: I went to the Godiva store in Bellevue Square near Seattle recently and found this very expensive box of chocolates. I thought my husband would love them but he thought there were too many creamy chocolates (with ganache) and not enough filled with caramel or nuts. I didn't even know he liked expensive chocolates until a few weeks ago so I'm a slow learner in this department. But I can't say I'm not pleased that I'll get to eat most of these chocolates. So far I've tasted three and the Coffee Feather chocolate is a favorite already. I'm looking forward to trying the Strawberry Cheesecake, Open Oyster with hazelnut praline and Cinnamon Blush. There is a little pamphlet with pictures so you can see which chocolates you want to try first. This is a very elegant package of chocolates that most people will enjoy. I'd buy this again.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I've brought this Godiva Chocolate Gift Box to three birthday parties in the last two months. Each time, when the birthday girl (all three parties happened to be for ladies) saw the box, her eyes lit up and the box was quickly stashed away. After all, who doesn't love Godiva Chocolates? And I certainly can't blame them for not wanting to share! In a pinch, Godiva is a most appreciated gift.

review/text: Ive had many Godiva Chocolates so I was very surprised with this box, it was almost entirely made up of low quality chocolate. There was little flavor and no richness, this assortment made Hersheys taste good and thats pretty bad. It was disappointing at best. I love Godiva and so this box was a real surprise. Id say pass and go for a truffle assortment over this.

review/text: Which is it? "14oz box, pack of 14" or "Pack of seven, 14 ounces each (total of 98 ounces)" ?  The description on this and the rice chex is contradictory. And I would have believed the 'written' description (it being 7), except that (a) this would be like $7/box which would be crazy expensive and a bit unusual, and (b) people 'referenced' 14, except maybe those reviews were prior to having received the order, it was hard to tell. Feedback?<br /><br />I will edit this with a real review or remove it if I order it. I couldn't find the proper link to ask amazon the question and didn't think using a forum thread would find people who specifically ordered from this page.

review/summary: Excellent for multi-food alergies
review/text: My daughter has food allergies and this is one of the products that does not contain other additional ingredients that causes her allergies. We used to purchased at a local store but when they suddenly ran out of stock, I search in Amazon for it. We now have supply for the next six months. We keep stock on her grandparent's homes so we don't need to carry (at least) this item every time we travel to visit them.<br /><br />It has a great taste so if it good for her, it is good for everyone of us. My daughter loves it, so we are very happy with this product.<br /><br />Corn Chex only has corn starch, which is gluten free. Someone said in another review that contain "starch" (usually made from wheat). My wife and I checked both, the boxes from out local store and the ones we purchased from Amazon and they only contain corn starch.

review/summary: Great price for avery versatile cereal.
review/text: I love "back to basics" cold cereals like this (e.g., cornflakes, raisin bran, frosted mini wheats, etc.).  When you get down to basics you have the option of having it plain when that sweet tooth escapes you or building it up with whatever you wish like sugar, cinnamon, chocolate milk, fresh fruit, anything your palate craves.<br /><br />  I particularly like Chex for another reason, it's unique shape.  I'll usually discount the shape of cold cereal as marketing gimmicks, but in the case of Chex it serves a purpse.  It's doubled wall netting shape allows for Chex to be used to take on othe flavors that allows it to go beyond the cold cereal options.  Yes, I am taking about the famed Chex mix.  You can add savory flavors and others thing to make into a salty snack food to munch on in te classic Chex mix recipe, which is conveniently printed on the box as well as other variations (on my box there were also recipes for Chex Muddy Buddies, a chocolate/peanutbutter frosted mix, and Chili and Garlic Snack Mix).  And let me tell you, you don't know the fantastic taste of Chex until you've had it hot and toasted!  It'll give you a permanent alternative (or additive!) to that movie night bag of popcorn.

review/summary: Fantastic gluten-free cereal
review/text: Good gluten-free cereals are scarce in Canada. (See my review of Rice Chex for more details). I was very happy with my order of Rice Chex, and again I am very happy with my order of Corn Chex, which might even be better than Rice Chex. What I like about these cereals is that they are good cereals, period, even discounting allergies, which I can't say about most gluten-free cereals.<br /><br />By buying 14 at a time, the percentage of the cost that goes to shipping becomes sufficiently small that it's not all that much more expensive than buying cereals at a local grocery store, even though I'm having it shipped to Canada. I expect these 14-packs to be my primary source of cereal for the foreseeable future. I would definitely recommend this method to any Canadian who is now eating gluten-free and misses good-quality cereals.

review/summary: My little girls did not like these
review/text: I have to small poms and neither one of them would eat these. They actually have a good smell to them and even smell like parmesean cheese but both just snubed their noses up. I gave the package to my dad and his dog loved them so I guess it just depends on the dog. Mine must be a little too spoiled.

review/text: I love these Dog Treats and so does my Dog. I really like them since they are low fat/low calorie and small so I can give her several and its still alot less then your average dog treat. I also buy the Fromm Dog food and they are such a great and trusted company and its the one company that my dog will eat anything they seem to make :)

review/summary: Too much salmon
review/text: I never thought I'd say this about a spread but there is actually too much salmon and not enough cream cheese.  As packed, it's a bit salty and dry to the point that is crumbles as opposed to being spreadable.  When I opened the second can I mixed it with an equal amount of fresh cream cheese and threw in some capers with excellent results.  I couldn't find anything to do with the tin can so I threw it out.  I bought this on sale at over 60% off of the list price - which is a pretty good value.

review/summary: Terrible Quality... Must be Remaindered
review/text: I occasionally grab a few pantry goods from Amazon when they're good deals, so at some point, I grabbed this big pack of (supposed) albacore tuna.<br /><br />Well, it didn't go well.<br /><br />The cans arrived incredibly dented, which made me wonder if they were castoffs or remaindered cans that couldn't be sold in other ways due to the quality of the cans.<br /><br />The tuna itself was really strange.  Look, I've bought Bumblebee tuna before and don't remember it being this bad. But this, which is supposed to be white albacore in water, is just the worst quality of tuna I have ever bought. The tuna doesn't look like white albacore at all, but more like the regular, flaky, grainy, browner textured regular tuna.  There is none of the pale, steak-like, albacore consistency in the tuna in these cans at all.<br /><br />It is literally the worst quality of albacore tuna I can ever remember buying.<br /><br />(Meanwhile, if you care about quality, I would suggest the Sustainable Seas albacore as an alternative. It's not much more expensive and the quality is terrific. We bought that shortly after this, and were blown away by how good it was. You get solid, big flakes of beautiful tuna meat that are delicious and also environmentally (and dolphin) friendly.)

review/summary: best mustard ever
review/text: I know, not a terribly original nor creative title BUT it happens IMO to be *true*.<br /><br />There's a creaminess to it texture-wise but has whole mustard seeds that give it this "pop". It has a depth of flavor that is bold and subtle at the same time. Does not "take over" my recipes, even lighter flavored ones like for macaroni salad but adds just the right amount of mustard flavor. Has a great balance between earthy and just a *bit* of sweetness, especially if/when the seeds pop as you chew them.<br /><br />I use this on burgers as well where it really gets noticed and again, hits all the right notes when combined with other flavors - try this on a handmade burger made with ground chuck, ground sirloin and ground lamb and you'll know what I mean. Actually, try it on a cheap hot dog and you'll STILL see what I mean.<br /><br />I buy this locally in these small jars as I cook for one and like it always to be fresh. Plus the little bottles look cute on the table if you have company. The larger squeeze bottles work well too and might be a better buy if you tend to use a lot of mustard.<br /><br />Ingredients: water, mustard seed, vinegars (white distilled, red wine, white wine), sugar, salt, white wine, garlic, spices, xanthan gum, tumeric, citric acic, artificial and natural flavors, annato.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: Not what I expected.
review/text: I certainly could do better by these if I just went over to Grama's house and raided her flowerbeds. I am not sure what I truly expected but it was not a bag a teeny microscopic half brown buds. The package is not sealed and one side is just dust where the buds crumbled. I showed the pic of the good side to point out the brown ones. The smell upon opening was overwhelming with the first whiff. Then it evaporated immediately and left a strong rank tea like chemically enhanced odor. I assure you I will not be using these for human consumption due to that lingering odor. Since they bare not commercially packaged etc, there is not guarantee of being purely organic. Unless by organic they mean dead, rotted, brown plant material.

review/text: I'll be honest, I thought this was a bit pricey, but I really like herbal teas with good flavor that can stand on its own and doesn't need sweetener. So I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed.<br />You read the ingredients, they seem so simple:<br />Organic Lemongrass, Organic Schizandra Berries, Organic Roses, and Organic Clove.<br />It must be those berries because this has got to be one of my favorite teas of all time. The flavor is quite distinct, yet delicate. If you like herbal teas or know someone that does, I highly recommend this as a treat.

This item was very inexpensive compared to similar tables and well worth the price.

Also Pomegranate is the only really good flavor, the rest taste like awful medicine.

review/summary: Works for me...
review/text: As a longtime veteran of working in places that operate around the clock, I'm familiar with most tricks of the trade for succeeding in the unnatural act of staying up all night. And while nothing will help you if you don't get most --or all-- of the sleep you need, little things can help. Back in the day there was coffee and soda and not much else. Now there are dozens of products that will claim to offer the boost you need.<br /><br />During a 12-hour overnight shift, I usually take one of these with a meal about halfway through. Doing so seems to get me over that middle of the night hump. Sometimes I'll take a second just before heading home to share the road with all the "normal" drivers.<br /><br />These are low in caffeine and calories. The taste will be familiar to you from cough syrup bottles. But the volume is mercifully small so you don't have to endure it long.<br /><br />Overall, these seem to help me through the doldrums of long shifts!

Not to mention that the salmon and sweet potatoes in it are known to be easily digestible. She gets so excited when I bring out the bag. Worth the money! Highly recommended!

Another series of dog deaths from treats from China has been released. There is no oversight. These treats may be OK but I will not take any chances. I am really irritated with Amazon and the vendor for not disclosing the source of the product. They say in the online description, "read the label carefully". In very small print the country of origin is disclosed. I do not knowingly feed my dogs anything from China.<br /><br />These are great treat. My dogs love them and they are no artificial stabilizers or fillers. However, at most other on line pet websites they are half the price. Usually Amazon is competitive in pricing but not on this line of products.

review/summary: Duck!  Treats Are Coming
review/text: These two-millimeter long treats don't have the pronounced smell of the tuna treats. Like the other Omega treats these are easy to break in half, but are small enough for many dogs to eat in one piece. The shih tzu pair, with their dainty snouts, prefer to have their duck treats torn or cut in two. Since the first ingredient in these Duck treats is duck liver, the girls are becoming treat snobs and act as if they are actually dining on Foie gras. I don't have the heart to tell them anything different.<br />Often the Omega Duck treats are mixed in with several other snacks on the breakfast plates. Always the duck treats are the first to disappear. It's funny to watch Piper push aside the other treats so that she can pick out the pieces of Omega treats. I have some reservations about the treat's country of origin, but the girls love these things and their lip smacking comments have all been positive.

review/text: First of all, they stink.  Imagine fish lying around in the sun for a couple of hours.  Yeah, they're that smelly.<br /><br />But that, as it turns out, is why my dogs love them so much.  These treats are so special, in fact, that they're only given out when we want to get our girls into their crates, like at bedtime, or if we're going out or something.  They even know the bag...all I have to do it get it out of the cabinet and they're running off into their crates, waiting happily for their treats.<br /><br />I had read the review from the person who wrote that a fishbone had been found in one.  What I do is bend/break them down the middle before handing them out so I can feel if there's something sharp inside.<br /><br />So the bottom line here is...if my dogs love them, then I love them.  :)

review/summary: CRAZY ABOUT THESE TREATS!!
review/text: These treats come in Salmon and Duck....my dogs LOVE both. They go crazy when they even see the bag.... Perfect size for a training treat. These treats stay moist...I have the Bear Treats also, they are good too, but more of a dried salmon "meal" consistency.

review/summary: Deadly treat
review/text: I bought these at a local store. I broke up the first one for smaller training treats. My finger was stabbed by a needle shaped fish bone. This bone could have easily perforated my dogs digestive tract and made him very ill or dead. I have contacted the manufacturer and have yet to receive a response.

review/text: I opened a bag of this treat a week ago. It was a part of the Christmas present I gave to my 5-month old miniature schnauzer. My pet is crazy over this treat! I would have given this product five stars because my puppy loves it and it's highly nutritious (as claimed by the manufacturer). But I reduced my scoring to two-stars because it makes my puppy pass obnoxious-smelling gas. It doesn't bother him but it does me! When I reviewed the list of ingredients, I found a possible culprit: sweet potato. This is a root crop known to cause flatulence.

review/summary: Best sea salt ever
review/text: I had found this initially at Whole Foods. Loved it, but they discontinued it the last time they reorganized the store.  The other sea salts available were wet and did not grind well. I was disappointed not to be able to find this product locally anymore, and then I thought of Amazon.<br /><br />The sea salt grinder in the top of the bottle is great, and has both coarse and find grind. I soak the label off the bottles and put one on the table and one near the stove. I also have a matching pepper grinder by the same company. Fortunately, the brand name was embossed on the bottle top, so I could search for it on Amazon.

review/summary: Coffee has new meaning for me
review/text: I bought the Bosch Tassimo T-Disc single cup coffee and beverage maker (chocolate, teas, etc.) I am so pleased with this system. And I LOVE the Tassimo Gevalia Latte pods (T-Discs).<br /><br />What I like best:<br /><br />-- There's two discs used for each cup of coffee (latte), one is the REAL MILK creamer, the other espresso.<br /><br />-- This gives you the option of having an espresso ONLY, should you choose. Simply don't use the included creamer disc.<br /><br />-- The strength of the espresso or milk is separately adjustable. Simply hold the big, shiny button when the green light is flashing (flashes after the initial brew) and the unit adds more steamed water to the espresso and/or the milk.<br /><br />-- The milk in this latte pack is real milk, not powdered crud like other machines use! IMO it imparts a better, more genuine coffee house flavor to the latte.(Bonus Tip: The milk has been pasteurized at extremely high temperature. That gives it a longer shelf life, but still only about six to 10 months - do NOT refrigerate or freeze. So if you buy these off of eBay or here, ask the seller the date code on the side of ANY package containing dairy (hot chocolate, creamer discs, etc.) since you do not want to get a package close to the shelf life expiration or worse, with expired dates.<br /><br />-- If you want a latte quick, you can be sipping a just-right (not too hot, not lukewarm) in about two minutes from adding the first disc. To avoid fisticuffs on who goes first in the morning or in the break room, there is a dual coffee maker that brews two cups, side by side.<br /><br />-- Unlike other machines, the Bosch Tassimo machine(formerly made by Braun) has a bar code reader that reads the bar code on the label on each disc. The machine reads the bar code and knows what it is supposed to do in terms of how much water to add, how long to heat, etc. How cool is that! Very! For example, if you insert a 12 oz. coffee T-disc, the machine automatically knows to add 12 ounces of hot water to the brewed coffee. If you insert an espresso disc (which comes in this latte package) the machine adds just the right amount of water to make an espresso like you would find in an Italian cafe (about three tablespoons of water). If you need to wake up in the morning have an espresso, you will be gritting your teeth, driving 80 mph in the car to work).<br /><br />-- COFFEE FLAVOR IS EXTREMELY SUBJECTIVE. One man's elixir of the Gods is to another Satan's poison. So these coffees are like romantic relationships. Only you know what you see in someone and you are not going to base a relationship on what friends, family or co-workers think of your significant other. Same goes for coffee. Why on earth would you buy coffee, or not, based on what a total stranger (that's me) thinks tastes good. You need to make up your own mind on what tastes good to you.<br /><br />So what I recommend is that you buy a sampler and find out what you like. After that, then buy packs containing 8 to 14 cups of brew. (Because I like a lot of Half/Half in my way-too-strong coffee shop coffee, I ended up loving these Gevalia Latte T-Discs (but I also happen to like Gevalia coffee). You may like the Maxwell House coffee or the Gevalia Morning Roast blend (I find the Gevalia Morning Roast way too strong for my tastes. I found that with the 12 oz T-Disc I was cutting the 12 oz brewed coffee in half and adding 4 ounces of Half & Half like I had been doing at Starbucks, for example. So that coffee is NOT for me.)<br /><br />-- These individual coffee machines are the rage for making coffee. It is great in the office break room, or for couples who want fresh cups of coffee each morning but not a full or partial pot (making a partial pot is a hassle). I predict that all other coffee makers, except for making big pots for four to ten people, will fall by the wayside. Even with large groups I predict most people are going to want a coffee made to order.<br /><br />-- It is also a fantastic way to save money. Each cup of coffee costs less than a dollar, on average. That's far less than paying $3 to $5 at Starbucks.<br /><br />Bonus Info:<br /><br />-- The package indicates the product is made by Kraft Foods. IMO that's a name you can trust and it will back up the product.<br /><br />-- Do NOT refrigerate, do NOT freeze (the creamer disc will explode rendering them unusable).<br /><br />-- The date code (expiration date) for the creamers (that are a real dairy product, not powered MRE cr#p) is clearly displayed on the side of the package. On mine just bought on 12/02/11 the date code is Aug 05, 2012.<br /><br />-- You can also lose weight with these machines? How is that? Well I don't know about you, but when I used to get my morning and afternoon cup of coffee at Starbucks I would also cave and get a sweet roll of some type. So by not going to the cafe I cut out the temptation (and eventual desire) to get a lemon bar or carrot cake. Cutting out two sweets a day, that has to result in significant weight loss.<br /><br />-- These are cheaper online than, for example, at my local supermarket. For an Eight Latte pack (8 espresso, 8 creamers) I paid $12.99 at my local Safeway. Of course at Safeway I had the latte pack in hand immediately, no waiting for shipping. So for me in an emergency Safeway will do albeit that significantly increases the PPCOC.<br /><br />Sidenote: These machines are a win win. The coffee machine manufacturers and producers make a lot more money because these discs give us far less coffee (per pound if you want to use that measure). But we win because of convenience, weight loss, and also saving money by not spending $10 daily at the cafe (coffee and a sweet). Even a coffee by itself cost about $3 to $5 here in San Francisco, so cutting that expense is significant.<br /><br />Office managers, this is a reason to get one of these types of machines. And arguably productivity will go up since employees won't be leaving the office to get a coffee. And making a coffee with one of these machines is fun. So it might even boost morale (the first few months will be trying because you will have to determine which T-Discs people want. There might be fights if two employees argue over who gets the last latte in the pack.

For some reason, when I lift the handle to take out the pod it explodes with hot grounds, making a gigantic mess and ruining the cup of coffee.  I would say at least half of each box does this.

review/text: I like the concept of this toy w/these rawhide strips but they are very expensive and after much wear on the toy the rings do not stay on well so they do not last very long.  Yes, my dogs are big agressive chewers but I was thinking the toy would last a little longer.  The strips are kind of thin so they are finished with it in about 10 minutes.

review/summary: A Pricey, But Favorite Treat
review/text: My dog gets pesky and there's nobody else to entertain him. When I went into the local pet store and asked for a busy box for my 100# lab mix, they sold me the Bouncy Bone. It took my dog less than 10 minutes to figure out that he could just grab the ring with his canines, while pinning the ball to the ground with his paws on the nylon bone on either side, and just using brute force to pull the ring until it snaps off. Gone in less than a minute. He's not interested in chewing on the nylon ends, and he could care less about that large heavy ball. Can't say I blame him.<br /><br />I started cutting thick chews in half and drilling a hole through the center, larger than the core of the toy. Sandwiching the gnawhide ring between the pieces slowed him down considerably, since he had to chew through a substantial amount of rawhide to get to the gnawhide.<br /><br />My next investment was the Bristle Bone (uses the same rings). If you haven't completed your toy purchase, get this one. It cleans their teeth, massages their gums, and conceals everything but the edge of the ring. Within 5 minutes he had cracked the middle piece that houses the bristles with his powerful jaws. The toy is still usable, although it does lose bristles. However, it only slowed him down by a few minutes.<br /><br />Now I cut 3/8" off the outside of the rings, and cut that into smaller pieces to hide between the bristles on the other side, and use as special mini-treats. (I'm too cheap to use more than one ring at a time.) By doing this I am assured of at least 30 minutes to two hours. He's also pretty worn out from all the licking and biting.

review/summary: Pet treats, baby food, supplements from China not SAFE!
review/text: China recently refused to let the FDA inspect pet treat manufacturing facilities.  [...]<br /><br />There is no inspection, legal system, or quality control to make sure you do not give your pet toxic rawhide if the rawhide is made in China.  There are other treats on Amazon that are American or European made--buy those.<br /><br />I threw out the rawhide rounds and cut pieces of US-made, no toxic chemicals rawhide into rounds to slide on this.  I put edible toothpaste (liver flavor--yum! yum!)on the bristles.  It is keeping my dogs' teeth much, much cleaner.  Great product, but dangerous to give your dog rawhide from China.  Over 6000 pets have died just from jerky treats alone.

review/summary: Fun, engaging toy
review/text: This toy keeps my 7 month old husky/german shepherd mix fully engaged for about 20 minutes. We have to prevent her from running, jumping and playing while she recovers from a soft-tissue injury. It's very hard to keep this highly energetic and curious puppy from running around the living room out of frustration and boredom while she heals. The Busy Buddy Bouncy Ball really holds her attention and seems to burn up some of her excess mental and physical energy. She seems calmer afterwards. I can shower, get the laundry and do other chores out of her sight as long as she has her Buddy to play with. The rings are a little pricey, so I don't know if we'll continue to use it after she has healed. But for the next 3 weeks, we are devoted to this toy. I'm going to order a bunch of refill packs right now, so we don't run out! (Caution: 4 rings in 1 night seem to cause loose stools.)

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite Treat
review/text: We picked up the first Busy Buddy Bone at a Greyhound meet'n-greet in Philadelphia, although our boy is a Beardie. It became his favorite immediately. By itself, it's just a good little chew toy, but the edible "Gnawhide" rings make it "new" each time. Beardies need a lot of grooming; daily in fact. This is his reward for enduring his nightly torture.

review/text: My one year old pup absolutely loves these things with or without the Busy Buddy Bone.  Of course, he spends much more time with it when they're on the Busy Buddy Bone.

review/text: These are great to distract/redirect chewing puppies but they like the "rough" type one way better than the smoothe one

review/summary: Best Chew Toy I've found
review/text: I don't write reviews very often -- only if I'm either very thrilled with a product or very disappointed.  In this case, I'm thrilled! :)  We just got two German Shepherd puppies -- and have tried numerous chewtoys, Kongs, etc -- but the Busy Buddy is the favorite!  I found that the pups like the rough rawhide rings better than the smooth ones... but they just chew the rough ones first & then go for the smooth.  This bone keeps them occupied for quite a while -- and they'll keep gnawing at it to get the last little bit of the ring off.  I found it lasts longer if you screw the toy together tightly -- that makes it more challenging for them to get the rawhide off.  Great toy!

review/summary: Fun for Dogs!
review/text: When used with the Premier Busy Buddy Bone, these rings are great for keeping the dog busy! The bone can also be used alone, but adding these rawhide rings provides a lot more fun. My dog loves them! And Amazon is a great store to find them for low price and free shipping over $25.

review/summary: MY BIG OLE DOGGIE
review/text: I purchased the Busy Buddy Bone over a year ago for my hound dog (puppy at the time). I've purchased the inserts more than once because of her teething and it's a lot less expensive than buying rawhide bones every day.  It seems to calm her.  She is now over 60 lbs and when it's time for her to sleep she always has her bone with her.  I like the product, but I can't find it anywhere but on line in the area I live.
