Even better, the seller made a small mistake in shipping and they immediately responded to my email - and fixed the small error. With that kind of service I would buy from them anytime!

review/summary: Hugely disappointing!
review/text: This is a super rich cake --1.5 sticks of butter, 3 eggs, and an additional 3 tablespoons of butter for the topping. Suggested serving size is 1/10 of a cake. I think 1/20 is a better portion. One serving of just the mix (not including butter and eggs!)  has 360 calories and 88 grams of carbohydrates (or nearly 6 carb exchanges! WOW!)  I can't tell you the fat, but trust me, it's a lot.<br /><br />Suggested retail price is $13.95. Holy crap! Sorry, I don't say that often but that's plain ridiculous. I had a gift certificate, so I didn't pay that, thank God.<br /><br />Other negatives: directions only included directions for making it in tube pan. I prefer flat cake pans. And it also did NOT include high altitude directions. I now live in Colorado, so these are needed.<br /><br />It certainly smelled delicious when it baked.  Suggested baking time is 50 to 60 minutes. Since my oven runs a bit hot, I checked at 50 minutes. Disaster! My coffee cake had become a victim of high altitude cake cave-in. Yup, it fell! According to allrecipes.com, "Lower air pressure at high elevations causes air bubbles trapped in the batter to rise at a faster rate. When this happens, cakes rise very fast and high...then fall. As a result, you end up with a dense, dry cake. " This  describes my coffee cake to a T. Dense? Yes. Dry? Yes. And of course, it had a valley in the middle where it fell.<br /><br />The flavor, I do have to say, was good. Very definitely sour cream. This could have been a nice coffee cake, great for holiday brunch (which was the plan.) But it turned out to be a flop. My boys still liked it because it was sweet. But it got tossed after a day because it was much too dry.<br /><br />Overall, very disappointing. One star only.

review/text: Why was this cake so dry?  Did I overcook it (by 5 minutes)?  It crumbled mercilessly and the streusel was missing in the middle of the cake.  Why did the directions say to whisk the glaze...my whisk got all balled up.  I really don't think that this saved any money and not much time.  I will never buy this again but the taste (ignoring the texture) was good.

review/summary: Best Fast_Rise Yeast I Have Used
review/text: I have always been discouraged with the results I've gotten from other rapid rise yeast products.  The bread tended to be smaller in size and not nearly as good-tasting.  After using the others, I decided to buy bread if I did not have time for the 3-4 hour cycle in the bread machine.  When my husband brought this home by mistake I used it out of desperation and the bread was great!  I still think that regular yeast turns out better loaves but this is an excellent time-saving alternative.  Much better than the others!

review/summary: GREAT Pens!
review/text: I used these pens to decorate some marshmallow fondant cut outs for my little cousin's birthday cake. I couldn't believe how neat and sharp the lines came out! It was so easy to draw on the fondant. I then used the Wilton markers (I needed another color) and they were horrible compared to these! The fondant kept sinking in and the lines were not coming out clean. These markers are definitely the perfect choice for drawing on fondant.

review/summary: Worked moderately well
review/text: I bought these pens to make faces on Lego mini figure pops made from marshmallows dipped in candy chocolate.  I put the finished pops in the refrigerator to set before marking.  The pen worked well in the beginning, but as the candy chocolate coating started to warm up, the condensation made drawing almost impossible.  No worries though, the package contained two pens so I merely switched back and forth, plus I wiped each surface dry before marking which helped immensely.  I'm not sure how well it would mark on fondant, but any dry surface would probably work.

review/text: This amazing wine was recommended in one of our favorite cookbooks - The Brisket Book by Stephanie Pierson.  She suggested that it be served with a recipe called "My Mother's Brisket," which is really a pretty straight forward brisket - no added spices or herbs.  The  pairing was perfection!<br /><br />  This wine is basically fruity reminding one of ripe berries and cherries.  We've read that it also contains traces of  cocoa  powder.  I couldn't have picked that out - only know the wine was delicious and we look  forward to trying more from Frog's  Leap Winery in the very, very near future.

review/summary: Good Teas Overall, But Tazo Disappoints
review/text: ****<br /><br />Tazo Assorted Black and Green Teas and Herbal Infusions includes one or two of each:<br /><br />AWAKE:  plain ordinary black tea, a little bitter<br /><br />CALM:  nice chamomile tea<br /><br />CHAI BLACK TEA:  an okay chai black tea with caffeine<br /><br />CHINA GREEN TIPS:  great green tea experience, Tazo's best, no "natural flavorings"<br /><br />DECAFFEINATED CHAI: an okay chai black tea without caffeine<br /><br />EARL GREY BLACK TEA:  a disappointing perfumy, intense, black tea experience<br /><br />LOTUS:  decaf green tea with lotus flower, one of my favorite Tazo's<br /><br />PASSION HERBAL INFUSION:  hibiscus-y, intense, caffeine-free, and luxurious<br /><br />WILD SWEET ORANGE:  orange herbal tea, some complex overtones perhaps<br /><br />ZEN:  mild, relaxed green tea<br /><br />Their ingredients include: black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, citric acid, natural flavors, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, rooibos, ginger root, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflower, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise, and red poppy flowers.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only "real" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.<br /><br />****

review/summary: More like 3.5 stars
review/text: I agree with most points in Ms Brown's review. I have to admit that Tazo always seemed to me to be just a marketing ploy to get us to pay more for regular tea. After trying this sampler, my opinion hasn't been swayed much. However, the teas in this pack are quite pleasant and do seem to have more intense flavor compared to other commercial bagged teas. What impressed me was how quickly the Tazo infuses and how rich the colors are! The Passion tea makes a deep, beet-red infusion! This makes me wonder if Tazo is impregnating their leaves with food-coloring or other additives. If you open the packet of Earl Grey, you will see for yourself that the teabag itself is stained with a yellow coloring. The tea tastes good, but if you're a tea purist, this may seem like cheating. I have no proof so I'll leave it to you to decide. After a tasting you might not care afterall. Personally, I like the tea, but I don't achieve Nirvana from it. :)

When you drink these teas you can transcend reality for moments at a time and that is all the truth I need about these teas.

I thought it was expensive at first, but now I think it's a bargain considering how good it is. I am definitely only going to buy Tazo from now on, because the other teas taste like swill water in comparison, seriously, and I don't enjoy them half as much. I don't care if any tea snobs say that it may not be as natural as their snobby teas. I just want to enjoy a delicious, hot glass of tea and that is all that matters! What else could possibly matter?

It is totally un-presentable as a gift.  I like Tazo tea myself, so I'll end up drinking it -- but at $12 for the box, I am disappointed, and now I still have to buy something else for my niece!

review/summary: Tazo always reliable
review/text: Tazo is one of my favorite producers of assorted products, and their teas do not dissapoint in this regard. First of all, their bags are filled with real tea leaves, not plastic or fiberglass, which is a nice change in this day and age. Secondly, their selections are incredible. Also the medicinal teas are really great and work wonders on your immune system. As the Book of Tea states, Tea is the backbone of a society which is constantly trying to steep itself, and Tazo can relate with ardent coordination. These are my favorite teas in order of my favoriteness.<br />1. Earl Grey<br />2. Dandelion<br />3. Arctic Herb<br />4. Mnemonic Lemon<br />5. Welsh Breakfast<br />6. Tangy Zizzer<br />7. Orange Hemlock<br />8. Free Radical Pro-Oxident<br />9. Citronella<br />10. Zoster Care<br />11. Brewed Offal<br />12. Narcoleptic Mint<br />13. Golden Sunrise<br />14. Blue Sterno<br />15.

review/summary: Corn Syrup is in the bars...........
review/text: I bought these bars because of the tales that oatmeal lowers cholesterol, and is so good for you. I also bought these because it was in the information the bars contained no corn syrup.  On the label for each bar in the ingredients it is as clear as day, corn syrup as an ingredient. I wanted to stay away from that unhealthy ingredient and was shocked to see it listed on each bars packaging.

review/text: I like to buy these granola bars to hand out to homeless people and the needy.  Instead of giving them spare change--which you never know what they are going to spend it on--you can be sure they will be nourished if you give them food.  Obviously not really a "meal" but about as good as you can get at a reasonable price, individually wrapped and relatively healthy.

review/summary: More Flavor Than You'd Think
review/text: I don't often eat breakfast before I leave for work, which means that I'm usually pretty hungry by about 10 AM.  I have begun taking these to work with me for a mid-morning snack, and they help to tie me over until lunch.  They have a surprisingly decent amount of taste, rather than tasting like cardboard or having a single chocolate chip or raisin in them.  For the price, it is a good deal.  You might be able to find them cheaper elsewhere, but keep in mind that there is a bit of a "convenience charge" when buying online because you didn't have to get in your car, drive to the store, spend the money on gas, get what you wanted from the shelf, stand in line to check out, drive home, spend more money on gas, and lose time that you could've been doing something else.  To some, this isn't a big deal.  For me, buying them on Amazon is the way to go, and I will continue to buy them for the taste.<br /><br />I should also mention that I have tried other products, like NutriGrain bars, Special K Thin Crisps, and Newtons Crisps.  The NutriGrain bars, in my opinion, are too dry.  The other two are alright, but there is very little flavor to them.  As such, I will stick with these.

review/summary: Oatmeal raisin tastes terrible, PB and Chocolate Chip are ok
review/text: These are the new "healthy" Quaker Oats 100-calorie granola bars; but don't let the name deceive you.  While they may have zero trans-fats and no high fructose corn syrup, they're still chock full of other great things, like various preservatives, hydrogenated oil, artificial flavors, regular corn syrup, and combinations of fructose/dextrose.  My advice is to buy the full-fat Quaker Oats granola bars which taste better anyhow; just practice some self-control.  However, since you've already chosen this variety pack, here's the review.<br /><br />The best tasting flavors are the peanut butter and chocolate chip; the oatmeal raisin has virtually neither oats nor raisins, and tastes more like a barley/rice bar.  Somehow, the "oatmeal raisin" bar came with no raisins, and a much drier, barley-er consistency.  What happened to the good ol' days when granola bars were primarily oats?  But I digress.  Thank goodness there are only 16 of the oatmeal raisin in the box, and more of the better tasting PB/Choco.<br /><br />As for the chocolate chip flavor, they still have enough chocolate chips scattered about to resemble a chocolate chip granola bar, and somehow the ratio of oats to barley/rice is higher in this than compared to the oatmeal raisin bars.  The bar isn't too dry, and you feel pretty good eating just one of them and only taking in 100 calories.  Only 100 calories?  Hmm, I can afford to eat a few more...<br /><br />As for the oatmeal raisin, they're terrible compared to their low fat chocolate chip brethren.  There's nary a raisin to be found, and somehow, the oatmeal to barley/rice ratio is very low on these compared to the chocolate chip version.  If I wanted a barley/rice bar, I wouldn't have bought a product that said "granola" on the front.  Additionally, the bar is very dry; I think the lack of a nice fat (chocolate chips) definitely leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />As for the peanut butter, they have a great peanut buttery flavor and taste.  Not much else to be said.<br /><br />Buy these knowing you'll have slightly dry-ish oat/barley/rice bars, good for a nice snack.  They're not especially healthy, but no one needs to know.  Shhhh.

review/summary: Average...
review/text: A fellow reviewer said something I remember now clear as daylight: All flavored coffees are below par for once the flavor is injected or whatever into the ground coffee it will mask all the mediocre aspects. He also said that it it better to buy good quality coffee and then add vanilla, hazelnut, etc., for this will yield a much better cup of coffee. Today, after a series of purchases of many flavored coffees I wish I would have followed the sound advice it provided. Millstone Cinnamon Hazelnut Ground Coffee,, 1.75-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12) was the poorest of the lot as far as taste and quality is concerned. Had to drink if first and get rid of it for I always try to save the best for last but so far the other flavors have been only slightly better. Not the best by a long shot. Now that I have become an expert there is a definite taste or should I say, after taste?, that lowers the expectation of the product. Will buy pure vanilla, hazelnut, etc and when I want this flavors on a cup of coffee will add it in the end. Maybe they use the "runt of the litter", sort of speak, for these flavored offerings. 3 Stars, Average at best...

A bit of history: a determined, candy-loving 12 year old loses war over Halloween candy with his stubborn, health conscious mom, the ideas was born to "un-junk" candy bars by removing the trans-fat, high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, GMO ingredients and other nasty things.

review/summary: Better than WIlton fondant, but not the best.
review/text: Satin Ice is more plyable and better tasting (for fondant0 than the Wilton boxed fondant at Michael's and WalMart. If you need colors, they are vibrant and strong--their blank and read are the best.<br />While I have used Satin Ice many times, I will say that whatever fondant is used and marketed as the "Duff" brand (from Ace of Cakes) is a MUCH better product than even Satin Ice. You can re-rool and stretch it to fit like nothing I have ever seen. It really is the easiest fondant I have ever worked with--worth waiting for the 40% off coupons from the large chain craft store and buying the Duff brand.<br />You can find Satin Ice elsewhere on the Internet cheaper than here, but at least you know Amazon is pretty dependable.

review/summary: Easy to work with and tastes good
review/text: I ordered this product to make a birthday cake for my son.  I had never worked with fondant before, so I made a practice cake in advance.  The fondant was brightly colored, relatively easy to work with (with ample amounts of powdered sugar to prevent sticking), and didn't taste bad like many other fondants do.  What I especially liked was that I was able to store the remaining fondant away for nearly three weeks, and it was just as good as when I first received it.  The green is a bright kelly green.

review/summary: Difficult to work with
review/text: I had such a hard time with this fondant.  I have used Wilton for years and have done many good things with it so I decided to "step it up".  Boy am I sorry I did.  I had a 4 tiered anniversary cake to do in ivory.  I HATE coloring fondant so I figured this was as good a time as any to try a new fondant that was already colored so I ordered Satin Ice (...or SATAN Ice as I now call it).  I took it out of the tub and set it on the counter.  My 9 year old twins both said WHAT is that?!  I said "It's fondant!"  Having seen me work with fondant for many years, they both said "It looks too GOOEY to be fondant!!".  Boy... even at 9 they are VERY observant.  It was very easy to roll out, but getting it ON the cake was a different story.  When I picked it up to put it on the cake it fell apart in my hands.  I attempted this 4 times.  Finally I put wax paper underneath it, rolled it out and flipped it onto the cake.  Easy enough.....or so I thought until I saw all the wrinkles transferred from the wax paper...back to the drawing board.  I ended up putting wax paper underneath, rolling it out, putting wax paper on top, flipping it over, THEN putting it on the cake....only to find that it still tore in the process.  UGH.  I'm exhausted!!  Never again.

review/text: I got this fondant for my brother's wedding. I won't be using it until this weekend, so the only things I can comment on right now are the taste and the color and texture.<br /><br />First off, right out of the bucket, this fondant was very stretchy and easy to work with, I pulled out a chunk just to see out it worked, before I ordered more. I found it very nice, and I'm just beginning to work with fondant. I was very concerned with the fact that it was being delivered on a 90 degree day, but it stayed gummy and workable and didn't melt or stick to anything.<br /><br />The color was gorgeous. I was a little worried about it leaving a blue or green color residue or not quite being black, but it's a great color and didn't bleed everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, the taste, I tried it and I have to say this is some of the best tasting fondant. I liked it so much, that I ordered the white and I plan on making the flowers out of it, because I know people will love them.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />Worked very well. I made many flowers and other decorations for the cake with this. Everyone thought it tasted great and looked wonderful. My only complaint is that it didn't dry as hard as other products I have used, so I had to be very careful when moving them around as they easily lost shape or fell apart. I'm not sure if this was because of the fondant or because of the heat, even though i made sure they were in a cool, dry place.<br />My other issues is that no matter what I tried, it was very sticky and stuck to the mat that I was rolling it out on. Once I let it sit out for 15min or so, it got much easier to work with and I was able to actually roll and cut ribbons without them breaking or sticking.<br /><br />Overall, I would buy this again, just takes a little bit of getting used to.

I needed to get the product to me quickly, so purchasing from Amazon 2 day was the most economical for me.  Which is good for when I need to try out mixing a few colors before ordering a large quantity. I used this blue along with the red to make purple which was perfectly stable to light. (unlike mixing gel colors which sometimes fade in direct light).

review/text: I don't normally use honey but I drink a fair amount of tea and wanted something healthier than white sugar or products like Splenda, etc.<br /><br />Just got two one pound jars of Really Raw Honey and I must say it's much nicer than what I'm used to at the local grocery store.<br /><br />It's packed in glass jars which is the proper way to pack honey (it can absorb things from plastics). Plus its totally unfiltered yet seems more sophisticated in both taste and texture than the super market stuff.<br /><br />It's a solid, so it's less messy than the liquid variety. I just made a cup of tea and dipped a spoon into the honey and it scoops easily up and melted into my tea right away,<br /><br />If you think honey is too cumbersome to use, reconsider. I can't honestly say this brand is better than others in its class but it is definitely nicer than the typical filtered, liquid, plastic squeeze container variety found in most super market brands.<br /><br />Addendum: April 2009 - my latest jars have been 2Lbs 10oz sizes. These have been packed in plastic, not glass jars unlike my 1lb jars were. If this is of concern to you, contact mfgr. to ask about glass jar options.<br /><br />EDIT: Feb 2010 - I should add that I buy direct from Really Raw. Their price includes shipping within the continental US - FYI

review/summary: WOW - The BEST Honey !!!
review/text: Let me just start by saying that I am the kind of gal who cooks for her family and tries very hard to either buy local grown or when those aren't available, organic products.  I tried the Really Raw Honey - OH MY GOSH!  Hands down - the BEST honey I have ever tasted!  When you open the jar, you notice it has a beautiful fragrance!  It tastes like honey and flowers - it is so smooth, flavorful, delightful!  No preservatives, no heating, no pesticides... Just like if you went out, took a knife and scraped a bee-hive.  Soooo GOOOOD!<br /><br />One reviewer had an issue with it not being "organic".  I would just like to say that the bees are local to where the manufacturer is.  They pollinate on flowers that have not been sprayed, harvested.... They are providing as pure and free-from-by-product honey as you can get on the market today.  And remember - organic, although better than off the shelf produce/meat/eggs... does not mean free-range, local grown.... That is a whole different topic that I could go on about.<br /><br />A note on the cappings (crust as some put it), that is a very important and enzyme dense feature.  It is to be eaten.  It is DELICIOUS!!!!!  When you take a bite, it is sweet - like the honey, and chewy like a yummy treat.  Then after that, it is chewy like gum - which is bits of wax from the honeycomb.  This is highly sought after and full of good stuff for your bodies.  So, don't throw it away - eat it!<br /><br />I recommend this honey A++!!  - And EAT THE CAPPINGS!!!

The top layer has propolis, pollen, and some wax. You can just push that to the side or chew it. It is worth the money for sure. I read up on honey after buying this and I was amazed at the health benefits of raw, unheated honey (including skin care benefits).  I also read that raw, unheated, unstrained honey is a whole food.

I came looking on Amazon for it to see if I could find it for a better price, and have found my local butcher has a MUCH better price!

review/summary: One of the best 'light' honeys
review/text: I have tried a few light honeys and I will definitely be buying this one again (I'll be getting the five pounder.) I know some reviewers have been complaining about the texture. My suggestion is to let the honey sit in a cool area for two days to let the capping rise to the top and completely solidify. When I received mine, the product had been shipped on its side and it was in a liquid state from the heat. The capping was floating at the wrong angle. This caused the capping to mix into the rest of the honey when I turned it upright. To fix this, simply let it sit somewhere cool so the crystallization process solidifies the honey and allows you to scrape the cap away and get to the honey beneath it -- it should no longer contain all the gritty parts of the capping.<br /><br />I love honey comb, however, so I enjoy eating this honey directly from the jar. I just received it yesterday and I've finished half of the jar. It's that good.<br /><br />This is the only light honey I've been able to eat from the jar. Others have been too sweet. This one is nearly perfect to my tastes.<br /><br />Another reviewer said that YS honey is better than this one because YS has an organic label. It is insanely hard for bee keepers in America to offer organic honey, and this company practices organic methods and does not use chemicals on their farms. I trust them, and I seriously doubt that the bees are venturing too far from home if they already have an abundant supply of flowers to choose from. This is as organic as honey can get in America.<br /><br />YS honey tastes horrible compared to this honey. It's almost sickeningly sweet and impossible for me to eat from the jar. This one speaks for itself. I'm going to have to buy a bigger jar for it to last through a months worth of tea drinking.<br /><br />While I prefer dark honey like honeydew and neem, this one is packed on site and never enters a barrel. This is becoming a problem for me and dark honey. I want honey that hasn't touched a barrel, and I haven't found a dark honey that offers this.<br /><br />Try this honey if you want something truly raw. If you don't like honey comb then you shouldn't try this. You will get a mouthful of honey comb from the capping, and it is nutritious but chewy.<br /><br />The lids and jars are BPA free. There is a seal between the jar and lid. This is rare; lots of honeys tend to lack a seal and touch the lid through transit. If the lid is made of metal, chances are it has a food liner made of plastisol (which contains PVC,) or it has a food liner that is hiding BPA in it. When you find organic honeys that have metal lids and the honey has touched the lid through transit, then it isn't as "organic" as it used to be.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this honey to anyone looking for a light and truly raw honey!

review/text: I bought this honey from the Eco-Fest in Baltimore, and I love it. It definitely has a different texture and taste from honey that I usually buy. At first, I was skeptical when I opened the jar to find a layer of whitish "cappings" at the top, but as the jar says, they are supposed to be there and tasted good when I got past my inhibition. I would definitely suggest this honey to others. =)

review/summary: This is like a product all its own.
review/text: Apparently I didn't know honey. I grew up near beekeepers, I've had tons of "wild honey," most of it clover and "misc" based. Most of such honeys are dark orange, but still see-through, sometimes with comb in the jar.<br /><br />This stuff... I didn't know what to make of it. First, it's from a radically different flower source which might be part of it (aster flowers or something), I know all honey looks and tastes different based on its source. But it's as different from "normal" honey as say, homemade burgers are from fast food, or grapes are from grape candy -- it might as well have some new word that would define it as something uniquely its own.<br /><br />1 - it is completly opaque<br />2 - it is cream colored, sort of<br />3 - it has all this stuff as a layer on the top which is a mixed combo of pollen, comb, etc.<br /><br />#3 has become my favorite part. Now I want smaller or wider jars so I get more. :-)<br /><br />The taste of it, as far as pure honey goes, is divine. But I actually like clover honey better I think (I grew up with it maybe is why), but that isn't any fault of the product, just a personal thing. If I could find clover honey processed the way this company does it, I'd be all over that.<br /><br />Once when horribly nauseous, I verrrry slowly sucked on a spoon of this and it settled my stomach. Found that in a home remedy cure site (earthclinic dot come) and was amazed it worked. (Sniffing peppermint essential oil also worked for that.)<br /><br />I honestly feel like this honey can't even be compared with honey from any other source that I have seen. It is a lot less like a syrup and a lot more like a creamy food.

review/summary: By far the best tasting honey I've ever had
review/text: I've purchased and sampled many different brands from different locations, and this is by far the best tasting honey I've ever had.  It's a bit on the expensive side (Locally, I can get 5lb of raw, unstrained, unheated honey for the same price as this 1lb jar), but the flavor and texture is what really stands out with "Really Raw" honey.<br /><br />Also, I love the 'cap' of pollen, honeycomb, etc.  Very tasty.

review/summary: Great raw honey
review/text: Delicious raw honey, really thick, with pieces of honeycomb.  Reminds me of my farm days when we took honey from the beehives. I use it in my oatmeal for sweetner and anti-inflammatory benefits; also mixed with a little soy milk when I have facial irritation. A little pricey, but if you like the best, this is it!

review/summary: hate the taste and smell
review/text: I pruchased this honey based on the reviews that I read about it from other buyers. I was excited to try it, but was horribly disappointed. I cannot stand the taste or smell of it. The plastic lid on the jar was cracked when I received it. It was a total waste of the $17 (including shipping) that it cost me. I purchased a similar product at my grocery store that I love.
