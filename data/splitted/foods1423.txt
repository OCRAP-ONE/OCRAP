review/summary: unfortunately underwhelming
review/text: I purchased this after reading the mostly quite positive reviews which equated its taste with Jet Fuel and other bold flavors.  My first cup (medium setting) was off-putting at best. I brewed my second cup on the small-cup setting, hoping for a bolder and richer flavour and mouth feel; none was forthcoming. I appreciate the less plastic packaging and don't find it a bad flavor - I personally don't find the intense boodness I look forward to in a cup of coffee.

review/summary: Very good coffee with less packaging
review/text: This is very tasty coffee and a bit cheaper than Keurig-sanctioned k-cups. The pod packaging is minimal.  I agree there is very little waste.  The top looks like a typical k-cup and the bottom looks like a filter.  You will want some sort of tupperware or jar to store the onecups once you open the pouch they come in since they will be exposed somewhat to air and lose freshness otherwise.  I just use a spare ice cream tub and dump the open bag in there.  Perfect!<br /><br />Today I made myself a larger cup than usual by accident and it was still rich and delicious.<br /><br />I usually drink the Newman's own coffee that I buy at Costco to give you an idea of my tastes.  I think this is better.

review/summary: Pleased with purchase so far.
review/text: I love the convenience of K cups but I don't love the waste so I was looking for an alternative. I've already tried the reusable substitutes but I could never get the right grind of coffee beans to produce the coffee flavor/robustness that I like. This coffee is a great bargain for the price, especially with the Subscribe and Save. It is not my absolute favorite, I still prefer Newman's Own blend, but it is better tasting to me than other K Cup offerings(the Folgers blends for example).  I hope San Francisco Bay comes out with more dark/bold roasts because I would definitely try them.

review/summary: Great cup of joe
review/text: Nice cup of coffee, I'm not a tree-hugger, but if you are, you will appreciate that it only has a plastic ring/top as opposed to the normal whole plastic k-cup.  I tried it because it is a little cheaper, but still convenient, with the rising cost of coffee (and everything else) compared to grinding yourself and using the ekcobrew (which works much better than the standard k-cup self grind accessory, but is still a bit of a hassle with clean up).  We do vacuum seal a canister with these once we open the plastic bag (the order came with 3 bags of 12 pods), to keep the coffee fresh (since they can't have the oxygen purged like a normal k-cup for freshness).  Overall a nice strong cup that is smooth, with less hassle than self grind and fairly cheap (even cheaper with subscribe and save)

review/summary: ahhh smell the coffee!
review/text: I have been on Subscribe and Save for Kcups since I bought a Keurig 4 years ago.  At the time, I thought the 'frustration free' box and Coffee People cups were great.  But over the years the price has creeped up and it was brought up my little cups weren't exactly 'green.'  HMPH!  SF Coffee Pod change everything.  First of all it tastes great.  It is the closest to a cup of coffee from a coffee house.  The pod design allows for a greener pod, but also more coffee per pod than a traditional Kcup.  But the real advantage is having the wonderful smell of coffee.  I've missed it.  I have a done of airtight plastic containers that keep the pods fresh and look forward to opening it and smelling the coffee.  :)<br /><br />if you are looking for an alternative for you Keurig, give this a try.  It wins on many levels including, price, taste and smell.  Real coffee fans will understand what I mean.

They work just fine in the Keurig B-3000, which is a large brewer aimed at the office market.  Sometimes you may get the "no K-cup detected" warning, but you can ignore it.<br /><br />It's great to have an alternative to the Green Mountain products.

review/summary: K-Cup that tastes like coffee
review/text: Finally, a k-cup that actually tastes like a "real" cup of coffee.  However, keep in mind you cannot use your normal k-cup "display" set up that most of you have.  You must keep these k-cups sealed in an airtight container to keep them fresh, as they do not have the plastic housing you are use to.  Perhaps this is why the coffee actually tastes like coffee.  Stick to the Foghouse blend - it's stronger and richer tasting than the other.  The cost is less, most likely because the plastic is missing.  You have a normal coffee filter-type-fabric encasing the coffee. Looks different than your normal k-cup, but tastes soooo much better.  I'm glad I read a review and purchased this product.  Hope you do too.

My favorite k-cups are Coffee People Organic, Newman's Special Blend Organic, Emril's Big Easy Bold and Timothy's Rainforest Espresso. If you like deep bold coffee flavor this one comes up short.

review/summary: Average, at best.  (You get what you pay for...)
review/text: This coffee tastes like a good cup of gas station or fast food coffee (i.e., objectively average, at best).  It is not very flavorful, particularly compared to other k-cup brands on the market.  But, this coffee is also 30-50% less expensive per cup.<br /><br />It's also worth noting (as other reviewers have) that these need to be kept in an air-tight container because they are not individually sealed; the bottoms of each cup are semipermeable filters--not air tight plastic like other k-kups.  This is inconvenient if you prefer to keep your k-cups in a k-cup tower next to the machine.

review/summary: "Green" K-cup packaging sacrifices flavor
review/text: Overall its just OK when considering the price of other K-cups.  The SF Coffee K-cups do not look like other K-cups in that they do not have the plastic base which contains and seals around the coffee filter.  This exposes the coffee to air and faster oxidation.  When drinking the coffee it lacks a fresh flavor and tastes a bit stale.  The K-cups come in a sealed plastic bag, but once its opened, the k-cups are exposed to air and they quickly go stale.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is a bit weak as well.  The lack of the plastic housing around the coffee filter, in my opinion, causes the water to flow thru the coffee too quickly and contributes to a weak flavor.<br /><br />I don't think I would buy these again.

review/summary: An inexpensive alternative to the K-cup
review/text: As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup!  Having said that, in my experience it is a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer.  I received an order of three 36 count boxes.  The 36 count boxes were unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon.  See the customer image I uploaded.  Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods.  I also have uploaded an image of a pod next to a K-cup for comparison.  The bags are not resealable!  You will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness.  I have found the pods work just as well as a normal K-cup.  I have no complaints about their function.<br /><br />About the coffee:  It is a very strong bold blend.  I think it tastes great, but it is too strong for my wife's taste!  If you like making a bigger cup (running water through the pod twice) it does a great job.  I definitely recommend this if you like strong coffee!

IT'S NOT A K-CUP, BUT WILL FIT A K CUP MAKER, and that is what they advertise.<br /><br />I can live with putting the filter cups in a baggie.

review/summary: San Fransisco k-cup
review/text: Just received my 3 pack of the San Fransisco Bay one cup for k-cup. It was delivered as promised, arrived a little crushed, but with no damage to product. I prefer a strong brew of coffee, so it tasted a bit weak for my preference. I really didn't think there was anything special about the small bit of flavor it did have. I will try it again with a smaller brew setting... Keep in mind I love espresso so I'm a hard core coffee drinker.<br />I loved the non-plastic design, and it actually fit in my Cuisinart k-cup brewer even better than the regular k-cup! I think the design is the biggest plus because it also makes the price more reasonable. I might try this brand again, but will definitely see if they have a bolder brew.

Thanks Amazon for offering such great products!!!!!!!

review/text: Was buying the Kona Blend until it dried up and then the price went through the roof. Tried several different K-Cup coffees until I found the Fog Chaser. Now I have it on my subscribe and save list. I have it sent to my office, my home, my son's home every month. It ain't Kona but it is almost as bold, the aroma fills the kitchen in the morning and that first sip is great every time.<br />And at 1/2 the price of the Kona, it is the "best bang for the buck". I'll never go back.

review/text: The k-cup coffee pods arrived right on time, even a little early. They are shaped differently on the bottom which other reviews had mentioned. They fit perfectly into my coffee maker and it looks as though there is less plastic waste than the other k-cups I have seen.<br /><br />I like strong, full bodied flavor- so does my husband- and we were both extremely happy with this find.<br />I am going to see if there is a way to get set up for monthly auto delivery.<br /><br />I will order from this merchant again...and again...and again.

review/summary: Great tasting coffee
review/text: As many other reviews have mentioned, these are not the normal K-Cups, but they work much the same. I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good.

review/summary: I love Fog Chaser
review/text: Fog Chaser is my favorite coffee and I buy it in whole beans for when I brew a full pot.  I have used it for years and would not think of changing.  When I saw Amazon had Fog Chaser for the Keurig I was thrilled. The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase.  Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).  Before purchasing Fog Chaser I was buying Jet Fuel.

review/summary: Great morning wakeup cup of coffee
review/text: These Keurig compatible onecups are a cross breed design resembling a Kcup top with a pod body.<br />They come 12 servings sealed in a vacuum bag with freshness seal. This is then placed in a attractive retail type box<br />that would look right at home on the shelf next to kcups at your favorite retail store.<br />The front of the Box has a drawing of a kcup machine and a blow up of the 1 cup inserted in it.<br />It also lists a few of the compatible keurig type brewers it will work in.<br />The top and back of the box has some photos of environmental projects that the Rogers Family has been involved in.<br />one side has a photo of the rodgers family and their mission statement. The other side has a description of the coffee contained in the box.<br />I can see how these should sell well in the retail setting and also appeal to environment conscious individual and those who are just curious about a new alternative to the standard kcup.<br />I have a Box of Fog Chaser described on the box as a blend with the body of our regular roast and the smokiness of our French roast. A heavy full bodied with hints of cedar,vanilla and toasted almonds<br />balanced with a delicate finish with honey and milk chocolate flavors. Sure sounds appealing to me.<br />When I cut the seal on bag I'm hit with a very strong dark roast scent right away and something poignant but can't place the smell. Maybe it's the ceder they describe on the box and I'm intrigued to brew and try it.<br />Fits in my B70 perfectly and I use the 7.25 oz drop as I normally do. Smells good during brewing just like the extra bold dark roast Kcups I normally drink.<br />Brewed perfectly with no issues. Smells and tastes great in the Cup. Strong full bodied french roast with a smooth finish and I like it as does the wife.<br />I'm not one to name flavors and stuff like that so you will have to try it yourself for a more specific taste profile. Suffice it to say I give Fog Chaser a Big thumbs.

review/summary: Less plastic and better taste? Yes please!
review/text: These do not look like regular K-cups. And perhaps they won't keep as long because the bottom looks like it's made of rounded cloth, kind of like a tea bag. But they fit Keurig machines just fine, are less expensive, and most importantly I think this coffee tastes better than the coffee in plastic K-cups. I actually prefer the fact that the bottom is not made of plastic. I never liked the idea that my hot coffee was being strained through a plastic cup. In fact, I just ordered more.

review/summary: Not Really K-Cups But They Do Fit in Your Keurig
review/text: Don't be alarmed when you receive these and they don't look like a standard K-cup. These are not K-cups, but dowill fit in your machine. I thought I had ordered the wrong product at first. These simply have a plastic ring at the top so that they'll fit in your K-cup holder and the rest of it is like a standard coffee filter. I've only tried Fog Chaser (ordered all 3 flavors) and was surprised that I liked the coffee. However, because it's using a filter rather than the K-cup technology, it does leave a sediment in the bottom of your cup. I find this also happens when using the My K-Cup filter with whatever brand of coffee I use.<br /><br />You will need to store the "k-cups" in a ziploc to keep them fresh. The 36-count come packaged in 3 plastic bags of 12 each. This is nice so that you only have to open up one 12 pack at a time so the others can stay fresh.<br /><br />I'm mostly neutral, but lean more toward "would buy again".

review/summary: Wow...fantastic coffee at a great price
review/text: This coffee is great in my Keurig and alot more reasonably priced here at Amazon. Shipping was fast and worry free. I really like the fact that this comes packed in 10 individual packs of 8 k-cups each. The reason for this is that these k-cups are different in their construction. Each one is plastic at the top but filter for the lower 3/4 of the k-cup. At first I thought..oh no..I see a big mess coming, but to my great surprise, everything went perfectly. I like this design for two reasons, one..they are made with green practices in every way possible, and..two..they brew alot faster than the regular k-cups. The taste is great, bold and deep mellow flavor, this is my new coffee for sure.

review/text: I am the buyer for a 20-person department.  The folks who like a bold strong coffee love this one.  I like it as well, but I use the 10-oz setting when I make it instead of my typical 8-oz.<br />"Fogchaser" sums it up pretty well.  This will clear your head and get you ready to roll.<br />I also love that there is less packaging.  I must admit to a bit of guilt over the whole K-Cup disposal situation.  (I make people use china coffee cups and am happy to wash them!)  These do not have the plastic outer cup.  I keep them in a plastic container with a sealed lid instead of in the K-Cup carousel to keep them fresher.  But I gotta tell you--opening that lid yields the most wonderful coffee aroma.

As an added benefit, the k-cups are constructed in a much more earth-friendly way, no plastic cup.  Why don't other brands go this route?

review/text: I was really lured in by the price and eco-friendly "pod" cup. I had read the good and bad reviews and decided it was worth trying the Fog Chaser. Well, I loved it! My cup was as bold and rich as traditional plastic K-cups and better than the reuseable cups (My K-cup, Ekobrew). This will be a mainstay in my coffee selection due to the flavor and affordability. I highly recommend trying it.<br /><br />Hopefully, someone can comment on whether these will work for the new Keurig Vue machine.

review/summary: Fast became one of my favorite K-Cups
review/text: Yes, it's hard to get used to the different design of these (paper-filter bottom), but they work fine in my Keurig Platinum B-70 and have enough coffee to make a bold, 10-oz cup.<br /><br />The flavor of "Fog Chaser" is strong and complex -- it took me a few days to get used to it, but now it is one of my favorites (tied with Timothy's Midnight Magic).<br /><br />I'm so glad that the patent on K-cups has expired so we can have some new companies making them, producing great products at lower price.  Hooray for the free market! (smile)

review/text: Since kcups are becoming more and more expensive, we've tried some alternative coffees for our Keurig. These "soft bottom cups" allow easier brewing and I think they make a stronger coffee. I like the decaf brew, and my husband loves the Fog Chaser. The only down side is they are not sealed, they have a soft filter bottom and they need to be stored in an airtight container, but who cares if it's cheaper and tastes good? We will continue to buy from San Francisco.

Innovative mesh cup may be an enhancement to the brew flow through, but probably limits shelf life if you let it set in the cabinet too long.  I drink a bit more coffee than one should so shelf life isn't an issue.  Worth the try, great aroma and full caffeine feel.  Gets a thumbs up from me.

review/text: I am very much enjoying FogChaser.  The flavor is great!<br /><br />As other posts have mentioned, it does not look like a traditional K cup (which is, incidentally, why the price is so great! No "k-cup" royalties, right?) but works just like a Kcup.  The coffee is packaged in bags freshness, and the company thoughtfully included a plastic food storage container for storing the open package.  Sure, it's a cheap-o container, but it works and I think it was a really nice touch by the company to ensure that my opened package of coffee stays fresh.<br /><br />The price is HALF of what I've been paying for my K-Cups from the supermarket, so I am VERY very pleased.  My household goes through 8-10 cups a day, so the savings is significant for us.  5 stars!<br /><br />Happy. :-)

review/text: Tried something new with these paper pods. The coffee is great, smells really good and tastes even better. Every once in awhile the pod gets stuck, but is easy to remove. Makes me feel a bit better about throwing away so much plastic as in other Keurig pods.

review/summary: Great alternative to Green Mountain
review/text: I am a helpless coffeeholic and a devoted Keurig User. I was so dissapointed in the k-cups after the Green Mountain takeover, almost to the point of looking for another brewing method. Then my brother in law suggested I try this coffee. WOW! One of the best cups I have ever had from my Keurig.  Not so thrilled with the Rain Forest blend but the Fog Chaser is the bomb! Don't confuse this with Fog Litter. Don't let the difference in the pod scare you, works great in my brewer. I just ordered a pack of the French Roast. Can't wait to try it.

review/text: I've had many other k-cups and none were ever strong enough for me.  This one still isn't quite as strong as I'd make myself, but it's close.  Very enjoyable.  One great thing that I noticed in the packaging (80-count) was that they included a plastic container which fit 1 bag of the cups very easily.  This will serve me well in keeping the unused but open-bag cups fresh.

Using a canister instead of the rack is a small price to pay for the difference in price to regular K-cups.  The coffee has wonderful flavor.  I like a bold cup of coffee in the morning.  If I dont have this, I drink Donut Shop.  I like the San Francisco Bay so much, I get two boxes on auto ship every month.

review/summary: foggy love
review/text: I ordered and recieved my box of 40 pods of coffee from San Francisco Bay.  When I opened the box I was alarmed that the pods were not K cups. Well, I popped the first pod into my Kuerig coffee machine and what came out was the aptly named foggy coffee.  Dark coffee that had a nice bite to it.  I will be ordering more products from this company as their coffee rocks the house. The price was better than the K cups and it is because, I suspect, the pods that they make are a plastic ring with the coffee encased in coffee filter paper.  I dont konow if they created these new pods but the are ingenious and they work perfectly, well done!

review/text: I have been ordering Coffee People's Jet Fuel K-cups for years.  I never really liked wasting all the plastic so I was happy to give these a try.  The coffee is very comparable in strength and tastes great!  But most of all, the design of these k-cups eliminates a large portion of the plastic and work great!  You do need to store them in an air-tight container, but they came packaged in separate 12-pack sealed bags which will keep the coffee fresh until I'm ready to use it.  I'm willing to change my storage container in order to help the environment just a little.  So willing that I just cancelled my Coffee People Subscribe & Save order and replaced with SFBay's Fog Chaser!

review/summary: Will buy again!!!!
review/text: I will definitely buy the San Francisco Bay Coffee again.  After I try the other flavors, I will use the subsription plan.<br /><br />After meeting my husband, I started drinking darker roast coffees, and this Fog Chaser was bold and delicious.  But the biggest reason why I tried this brand was because of the lack of the extra plastic.  I've felt bad about the excess plastic that was being discarded with K-cups.  I've bought a wide variety of gadgets that are compatible with Keurig, all in attempts to reduce waste.  Some had a re-usable cup with small inner paper filter, (which I still use when I acquire my own ground coffee) others were caps that went over re-used K-cups after they were emptied and rinsed.  But that all takes time that I don't always have.  I feel better that these have less waste PLUS they're less expensive than regular K-cups.  A subscription will make it that much cheaper.<br /><br />The box has separate bags of 8 coffee pods each.  I don't think maintaining freshness is an issue for me, since once I open up a bag, I simply put them in a sealed plastic container.  There is one plastic container included in the box, but it's a little on the flimsy side, certainly not Tupperware tough, but it's still enough to store these.  I drink one to two cups a day, so the opened bag doesn't have a chance to sit around long anyways.<br /><br />This fit perfectly in my Keurig machine, too.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this to others.

review/summary: Great Pod Coffee
review/text: Tried this pod coffee with a bit of trepidation, first it was a new style pod and 2nd it had several bad reviews.  Tried it anyway and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />1. New pod style worked great.  No issues what so ever.  They pack the pods in small bags so the air does not oxidize the remaining pods.  I use a clip to seal the bag back up after opening.  Maybe they could add a self seal bag type but then they would raise the price on me.  Leave it as is.<br /><br />2. Coffee was great.  Very bold just like I like it.  In fact it was better than the other bolds on my Amazon Subscribe and Save list.  This coffee pod just made the list.<br /><br />All I can say about the reviewers that did not like the bold taste is that perhaps they are only "wanna be" bold coffee drinkers.  Maybe they should practice more and then try this blend again.

review/summary: Best K-Cup I've tried!  Excellent taste and quality.
review/text: I love coffee.<br /><br />I drink it in the morning, in the afternoon, and right before bed.  However I had yet to find a k-cup that gave me the full bodied taste that brewing a nice strong 1:1 ratio pot ever gave me.  I tried all the usual suspects.. green mountain, starbucks, caribou, donut, etc.  While I normally love their whole bean, ground, and coffee shop stuff.. I just could never find a full taste in any of them.  So, I gave up on k-cups and went back to my trusty home drip brewer.<br /><br />Then one day our company bought kuerig machines for the office.  So, I decided that I'd go out and try to find a decently priced k-cup, as anything tastes better than the sludge that they make in their industrial drip machines.  These are what I found, and whether it's the coffee, the lack of plastic on the bottom, or some combination, I'd have to say these K-Cups are the absolute closest thing I've found to a regular cup of coffee.  It bold, but not hit you over the head bold.  It isn't watered down.  It's perfect.<br /><br />Anyway, give them a try if you want a great cup of coffee for a great price.  Don't let their look scare you off.  It's perfect.

review/summary: Good Coffee ! It will lift your morning fog!
review/text: First off if you are wondering, they are not K-cups.  The coffee is in an innovative filter pouch with a ring that fits K-cup type coffee makers.  The packaging is thoughtful, 8x 10 packs with a resealable cup for the open pack of coffee your working on. As far as taste its very good coffee, but strong ( fyi I drink coffee black like God intended). I typically make a 16 oz cup of coffee with one 'pouch' of coffee.  So for me it good tasting coffee at a  screaming deal as compared to traditional K-cups.

review/summary: Wow - much better than expected
review/text: I was really surprised to like this coffee this much. Some of the lesser-priced coffees claiming to work in a Keurig have not been so good. This coffee is excellent - and less expensive to boot! I'm picky about my coffee. I like a dark, bold roast, but find many to be bitter. This roast is smooth and flavorful.<br /><br />While I've not been really good about going out of my way to use "greener" products, I'm happy to buy a product that I really like and also happens to be more environmentally friendly.<br /><br />A couple of potential downsides with this new style of k-cup:<br /><br />1) since the filter part containing the coffee is more exposed than a traditional kcup that is encased completely in plastic, I suspect these SFB kcups may not stay fresh for very long. HOWEVER, in the 36-cup pack that I purchsed through Amazon, the company has seen fit to package the cups in 3 heavy, sealed plastic bags, so you only have to open, and expose to the air, 12 kcups at a time. Sidenote: the bag emits a WONDERFUL aroma when you open it!<br /><br />2) Also due to less plastic packaging over the filter, I notice more coffee "sludge" at the bottom of my cup than I see with traditional style kcups. This doesn't bother me. I just don't drink that last little bit in my cup. The coffee I DO drink is so rich and flavorful that this just isn't an issue for me.<br /><br />3) I take my new SFB kcups to work and use in the heavy-duty machine used there. Due to the smaller length of these kcups, some Keurig brewers don't recognize the cup as actually being there when you insert it in the basket. However, you can easily override this. When the machine says "no kcup detected," it will usu. also say, "continue? yes or no" and you simply press yes. The machine will still function, as it would if you were using it simply to brew a cup of hot water.<br /><br />I will definitely order more of these kcups and am interested in trying other blends in addition to the Fog Chaser. Taste-wise, cost and ease of ordering: an all around "win" for me!

Having bought this blend before I knew what to expect, and it didn't let me down. It delivers a full-bodied cup of coffee, with a fantastic nutty, sweet kinda spicy-chocolaty finish. On the technical side, I like that they've figured out a way to work around using all the plastic. These "K-Cups" are an ingenious design using a filter instead. Absolutely a splendid cup of coffee all around. This product has been added to my Subscription orders with Amazon.

review/summary: Great Cup Of Joe!
review/text: I am a rather late comer to the K-cup world. I have always loved my the flavorful and bold 'one cup at a time' coffee faithfully brewed by my cherished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009314RQ">Gaggia 90501 Titanium SS Super Automatic Espresso and Cappuccino Machine, Stainless Steel</a>. After six years of faithful service my Gaggia developed an issue requiring it to be sent off for repair, so I purchased a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MZYZHU">Breville BKC700XL Gourmet Single-Serve Coffeemaker with Iced-Beverage Function</a>. The Breville is intended to be an interim coffee maker while my beloved Italian Gaggia is sent off for repairs (a 3 month endeavor).<br /><br />I don't think of myself as a coffee snob, but I will admit to being particular about the coffee I drink. I was now faced with the challenge of finding some of my favorite coffees in the new to me K-Cup containers. As I came to the realization that my old favorite beans were not readily available in this medium I turned to Amazon buyer ratings as my guide in this java quest. I placed orders for both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00461AF2W">Emeril's Big Easy Bold 48 K-Cups</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TGDXMU">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Breakfast Blend, 80-Count</a> as a starting point. The SFB Breakfast Blend arrived first. I read all about the Rogers SF Bay family coffee business philosophy and their social give back and thought it was pretty cool. I then looked at their K-cups (OneCups) and thought to myself, "is that how these things are supposed to look?" Their OneCups take a more Eco-friendly construction approach so that you see a rounded filter bottom rather than the standard shaped plastic cup bottom. It all seemed interesting, but how would it taste? I thought the Breakfast Blend was really a lovely cup of coffee. The smooth medium-dark roast Central and South American beans are very tasty indeed! I would venture to say that it is on par with any of the very best medium-dark roast coffees available. I would never turn my nose up at it, that is certain. However my personal pallet preference is for something a bit more dark and bold. Three days later I received the Emeril's Big Easy Bold order and immediately tried it. It certainly delivered on all aspects of a robust dark roast with full flavor. It is a bold, dark, classic Parisian roast, in your face brew, just the way I like it. However I find it to have an ever so slight unpleasant aftertaste and a not too far away from, but not quite there bitter finish. Again this is just according to my palette, you may not think so. All in all it is a very good coffee.<br /><br />The SFB Fog Chaser arrived and I couldn't wait to try it out. I cut the seal on bag and was hit with the scent of a strong dark roast. I placed the now familiar OneCup container in the machine and hit brew. Immediately the aromas hit my nose and let me know that I was in for a treat. Fog Chaser is a strong full bodied French Roast with an extremely smooth finish. It is certainly bolder than Breakfast Blend, but is not as bold as Emeril's Big Easy Bold. The taste is full, smooth and well rounded without any unpleasant bitterness or aftertaste at all. I wouldn't have minded if the yield had been slightly stronger though. My next order will be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA70">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count</a> to see how it compares to these three. Until that time, I give SFB Fog Chaser two big thumbs up!! It is currently at the top of my K-cup coffee taste experience.

review/summary: great tasting coffee, decent price
review/text: this is my third purchase of the fogchaser kcups and i will keep buying it!  The taste is on the darker side, kind of like a SBUX french roast, but much tastier.  The smell from the bag when I open it is just heavenly!  I also like that the cup isn't all plastic, just the plastic top with mesh bottom.  I have had no occurence of the mesh bottom ripping open after about 200 of these.

review/summary: Fog Chaser?
review/text: This is a great tasting coffee. But not as strong as I was hoping for. I expected it to be stronger then the french and on the lines of Black Tiger and Jet. In my opinion, it's not as strong. I was disappointed. But still a nice flavor.
