review/summary: Cheez-it White Cheddar
review/text: I purchased these as snacks for the family.  They could also be purchased for Halloween treats or to sell at school/athletic events to raise money.<br />The only thing I thought could be better is the box.  They come 60 to a carton/no internal packaging and the box/carton is not of the highest quality.  They taste great.

review/summary: Decent.
review/text: I bought these here on sale (a case of 60) and they were good.  They arrived as just 60 separate pkgs. loose in a huge box and kind of beaten up looking, but the crackers were whole, fresh, and fine never-the-less.  Great as a snack for kids lunches or with soups.  They have enough flavor to hold up in soups and with other dishes.

review/summary: The BEST whole grain pasta available
review/text: We tried this because Cook's Illustrated rated it the best whole-grain pasta, explaining the production process as preserving the whole grain structure and nutrition while still attaining a non-mushy pasta.  And we agree.  True, its flavor is too robust for a delicate white-wine sauce, but it is wonderful with any tomato sauce, etc.  Our family eats this often.

review/text: I ordered this and, like another reviewer, received something totally different. The spaghetti I got is actually "bionaturae Organic 100 % Durum Sermolina Spaghetti." The box has two labels on each side, that of what I was suppose to get and that which I did get. I suppose it could of been possible that somewhere along the line between the manufacture and amazon, someone dropped the ball.<br /><br />I haven't actually tasted it yet, but I'm sure it's good; just not what I ordered is all!

review/summary: good for ya and actually good:
review/text: After trying some "whole grain" "whole wheat" pasta from our big box retailer with mixed results we had given up on such pasta until seeing a whole wheat pasta segment on America's Test Kitchen (with Cook's Illustrated  EIC) . The winner was this product. Since I'm "value orientated" I  took the risk and got this large quantity. We are very pleased. I am not a very accomplished cook but twice now I have cooked this product satisfactorily. 8-10 Minutes in boil'n water for nice firm pasta does it. It does have a very light nutty flavor but we both like it.  When buying this in bulk the price premium is about 6 cents/ounce over the store brand WW pastas (which seemed gritty , etc) and 2 cents or less over other "whole grain" whole wheat " products we found that are not 100% whole wheat ( or grain). For whole wheat pasta this is what we will buy going forward.

review/summary: Whole wheat?
review/text: The whole wheat spaghetti I got looked nothing like the picture: mine was pale and smooth, whereas the picture looks like it has a rough surface. Still, I tried it with an open mind because i knew it had two 5 star reviews. It didn't taste at all like whole wheat (i've been eating different brands for the last four years). It tasted awful actually--there was no grittiness and no "fiber" taste/texture. I think they made a mistake and shipped me the wrong kind of spaghetti--i'd be shocked if it was whole wheat because i side-by-side taste-tested two other whole wheat brands and this one, and this one tasted and looked completely different. Not ordering from them again.

review/summary: Very nice tea for a reasonable price
review/text: Green tea`s benefits as an antioxidant and its benefits to digestive system are generally known.<br /><br />This particular green tea has a smooth taste when you brew it in a porselain teapot. One tea spoon of the tea is recommended by the seller but you can add more for stronger taste or less for milder taste according to your preferance.<br /><br />You can also watch the flowering ceremony of the hand-rolled pearl green tea leafes in a glass teapot.<br /><br />I personally recommend this green tea to all tea lovers, especially as a substitute for black tea or ceylon tea.

review/text: This can of tea is sold in the store for more than 20 bucks and I got it on Amazon for less than 10. Yet the tea is still of great quality -- the jasmine flavor stands out so well and maybe taking into account my brewing time, the green tea smells strong yet never comes bitter. It could be an everyday enjoy, if I'm not such a tea mania and got so many cans of different tea leaves I can't take any of them as everyday... what a lovely beauty.

review/text: I ordered this tea because it had decent reviews and was a good price. I am a huge fan of jasmine tea, particularly the pearls. I tried steeping the tea in a variety of ways, using varying amounts and brewing times. I found the tea to either be weak or have a bitter taste. I have owned a number of other low and high quality jasmine teas and they have performed better and had better flavor than this tea. I will not buy again.

review/text: Let me start by saying I love this tea so when I saw it for this price I had to jump on it, bad idea!  I opened it today, when I looked in the container I was like is that a hair! oh yes it was about 8 inches long and attached to two of the pearls so I dumped some tea in my hand (the amount was what I would use for one cup) and found two more hairs rolled up in the pearls.  So Dear Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf I have always been happy with both your coffee and Tea and I would be willing to pay more for your products if you promise to make your employees that deal with the Tea and coffee for that matter wear hair nets.

review/summary: An economical, "middle of the road" dragon pearl tea
review/text: Dragon Pearl tea is one of my favorite types of tea. I drink Dragon Pearl several times a week, so this is coming from my experience of a variety of different brands. My favorite Dragon Pearl I buy from a local herb shop for $7/oz. It's fresh, highly aromatic and tastes wonderful.<br /><br />When I came across this deal at $9 for 4oz, I was curious enough to give it a try. When I first opened the canister, it had the floral-filled aroma I was expecting, albeit not as potent as I am accustomed to. I was about to make my first cup of tea, when I noticed a hair inside. Grabbing a hold of it, I pulled out a 10" long strand of black hair. My first instinct was to return it, but I didn't. I hope whoever was working that day hand-rolling my tea was at least a bit hygienic.<br /><br />The tea itself once brewed was weak. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, just significantly weaker than I am used to. If you're looking for a nice, inexpensive gift for someone, this would fit the bill nicely - sans hair, hopefully. However, if you're looking for an impressive Dragon Pearl tea for someone used to drinking it, they will probably be a bit disappointed. I'll probably finish the can, and then head back to my herb shop.

review/summary: Fair Tea for the Price
review/text: I have been ordering jasmine tea from various suppliers for a few years now.  I found this to be some of the best priced Dragon Pearl Jasmine tea around.  The Jasmine scent is definitely  on the weak side.  I believe this is due to the number of times the tea is "scented".  In addition, the tea is shipped in a tin that is not vacuum packed.  Over time, the tea will lose its jasmine scent if it is not sealed properly.  I would recommend this tea if you are on a budget and you are an Amazon Prime member (free shipping).  If you are a jasmine tea aficionado, shop elsewhere.  I give 3 stars for the price.<br /><br />Update... After using this tea for a couple weeks now, the jasmine scent has almost completely dissipated.  I have adjusted my rating to 2 stars.

review/summary: Weak
review/text: I am going to echo other reviews that call this Tea weak / bland.  I believe that the main issue is the container is not airtight. There is a packaging piece that bands over the top to show whether it has been opened; however it is not an airtight container, which causes the tea to lose its potency overtime.  You will need to steep this a long time or use a lot of pearls to reach acceptable strength, but then I think it tastes a bit off. Oh, and it is a non-returnable item.  Chalk it up to experience.  Very happy with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFIL60">Numi Tea Jasmine Pearls, Flowering Tea, 1 lb. bag</a> alternative, except that it is 4x as much tea.

review/text: On my last trip to the local Costco store, I picked up a 15-ounce bag of Sahale Snacks Pomegranate Pistachios Nut Blend. I hadn't noticed it before. Must be a new item. In any case, it represented a strange mixture of pistachios, pomegranates, almonds, cherries and seasoned with black pepper. Strangely enough, it was quite good. Delicious! Good nutrition, too. This won't last long! The calories are a little high, probably from the fat  content, but I should indicate that it's the good unsaturated fat. The sodium is a little high, but the fiber content is high also and that's good. It's an unusual but good tasting mix.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: A little different in a good way - the pepper makes it tasty! Savory-sweet. Very filling.
review/text: I bought a bag of these 15 oz. Sahale Snacks (Pomegranate Pistachios with Almonds, Cherries and Black Pepper) at Costco for $10.89. I was curious about the black pepper listed as an ingredient.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the taste, especially the savory aspect heightened by black pepper and sea salt. There is a hint of spice...the manufacturers call it "inspired by" their favorite Moroccan flavors. Overall, the mix is a bit sweeter than I like (7g of sugars in 1 serving, which is about 1/4 cup).<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />pistachios, almonds, dried apples (unsulfured apples, sugar, natural pomegranate flavor, citric acid, fruit and vegetable juice [for color]), organic evaporated cane juice, dried cherries (cherries, sugar, sunflower oil), organic tapioca syrup, brown sugar, sea salt, pomegranate juice concentrate, dried lemon peel, spices, lemon juice concentrate, natural flavor.<br /><br />This mix is probably a lot healthier than a bag of potato chips, but as I'm trying to cut down on my sugar intake, I'll eat them sparingly. A handful is very filling, so I don't end up eating the whole bag in one sitting. The bag is conveniently self-sealing.

review/summary: Fresh to Cardboard Peanutbutter Pretzels
review/text: I'm not giving this 5 stars, not even 4 because it lacks quality in certain areas. The tub of pretzels is basically a little bigger than a half gallon of milk. At any wholesale club, you can get the same amount of pretzels for less than half the cost without the peanut butter. The reason I bought such a large container is because I like snacking on pretzels; seeing that these have peanut butter in them, I decided to try them. On opening these peanut butter filled pretzels: quality is pretty good, nothing wow. The texture of the pretzels are soft and flavorful with a thin crunch, not bland. The peanut butter flavor within is good also, something in between Skippy and generic peanut butter. These little bite sized snacks are filling, about a dozen will hold your hunger. Though, about a dozen gets you a good part of your daily sodium, like many salted pretzels. About 10% of the pretzels in the tub came (before even opening) broken and with crumbs of pretzel bits. Well it's been a little over a month and all that remains are about five handfuls of them left stale and granulated mixed with salt. The peanut butter inside have become dehydrated but still edible.

review/summary: My favorites, although not necessarily for everyone
review/text: I discovered these cookies while working in Melbourne, Australia for a few months. I got to the point where I was eating them every day.  They are especially good for dunking.  Out of the package, they're pretty hard. Softening them up with a bit of a dunk in tea and they achieve a delightful texture.  I love them straight out of the package or dunked.  Either way, I still eat them pretty much every day.  They are not like "Ginger Snaps" of any kind you'll find in the US.

review/summary: GREAT on chicken and steak!
review/text: I am always looking for new and interesting ways to make chicken.  The other day I roasted a whole chicken--took a red onion and inserted it into the cavity, rubbed the entire chicken down with "Two Snooty Chefs Southwest Sedona Gourmet Spice Blend" and roasted it in a 250 degree convection oven for 4 hours.  The chicken turned out fantastic!  The whole house smelled SO good, and the flavor was amazing.<br />I also was fooling around with a tequila-lime fajita steak recipe and used this instead of messing with mixing my own fajita spices.  I sliced the steak and then let it marinate in the 1/2 and 1/2 tequila lime mixture, then on the cast iron grill plate on my stove cooked the strips.  Meanwhile, I cooked up some red bell peppers and red onion in this spice mixture (with oil).  After the meat was cooked, I mixed it in with the "Two Snooty Chefs Southwest Sedona Gourmet Spice Blend" and veggies...I served that up with cornbread and a salad.  It disappeared quickly and was a BIG hit.<br />This is a very versatile spice blend, and doesn't pack too much of a hot-punch.  The flavors are more smokey, with roasted chipotle and complex flavors.

review/summary: Great Plants
review/text: I really like prayer plants and was interested in buying a red one.  I decided to purchase these since I was having trouble finding one locally.  They arrived quickly by priority mail.  The 4 inch pots had tape around the top to keep the soil in place and the box they were in was full of packing peanuts.  Be prepared to repot the plants within the week, 4 inch pots are a bit small.<br /><br />The green plant was much larger than the red one.  The green one was also blooming (they arrived in September.)  After repotting both plants they are both thriving and growing like weeds.  They like light, but not direct sun.  The green one folds its leaves more tightly than the red at night.<br /><br />The only thing that would have improved the purchase experience whould have been if Hirt's Gardens had included a care sheet for the plants.

review/summary: About marantas and their care
review/text: I love marantas! Here I only rate them as house plants. I will rate the ones offered on Amazon when I purchase them.<br /><br />I have not yet bought these marantas but I grew them before moving from California to Idaho. Since I carried very few houseplants I have not yet replaced the marantas. Once you have found the place in the house they like, they become absolutely spectacular. If they have a couple of dried leaves on arrival do not worry. They do that regularly as they grow new leaves. They need even light, but not direct & hot, some humidity, and full watering when they become dry. Move them around including to a bathroom with windows until you see what they prefer. In fact a one-week stay in the bathroom once per month will do wonder for them. Give occasional very diluted  fertilizer. They can become leggy and drop down due to the way in which they grow. I generally prop mine-up with forked sticks. You'll see that they have little nodules at intervals and that spidery roots grow from these points, they can be carefully cut off below the nodule and replanted or put in water to be potted later. They seem to like being pot bound.<br /><br />PS: I grow all my house plants bunched together - that way they create their own micro-climate and exchange humidity.<br />Vera M.

review/text: Beautiful plants came 72 hours after the box was shipped.  I watered them immediately since one was a little dry. Both were in excellent condition.  The leaves were in the night position when I took them from the box and within minutes they responded to the light and opened for the day.  My interest was sparked in prayer plants by a planter pot which had miniature white blooming peace lily Spathaphyllum together with prayer plants of the same size leaves and height so as not to overshadow one another. The red prayer plant catches the eye with color while the green one adds leaf shading and the white blooms of the small miniature variety of peace lily is very attractive when blooming. Love this combination and the idea of prayer and peace go together biblically speaking. Have a blessed day!

review/summary: Excellent single source cold pressed EVOO
review/text: I've tried a lot of high-end olive oils and Monocultivar Nocellara is near the top of my list. This oil has a true pedigree because it comes from a single Sicilian organic farm and is cold-processed which differentiates it from other olive oils. Most other olive oils are blends consisting of cheaper tasteless oils from places like Spain or Portugal.<br /><br />Store brand oils are virtually tasteless but are fine for cooking.  Other disagree and would use this liquid gold in everything.  They're probably the same people who cook with $50 bottles of wine. Olive oil in general is not so great for frying since it has a low smoke point and burns easily. Extra virgin olive oil smokes/burns at even a lower temperature. In other words, this is an oil best used cold. It's great for dipping bread, salads and as a finishing oil on soups or vegetables.<br /><br />This oil has a little bite and is packed with flavor.  It compliments, as oposed to overpowers, your food.  I recommend it without reservation.<br /><br />The farm where this oil comes from is relatively small and produces under 10,000 liter of oil/year. This accounts for the high price. If you want a less expensive oil that is almost as good try Olio Carli Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 500ml Bottle (0.5 liter) buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D9N4Q">Olio Carli Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 500ml Bottle (0.5 liter) by [...</a>. A quick web search and you can find 3 liters for thirty dollars and free shipping. I can't post the link but if you find their website add a slash offer to the address.<br /><br />One last thing: Extra virgin olive oil by definition has to contain a minimum percentage of EVOO. The rest is just regular olive oil. Monocultivar Nocellara use a much higher percentage of EVOO than is required resulting in a superior product. Keep in mind that Italy produces twice the amount of olive oil than they have trees for because they import and package cheaper oils -- technically they are Made in Italy.

While the ravioli was great, it was even better with the Nocellara olive oil. If you care about high quality food, then you should try this olive oil.

review/summary: Another Pricey But Wonderful Olive Oil
review/text: I consider myself a bit of a foodie, and recently returned from Provence where I sampled many olive oils from that region. They were for the most part delicious.<br />I enjoy Italian olive oils also and so was looking forward to trying the Nocellara single estate oil from Olio Taibi in Sicilly. Like Olio Taibi's Biancolilla, this is really good - a wonderful flavor, full olive but with a hint of peppery spiciness. I would have rated this a '5' were it not for the price, which I consider high. Because of its somewhat unique flavor, and its cost, I never mix this for a vinaigrette (to me it would be like using a 15 year-old estate bottled rum for a rum & coke), but rather just use it with some freshly baked bread when enjoying a salad and some wine. Yummmm.

review/text: I bought this oil with a Groupon.  I did like the flavor, which I thought was pretty strong compared to other EVOOs I have tried, so keep that in mind when you use it.  Unlike "lighter" oils I've had, which can blend into the flavor of the final dish, this one was strong enough that I could distinctly taste the oil's flavor on the food.  This is not a bad thing, just a matter of preference.  However, I don't think I would pay full price for it, especially for only a half liter.  I have had other EVOOs of comparable quality, even organic ones, that cost much less for the same amount of oil.  With the Groupon though, I think it was a decent value.

We use it on salads and when cooking, but it is best for dipping with a good, hearty artisan bread.  Haven't found anything else that compares to this oil, in terms of taste and richness.

review/summary: Spectacular EVOO
review/text: Taibi's Nocellara EVOO is amazing.  It has a very pure, clean taste with a spicy finish.  Best if used on its own with a great bread for dipping, although it can obviously be used in salads or marinades (excellent for fish).  It is great to have the ease of finding an oil this good on Amazon....Great gift idea if you are tired of bringing wine.

review/summary: What a taste!
review/text: Extra virgin olive oil is one of the great tastes of Italy. Different Italian regions produce different kinds of oils (for example, olives from Tuscany, Apulia, and Sicily have different characters and result in oils with different flavors). This extra virgin olive oil from Sicily is outstanding. I have enjoyed it on salads, meat, fish, a variety of vegetables, and always found it to be truly delicious!

review/text: Try this oil and you will know why the poet Homer called oil "liquid gold." This is a really superb olive oil, comparable to the best you can buy in Italy. I am Italian and I always struggle to find good oil among the mediocre oils that is available at most stores in North America. Taibi has given me back the pleasure to savor my salads and bruschettas. But be warned; once you try Taibi's oil, you will never go back to the regular supermarket stuff.

review/text: Even if you think that you have had many great Extra Virgin olive oils, you must try this one. I tried it together with three other kinds and the difference was obvious also to the non-expert. More rounded flavor, lack of acidity are the most obvious characteristics. I found myself drinking (or is it eating?) a full table spoon of Nocellara and loving it.

review/summary: Extremely expensive olive oil
review/text: The cost of Taibi oil is extremely expensive for olive oil, even buying from a small orchard in Sicily. In Sicily, a one litre can of top quality organic oil costs about $12.  This Taibi oil is a bottle half that size so worth about $6.  Can the cost of shipping really be over $40? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another firstclass oil from Sicily available on Amazon for only $20.79 is Mandranova Biancolilla Extra Virgin Olive Oil 17 oz.<br /><br />Olive oil is bottled and released for sale two to five months after pressing. For example, oil that was pressed in the fall of 2010 - as this oil is dated - came to market from February to May of 2011.<br /><br />The shelf life of most extra-virgin olive oils is anywhere from 1 year to 18 months from the bottling date, but it is always a good idea to do as the locals do and buy fresh oil when the new release comes to market.<br /><br />Unlike wine, olive oil does not improve with age, so you can assume a 4-6 month shelf life for opened bottles, and a full year in a sealed bottle from one release date to the next.<br /><br />If you purchase an olive oil that is stronger than you like, just set it aside for a few months and then taste it again. Olive oils gradually mellow over the course of the year.<br /><br />Because olive oil is susceptible to deterioration from air, you may be better off purchasing olive oil frequently, in smaller quantities, rather than purchasing one large container. Most top producers put their oil into dark glass bottles or clear bottles that are covered in a foil wrap. Clear glass bottles allow damaging light to affect the oil, bleaching the color and souring the flavor. Keep your oils away from heat sources, such as a radiator, the backsplash of your stove, or the sun.<br /><br />It is best to keep your olive oil at a slightly cool temperature that does not fluctuate ...but do not refrigerate it.<br /><br />See also the new book:  Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil by Tom Mueller.

review/summary: Great Tasting, Zero Calorie, and Refreshing
review/text: I love Arnold Palmers, which to the uninitiated are drinks made from half iced tea and half lemonade.  Steaz takes Arnold Palmers to the next level by making them healthful.  First, they use green tea instead of regular black tea for the iced tea.  Sounds like it might not work, but it does.  Second, they sweeten the drink with Stevia and Erythritol -- two entirely natural, no-calorie sweeteners.  So you can feel good about drinking these, while enjoying an incredibly thirst-quenching flavor.  Love it!

review/text: I typically love the taste of Steaz products so I was excited to give this one a go when I saw it at the store. Unfortunately it bears absolutely no taste resemblance to any half and half I've ever had anywhere. The only flavors I get are of the stevia along with some unidentified citrus taste.<br /><br />This one falls far from typical Steaz products. I suggest staying away until they can come up with an improved formula that actually tastes anything like half and half.

review/text: I just recently discovered this brand of drinks.  I am in love with their zero calorie half & half.  I'd been drinking another, somewhat healthier brand for years.  This is sweetened with stevia and a specific version of a sugar alcohol (from what I've gathered) that is not bad for you & easier on your gut than some sugar alcohols can be.  And to boot - you get the benefits of green tea!<br /><br />Pricing here is slightly better than I found at Whole Foods, regular price.  I can't find it in any other store where I live.

review/summary: Freed Me From Soda
review/text: I tried out Steaz on the recommendation of a friend after a recent doctor visit. I had been drinking too much soda, and i'm past the point of not paying attention to things like that. I was looking for a healthier alternative, something that had more flavor than water but wouldn't be burying my system in sugar. The half and half was a combo I guessed I'd like, since I like the Arizona Arnold Palmer drink. I'm happy to report these are pretty tasty. The flavoring is on the light side, but for me it's a good compromise that gets me off the soda sugar but avoids the monotony of only drinking water during the day.
