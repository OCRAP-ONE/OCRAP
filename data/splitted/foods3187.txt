review/summary: My Favorite Seasoning
review/text: I'm on a low sodium diet so I add this to everything I eat.  Huy Fong makes a similar sauce without the garlic and it's a lot hotter and less flavorful.  Before you buy this pack of 6, go to an Asian store and buy one jar and try it out.  Then order the 6 pack.<br /><br />-------------------------<br /><br />Three years later and I'm ordering my third multi-pack.  My brother cooks for us and some of our neighbors and he adds this stuff to much of his cooking.  He said he uses a tablespoonful a day.  If someone does a really good job for us, we reward them with a jar of this sauce.<br /><br />But I caution to compare prices here at Amazon.  I'm ordering a 12 pack today for $3 a jar.

review/summary: Great Flavor and Heat - Highly Recommended
review/text: Huy Fong "Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce" is offered in just about every Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in my area, and with good reason! Unlike at lot of hot sauces, this has a great chili pepper and garlic flavor that compliments most of the dishes I like (particularly good on Pork Lo-Mein) and also provides a good amount of spicy heat. This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the borderline for several of my friend.<br /><br />This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out doesn't have enough "zing". It is also great to spread on chicken when grilling but watch the smoke when opening the grill lid, it is like OC spray if it gets into your eyes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: First off--best hot sauce ever.  Almost every food I eat now has this sauce on it.<br /><br />But don't buy it here.  I know this six pack looks tempting but...the local oriental market has 18 ounce bottles for 3.39...adding up to around 20 bucks for a 6 pack.  If you don't have any sort of local oriental market and none of the grocery stores carry it, it's still totally worth paying almost twice as much as it's retail value just to experience the stuff.

review/summary: Great kick without swamping the other flavors
review/text: I just ordered my third 6-pack. Found this item a few years ago at the local Vietnamese food store. I enjoy spicy food but do not want to kill the flavor of the underlying dish. This is a great add to meatloaf, rice, sandwiches and many other foods. Adding it to some soy sauce makes it terrific for pork fried rice or for a topping to salmon. There are many creative uses. It can pack a punch if used too heavily. I find it much more interesting and flavorful than the basic Sriracha Sauce produced by Huy Fong.<br />Buy a small bottle and give it a try. You will be back for more.<br /><br />.

review/summary: Such a nice change and a legit everyday oli option
review/text: Probably like you, we use olive oil at least every second day - so its an important part of my cooking regime.  The Village Press oil has a very fresh taste about it.  It just tastes more pure, cleaner, healthier and somehow - lighter.  Its a beautiful oil that cuts out having another big glass or oxidizing metal around and the tap works surprisingly good.  It would be five start except I havent figured out if the bad is recyclable.  If it is I will come back and change this to 5 stars.  I like that it is cardboard (light blocking is key) and that the cardboard is recyclable.  So if I can recycle the bag too, then its quite an exceptional all around product.  Back to the point!  The oil is really legit.

For things like Salads (Vinaigrette in particular) this is a beautiful oil, but don't stop there!  I have been using it on everything and it really shines!

review/summary: Southern Goodness in a Can!
review/text: When I discovered Sylvia's greens, I brought a memory of my childhood back into my life.  My grandmother cooked greens with this same type of seasoning and I've missed that these many years into my adulthood.  I don't have the time nor inclination to work through trying different seasonings to develop the taste in these greens.  But thank goodness Sylvia's has!  These greens are just delicious and since I've gone on a grain free diet, fit in perfectly with my lifestyle of new eating.  But even if I was still eating with grains I'd order this product over and over just as I've been doing for the past year or so.  You won't go wrong with this product.  It's full of flavor.  Even my Mom and Dad love it when I send packs to them.  Mom says they taste just the way my Grandmother made them and as far as we're concerned that's the highest praise we can give!

The box arrived very perfumey -strangely- and that affected the quality of the chocolate because the chocolates also started to taste like perfume. :( If you could find a different seller then that would be great :)

On the plus side, these varieties provide a bunch of protein and overall good nutrition for your cat, just buy their regular favorites with a different one thrown in for good measure.

But, then I thought, "It's English tea...how bad can it possibly be?" As it turned out, this was faulty logic, indeed.  After brewing for the prescribed time, the resulting liquid neither smelled nor tasted like tea, or raspberries, for that matter. It had a sickly sweet and decidedly chemical aftertaste. Needless to say, I would never purchase another product from this supplier. "Caveat Emptor!"

So Mauna Loa,this is a heads up to start making this more affordable.

I wondered how he flavored the burgers to get that taste of tomatoes, mustard, pepper, and vineagar just right.  There was a hint of molasses too.  The burgers were big, beautiful, and juicy.<br /><br />He pulled out the Char Crust box.  I was amazed that something this delicious could have come from a box.

It looked and smelled awful...this does not look like tastey baby food at all. Against my better judgement, I still let my son try it. The first bite he choked and gagged. I thought, "ok, it's just too thick". So I thinned it out with a bit of formula and tried again. Second bite he spit it out and tried to scrape off what was left on his tongue with his fingers! My son is NOT a picky eater by any means and loves food in general, so I knew this MUST be awful if he wouldn't eat it. Rather than torture my kid, I threw the rest out. Thankfully I had only purchased two pouches at the store before commiting to a pack of 16 on Amazon. If only I had read the reviews first!<br /><br />Bottom line, don't torture your kid with this OR waste your money!

review/summary: Watery, flavorless, sour
review/text: Agree with the reviewers who pointed out this is too watery, acidic, and tomatoe-y. It doesn't taste like beef at all. It's a little sweet from the tomato, not in a good way. I think it's a problem with all Happy Baby foods I've tried--they are all sweet, maybe to appeal to baby's tastes. This works well for the fruits and veggies, but not so much for the meat and chicken. I want my baby to eat savory food too! The texture was not appealing--very mushy with some quinoa globs. Again, where's the meat? I guess I'll stick with the fruit pouches, and make my own baby meats, which my girl loves.

review/summary: My baby and my cat won't eat this!
review/text: We had ordered some of these pouches after trying some other Happy Baby products that my baby loved. These had very little flavor and my baby tried a couple bites and then started to fight me. She even gagged in the process. Bummed that I had ordered a whole box, we tried again to no avail. Next, we  tried to feed it to the cat because she seemed interested when I opened the pouches. My cat won't even eat it. I recommend getting a small quantity to see if your baby likes it before ordering a whole box.

review/summary: Wonderful Beef Stew by Happy Family
review/text: This Beef Stew is fantastic!  It actually tastes like beef stew, no artificial flavorings or colors.  Everything in it is organic and there is quinoa too.  Babies need to be able to taste what real food tastes like.  This product delivers!  All of the other baby beef stews taste like a mystery and loaded with extra "stuff" that babies do not need.  It has great portable packaging for moms on the go.  Great price too!

review/summary: Just Love this Combo!
review/text: One of the things I just love about HAPPYBABY organic baby food is the unique combination of ingredients they offer.  I mean, how many companies utilize quinoa as the primary grain in their baby food?  I love that HAPPYBABY thinks outside the box to come up with an innovative mix of super healthy foods for our babies.  The bananas, black beans and rice work well together, both in taste and texture, and I know this is one meal my baby will gobble down every time.  Did I mention how much I love the portability of these pouches?!  I only wish they had been around when my older daughter was a baby!

review/summary: dried texture and crappy blend for baby food
review/text: I have tried many different flavors from many different brands and by far, this particular flavor from Happy Baby is the worst texture and taste that I ever bought for my baby.  My baby just doesn't like it.  I let her try it three times and she just hates the texture and the taste.  I don't why they made the food so dry to begin with.  Turkey itself gives a little dried texture compared to chicken and they should have taken that into consideration.  And the food is so lumpy and it's not even in good chunky blend either.  In the end it was a total waste of money to buy this product.

review/summary: Fish for baby!
review/text: Fish has that all important DHA that helps brain and eye development so I went looking for a baby food with fish. I was so excited to find WILD CAUGHT salmon in a baby food (wild caught salmon does not have the mercury content other fish have)! Plus it has other super foods such as lentils, sweet potatoes, and carrots! But all this goodness is only good if baby will eat it and she gobbled it right up!!

review/text: We bought a 16 pack and have 13 left.  Of the 3 that we tried, she never once finished a single pouch.  I tried it and was really surprised because it is well seasoned with herbs and spices compared to other things she will eat.  It could be the texture - I don't know.  It's a little mushy, like baby food.  Probably would be better with pasta instead of amaranth, although I appreciate the diversity of grains.  Anyway, I love it, she hates it, so 3 stars.

review/summary: So good with an avocado!
review/text: This has been my baby's (now 21 months) favorite since he was 10 months old. He seemed to be bored of it after a couple of months. My husband then was going to claim the rest of pouches as his snacks and started to have it with an Avocado, my son reached for it. So now, we mashed, somewhat, an avocado in the Ratatouille and he would inhale it down in no time! It's also a go-to meal when we are having spicy grown-up food and I'm too lazy to cook him up something else. It also helps him "go" regularly.

review/summary: Try Before You Buy in Bulk
review/text: My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!

review/text: My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes fishy. Salmon is good for baby brain development.

He like other happy baby product like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either.

review/summary: *Less Sodium than other brands
review/text: My baby loves this salmon combination a lot more than the popular chick chick (which is actually her least favorite). Yes, it does stink... its fish! I don't care for fish myself, smell or taste, but she digs this and its good for her. This brand has a much lower sodium content than plum and sprout and is cheaper on a different website. I make most all of her other foods but am not quite ready to tackle preparing meat so Happy Baby has been great for introducing chicken, fish, beef, and turkey.

review/text: My 18 month old likes them, but he will eat pretty much antying. My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon.

review/summary: yay! NOT SWEET , finally!!
review/text: I love the happy baby and similar brands of organic baby food in pouches, but they have one MAJOR downfall in my eyes- most of the blends are SUPER SWEET. It's difficult to find many pouches with just vegetables, and no super sweet fruits mixed in. I hate the idea of teaching my child that everything MUST taste sweet (spinach, broccoli, peas, etc- they're always mixed with mango, pear, apple, etc- they always just taste like fruit.) I LOVE that he Amaranth Ratatouilli is not sweet at all- it actually tastes like vegetables!! My child loves it. We frequently mix it into other things- pasta, rice, etc. It's great topped with cheese. One bit of warning though- this blend seems pretty acidic, so babies with sensative tummies might have trouble- I would just mix it in smaller portions with pasta or something else.

review/text: Mama Grain and Amaranth Ratatouille from Happy Baby have been long-time favorites since my son was about 10 months old. Even now he is a toddler, he still eats Mama Grain on occasion - it's good to take with us if we're eating out and he's being picky about what's available. It's thick and filling enough to supplement his meal. It has a sweetness from the bananas, obviously, but the black beans and the quinoa grain also help making it more lasting. So full of goodness! I agree the taste seems a little weird at first to us adults, but I actually like that's a different flavor - help to keep his taste buds open to different tastes, hopefully...

review/text: This is the only way I can get my daughter to eat fish.  I often add extra coconut oil and cinnamon to improve the taste though.  She didn't like it the first time, but after a few attempts she enjoys it.  She screams when I try to feed her any other brand of salmon, and so I think this one is worth a try.  If they don't like it, just mix it with something they do like. Great ingredients, great product.

review/summary: Happy Salmon Eating Baby
review/text: I was worried about it before I served it to my 12 month old... but after a tentative first session (there is a pretty strong salmon smell, and he seems opposed to strong scents), he's since eaten this package w/o problem, and finishes it every time!  We're pretty pleased with this meal - great texture and I feel good that he's getting some salmon in his diet.  We had one instance of diarrhea after eating this for lunch, but since it only happened once, I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the salmon package, but definitely I keep an eye for now.  It might have been one bad package in the stack... so it's still probably advisable to not serve this if you're going to be away from home :).

review/summary: Healthy, maybe. Smells/looks like cat food
review/text: I really like the Happy Baby "Chick Chick" pouches and thought this would be a great way to introduce seafood to our baby. However, the consistency is much different - much thicker than the chicken pouch, and the smell! Well you definitely know it's seafood! It reminds me much too much of cat food.<br /><br />All is not lost - our little guy would eat it, provided I dunked each bite in some pureed sweet potato or squash first. But, I don't think we'll be buying this flavor again.

review/text: My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein, and try upping the fish. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien, and were salmon.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon.

review/text: I purchased two boxes of this because previously I had purchased Happy Baby Chick Chick and my daughter loved it.  When I opened this pouch up I couldn't believe the smell and texture of the "food".  It smells just like cat food because it's fish.  And the texture is just like canned cat food.  I have two boxes of this that I can't use because my daughter gags as soon as I bring the spoon up to her mouth.  I don't blame her, I'm gagging as soon as I tear the package open.  The nutritional facts are outstanding but they need to make it taste and look better.  The Happy Baby Chick Chick is an actual hearty puree with pieces of chicken and pasta.  This is not even close.

Unfortunately, the recipe has apparently just been updated (though not reflected on Amazon's page as of 2/24/2012) to include totally different ingredients (except for the chicken). Now my daughter absolutely refuses to eat this product. The consistency and flavor seem to have drastically changed. Hopefully your child will enjoy the new blend, but I wanted to provide a warning for those of you that may have tried the other version...

review/summary: Healthy Alternative for Working Moms
review/text: I give props to any mom, especially one that holds down a full time job or two, that can puree and strain her own food.  If that's you, hat's off.  You're my hero.  I'm no superhero, so my goal was to find the best quality, best tasting food with minimal processing.  Let's face it, there are plenty of organic options out there.  And these days, I think most of them are good.  The little man likes the Gerber organics fruits.  They're easy to find and inexpensive.  But hands down, the Happy Baby products are the best quality, best tasting (in my opinion) and most convenient of them all.  The pouches are great, especially for when we're on the go.  We can eat the fruit varieties without even putting on a bib.  The Chick Chick is the man's favorite (bib required).  The negative is that they're about twice the price of the Gerber fruits and meats.  So if you're on a budget, this may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, keep some pouches around for when you travel.  Baby will love them!

review/summary: Does NOT promote healthy growth and development
review/text: I was hoping that the new recipe would include more protein/fat than the original, since in my opinion, the protein/essential fatty acids that are abundant in salmon are the best reasons to feed it to a baby.  Well, I should have taken the time to research the nutritional info before purchasing, because this item actually contains less of both. If you can manage to get your baby to eat an entire pouch of this, he/she will get a mere 1 gram of protein, or 6% of the RDA for a baby, .5 grams of fat, and 50 calories.<br /><br />That makes this a nutrient poor food.  And HappyBaby a pretty despicable company.

review/summary: Don't give up and give it more then one try!
review/text: I gave this flavor to my 6 month old son but he did not like it so I tried to blend it, but still no luck. It does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends. So I mixed the blended beef stew with green beans ( 1,5 oz of beef stew with 3,5oz green beans ) and my baby ate it all no problem. I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br /><br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it.

review/text: What HAPPYBABY needs to realize is that when you have a steady customer base, you should not change the recipe of a product!  My daughter loved this original recipe, but this recipe is COMPLETELY different.  I tried giving it to her 3 times - she refused to eat it.  I then blended it with chicken broth and she does eat it now, so it turned out to be a texture thing.  HOWEVER, the whole reason that I purchase products such as these are for the convenience of having an organic product that can travel easily - so it is very impractical for me to travel with chicken broth and a blender!

So I am not where the chicken is cuz you can't taste it. But my daughter absolutely loves it. She gobbles down the whole thing in minutes (except her teething time).<br /><br />Although I am skeptical about the chicken part, I have to trust the labeling that says heavy amount of protein is in there.<br /><br />I also tried the turkey and chicken training meal from Plum brand. It has way too much spice in there. Not for my baby who is just starting out on protein. I will try the Plum brand a bit later. But you can definitely taste the meat in their products.

review/summary: Baby HATES the new recipe!  (Loved the old formulation).
review/text: My 9-month-old absolutely adored the old recipe of this product, which was organic chicken, sweet potatoes, and brown rice pasta.  She would gobble up an entire pouch every time we offered it to her, and often ask for more.  Unfortunately, Happy Baby had to go and ruin a good thing by reformulating the product!  The new Chick Chick recipe consists of organic chicken, vegetables and quinoa, and my baby completely DESPISES it.  We've offered it to her several times now, and each time, she makes a face, spits it out and turns away from the spoon.  I see from several of the recent reviews that many parents and their babies feel the same way about the new recipe.  I can't for the life of me figure out why Happy Baby would change the formulation of its Chick Chick baby food when it was perfectly fine and delicious the way it was.  I definitely won't be buying this product again, unless Happy Baby goes back to the old formulation.  Grade: D-

review/text: I usually buy Sprout and thought I'd try this food since it got other great reviews.<br /><br />I am pleased with this meal.  It's a little less chunky than Sprout's stage 3 meals...so I worried a bit less about my baby gagging on it as he's learning to chew more.<br /><br />Also, the chicken, sweet potato is a big hit with my baby.  He ate it all up!<br /><br />These organic meals are a very nice alternative to making my own food for him.
