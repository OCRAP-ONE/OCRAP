review/summary: A nice sized snack
review/text: I have two Shih-Tzu/Pomeranian mix dogs that can be a bit finicky when it comes to what they eat. It did take them a while to warm up to these, but now they seem to love them. One of them will eat every crumb, then go check to see if his brother left any crumbs. Though I don't think these will ever replace my dogs' favorite "Greenies," these are a good change of pace for them.

review/summary: Sick Beagle on crunch and clean hartz
review/text: My dog was fine and I gave him a Hartz Crunch and clean as we were going to bed. I knew something was wrong when I noticed that my beagle, Cocoa, who rarely lets me out of site, did not follow me to bed. Cocoa, who has been sick once in 5 years that I know of, has been throwing up for 2 hours. He has also been drinking insane amounts of water, and ran outside to eat lots of grass as fast as possible, which is uncharacteristic of him. He has stopped throwing up, but I suspect it is because he either has nothing left to puke, or is fighting it off as his diaphram is still jumping. He wont even lie in bed, which is where he lives. The list of ingredients is pretty long. My dog has a healthy diet(science diet), so this could just be a reaction to a healthy dog eating unhealthy food. Anyway, I am done with Hartz, and probably on my way to the vet.

review/summary: 3 out of 5 won't eat!!
review/text: I love the idea of a dog biscuit that will freshen your doglies breath.  I have 5, so I'm always trying different dental bones and things to help me out there.  These bones are the perfect size, smell great~~like human food, actually~~but out of 5 dogs, only 2 would eat them.  I actually put one in my youngest dog, Tobey's mouth, and tried to coax him.  He spit it back out!!  Not sure if it was the smell, or the taste, but I hate to report that it would be a waste of money for me to buy these.  I have 4 Lhasa Apsos, and a Schneagle~~the Lhasa's I do have to say are pretty picky eaters, and 3 of them are the ones who wouldn't touch them, so take that as you will.<br />I WISH they loved them so that they COULD Crunch n' Clean!!

review/text: These biscuits are advertised to "clean" your dogs teeth.  My dogs were very happy and willing participants in the experiment.  They loved the biscuits (but frankly... if it comes from a human hand, they will gulp it down even if it were garbage... they're dogs... that's how they're wired).<br /><br />However, after using these, I couldn't really tell a difference in the cleanliness of my dogs teeth.<br /><br />If you want to give your dogs a treat, these will work great.

review/summary: Dog Candy!
review/text: My dogs love these.  I have a 65 lb, Golden Retriever that will eat anything I give her ... she operates on blind trust, and if it comes from my hand it must be good, so of course she eats these happily ... but hey, she drinks from the toilet so how picky can her palate be??  On the other hand I have a 9 lb Tibetan Spaniel that covets ownership of any and everything that has been dropped on the floor or has been offered to the Golden; however, he doesn't wolf it down ... instead he carries off any treasure he finds to his pillow where he will carefully, delicately, and privately decide if he actually wants it.  If he doesn't, she can have it after he is done inspecting it.  He is VERY picky about what he eats, and generally turns his nose up at most treats (after carting it away for the inspection ritual - mind you, he doesn't really want it; he just doesn't want HER to have it).  However, even this picky little critter enjoys these and gobbles them up, so ... while not having tasted them myself, I can honestly say most dogs will enjoy them thoroughly.  On a medicinal point ... I have not found any improvement to the Golden's bad breath after using these ... this is no substitute for brushing.

review/text: So I got a box of these for my 3 year old Norwegian Elkhound. All dog owners know that there are many, many products out there that claim to clean your dog's teeth. So do it better than others, and some my dog flat out won't eat.<br /><br />When I first opened the box of these I was amazed at the size of them. The box does say large, but these things are huge. I would recommend this size for much larger breed dogs than my 50 pound elkhound.<br /><br />The benefit of them being so big is it does take her a little bit of time to chew the whole thing up and eat it.<br /><br />Results? Not really sure. The box says to feed at least two of these to your dog per day. But quite honestly, that would get really expensive and I am not sure what the dietary 'after effects' would be with that dose and I really  don't want to find out. So I can not really speak to the cleanabability that this product does.<br /><br />I can say my dog enjoys them and does take a little time eating them.

review/summary: Dog loves them, and they seem to work at cleaning teeth
review/text: When we first received the box of Hartz ProDent, which proudly proclaimed "Taste preferred 2 to 1 over the leading brand," we couldn't help but roll our eyes a little.  And as I tried to break a biscuit in half for my little dog, a couple snide remarks ran through my mind: "Geez, these things are hard as rocks - they're more likely to break teeth than clean them!" and "I hope those greenish-blue specks are just minty dental crystals..."  Over the course of a few weeks, however, my skepticism faded since a) it is very apparent that the dog LOVES them - they're by far her favorite treat now, b) her breath has actually improved noticeably (though i did NOT french-kiss her to verify this for a fact), and c) her teeth do look a bit cleaner.  I still think that the best way to take care of your dog's teeth is to brush them, but for those who don't want to bother with that, the biscuits will likely provide a handy/easy alternative.

review/summary: DOGS SHOULD ENJOY THIS TREAT
review/text: My cocker spaniel dog Lucky is always looking for treats. So I thought I'd get him a box of Hartz Crunchn Clean dog biscuit treats.<br />  Lucky was initially skeptical of this new treat. We put the treat in his dish and then poured his regular dog food on top of it. Soon, Lucky was digging through his food looking for the treat; like a child looking for the prize in a box of Cracker Jacks. Over the next several days, Lucky chowed down on every treat in the box. The biscuit is also supposed to clean the dog's teeth, or improve dog breath, or something. It didn't seem to do that for my dog, but Lucky seemed to really enjoy these. So I'll probably buy more of these treats for him in the future.

review/summary: Not Lily's Favorite, but Close...
review/text: I have inherited the world's most persnickety shih-tzu. I have bought her every brand of designer, organic, healthy treats on the market and she promptly turns her nose up at all of them. I was sure that Hartz Crunch 'n Clean dog biscuits would end up at the Humane Society (where I donate all Lily's cast-offs), but lo and behold she actually tried them and seemed to enjoy them. While she would gladly choose "Tiny T Bonz" over these at least these are good for her. Her veterinarian said she is going to have to have her teeth cleaned in the next year because there is some tartar on them which could lead to tooth loss. I'm hoping that Crunch 'n Clean Dental Biscuits takes care of that problem because I know how traumatic a teeth cleaning will be for her highness. I give her one every other day so she doesn't get tired of them and not respond when I try to get her to come inside by saying "do you want a treat?", which usually gets her running. I am interested to see what the vet says at her next appointment. If there is a major (or even minor) improvement in her teeth then these dog biscuits are worth every penny.

review/summary: My dogs love these!
review/text: I have two dogs, one is a Terrier, and the other is a Chihuahua. They are extremely picky eaters. They will only eat Cesar dog food, and the only biscuits they ever eat are the ones you get from Sam's Club. The multi flavor Members Mark brand. So when I got these, I knew they would be better for their teeth, but I honestly didn't think they would eat them. Well I was WRONG!<br /><br />Now I usually leave a little pile of the regular dog biscuits on the floor for them to get when they want one. So I decided to do the same with these. I put a small pile of these right next to the ones they usually have. They went straight to these. First my Chihuahua took one, and jumped on the couch. She wouldn't part with it. Then the Terrier got one and jumped on the living room chair. The Chihuahua ate it and the Terrier immediately started growling at her thinking she was going to get his LOL. She has continued to eat these and the pile of the regular ones haven't been touched since I got these. I guess I now have to change what biscuits I buy for them.

review/summary: Good dog treats, but make sure to monitor eating of them.
review/text: I have two dogs and one tends to chomp down whatever she gets and the other one tends to sniff it out first before chowing down. I got the medium sized Crunch 'n Clean and the dogs I have are a border collie mix and a black lab mix.<br /><br />Amber, my black lab mix, took to the treat instantly, eating it very quickly. As for Palmer, my border collie mix, it took him a little while before he was ready to try the treat. However, after his initial taste, he would grab the treat whenever he is offered it.<br /><br />The size of the treats are pretty good for medium dogs. It takes more than a few bites before they can swallow the biscuits completely so make sure to monitor them when they are eating this. Amber tends to swallow really fast without chewing so I can see these as potentially a choke hazard for any dogs who do not like to chew. Therefore, make sure to watch the dogs as they are eating these treats.

review/text: Very tasty dog biscuit meant for large dogs.  I have a lab and a min pin and I just break it in half for the min pin.  They both love this treat. The only bad thing is that it crumbles very easily so feed this treat to them outside, they tend to make a bit of a mess when they eat it.  It's so large and they have to break it into pieces, when it breaks, it creates a bunch of crumbs.  I'm not sure if the advertised Denta Shield ingredient really does block new tartar formation, but the dogs love it.

review/summary: she likes it, but what the heck is DentaShield?
review/text: We received Hartz Crunch 'n Clean biscuits through the Vine program, and our medium-sized dog can go through a large-sized biscuit in about a minute.  She enjoys them, but I'm concerned about the patented ingredient, DentaShield.  "Invented by researchers at Indiana University's School of Dentistry, the same researchers who developed flouride for you and me," DentaShield might be the sodium hexametaphosphate listed as the 5th ingredient after wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, and wheat germ meal.  It sounds like a salt, which isn't necessary to clean tartar from teeth, as the box claims.  Other ways are better to clean dogs' teeth.<br /><br />These biscuits are definitely loaded with non-essential ingredients like partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and artificial color (they're uniformly tan, so where's the color?).  The blurb about the same researchers who developed fluoride set off warning bells, as many people know the issues with mass amounts of fluoride in our drinking water, but people unfamiliar with those issues may feel this is a good advertising tactic.<br /><br />Our dog likes them, but dogs tend to like junk food, including human food.  So, if you're conscientious about what you feed your critters, consider buying locally-made biscuits or make them yourself from a recipe online.

You see, my dogs loved these so much that when I was at work, they somehow got the box off the table and ate them all! Stinkers! And they are VERY picky about treats.<br /><br />The biscuits are a fairly good size, about 4 inches long and about 1 inch think, which is much thicker than standard biscuits. They are very hard and crunchy. It took several minutes for my dogs to eat the ones I gave them, and they are good size dogs and big chewers, weighing between 50-85 pounds each.<br /><br />I'll be looking for this in my local market. If they don't sell them here locally, I'll get more from Amazon. Looks like I'll have to put them WAY up the top shelf in my kitchen though!

review/text: My dog, Max, will eat almost anything, and he's never found a dog treat or food that he didn't like.  The Hartz Crunch n Clean biscuits are no exception.  He is a miniature American Eskimo, around 20 pounds, so I got the medium size for him.  They are pretty stout for a medium (in terms of thickness), but they were a good size for his mouth otherwise.  He really enjoys them.  My mom's dog, Gypsy, is a frequent visitor to my house.  She prefers soft treats to hard and generally snubs any hard treat (to Max's delight, since he'll steal it from her).  I gave her one of these, and to my surprise, she devoured it.  She loves it!  That gets a gold star from me.<br /><br />I deducted a star because I couldn't tell whether or not they were actually cleaning the teeth.  (I suppose this isn't the fault of this product specifically but of all dog products which claim to clean teeth.)  Max's teeth don't seem to be getting dirtier, but they don't seem to be getting cleaner either.  Perhaps one box isn't enough to be able to make a judgment call -- but with Max and Gypsy both loving this treat, chances are I'll be buying it again!

review/summary: My pups will eat anything--but they won't eat these unless they're the big ones
review/text: I haven't had the same success as other reviewers here. My two sibling dogs are Rhodesian Ridgeback/Beagle mixes, and they are basically breathing vacuum cleaners. If it hits the floor, they eat it. I normally treat them to Stop & Shop brand treats in the assorted flavors (and colors) because they love them. The medium sized Hartz Crunch n Clean biscuits have been spit out repeatedly by my two 55 pound dogs. I even broke them in two to make them smaller for my dogs' mouths and they still reject them. It seems to be not only the size, but the fact that these biscuits are extremely hard. I'm sure that is what helps remove tartar, but my dogs only like a tough chewing job when they are enjoying a rawhide bone.<br /><br />On the other hand, the LARGE variety go over better, but not so much as quick treats but as if my dogs think I've just given them a rawhide to gnaw on. They're just in for a surprise when, after enough chewing of these hard bones, they actually break apart and become edible.<br /><br />Some of the main ingredients include wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, wheat germ meal, poultry fat, poultry digest, sugar, dried whey, malted barley flour, dried cane molasses, citric acid, corn starch, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Aside from also having vitamins in the ingredients, these treats are loaded with ingredients that are hard to pronounce and sound like things you learned bout back in chemistry class!

Two of the three, would turn their faces away refusing to take the biscuit in their mouth or even lick it.  The third dog would readily eat them but she also has a nasty habit of eating dead animals and squirrel poop.  After giving my single "test subject" 2 biscuits a day for 2 weeks I did not notice any reduction in the visible tarter on her teeth nor did I notice fresher breath.  Perhaps with a longer test trial, some benefit would become obvious, but given that the majority of my dogs won't eat them I doubt I will be purchasing this product in the future.

To give you an idea of whether these are size-appropriate for your dog, she's a 45-lb lab/terrier mix, about nine months old.<br /><br />So why did I only give it a four? When I first gave her one, she thought it was a toy.  It took her a good ten minutes to figure out it was food. This suggests to me that the flavor could be made more appealing (though I'm not planning on tasting them to find out); on the other hand, she goes straight for the crunch nowadays, having figured out what they're for (well, other than the tartar removing part, I'm pretty sure she doesn't much care).

review/summary: My doggies love them!
review/text: Hartz Crunch 'n Clean Biscuits are vet recommended.  The front of the box claims they remove 2 times more tartar than plain doggie biscuits and have a meaty flavor.  The small size seems to be just right for my two dogs (a pomeranian and a little terrier mix) and they absolutely love them!  There are only 35 calories per biscuit, so they make a good snack.  Directions state to give two daily.  Great product!

review/summary: Molly-approved :)
review/text: As the first review for trying out a Vine product, this one had considerably more success with my dog than I anticipated. It's not her absolute favorite, but she does seem to enjoy them and eat them (most of the time) when we give them to her. It also never hurts that it's a useful cleaning device for our dog too.<br /><br />Our dog is a German Sheperd/Retriever/Labrador mix and she is a year and 8 months old.

review/summary: I'm no dog dentist, but...
review/text: My 3 dogs (Black Lab, Blue Heeler and Rhodesian Ridgeback) didn't really know what to think of these at first because I've never given them doggie bisquits before... they just dropped them and looked at me like... don't you have any REAL bones?  But now as I just fed them the last three, they definitely know what to do with them and welcome them.  Each takes his/hers off to a remote place and works on it until it's gone.  Mine are the large variety so they last them a while.  I don't know if it's doing a job on their teeth, but there's enough chomping going on that it certainly should be cleaning them well.  I'll buy more of these!

review/summary: Lily and Lola Approved
review/text: There's not a lot I can say about the tartar fighting amazingness of Hartz's new tartar fighting Crunch 'n Clean dog biscuits. However, I can tell you that they MUST be delicious. Lily and Lola are Boxadors and large ones at that so the biscuits lasted mere seconds during the shark-frenzy-like consumption period.<br /><br />They did not bark at the UPS man when he delivered the biscuits which meant they were not a box of crumbs from a launch-delivery as he ran scenario. Lola, the finickier of the two (though both will eat fresh deer droppings, go figure ) didn't hesitate to snarf them down. And when I hovered the biscuits over their heads the Pavlovian drool strings appeared as if I was offering something truly dog-delightful (I suppose like a plate of wildlife droppings). Both Lily and Lola licked up every crumb of Crunch'n Clean after the biscuits broke up while being chewed.<br /><br />I do like the idea that the substance, DentaShield, coats the teeth to block new tartar formation. And I like that I can feed the girls treats that serve a purpose besides just tasting doggie-delish.

review/summary: Woof Woof Good
review/text: I hope you do not mind but I told the old two legged humans to take a break while I let you know how we liked Crunch 'n Clean.  For the record, we are 9 and 10 year old Yorkies and if you know anything about Yorkies we are weird when it comes to eating.  Sure we are adorable, loving and just the best pets in the world but we are picky when it comes to eating.  The humans, bless their heart, bring home some of the weirdest stuff you can imagine.  Stuff that comes in boxes, bags and who knows what else.  They got smart a few years ago and only bring home small bags, etc.  We take a sniff and walk away unless we like the stuff.  If we don't like it, they give it to some other dog and that poor old thing is huge, loved and not lacking for food.  He has his own stimulus plan.<br /><br />Sorry for the elaborate history but Hartz has done it again.  We really like these small biscuits and know full well that the humans will get more.  I can't wait to see the Vet to show off our clean teeth.  Even though it has been only a few days the difference is quite obvious  They almost sparkle and by the time we get to the end of the box they will look like TV teeth.  We simply do not care about all those human considerations like calories, fat, fill and such.  We care about taste and the ability to knaw and eat something that makes our mouths and tummy feel good.  Hartz Crunch 'n Clean fills the bill.  Thanks for stopping by and y'all come on back.  Wuff Wuff.

review/summary: "Small" sized biscuits
review/text: First off, my dog loves these buscuits.  I'm not sure if it is still just from the novelty of having something new, but even that would indicate that they aren't just the same old treat in a different box.  Now, like most dogs, she gets excited for just about any type of treat, but she clearly favors some over others, and she does enjoy the Hartz Crunch n Clean Dog Biscuit, Small.<br /><br />My dog is also 60 lbs, and would not be considered small -but these aren't too small for her.  The biscuits are very hard and might be a bit big for a really small dog.  I usually buy small to medium size treats anyway, so they are a good size for my dog.<br /><br />If you have concerns about ingredients:  these do contain artificial food colorings, lots of 'unpronouncables' and a high wheat content. I generally avoid these in dog food, but since this is the equivalent of doggie junk food, I can dole these out sparingly as rewards and not a diet supplement.<br /><br />The dog says five stars, but I'm leaning towards three stars because of the ingredients, so we have settled on four stars overall :)

review/summary: My dog likes the other brand better.
review/text: I gave a Hartz to my dog and he ate part of it and stopped. Then I gave him the "other" brand and he ate it up. So my dog only will eat this if there's nothing else around. It's hard to write a review since it's up to the dog whether he likes it or dislikes it. Each dog is different on what they feel is good so I didn't get to the point to see if it helped his teeth or not.

review/summary: Tasty biscuit according to my dog
review/text: As another reviewer mentioned, these biscuits are a bit large for a very small dog.  I have a maltipoo and do not usually give him bones this big so I would break them up -- which is no easy feat since these are hard as rocks.  I guess that is what helps remove the tarter?  Anyway, I would put a biscuit in a sandwich baggie and use a small hammer to break up the biscuit and give him a little piece as a treat.  My dog probably only eats one full biscuit daily since I don't want to over-treat and worry about weight gain.  He does love them though and he always enjoys eating them.  I cannot say that his teeth look cleaner to my eye but I do try to keep his teeth clean and am for anything that helps accomplish that with ease as these biscuits do.  I took off a star for the somewhat questionable ingredient list and also for the size.  An extra-small would be a good idea or a small treat size nib.

review/summary: A bit more protein a bit less wheat
review/text: First, I do have to say our dog Mitzi (a black Chow) enjoys the biscuits and the size is no problem for her, even though she is only 40lbs (small for a Chow). I can't tell if it actually removes tartar, but I am giving it an extra star for that if it does. I am deducting a star because the main ingredient is wheat and a dog should have more protein and fewer carbs in its diet.

review/summary: Mixed opionions from my two dogs.
review/text: I have 2 medium sized dogs, a siberian husky who is a bit of a picky eater and my puli who is a trash can. They both are typically fed Wellness brand products, so I wasn't sure how they would like  the Crunch 'n Clean biscuits.<br />My puli, being the little trash can he is, stared at and played with a biscuit for a while before digging in, which is not his usual form. However, after a few minutes he snarfed it right up and he has continued to do so for the past several days.<br />My husky on the other hand initially left her biscuit and stared at it. Then she licked it and stared at me, leaving it on the ground and walking away.  I tried again the next day with similar results. On day three she begrudgingly took it and ate it, but she left bits of it all over the floor, which is not her MO for our normal brand.<br />I think, therefore, it is likely that how well your dog will or won't like these treats is dependent on how finicky your dog is.<br /><br />They do appear to assist with removal of food particles. I could not ascertain whether they assisted with tartar build-up removal as neither of my dogs really have this problem. However, if the loose food is removed, I suppose you could argue that it would reduce the potential for tartar build-up in the future. It did not make their breath smell remarkably different.<br /><br />The caloric content is high considering the ingredient list (50 cal/biscuit). This could be a problem for anyone with pets that have weight issues as the recommended serving is 2 biscuits twice a day for 200 calories total. The ingredient list also sports a number of grain products, wheat, barley flower,  and corn starch, which could be a problem if your pet has allergies. It also contains partially hydrogenated oils and sugars, neither of which are particularly good for either pets or people. So those people who worry about what their dogs eating, or those with pets with allergies will probably not find this product to their liking. I am most concerned with the calorie content and wonder if the reason I did not notice noticeably fresher breath was because I fed my dogs half the recommended serving (so 1 biscuit twice daily) as I have one pet whose weight I have to watch.<br /><br />All in all I think this is a split decision. I think many dogs will like the biscuits, like my puli and be just fine with them. They are a good size for the medium breeds and they probably will prevent future tartar build-up. For finicky eaters and/or owners, or those pets who have grain allergies, a different choice may make more sense.

review/summary: Dogs like them...
review/text: I've been giving these out to customers at our grooming shop for the last several days, and the response has been very positive.  Most dogs are anxious when they're at the shop, so very few will eat a treat.  However, I've had several dogs eagerly enjoy these while waiting to go home.  If a dog will eat these while waiting for their owner, they must be pretty darn good.

review/summary: the dogs love these - but they love all treats
review/text: If you are looking for non-wheat based treats - these are not them - the first ingredient is flour. The second is wheat meal.<br /><br />Some people are very wary of this sort of thing for their pups, so I wanted to get that out of the way. Do they clean your dog's teeth? I can't say as we brush their teeth nightly - but they are quite hard biscuits - so they have the potential - as do most other very hard treats - to help clean teeth.<br /><br />Size - small - well, really, they are on par with other medium biscuits - so if you have a toy breed - as in less than 10 lbs - they will likely have trouble with these as they are larger than most 'small' biscuits.<br /><br />The dogs love them - of course, the dogs love all treats - but they don't spit them out in disgust ;)<br /><br />Overall, they are fine - the pups have gone through most of the box so far (we have 3 and they get treats a couple times a day). No problems at all.<br /><br />If you have a 15-50lb dog - and are looking for a hard treat that might help with keeping their teeth clean, this is a good option.

review/text: I have a 12 year old sheltie with older teeth, despite yearly tooth cleanings, his breath is not as good as it should be. He can no longer chew his tooth vet approved tooth cheweys, so I thought I would try these.<br />I am not sure why so many reviers are hung up on "taste", as a 20 year dog trainer I suspect they have very spoiled dogs that are over weight and need to be a bit hungry.<br />The goal of these cookies  is breath work!!! not taste!!!<br />They are cruncy! suggest you do not feed on carpet!  and after two days his breath was better when we played toys. I think they have made an improvement in his breath, and suggest you try a box.<br />two days later,, we skipped a day,,, and I could tell he needed one.<br /> ****I have fed them for two weeks and the teeth  have improved.<br />  If your dog has bad breath, try one of these a day. doglady forest grove

review/summary: I'll buy again: dog loves 'em, good size for large dogs, ingredients so-so, somewhat pricey
review/text: The good:<br /><br />The 1st test of any dog treat is how much my dog likes them (after all, they are treats for him!). He loves these biscuits; in fact, I usually give him a dog supplement with each treat and he refuses to eat his supplement until AFTER each biscuit crumb is gone.<br /><br />I also like the size of the large biscuits: my lab needs to actually chew these; can't gulp them in one bite.<br /><br />The so-so:<br /><br />The ingredients are pretty standard; I home feed my dog, so I do pay attention to ingredients. Still treats are treats, and as such, the ingredients in these once/per day treats are acceptable to me.<br /><br />The amazon.com price for the large biscuits is $3 per pound --- way cheaper than some of the other things marketed as teeth-cleansing, but still, $3 per pound - even with free shipping - is a little high. I checked and these are not offered as subscription items, which would knock off 15% of the price.<br /><br />Overall summary: I give this product 4 stars, marking down just slightly for price & ingredients.  That said, I'm placing my 2nd order now ...

review/summary: Good Clean Treat for your Dog
review/text: I got worried about this brand of dog biscuit when my golden retriever (18 months old) licked it a few times and then sat there. She then ate it all up in a little less than a minute. She didn't attempt to jump for it (she often does for cheese or other treats) but my dog Georgia seemed to be happy with the treat. I don't think this brand of biscuit will appeal to all dogs (picky eaters may not enjoy it though that doesn't seem to be a problem with most dogs) but it is a great alternative for dog owners who want only the healthiest products for their pets.

review/summary: Simply the best!
review/text: Rose tea is so delightful, I am amazed it isn't bottled and sold in stores, or at the very least sold at high end coffee shops as a specialty item, as a lot of other teas are. Rose tea is simply that wonderful! It smells like you are standing in a field of roses and the taste is quite delicate.<br /><br />My favorite floral teas are jasmine and rose and, in my humble opinion, mixed together they make the perfect cup of tea. I take 2 jasmine tea bags and 1 rose and place them in a picture of nearly boiling water  and let them steep together for about 4 minutes. The aroma is just wonderful and the taste is so delicious my 13 year old can't get enough of it, and that's saying something for a kid who picks soda over everything else when given a choice. (he does add sugar to his tea, but I enjoy mine plain or with a dash of honey).<br /><br />On a side note, you can make a wonderful spritzer for your face (& body) using this tea.. You can look online for ideas, but the basic concept is you make your floral tea (anyway you like) and mix it with water in a spritzer bottle that you keep in your refrigerator to mist on your face during the summer and/or winter to keep your skin hydrated and it smells awesome! Another great idea that I came across online, that I love doing is a weekly tea steam facial! I take one Numi rose tea bag and one Numi jasmine tea bag, place it in a silver mixing bowl & pour boiling water into it & let it steep for 2 minutes (please be careful not to get burned) and you place a towel over your head and let the steam open your pores. After 5 to 10 minutes rinse your face with cold water to close your pores. Your face feels wonderful and the scent calms your mind.<br /><br />I love the rose tea and would highly recommend it to everyone!

review/summary: What An Amazing Tea! Romantic and Unique...
review/text: *****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: "Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair." I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Love this tea!
review/text: I am a dedicated lifelong coffee drinker, so when a friend suggested I try this tea, I was skeptical, to say the least.<br />Before even opening the box, reading the information about their fair trade practices and recycled materials and biodegradable packaging, I was impressed. Then I read the ingredients: white tea and rosebuds. That's it. Nothing else. Wow.<br />So I brought some water to a boil and opened one of the individual packets of teabag. Oh, that fragrance! Truly, it smells like roses in springtime.<br />Let the tea steep. Not too long; it gets bitter if you expect your tea to be as dark as, say, Tetley or Lipton. Just a couple of minutes is plenty.<br />Sip. Enjoy.<br /><br />That's it. It's wonderful tea, a welcome break from coffee (though I'm not ready to entirely abandon my coffee!)

review/text: I've never been into rose-scented stuff very much, but my coworker INSISTED I try this Rose Tea. Verdict: seriously delicious. It blew me away and completely surprised me! From the first sip, you kind of get hooked. It's one of those things that you just have to try for yourself to understand. I've never had another tea quite like this one, and now we're always out of this flavor at our office...because of me. :)

review/summary: I drink this tea like water...
review/text: A friend of mine turned me on to this white tea a few years back and I literally cannot get enough of it.  It smells fantastic (just like you guessed it would-- like roses) and it has a light and wonderful flavor with a hint of rose.  If you add a little bit of honey to a cup-- the best way to describe it is heavenly.  I let it steep for about 3 minutes...

review/summary: Just okay
review/text: Is it me, or does the description "full leaf" inspire the idea that the leaf is actually complete, or at least broken but sufficiently large? I was really looking forward to seeing actual rose leaves and full leaves, but instead the tea bags I got have leaves that are so small and broken, they are almost dust. Overall the tea is okay -- not great. Has a nice smell, but flavors far too fast and does not last through two steepings.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: You have to be careful of how long, and at what temperature you prepare this tea. I would recommend 180F and not a second over 5 minutes. This tea has a tendency to become extremely bitter very quickly. Another note, most of the fruit pieces will settle to the bottom of the bag, so make sure you get a good mix of leaves and fruit before you steep. If done properly it can taste very good, but again the margin of error on this one is slim.

review/summary: Good Cat Food Without Smelly Cans
review/text: What self-respecting cat isn't a picky eater?  I've never met any.  My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat.  Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both  the Beef in Gravy or Tuna.  Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go-to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods.  If you ask him his true five-star preference is meat caught fresh in  the garden.  Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!<br /><br />I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.  (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!)  Pouches are easy to dispose of too.  Just rinse and trash.  You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center.

review/text: It is hard to get just one falvor of this product. I was very happy to order 48 pouches. However, when they arrived the out side of the box label was turkey in gravy but they contained mixed grill instead. I could not return but Amazon gave me a total refund. If you are ordering this, wait about 10 days (after 9/1/12)so you don't receive Mixed Grill like I did. It was labeled wrong from the factory so it will take them a while to get new shippments.

review/summary: My cats go crazy!
review/text: Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor.  My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone.  When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food.  She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone.  She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves.  After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas.  The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store.

One pouch doesn't go far so it is more of a treat than a meal (unless you feed according to recommendations on box).<br /><br />Pouches are easy to open and a little messy, always seems to get on my fingers.<br /><br />My cats come running if they see me reach for the pouch or they hear the sound of flicking it back and forth before opening.<br /><br />All the yucky stuff (think fast food for cats) must be addicting because they seem to listen for the very quiet sound of the rustling pouch.

review/summary: Tasty food for a picky cat
review/text: Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: "She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.

This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have.  There's a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K">Friskies Cat Food Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> are more expensive and very similar.<br /><br />I have these on Subscribe and Save so the price is pretty good.

The result is a mild tasting snack with a good balance of sweet and saltiness. One serving (32g) contains 140 calories, 4g of fat, 4g fiber, 6g protein, 200mg of sodium and 17g of sugar. Not exactly a health food but better than your average potato chip.

After comparing these with other brands, I noticed the fiber content of these are 4g. Some of the other brands indicate 1% or 2%, much lower than these.  It does have sodium, but so do potato chips.  These are great idea to keep a stash in the pantry for guests that drop by unexpectedly.  I pour them in a large bowl with a scoop or spoon. Then can place little snack size bowls as well (or people can use their hands or napkins) to hold and munch away.  Have a nice cold pitcher (or a variety) of drinks (or milk if some find it too hot) and you're good to go.

review/text: My son is supplemented with formula, and sometimes when we're out in town it collides with a feeding. Nothing has proven to be more useful and convenient than these bottles. They are premixed and measured, all that is needed is a nipple and it's ready for feeding! A lot of reviewers apparently don't realize that Amazon's prices fluxuate and you don't rate a product on the price. While at one point they might have had this insanely overpriced, currently it is 7.97 - cheaper than Babies R Us - and ships for free with Super Saver or Prime. Hands down, a better deal than a brick and mortar store. But, setting price aside as it could possibly change again, the product itself is fantastic, and I will continue to buy it.

(once u get them on a feeding schedule that allows u to sleep longer at night then u will be alright)

These with the enfamil sealed "disposable" nipples are nice to have as a back up sterile option in your diaper bag.<br /><br />After we use the disposable nipple, we save the collar (and nipple) to wash and reuse. They are not really disposable but they are more useful for a sterile nipple to use when needed, then put in the normal bottle collar circulation.

review/text: I just had a baby, she is so sweet and beautiful; so she deserve to have what she is like. I couldn't find the same enfamil any where, I found different other forms, same brand but in powder from, but she refused to drink it. I was so desperate. Then I looked in Amazon and I found it in a very good price. Guess what? It has been delivered to me within two days only. I and my baby are both happy since then.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YDJSBC">Enfamil Newborn Nursette Ready To Use, 2-Ounce, 6-Count Bottles</a>

review/summary: PRICE TOO HIGH
review/text: I agree with other reviewers.<br />19$ is just too high price for a 6pck 2oz enfamil premium newborn nursette set.<br />This is available at less than 9$ elsewhere.<br />You can get a set of 48 from enfamil for 68$ only.<br />There is something seriously wrong with this deal and Amazon should really do something about it.

review/summary: Order from Enfamil
review/text: You can purchase a case with 48 bottles from Enfamil directly for $68.00 with free standard shipping.  Charging almost $20 for 6 bottles is not fair to new parents who are sleep deprived.  Seriously? This is a joke.  Babies R Us usually also has this item in stock.

review/summary: Convenient but has it's issues
review/text: I have found these to be convenient when on long road trips, or in small spaces such as a on a plane. However, while they are convenient bottles, they do not come with the nipple and so you will need to remember to bring that along. Also the bottle tends to leak. It may be because of the nipple I am using is not the recommended nipple. All in All, I do recommend them for on the go but they are not something I would recommend for everyday use.

review/summary: BEWARE!!!!!!!!!
review/text: This used to be my favourite salad dressing. The most recent bottle I purchased says 'New Look!' as does their website. The bottle holds less but they didn't lower the price. And bit biggie, while they say they haven't changed the recipe, they have. It tastes terrible compared to previous and it's far more oily and watery.

review/summary: Great Way To Buy These Biscuits! My Dog Loves Them.
review/text: My dog is medium in size, but he doesn't like large bones or treats. These are tiny, and I think he thinks he's getting more, because he gets them more often. They are easier for him to eat though and he doesn't need large ones because I don't want him to overeat.<br /><br />He also has a sensitive stomach and these don't bother him.<br /><br />Good choice for us and SO convenient to have them delivered right to the door. I'm hoping my dog will come to think of the UPS delivery man as a friend, but so far it isn't happening.<br /><br />EDITED to say that this order contains a lot of dog biscuits! I think I bought too much for one dog. It's going to take a long time to finish all those boxes. I probably should have bought less or added more dogs.  :)

review/summary: Iams Small biscuits for dogs
review/text: Iams dog biscuits are the only ones I give my dog as they are flavorful, crunchy, balanced nutrition and in addition to all that they  make my Lab smile !  She prefers the small size though she is NOT a small size.  She gets two since they are small and thinks she is getting more that way. (Sneaky Mom)  You can't beat Amazons price.

review/summary: My dog likes these tiny treat biscuits!
review/text: My order from Amazon arrived very quickly.<br /><br />My lab mix, medium-sized dog has trouble with large treats. These were tiny.<br /><br />When they arrived, I took one out and he sniffed at it very cautiously, then tried it. It passed his nose test and his mouth test.<br /><br />We're happy.<br /><br />EDITED to say that he has changed his mind. Now he prefers one size larger, but he still likes these.

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: Up until recently I have had 4 dogs. Sadly, one passed away from old age this past July. Anyway, all four of my dogs love these Iams biscuits. My finickiest dog never turns them down although she has turned down other brands of biscuits. The only thing that puzzles me is that the biscuits are now thinner than they used to be. They must still taste the same since my dogs still gobble them up. I had brought up this inconsistency to an Iams rep at a dog show about a year ago. His only answer was that they had 2 manufacturing companies and one must be making them thinner than the other company. I would think that their standards on this would be fairly strict so that the 2 companies would be manufacturing identical products, but apparently not. Oh well, it's not really a problem as long as my dogs remain elated with them, and since they are sold by weight there's nothing sneaky going on as far as I can tell. I love that I can order a pack of 6 on Amazon.com. Many times the stores do not have that many, so the 6-pack is really convenient since my dogs go through these pretty quickly.

review/summary: Dogs love them, a lot of treats!
review/text: I have 2 dogs, one is a small chihuahua and one is an older sheltie. The small dog eats these things like crazy, loves them. The older dog has few teeth left (she was abused and we rescued her). A lot of treats we buy are to hard for her to eat but these are the right texture and hardness. She can chew them up and she loves them as well. Perfect for giving to the dogs after they use the bathroom.<br /><br />The value is great. I didn't really think about how many boxes 6 of these were but the deal is that much better when you actually see how many treats you have. It's an amazing amount and I'm set with treats for a few months at least!<br /><br />Great deal, I will be placing a new order when I start running low.... But that will be a long time!!<br /><br />I uploaded a picture so you can see how much the little dog loves these thing!

review/summary: Healthy Treats
review/text: I have been giving my dog these treats since she has been a puppy.  She loves them and were great rewards for her training.  Best of all, they have kept her teeth and gums clean and free of plaque.  I recommend them to all dog owners.  Buying them from Amazon on a recurring basis has been a lifesaver.  These treats do not last long on store shelves so finding them locally has been difficult.  Thanks Amazon for solving my source problem!

review/summary: Great Way to Buy a Great Product: Subscribe Today!
review/text: I live in an isolated town, and you cannot purchase Iams dog biscuits within a four hour radius.  Unfortunately, Iams small biscuits are all my parents' spoiled dogs will eat for a snack.  Like another reviewer's dog, these dogs will not eat large biscuits, even though one is a Great Dane and the other is a lab mix.<br /><br />When I found the monthly subscription on Amazon and found they were slightly cheaper than in the stores (where I can no longer buy them; thank you, over-sized "super" stores that carry fewer and fewer products since you feel the consumer is at your mercy), I immediately ordered them.  They arrived a week later with free shipping.<br /><br />The packaging was neat and tight; very few biscuits were broken in the opened box.  They were also very fresh.  The expiration date was June 15, 2012.  Traditionally, the ones I've purchased in stores were only good for six months or less.  I subscribed for two six packs a month, and it's very satisfying to know I don't have to worry about my mother haranguing me to drive to Mississippi to pick up dog biscuits.  They come to the PO box once a month: No fuss, no muss, no bother.  And the dogs are infinitely happier. :)

review/text: If your pooch is pampered, this is the way to go.  All the Wal-Mart stores quit stocking these and so did Target so I had to start looking around to find a better value.  This is it.  They arrived quickly and sre actually boxes, not bags.  It's a good product at a great price.
