review/summary: Love This Conditioner!
review/text: My hair is very prone to dryness. I use to layer 3 different leave in conditioning treatments to keep my hair from drying out between washes. And that only bought me a few days. If I wash my hair too often it starts to shred so I wash it every 7-10 days. So I'm used to about 4 days of good hair and then 4 days of fighting with it until I wash it again.<br /><br />That's not a problem with this conditioner. It leaves my hair really soft (which also makes it easier to straighten) and my hair is shiny and healthy and bouncy until I wash it again. I'm really excited to have found this line. The shampoo that goes along with this is also a great product.<br /><br />Note: I would say this is probably just for really dry hair, though the shampoo can be used on anyone with dandruff or a problem with excess oil or product buildup on the scalp. This conditioner works great for me though. (Dry hair/Dandruff prone.)

review/summary: Just Average...
review/text: It's summertime and I have dry hair and scalp resulting in an itchy head.  Although this conditioner does get the tangles out, it hasn't made my hair any better but, it's not any worse either.  I just don't see any results.<br /><br />I dislike the smell of the shampoo which I think smells like play-doh but the conditioner isn't that bad.<br /><br />I have used Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty's Dry Scalp Shampoo & Conditioner and saw results immediately.<br /><br />I found this conditioner to be very average.  I don't think I'd recommend it.

review/summary: Lots of things to like!
review/text: Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner has a lot of pluses.  I've got dry and frizzy hair and usually use $20 per bottle stuff to try to combat it.  This stuff works about as well.  My hair feels clean after using with no build-up feeling, it smells nice, and the upside-down bottle is a terrific design.  I've still got frizz, but at least it's silky frizz.  I'm going to alternate this conditioner with my expensive brand and save myself some money!

review/summary: No Scent and Works Great!
review/text: I gotta say that I am truly pleased with this cream rinse.  The first thing I noticed after opening was that it wasn't laden with perfume.  I couldn't detect any perfume whatsoever.  I can just barely tolerate perfumes and never wear any so not having my hair smell like a perfume factory for the rest of the day was a very nice surprise.  And on top of that it really moisturized my hair wonderfully!  I used a medium/small blob and worked it thoroughly through my hair after shampooing.  It rinsed out well and left a soft, protective coating that really made my hair shine and feel very healthy and soft.  I have shoulder length straight hair and combing out the wet tangles was super easy!  I will definitely be adding this to my list when I need to top off my $25 purchase to get "Free Super Saver Shipping"!  I can't have too much of this if it works this well.

review/summary: Nice Feel, Pleasant Fragrance, Good Conditioner
review/text: I have really thick hair, shoulder length, and I color it. I like a conditioner that leaves my hair clean but smooth and silky. Isn't that what we're all looking for? So far, after a few uses, this product has done well. It it thick so you know you're not putting a handful of just water on your hair. It rinses off and feels clean and has a pleasant smell.<br /><br />My hair has some 'fluff' factor without a lot of flyaways and feels nice to run my hands through it.<br /><br />It doesn't make my hair feel extraordinary but it does feel good. For the price, it's a good product.

review/summary: Feels like silk in your hair.
review/text: After using the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Shampoo I used this to make sure I could get an accurate impression of the Shea line and I loved it.  When you put the conditioner in your hair it feels as though you are adding liquid silk.  I leave my conditioner in for 3 minutes and then rinse and my hair felt so nice and clean and silkie.  The fragrance is nice and not overpowering which is a big plus in my book.  Overall though I do like using the two products together for the perfect results.  I have dry hair so this is great.  Also this would be great to add to your hair just before leaving the beach after your hair has been beaten by the salt, sand and wind.

review/summary: Extra conditioning
review/text: This conditioner has a light scent that is not bad, but not my favorite. This conditioner seems to have extra conditioning power. It must be the shea oil. My hair came out really smooth and clean, but it felt super conditioned. I don't know if this is a product that I would use all the time, because it almost conditioned too much, for my hair. I'm also not crazy about the scent, I thought the moisturizing oil smelled much better and I was disappointed this wasn't the same. If I was in the market for a super conditioning extra moisturizer product this one would be a good choice.

review/summary: Great on hair, less so on scalp
review/text: I got this conditioner to go with the hair oil of the same line. I don't have the shampoo, so I used it with my normal Pantene Pro V. Right away I could feel the difference in the conditioner itself; it was thick and dense, but not oily or heavy on my hair. It moisturized without stripping, a major problem for me.<br /><br />It says for scalp, but I didn't see any dramatic results on my scalp. You aren't supposed to apply conditioner directly to the scalp(it can cause dandruff and other similar problems), so maybe that's why.<br /><br />But my hair has remained silky smooth for a few days now, and stayed very un-tangly! A BIG bonus. I don't brush my hair that often as it makes it frizzy as all heck, but leads to huge dread like tangles after a day or two. This conditioner has kept my hair feeling clean and smooth without any other changes in my routine.

review/summary: very conditioning & with cones
review/text: This conditioner comes in a nice, ergonomic bottle that has the cap on the bottom - a feature I love, since the product is always easy to squeeze out even near the end of the bottle and you don't get "ketchup syndrome" where you are trying and trying to get it out and then too much comes out in a big blop. It would fit in my shower caddie better if it was a little shorter and squatter, but oh well.<br /><br />The smell is like something from a salon and it is very STRONG. When the bottle first arrived and I unpacked it, it was sitting near me and I had to move it because the smell was driving me nuts. Not bad smell, just strong smell. And that was before even opening it!<br /><br />I used this right after doing a color-oops treatment on my hair, trying to remove some of the henna I've applied over the years. The treatment itself isn't really damaging, but you have your hair under running water for a long time and shampoo it several times and it is extremely drying because of that. I massaged it on my scalp, although I usually am trying to NOT get conditioner on my scalp, since the directions say to do that. I can't say my scalp felt really moist afterwards or anything, but it did a good job of restoring moisture and softness to my hair. This conditioner is a little oily for me to use after every shampoo, but it was perfect after color-oops and I think would be great after hennaing my hair as well.<br /><br />Although this conditioner is called "Ultra Shea", there are a lot of other oils in there providing moisture, including soy and palm.<br /><br />There are some rather mysterious ingredients in this conditioner so I looked some of them up. Basically, I was wondering if it had 'cones in it (like silicone...usually anything that ends in "cone") and it didn't list anything ending in cone in the ingredients but I wanted to be sure. It turns out the third ingredient, cyclopentasiloxane, is a silicone. Not only does it have 'cones, it's a top ingredient! Now, some people swear by 'cones and some people swear by staying away from cones, but I just think it's good to know they're in there before you try a product as it gives you a better idea of what to expect. My experience is that 'cones work okay on my hair BUT it can cause a buildup after a while that can leave hair sort of flat and greasy. (Nothing a little clarifying can't fix...apple cider vinegar rinse or whatever.) It's also not the best thing to be using right before you do something to your hair like, say, applying color-oops or doing some kind of fancy treatment, since the 'cones tend to coat your hair and might get in the way.<br />i<br />For what it's worth, cyclopentasiloxane is one of the fancier 'cones that is likely better at what it does than some of the others. It also evaporates, so if you feel like the conditioner is still there gunking up your hair after you rinse it, it's probably the cyclopentasiloxane, and once you dry and style it all that gunk is not going to be there any more. No point in over-rinsing. My favorite conditioner has got to be Aussie 3 Minute Miracle, and this seems like it would be an okay substitute.

review/summary: Yes, indeedy, this stuff has been here awhile
review/text: Well, I was hoping that the poultry seasoning I got would be of a newer vintage, but the code shows mine was packed in August, 2001. However, it still smells pretty potent. I'm going to actually cook with it before I send it back. Price wise, Walmart wanted $3.78  for .065 ounces...so this is a steal. I'm going to rate it middling till I actually use it. Then I'll rerate it based on flavor, not just dates.<br />On the cooking side of things, poultry seasoning is my secret ingredient in nearly all of my soups. Potato soup, cream of broccoli, chicken...all benefit greatly from 1/2- 1 tsp of poultry seasoning.

I do especially like it for melting purposes and not cold because it brings out the flavor in the cheese and whatever you are melting it onto.  I am very happy with it -- sad I could not find it in the large cheese department at Fairway or Whole Foods so I guess I'll have to keep ordering it this way, which IS rather expensive.

review/summary: Great portable cocktails!
review/text: I used to buy daiquiris and margaritas already mixed in individual freezer bags and enjoyed the convenience very much. For some reason, I cannot find these anymore.  BTW: There are some made by Daily's, but they are made with wine, not liquour (but taste really good anyway!)<br /><br />Still, I was looking for my favorite cocktails in a portable bag. These were very good! They are very fruity (with real strawberry seeds) and creamy..not like kool aid. Also, they freeze really well, no big, sharp shards of ice, but with a squeeze or two, they were more like a slushy.<br /><br />To make: You open the twist cap, fill first with rum (to a premarked line), shake to mix, then fill the rest of the way with water and freeze.<br /><br />I made the first batch just this way, by pouring the liquor right in the bag up to the "fill line" on the packaging. I don't know if I had the bag set on the counter incorrectly or what, but the powder seemed to absorb the liquid and I ended up pouring too much rum in the bag and hadn't even reached the line! It didn't even freeze too well as it was too strong (we did drink them anyway!) With the second bag, I measured the rum in a measuring cup (1 1/2 cups...it is written on the bag, too.) They were better. You can vary the amount of liqour to your taste (or even use different kinds of alcohol...or I suppose none at all if you want.)<br /><br />One more fun tip: I mixed the entire bag, then poured individual servings into small ziploc freezer bags. I think I used about 5 or 6 little ziplocs per 1 Lt. Blender Bag (which makes 1/2 gallon.) Then I froze all the little bags. That way we could take only 1 when we wanted it, OR we could throw a few in our beach bags and they stayed slushy for hours. Plus, we didn't have to carry much garbage when we were done (like with cans or bottles.) Also, we didn't have to worry about doling out servings into cups or anything. Just slip a straw into a little opening in the zipper and enjoy!

review/text: Friends gave us a jar of this as part of a "Taste of the Northwest" gift basket while we were visiting Seattle last year.  We eventually tried it, and fell in love with the taste, texture and ease of preparation.  You coat the salmon in a bit of the rub, and saute it in a little olive oil.  The resulting crust adds a mildly spicy, sweet flavor and a very slight crust to the salmon that my wife and I like better than any other way we've tried salmon.  Highly recommended, and we'll be ordering more as we're almost out.

review/summary: Simply the best fish spice rub out there...
review/text: I'm an avid cook and experimenter with commercial and homemade spice mixes.  I came across this spice rub in a gourmet food shop in Los Gatos, CA.  Hands down, the most flavorful and versatile spice 'rub' out there.<br /><br />Generously coating your fish with this mix adds a light crust and a slightly zingy, sweet flavor.  Additionally, the large amount of smoked paprika in the mix gives the food a wonderful red color.<br /><br />If you have guests that like a little more heat in their food without overpowering your fish, add a couple pinches of fine - not coarse! - ground pepper to the mix.  Your taste buds will thank you!<br /><br />Interestingly enough, this mix also works well on catfish, chilean sea bass, and orange roughy.  Of the Rub with Love mixes, this and their companion mix: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a> are by far the best.

Costco did not have any fresh wild Salmon but their farmed Steel Head is much better than the farmed Salmon.  Costco no longer sells this rub.  I glad to know Amazon carries this product.  For salmon, this rub is better than my homemade rub.  My rub is too strong for fish.  I will save my rub for tri-tip, baby back ribs, and chicken.  Never use lighter fluid or the charcoal with the fluid in it unless you like to ruin your food!  The Chimney starters are cheap and need about two sheets of newspaper.

review/text: I bought this from a local grocery store a few years ago because they were out of my usual seafood rub. After trying this, I will never use anything else to season salmon fillets! The best way to prepare this seasoning is to add about half a tablespoon of olive oil to a large piece of fresh salmon, rub about a tablespoon of this seasoning all over one side, then grill skin-side down until cooked to your desired level. It's the perfect level of sweet and smoky!

review/summary: Keep the Heat Low!
review/text: "Rub with Love Salmon Rub" is great on salmon if you keep the temperature fairly low. I wouldn't go over medium heat with this rub because it will burn. This rub has brown sugar in it which must help to create a delicious crust on the salmon but it doesn't like high heat. I've had this spice for what seems like years. Recently while trying out the steak rub I remembered I had this spice rub somewhere in the kitchen cupboard. There it was a little lumpy but still very edible. I just mashed up everything with a spoon and the spice rub was good to go. So it is not only great tasting, it lasts a long time. I will say that now that I'm back to eating a lot of salmon on a diet that requires you to eat 5-7 ounces of protein a night I probably will be using this salmon rub quite a bit more often. Give it a try, but you may also want to add a little Fleur de Sel or sea salt.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Everyone wants a sample of this rub!
review/text: We purchased a single tub of this rub, then a three pack, and then a 16-oz. mega container.  We make grilled salmon frequently for guests, and everyone loves the sweet/spicy/smokey flavoring of the Salmon Rub.  We end up giving them a little ziplock bag of the rub to take home.  It's so simple....brush the salmon with olive oil and then sprinkle generously with the rub (both sides).  Grill about 3 minutes, flip, and grill another 3-4 minutes.  Delicious!

review/text: I first purchased this at my local Whole Foods.  After I finished that first jar, I never found it again. Boy, am I glad I found it here on Amazon. It is so easy to use and delicious.  It has very few ingredients but something about it is difficult to replicate.  Maybe it's the smoked paprika?  Regardless, the mix of brown sugar and herbs is a fantastic blend of sweet and savory.  It complements salmon perfectly.  I've only baked/broiled it in the oven, but I can't wait to throw some salmon on the grill with this rub.

They were nice and fresh and tasty and didn't last nearly long enough. Next time it will be a bigger size package.<br /><br />Halves and pieces. Hmmmm. Where and how do they get all the broken cashews? I couldn't find a single non-broken one. Oh well, I guess that's truth in labeling. But, how do they all get broken? Is there someone in charge of breaking them as they come down the production line? If they're accidentally broken and won't sell for as much as the non-broken ones, why isn't the price cheaper? Oh well, does it really matter? Once they're in my mouth, all will get broken.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Taste fine. Easy to digest during workouts. My big complaint is that they are thin and crumbly. How do you carry these with you during your workouts? If I put it in my pocket, it crumbles into pieces and is real hard to eat. I much prefer Honey Stinger energy bars because they don't fall apart before I can eat them.<br /><br />Also the price is kind of expensive. 250 calorie Clif bars cost about a dollar each at my local supermarket. These waffles only have 160 calories for a dollar, so you wind up paying a lot more for the same amount of energy intake (assuming you're trying to eat the same number of calories per hour during your workouts).

review/summary: Tasty... one more please
review/text: Honey Stinger is a pleasant addition to an endless energy bar section at your local bike store. You know about those energy bars, sure it gives you energy / carbs / protein but they are a pain to eat (way too hard / chewy, nasty tasty, etc). Honey Stinger really hit the spot as a healthy tasty alternative. (I sound like a commercial but I do not work for them... wish I did, then I can just eat them by the case).<br /><br />Of note, I'm a cyclist, so my review will be with a cyclist slant.<br /><br />Wrapping: It's pretty easy to open with the little jagged edge at the top and bottom. When I go ride, I usually partially open the pack to make my life easier.<br /><br />Taste: Man, this thing tastes great. I would eat it for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner. I believe they have different flavors, I usually stick with Honey as the standard.<br /><br />Ease of eating (important for me as a cyclist): The waffles are soft, perhaps a little bit too soft. I think if you hold it at one end, the other end will probably start to sag. But I usually don't hold it long enough before the whole thing makes it to my mouth. This is soft, so you can swallow it in a couple of bites / chews. So much better than some of the energy bars that takes forever to chew and swallow.<br /><br />Cons: The only gripe that I have is that it is crumbly.. little tiny bits will fall off the edges or linger at the edge of your mouth. The other thing is that it is soft, so don't place too much pressure on it or you'll find your waffle shaped like a fortune cookie.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is the best fuel on bike. I usually bring this and some Sport Beans on my ride.

review/text: I bought these Stingers to eat as breakfast with a protein shake before workout, and now im hooked! It has a somewhat soft texture to it..You'd think a waffle would have crunch, but maybe the honey soaks up into the waffle and it softens. I'ts sweet, but not too sweet. Honestly, I have to stop myself from eating more then 1 a day. I'm lucky to have some self control because i'd probably eat 2 or 3 a day. If i had to complain about anything is the packages don't open very easily, it causes the waffle to crumble in the package sometimes. But im just being picky here, this product is perfect.

review/text: These are thin so that several can be put in a pack without taking up too much room.  The packages are about 5x4 inches and 3 or 4 packages stacked is about an inch.<br /><br />They taste good (especially when compared with some of the other endurance foods) and go down fairly easy even after 30 miles.<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, they have never given me any GI issues during a run.  Of course this can vary from person to person, but they're worth a try.<br /><br />The only reason I deducted a star is because they're a bit overpriced for what they are.

review/text: I'm sold on the product. I use it as a part of my long distance bicycle riding nutrition for a pre ride energy bump. But really, I eat it because they are so tasty. It's a good thing they are individually packaged as there is a huge temptation to eat several at once. I buy two boxes at a time because the other riders in my house have discovered my pre-ride indulgence and I don't want to run out. (Though I suspect they pilfer a few in between rides as well!) I'll admit they are little hard to eat while pedaling (pieces tend to break off) so I've adapted to using it pre-ride or at a break stop. I give it 4 stars, not 5, only because this last batch was not quite as fresh as I've had in the past. Oh what the heck. 5 stars! I'd write more but I hear a honey waffle calling my name.

All in all, I think they're a good source of energy for periodic re-fueling.

review/text: These are delicious and don't give me any stomach problems.  I used them a few times when training for triathlon, but mostly use them for long canoe races (outrigger canoe in open ocean) when going hard for 3-6 hours.  They have plenty of calories for how easy they are to digest.  I used to use Kit Kats and Twix, but the chocolate coating on those can make them difficult to eat when it melts, and sometimes if I ate those super fast my stomach wouldn't like it.  No stomach problems with these.  The one imperfection is that they're a bit greasy, so if you touch them they make your hands greasy and slippery.  Not good when you're paddling.  Trying to hold it by the wrapper without touching the waffle with your fingers while you're going can be slightly cumbersome, but well worth it.

I don't depend on these for nutrition, but I like to have them there in case I bonk or just need an extra boost.<br /><br />They've also been a life-saver to tide me over post-ride or run when I'm ravenously hungry but haven't had a chance to get my pwo noms.  Who am I kidding; I've also used these post-swim after 5k swim race when I'm about to gnaw my arm off but haven't had the chance to get real food!<br /><br />I've also used these as pre-run fuel when I want some energy but don't want to eat anything big before a long run.  They're just a fun & convenient source of energy when you need something quick and easily digested.  Just enough taste/calories/nutrition, easy to digest, quick energy, convenient packaging, and easy storage.  A great food to keep around your workout gear "just in case".

review/text: If you're looking for a product while on the bike for fueling and have had stomach issues digesting those nasty gels, this is the product to get.  It works quite well, has no crash, and no stomach upset issues that the gels cause some people.  I love the product, the packaging is a little tricky to open while riding but you'll get the hang of it, and add these as a supplement for long distance rides.  I use these, peanut butter cracker sandwiches, and thin tortillas with PB&J inside.

review/summary: Great Food For Long Workouts
review/text: If you have not tried these they are great.  I could eat them just for a snack.  I typically take them on long bike rides as they are much more palatable than most of the gel products and sometimes it is nice to eat something solid when training.  You can't beat the price on Amazon.  I have paid more that $1 per at specialty stores for these.<br /><br />I would not recommend these for race situations as they are simply too hard to open in my opinion.  When I try to open them while riding I either have to slow way down or stop, or else I end up with a bunch of crumples and end up dropping half the cookie.

This suprised me considering the expire date was march 2013. They taste okay, but fall apart. And if i'm<br /><br />not careful while riding, I lose half the waffle while trying to get some out of the package. Love the product, but concerned about shelf<br /><br />life.

review/summary: Love at first bite!!!
review/text: In energy snack I've tried every form and brand.  I think I finally found one that I'd stay with, until someone comes up with a better/tastier/easier product.<br /><br />This is s small palm sized waffle, not hallow but semi soaked (moist).  It will crumble therefore don't take it out of th package (the package can catch the falling crumbs)<br /><br />To open is easy, just tear the folded area with your teeth or fingers (the tab in the back where the nutrition info is).  It will open the pack right in the middle exposing half of the waffle.  Just hold the half that's still in the package and start eating.  This is the fastest and safest way to consume this product while on the go (I did just that while hiking, holding my poles in one hand and eating this from the other hand).<br /><br />Haven't tried the chocolate flavor yet but I love all three (strawberry, vanilla, and honey) that I've tried.  Bought Vanilla and Honey from Amazon in bulk.  I know I will finish them based on my scheduled hikes coming up in the remaining 2012.<br /><br />At 160 calories, it is a good hourly snack.  But the reason I bought it is because it tastes GOOD and no need to work hard to eat it.

review/summary: Love these waffles!
review/text: I have to say that the Stinger Waffles are the best energy snack to come on the market in years.  I love these things.  I cycle, and the fact that these are flat make them really easy to carry in a jersey pocket.  They don't have huge amounts of calories, but they definitely help me keep going during a long workout.  And they taste so good, that I keep them around as regular snacks, even when I am not exercising.<br /><br />The only downside to these (and the reasons they get 4 stars): the packages aren't the easiest to open.  I usually only open them when stopped if it is during a ride.  If I could give half-stars, these would be 4.5!

review/text: I came on Amazon looking for energy gels and blocks, but ended up looking at this product because it ended up on my "What Other People Are Buying".  I had read about the nutrition and race fuel benefits of waffles but thought that making actual waffles every morning was a bit too time-consuming (I'm really lazy).  Anyway, bought these due to glowing reviews and they are indeed delicious.  Now I eat 1 every morning with Greek yogurt.  I'm not sure they'll give me the carbo boost I need during an actual workout, but they are definitely an excellent breakfast for training and race days.

I've had the strawberry, vanilla, and honey waffles, and although they were all good, I never get tired of the honey flavor. When I am craving something sweet for dessert, this also goes great with coffee or tea.<br />For longer runs, I like something with a little protein and caffiene in it....Accel gel is effective for me (and it tastes pretty good).

review/summary: Nice flavor, but...
review/text: This tea has a lovely flavor--just what I'd like for an English breakfast tea--but to describe it as "leaf" tea is a complete misnomer. The tea "leaves" are crushed fragments, very nearly as small and dusty as the tea in many grocery-store bagged varieties. I purchased this loose leaf tea to use with standard tea strainers, and unless I use my finest kitchen strainer (that I normally use for powdered sugar dustings on baked goods), I have a cup full of leaf fragments. I don't mind a healthy smattering of tea leaves in the bottom of my cup, but my results with this particular tea were rather more like a stew of leaves. I have no interest in using disposable steeping bags, and I'd rather not have to purchase more apparatus simply to enjoy my tea. Some indication in the product description that this is not full leaf tea would be nice, particularly at its price.

review/summary: Great Breakfast Tea
review/text: This tea is great for breakfast especially if you don't want a really strong cup of tea.  What I like about it most is that there is no bitter taste at the end as I have occasionally experienced with other caffinated teas.  Also great price thru subscribe and save.

review/summary: An excellent product.
review/text: I was not familiar with Taylors' products. Now that I have sampled some of their different varieties I find them to be a reliable supplier.<br />Everybody has a different appreciation of teas and may like some blends better than others, so I won't go there.<br />In general I have found Taylors' different varieties to be perfumed and flavorful the way they should. So far I have not been disappointed.<br />Preheat the (silver) pot, use boiling water and never forget the extra spoonful "for the pot!"<br />In conclusion, Taylors offers a good product at a reasonable price.

review/summary: not my cup of tea
review/text: The strength of this tea is OK, but it's not quite the English Breakfast taste I'm looking for. That may be because, unlike other English Breakfast blends I'm used to, this one is make entirely from teas from East Africa---no Assam tea is included. Furthermore, as others have mentioned, the tea is a fine-grained powder, definitely not full leaves.

review/summary: The Quintessential Breakfast Tea.
review/text: Calling this blend "English" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea." It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word "English," which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday "work horse," and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee.

review/summary: Makes AMAZING cobbler!!
review/text: This muffin mix makes the yummiest cobbler.  I've made cobbler with peaches and raspberries; with cherries; with apples; with blueberries...  Just spoon the mixture onto the cooked fruit.  i like to sprinkle it with cinnamon and a little stevia or succanat.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes.  Namaste has a terrific cookbook.  Also tells how to make dumplings with the muffin mix.  THANK YOU, NAMASTE!!!  The yummiest products for those of us who are gluten-intolerant and have other allergies.
