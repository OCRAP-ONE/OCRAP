review/summary: My cat can't get enough of these!!!!!!!!
review/text: I was purchasing my cat other treats until I came upon this one. Ever since he tried he couldn't stop. He doesn't want any other kind of treats but the Creamy Dairy flavor ones. Acutally, when he was inside his mother, she ate them while she was pregnant, don't know if it had anything to do with it but cats love these! They should start making gigantic bags of these. I pretty much have to buy them by the dozen for my spoiled rotten cat.

review/text: My cat absolutely loves all of the temptation flavors but I feel like he is getting oral care when I add these to the mix.  I get my amazon products on time and in fine condition.  Subscribe & Save is a great program, although you gotta look for the deals to make it work for you.  Not all product prices are comparatively better.  Do your research.

review/summary: Good product.
review/text: I've been giving these to my 2 cats everyday after I give them wet food so that their teeth can be somewhat cleaned afterwards. They love the flavor, though after such a long time they're growing weary of the taste. It's well known that cats who eat too much wet food without eating anything crunchy after are prone to tooth decay. This is just one product that can help cut down on long-term dental health issues with your feline.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is that it only comes in 1 flavor; my cats want variety. Do yours?

review/text: Ok so my cat loves the flavor will eat them like they are going out of style. HOWEVER these treats are very small and when you have a 17lb large cat he doesn't have to chew them... he just swallows them whole. Therefore they aren't working on the teeth. Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else.

review/summary: Kitty cat crack
review/text: I got this to give to our cat as an occasional treat. Like many of the reviewers here my cat now acts like an addict. I don't know what they put in this stuff, but she wants it all day and all night. It's gotten so she has started pestering me non stop. I'm glad I found a treat she likes, but it's a nightmare if we run out. I just came on here to order another box. I'm not sure if I want to keep dealing with this. I might have to consider kitty cat rehab.

review/text: my cat is a very picky eater, she will not touch human food and it was very hard to find her a cat food that she actually liked and would eat. As for treats same thing, she would not eat every kind. I bought a pack of temptations to try her and she goes crazy for them, i once left a package of them on my coffee table and went out and when i got back the cat had knocked them off the table and ripped the bag open and ate them all. (i think that these are equivalent to smoking to humans) its very addictive to cats.. 5 stars.. *****

review/text: I've been giving my cat medication for a little over a year now and I just hate prying open his mouth and dropping the pill in.  If I get one of these treats ready beforehand it triggers his attention to the treat instead of the pill.  I give him his medication and then immediately give him the treat.  (not in the same fashion, however)  He used to run and hide every time I opened his pill case now at least he sticks around.  It makes it easier for me too.

review/text: Each of my three cats loves this flavor of the Temptations Treats. Anytime I go into the kitchen, one or more of my cats follows me in, sits on a perch (each has his own spot so the other will not nibble from the plate of another) and waits for his/her Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treat. This makes it a lot easier to deal with a hairball problem.

review/text: I am sorry but the below reviewer is absolutely talking non-scence. I have 7 cats and 8 bags of these in my cabinets but I have gone days on end without giving these to ANY of my cats and they are absolutely fine. Also I run a shelter with a LOT of cats and have not had them acted like she sais.<br /><br />These cat treats have the ingredients on the label and just like any cat treat cats love them... My cats also love Party Mix, does that mean they are drugged product.<br /><br />That being said please do not listen to non-scence on these ratings.<br /><br />My cats do love these temptations... They do not beg for them,,,, but they do like them!<br /><br />I feed them each 10 treats at home at a time, the suggested ammount and of course they could go for more (because it is a snack)...<br /><br />I love that these taste good to the cats but they are also very healthy!!!!<br /><br />I have 7 cats. One of my cats will only eat 4-5 treats and she gets FULL easy and the rest can eat ALL that I put down........ My neighbor sais that her cats do not like them because they are spoiled on "people food"... I was shocked when she returned the bag I sent them for Christmas!<br /><br />I tried to get them to eat them also and they walked away, tried to also put one in there mouth...<br /><br />I also have 35 cats in our shelter and they ALL love these treats, they will eat as many as you give them.... We cannot afford to buy these for them all the time but we get it for them every few months.. We keep them all the time for our own cats!<br /><br />They are a great product, I like to buy the large bags because you are saving money!

They will eat these becuase they are gluttons but it is obvious they are not that keen to the taste or the way it makes them feel.<br /><br />I noticed no difference with hairballs using these treats.  If you need something for the hairballs get the brown barley or malt paste.  That stuff works real good and some cats actually like the taste.

He doesn't forget about them. It doesn't matter if I hide them. He knows. He watches me. He watches everyone who he thinks might give him his treats. I'm down to the last bag. I need...I need a Catnip Temptations dealer. Or I need to send him to Catnip Temptations Rehab.

review/summary: My cat loves it.. I don't know if I do.
review/text: Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.

We used to have hairball messes to deal with many times a week, and now it's down to just a few a month. I've now put these on our Subscribe & Save list to make sure we never run out. I love that I am giving them something they love that also happens to be so good for their insides. And as a huge bonus, we have a lot fewer messes to clean up/step in. We all win!

I have tried other flavors of the Temptations with her and her internal system rejects them.<br />So thank you and a meow from her.<br /><br />Susan

review/summary: Great Cat Treat
review/text: I ordered these Whiskas Dentabites for an 8-month old kitten we adopted.  The cat was in good health, but his breath was a little stinky.  One bag of these treats plus a carefully balanced diet was it took to clear up that breath.  I ordered the 12-pack and plan to re-order when we run low.

review/text: The cats love these treats and I'll admit it, I use them sometimes when I'm cat herding which can be frustrating let me tell you. The dairy flavored treats truly are tempting and distract the cats long enough to give me a window of opportunity for tactical maneuvering. I'm their favorite person in all the world with these!

review/summary: My Cat Loves These Treats
review/text: My cat loves these treats.  Her name is Precious and this is one of her favorite treats.  I did not buy mine from Amazon but got them from Walmart instead.  She has tried some of the other flavors of Whiskas Temptations as well and loves those as well.  She always gobbles these down real quick.  I am thinking about trying her on the tuna flavor next since she loves tuna so much.

review/summary: Kitty Crack
review/text: All three of my cats are crazy about these.  They like the salmon and tuna flavors best. They all beg for them in one way or another.  One cat will sit and stare at me and if that doesn't work, he'll curl up on my shoulder and purr as loud as he can. Another one of my cats just bops me with his paw to let me know he wants treats.  The more I ignore him, the harder he hits me.  I eventually have to tell him no, because I don't want to overdo it with the treats. Anyway, they all love them and I've noticed silkier coats since adding these to their diet.

review/text: Crunchy addiction<br /><br />I treat my cats to 8 different Temptations flavors, and they love them all.  I'm sure that giving them different flavors means more to me, than it does to my cats; they don't seem to chew them long enough to taste them.  But they insist on two or three each time they come in the house, I'm sure it's a form of addiction.  I'm buying these on the "Subscribe & Save" program, which save money and time compared to buying them locally.<br /><br />Cats love these things!

review/text: We have two cats (neutered males) and we feed them twice a day. Both have maintained proper weight, so they're getting what they need. Well, you'd never know it! They seem to always be hungry, day or night. What goes? I don't want to feed them again and get them to looking like Garfield. So, I got these Whiskas Temptations cat treats and I give them a few every now and them. Boy, do they go fast. The treats barely hit the dish and they're gone! Well, I notice they're only 2 calories per treat so they can't be doing much harm.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Prior to finding them on Amazon I would get them at local stores but it is so much cheaper to buy them through Amazon.<br />I always give my cat 4 or 5 treats every night before bed and sometimes during the day, so I can go through a bag of these pretty quick. For around $20 for 12-3oz packs is such a good deal, and the treats keep very well if you don't open them.

review/summary: Whiskas Temptations Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treats for Cat
review/text: With four cats in the household hairballs are a given. It got to be an almost daily routine to hear and see one or more of them gagging and coughing, trying to get rid of a build up of hair in their system. Why their digestive tracts haven't evolved to handle this problem over thousands of years mystifies me. Not only do they groom themselves, they also groom each other.<br /><br />We've tried several different products to try to alleviate this problem and nothing helped. Then we came across the Temptations treats. They have helped considerably. The cats seem to relish them, not knowing they're being given "medicine". Whilst the treats haven't completely ended the hairball issue they have been a great help. Now, it can be weeks if not months without any hairballs.<br /><br />If your cats have a problem with hairballs then give this product a try.<br /><br />Also, with Amazon's Subscribe and Save you'll save money.

review/text: We have two cats and one has very long hair and of course after cleaning themselves they get hairballs. We tried several hairball control treats and these are the one our cats seem to prefer. I purchase one case every six months,giving the long hair cat 10 each day and the short hair cat 5 each day, and they do help to control the frequency of the barfing. They always arrive quickly and we will continue to purchase them from amazon. The long hair cat likes them sooo much he greets me each morning and bugs me until he get his whiskas.

review/summary: Defective!
review/text: I ordered this item, a 10 pound BAG of sour cherry Jelly Belly jelly beans but what I received was a previously opened BOX of jelly beans which were crystallized and melted together and looked nothing like the image above. In addition, the jelly beans were simply dumped into the cardboard box with no wrapper whatsoever. This box had a seal on it which had been cut through and then retaped. The external shipping packaging was undisturbed. When I have ordered Jelly Belly jelly beans from other vendors, they have come in plastic bags, shipped in a cardboard box.<br /><br />Since I really wanted what I had ordered, I was disappointed to see that upon return of the defective merchandise, I was only eligible for a refund, not a replacement as Amazon was out of stock on my item. I sent the item back and was surprised to see that today, when my return processed, there is now 1 ten pound bag of sour cherry Jelly belly jelly beans in stock. I wonder if the in stock item is the very same defective item which I just returned.

Try Superior Nut thru Amazon instead; they packed them right and it arrived perfect!

review/summary: Really salty
review/text: I should have checked the nutrition information from these.  Each one has 300mg of sodium and you can taste every mg of it.  They taste something like an unleavened saltine cracker, but they're saltier (which is saying something).  They do pop up nicely in the microwave without the need for any frying, and if they got rid of most of the salt (or if you like lots and lots of salt) I think they would be very good.

Then, after reading a bit here, I put them on a paper plate, brushed one side with oil, sprinkled on some cinamon sugar and then microwaved them for about 35-45 seconds on high.  (Watch them to prevent burning!).  A bit salty, but YUMM!  (To ease saltiness a bit, I wonder if one quickly dipped them into water for a fast "wash" before MW?  Pat dry with paper towel, brush with oil and sprinkle with Cinn/sugar???) Gotta' try that.  BTW, I got these at my local coop for $3.29 per pkg.

I love popcorn very much, and wanted to try some new types.<br /><br />Last year, my wife got me a gourmet popper, and I have been experimenting with different kinds.  I got a couple of specialty popcorn from Williams-Sonoma.  They were great, but on the expensive side.<br /><br />Now, this popped up a bit on the small side.  If you are expecting big pops like from Orville Reddenbacher, you will be disappointed.  What will thrill you, though, is the flavor.  This tastes so very good, with just the hint of oil and salt, I have gone thru buckets of this stuff!!!<br /><br />Next, to try it with cheese.  Hmmmmm.....

There was no expiration date on the bag and it was closed with only a twist tie, so Lordy know how long it was sitting around.<br />Amazon refunded my money and I threw the rest of it out.  Although it's more expensive, I'm sticking with Orville!

review/summary: Impotent Popcorn
review/text: As an alternate to the high fat microwave popcorn and noisy hot air poppers. I wanted to pop my own popcorn - the old fashioned way over the stove in a pot. This was a dissapointment. Nearly half the kernels never pop and the kernels that do pop are very small. I'll try buying other kernels but I would not buy this again.

review/summary: Very Good Cough Drops
review/text: These cough drops are very good. The taste is so good, that people have even asked me for one when they did not have a cough, just because they like the taste of them. These also do a good job of soothing your throat and momentarily reducing your cough.<br /><br />These sticks are convenient for taking with you on the go.  I usually buy these in the bag, but the sticks are handy for tossing in a backpack, purse, or pocket.  Overall, I definitely recommend this item for coughs or sore throats. There is also a cherry flavor, which is very good. I recommend them both so that you can mix up the flavors while using these: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YLYG64">Halls Mentho-Lyptus Cough Suppressant - 200 Cherry Drops</a>

review/summary: A Favorite Rediscovered
review/text: For many years we depended on this bean soup mix on wilderness backpacking trips, and then our local stores stopped carrying it. I'm very happy to discover that I can buy it from Amazon, and it's still exactly the same product that we knew and loved.<br /><br />It's a versatile mix that combines well with other dried foods such as rice, sun dried tomatoes, or bacon bits. By varying the amount of water, you can make a nourishing hot soup for a cold, wet day, or a dip to enjoy with tortilla chips from the last town at the edge of the big woods.<br /><br />I used to cook it with McCormick dried soup vegetables that we bought in the spice aisle at the grocery store, but that product has disappeared as well. So for my test run tonight, I substituted Harmony House Foods Dried Vegetable Soup Mix. Even better than I remembered!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039QXWPM">Harmony House Foods Dried Vegetable Soup Mix (10 oz, Quart Size Jar) for Cooking, Camping, Emergency Supply, and More</a><br /><br />Black Beans with Veggies<br /><br />Place 1/2 cup of Harmony House Foods Dried Vegetable Soup Mix in 1-1/2 quart pan. Add 3 cups of water and bring to a boil. Turn heat down to low and cook 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 package of Fantastic World Foods Instant Black Beans. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand 5 minutes. Spoon onto tortillas or crackers and top with cheese. Serves 2.

review/summary: Good but not GREAT
review/text: When I received this, I was expecting it to taste like those awesome cold Mocha Starbucks drinks you can find in stores these days.  Do you know those things?  Starbucks sells like Mocha and Vanilla cold drink things - I have no idea what they are, precisely, but I know they are AWESOME.  So I figured this thing - this Cappuccino can thing - would be like that.  And to some degree, it is, only to a lesser degree.<br />-<br />First off, the can says Cappuccino, but it tastes like no cappuccino I ever had!  One of the ingredients is cocoa powder, and I'm pretty sure that's not an ingredient in cappuccino!  First ingredient is cream or milk - I forget - so just FYI this is a creamy-coffee drink - it's not like black coffee or anything.  It is very much like the Starbucks drinks I love, only it tastes more watery.  The starbucks drinks have that super-creamy and sweet and strong coffee flavor that punches you in the mouth!  This drink is more like being hit in the cheek with a slice of lemon.  No, it doesn't taste like lemon.  I'm trying to make this entertaining.  Is it working?  Anyhow - this drink is OK, but it's not GREAT.  I liked it well enough, but if I'm going to buy some pseudo-coffee drink in a can, I'll reach for the Starbucks bottle instead.<br />-<br />Also - I got a slight headache after drinking this.  Not from the cold.  Probably from the massive amount of caffiene!  But I survived.

review/summary: Strong espresso taste - a little bitter for me
review/text: Strong espresso taste, but a tad bitter for me. If you like a little bitterness, then you'll prolly love this. Thankfully no can taste, which was a concern of mine.<br /><br />Otherwise not much to say - plain, no flavors, although I'm sure you could add your own if you want i, but taste fine just like it is.<br /><br />The bitterness was just a hint, which many regular espresso drinkers probably wouldn't notice - for me, it was enough to take off a star, but was still good. Don't know that I'll be buying a lot of it, but for that allergy or headache, when I use that caffeine, it would be great to have around to get rid of those.

review/summary: delicious, perfect size, not too sweet
review/text: This was a great kick in the pants!  Not too large, so none of that icky-stomach feeling.  Yet it perked me up mid afternoon and tasted great.  I also liked that it is lightly sweetened, but not super sweet like those Starbucks drinks that feel like pure sugar.<br /><br />I do think this is better ice cold in the can instead of over ice: with ice it loses it gets diluted quick. But the shape of the can makes it quick to chill and keep on the go.<br /><br />Much better than the illy espresso shot, which doesn't taste as full-bodied as this.  Before, I was hesitant about stocking up on these, as they are pricey, but if it keeps me from running into a 7-eleven or AM/PM to buy one, it saves me the element of risk of running into all that junk food! So, keeping this at home cold is a treat that doesn't involve having to look at a rack of Snickers and being tempted to buy one of those too!  It will be cheaper in the long run!

review/text: In comparison to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;</a> I prefer the caramel taste of this Cappuccino version. It's a little creamier and sweeter, but still contains traces of a good solid black coffee. I don't drink a lot of coffee mostly because I find it so difficult to find the blend of blackness and cream and sugar. Temperature is also a difficult think to master (it always seems too hot or too cold!) However, this coffee blend is a masterful mix of my favorite sweetness, creaminess, and blackness. It's rich, but not too rich. It's sweet, but not too sweet. And no bitter aftertaste! I refrigerated it and thought it tasted great cold.<br /><br />With that being said, I would never spend $2 on a little tiny 8.45oz can of it. But if coffee is important to you, this is a great-tasting product. And a nice--albeit unhealthy--way to boost your energy!

review/summary: It's good, but my palate still prefers Starbucks' Frappuccino.
review/text: I opened my can of this illy issimo Cappuccino iced coffee to enjoy with my breakfast this morning, but, even though it WAS good, and had a pleasant-yet-not-overly-strong coffee flavor, I found it to have a bit of a thin mouth feel for me, to the point where I felt compelled to gussy it up with an extra splash of half and half, and a pump of the bottle of Starbucks Cinnamon Dolce syrup that I keep stocked in my kitchen.<br /><br />All that I've ever had from the grocery store (that I can recall) in the way of prefab iced coffee drinks has been from Starbucks' Frappuccino line, which I've always found satisfying, sweet, flavorful, and thick enough tasting that it hit the spot perfectly. This illy iced coffee just left a little to be desired for me, which is where it loses its two stars.<br /><br />If you're a true coffee connoisseur, you might find that you prefer this brand over Starbucks. What I've read and heard indicates that this is Italy's preferred brand of coffee. As a frugal Foodie, even though I like Starbucks, I'm typically loathe to dish out happily for the prices they charge for their products. Even still, in this case, Starbucks wins, at least as far as my palate is concerned.

review/summary: Great additive
review/text: First off I'm not a coffee drinker, but like a little jolt in my hot chocolate to give it some extra flavor and of course to add caffeine. Generally in the morning I drink a cup of hot chocolate or chai tea latte. When I go the hot chocolate route I like to put about a third of a teaspoon of instant coffee in the mix. As I said I'm not an adventurous coffee imbiber. Thought I'd try a liquid coffee form and this coffee cappuccino drink seemed like it would be an 'adventure' to try for someone who is not coffee oriented. As an additive it was great. Because the cappuccino mixture includes some milk and beet sugar, it complemented the hot chocolate's taste. I used about an eighth of a can per 12 ounces of hot chocolate. Gave it a little zing. If you are not a coffee drinker, but like to add it to something for a bit of that coffee taste--this is a great product.
