review/summary: High priced sweetener
review/text: At over $4 for a box of 35 packets, this is a pricey sweetener, organic or not. The quality is very good. There is no weird aftertaste and it has a pleasant taste. But I can't say it is so much superior to other sweeteners to justify the price. Seems to be common with all stevia-based products. If you can catch it on sale at your local supermarket, pick it up. But Amazon isn't really offering any deal on the price here and there are less expensive alternatives at your local supermarket.

review/summary: Better Tasting Than Other Brands I Have Tried
review/text: I have Diabetes II and I have tried various sweeteners over the years, but have yet to find a product that I really like.  I don't drink coffee, mainly hot and iced tea. so I use these 'sugar substitutes' daily.  I also use it on cereal and again, I like the taste, it doesn't have a metallic taste as some other products have.  I can actually enjoy the taste of the cereal.<br /><br />Organic Stevia does not have the bitter taste that I have found in similar products.some  I am starting to enjoy using it, which surprised me.  I love sugar and honey :-) but since they are a no no, it is nice to finally find a product that  I actually like.<br /><br />UPDATE -10/1/12.  Still using and enjoying this product, but it is pretty expensive, for the little packets.  Other brands sell it in larger packages like sugar and it really lowers the cost and the waste if you don't use a whole packet and have to save the rest for later.  I called the company and they told me that they were hoping to put it out in a larger package in the Spring, one you could spoon out like sugar.  They have no exact date or price yet.<br /><br />I love margaritas, but rarely make them at home or drink them in restaurants because of all of the sugar.  Last night I made some at home in my Vitamix, using their whole fruit recipe (orange, lemon, lime) and substituted 4 packets for the 3 tablespoons of sugar that the recipe called for.  It was excellent with no after taste and no guilt. I halved their recipe and the two of use got l.5 glasses each.  Now if I could figure out how to use it in chips .. I would be way ahead of the game :-).

review/summary: One of the better Stevia products on the market
review/text: I recently ditched sugar and artificial sweeteners and discovered Stevia since it's a healthier alternative and plant-based. However, not all Stevia products are the same and it's a good idea to check out the ingredients since the stevia products you now see on the shelves are not pure stevia. Many contain a corn-based sweetener called erythritol or Stevia in the Raw contains dextrose.<br /><br />I regularly use Sweet Leaf and Kal Stevia as they're both the purest forms of Stevia and would highly recommend those over all others. However, Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia is a great choice over many other brands of Stevia. The ingredients are Organic Agave Inulin, Organic Stevia Extract (Stevia rebaudiana), and Silica and it's certified organic. Agave Inulin is a natural dietary fiber and Silica is a common additive in food products, which is also sold as a mineral supplement. It's something we already have in our bodies and it's essential for increasing bone strength.<br /><br />Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia has no bitter after taste and I find that one packet sweetens my coffee just as well as two teaspoonfuls of sugar. If you're looking to make the switch from sugar and artificial sweeteners, this is definitely a smarter choice.

review/summary: Sweet, but...
review/text: I used this in a few different teas and found it added sweetness, but not the clean taste of sugar.<br />Actually, I prefer my tea plain, but wanted a vehicle that would allow the Stevia flavor to come through.<br />Like others who have reviewed this product, I have found differences in bitterness in different brands. This one was not bitter, per se, but it still had that echo of "not sugar."<br /><br />That said, if I had to stay away from real maple syrup (my sweetener of choice), I would probably buy this brand.<br />The fact it's organic is a plus, though with the tiny amount you eat, I am not sure how crucial that is.

review/summary: Comparable in taste to other powdered stevia brands
review/text: This powdered stevia is comparable in quality to other brands I have tried. Like other no- or low-calorie sweeteners, stevia is extremely concentrated, so the envelope contains other substances as well, in this case organic agave inulin and silica. Each envelope contains a little over a half teaspoon of powder in all.<br /><br />Each packet claims to sweeten "like 2 tsp. of sugar." However, I found it to be comparable to one teaspoon of sugar.<br /><br />While the agave inulin and stevia are organic and this may attract some buyers, in my opinion, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PMSTTE">Truvia Natural Sweetener, 300-Count Package</a> has a more sugar-like taste. That being said, I strongly prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3JY">SweetLeaf SteviaClear Liquid Stevia, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)</a>. This form of stevia is more economical and a more palatable sweetener than any powdered stevia brand.<br /><br />For any buyers who are new to stevia, I recommend using this in foods, but not in drinks. Stevia always tastes odd to me in beverages, though it may be that one can become accustomed to its unusual taste/aftertaste in time.

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: I have used Sweetleaf brand stevia off and on for years and find this  Wholesome Sweetness to be the same as far as taste.  The only way I can enjoy the no-calorie sweetness of stevia is in tart or acidic foods.  For instance using stevia in lemonade or to make a warm apple cider vinegar quaff.  Also it is excellent sprinkled over grapefruit.  Stevia just does not taste good to me in coffee, tea, or cocoa.  Or in baked goods unless they happen to be lemon squares.  I do feel that the silica in this stevia is unnecessary because it's sealed in single use packets.  The only time I've had caking issues with stevia was when I bought a small jar of it and it turned rock hard after a while.  I've never had that problem with stevia sealed up in single use packets.

review/summary: Works OK Price is a Little High
review/text: This Stevia has less of an aftertaste than the original Stevia.  It is very sweet but it does contains other ingredients.  Instead of repeating I recommend you read K. Franklin's review on ingredients.  It is also a little pricey.  Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia, 35-Count Package (Pack of 6) for 32.52.  That is 5.42 for a box of 35.  Even though it is organic I though that was  a little high.  All of that said it does sweeten very well so it just depends on how much you want to pay for organic and how you feel about the addition ingredients.

review/summary: Good Taste
review/text: I've only used one other Stevia product which was very good. This is just as good and does not leave any bitter aftertaste in my opinion. I only use it in my morning coffee- two packets for a 16oz cup. I'd definitely buy this product if I wanted to stick with something organic. However, I personally still prefer Splenda- whether it's good for me or not.

review/text: I just did not care for this.  Put it on a bowl of cereal and tasted the sweetness an hour later.  I think it is too sweet for table sugar use but may work fine in cooking.  It is really really fine, does not look or taste like sugar.  I am always looking for a natural replacement but so far Aspertame seems to be the one I choose.  Like I said, I am always ready to find a better one, but this isn't it in my opinion.

review/summary: Okay tasting, expensive, not into the hype of agave
review/text: When agave first came on the scene I thought it sounded great.  But after a lot more research I don't think it's the wonder sweetener that many people think it is.  It is VERY high in (processed) fructose, not the same as fructose found in natural fruit.  Fructose is metabolized directly by the liver, which is different from other sugars, and can lead to fatty liver deposits. High fructose intake has also been linked to weight gain, insulin resistance, and heart disease risk in animal studies.<br /><br />Also, at the Amazon price this is extremely expensive.  My favorite is a 2 oz. bottle of NuNaturals No Alcohol Liquid Stevia--it mixes instantly in beverages, is not bitter, and lasts forever.

review/summary: Side by Side Comparison
review/text: I tried Stevia many years ago but abandoned it because at that time it was only available from health food stores and was very expensive.  It's great that you can now purchase it online or in any major grocery store.  In the past 6 months I've had fun sampling the many new varieties of low-calorie and/or artifical sweeteners that have come to market.  This morning I did a side-by-side comparison of Splenda Nectresse and this Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia.  I had actually tried the Splenda Nectresse about a month ago and couldn't decide if I liked it or not, so the side-by-side with the stevia seemed like a good experiment.  So...first I simply dipped a damp pinkie into each packet and tried them straight-up. BIG difference in taste.  The stevia shocks your tongue with how sweet it is.  The Nectresse on the other hand doesn't convey much sweetness at all and also has a unique taste that is hard to describe.  Next test...half a packet of each in a hot, regular coffee with half-and-half creamer.  Side-by-side tasting yielded a clear winner for me:  the stevia would be my first choice every time in a cup of coffee.  The Nectress adds a funky little taste that I don't enjoy in coffee.  Now, it's possible that the Nectresse would be fine to sweeeten a cold glass of a fruity iced tea.  In general tho' I don't want my sweeteners to have any taste of their own - other than just plain old SWEET.  This stevia answers that call nicely and I would certainly buy it again.

review/summary: pretty much what you'd expect it to do
review/text: Compared to other stevia packets from other competing manufacturers, this doesn't taste all that different.  The only question I have is that one of their ingredients is silica.  Curious as to what that is doing in there.  I see it in my whey as well.  Supposedly silica is a component of our bones and is available in foods like celery, which can strengthen bones.  But not sure why they would add it here.  As a filler agent?<br />The packet dissolves pretty well.  Even a bit better than another stevia packet that I have from another company.

review/text: This is the first stevia I have tried. (I'm a Splenda fan, currently.) The flavor was very good, though I was not prepared for just how sweet it is. Blam! Perhaps a half packet is the right amount for, say, an iced tea. I rather prefer the mildness of Splenda, which is not organic.<br /><br />The packaging is very convenient, and it dissolves quickly.

review/summary: Not zero calorie, but close
review/text: First off, stevia is my favorite natural sweetener.  I was, however, curious to see how Wholesome Sweeteners handled the "fillers" aspect.  The deal is that every packet of low-/no-calorie sweetener (that I've ever run across) is packed in some agent, typically maltodextrin.  In this case, it is agave inulin.  The 1 gram of agave inulin contains 0.8g of fiber, so it's really closer to 1 calorie, whereas typical zero-calorie packets actually contain 4 calories.  Due to a technicality, they get to round down to zero if under 5.  This loop-hole is pervasive in the USA.  Anyway, this 1 calorie is pretty good.  I don't like, however, that they say it's zero calories and you don't need to count them, but it's close.<br /><br />The calories of carbs can creep in if you are on a very strict diet and drink a lot of coffee or tea.  This is especially true if you are on an extremely strict diet like an Atkins or other ketogenic diet. But, for both the price and for true zero calories, you are much better off just buying liquid stevia in a water base.  I do like packets since they are portable.  For that, I give it a some stars, but I will be sticking with liquid stevia where I can, though.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: My favorite sweeteners are stevia and agave.  This Organic stevia has a bit of taste of both.  The main ingredient is agave inulin and then the second one is stevia.  This makes it really sweet with no aftertaste.  In fact, you can say that it almost has a hint of honey (must be the agave inulin)  It dissolves quickly too.<br /><br />A packet equals 2 tsp of sugar.  I like 1 tsp in my cup of coffe so I use only half a packet at a time.  It is very good though.  Considering that it is organic and natural, the price is slightly above what I would pay, but I think it's ok if you're used to buying other products with stevia.  Truvia costs about 50 cents less than this organic stevia at about the same number of packets, but truvia is not organic.  So it depends on what you're looking for.

There is no bitterness or any kind of chemical taste.<br /><br />The Wholesome Sweeteners brand has a very nice website with all kinds of information on their various products, information about their company, a blog and recipes.  I really don't know that much about the safety of Stevia or anything like that, but if you are interested in checking it out before purchasing, you can find plenty of information there.

review/summary: My choice for natural no calorie sweetener.
review/text: Had not tried this brand before but like the handy packs I can take with me when going out. Stevia is a natural and not processed with a lot of chemical that are harmful to our bodies especially the liver. One I will not name uses formaldehyde,yuck we know other uses for that,<br /><br />Stevia to me has no unpleasant after taste. It is just like using sugar. The fact this brand is organic is all the more reason to buy this brand. I make a lemon water that takes just a pinch and it is a great for that and the combo seem to be acting as an appetite suppressant for me. I know they are making no such claim just passing along something I personally have noticed.<br /><br />If you use other non sugar sweeteners you should give this a try I do believe it is the best tasting and best for your body. Enjoy.

review/text: This is my first time to consciously use Stevia. It does sweeten but you'd have to put a heap of it in your cup/bowl for it to match the sweetness you'd get from Splenda. I had a glass of peppermint tea and I used 6 packets before I gave up (the packets are stiff) and the tea was not sweet.<br /><br />Further, the taste is rather earthy although that could be because it's organic.<br /><br />In short, if you like your food/beverage to be really sweet without the calories of real sugar, you may do better with Splenda unless you want to spend 10 minutes opening packet after packet of this Stevia.

The only thing that raises any doubt is that it seems impossible to find any information about the company and its location on the Internet.  But the standards of the packaging and the whole spectrum of taste argues that this is as high quality as you'll ever get in green tea.

review/summary: These are good tasting but not too satisfying.
review/text: I am comparing these to Vitalicious and they are not as filling for the calories.<br />They do have the moistness of a real brownie and taste like the fudgie brownie but they are smaller and the packaging is too much for what you get.<br />I like them but I am staying with Vitalicious.<br />There is one important item that these do NOT have which is very important for people who do NOT want iron added to their diet. This does not have iron listed on it.<br />Vitalicious has 50% of the RDA of iron in each piece. I have tried to get them to get it out but they do not listen.<br />Glenny's Brownies are much better for having NO iron added.

review/summary: Weak taste but priced like gold
review/text: I love cinnamon sticks and have bought from many different venders. I boil or pressure cook them to make a big batch of tea. Some give up amazing flavor: sweet, spicy and oh so good. These were weak and woody and were among the worse I have ever bought. I don't mind spending the big bucks but it had better be the best quality. These sticks sucked. Maybe I was unlucky and got a bad patch. But obviously quality control is not good so I don't be buying anything from Frontier again.

review/summary: First excited, then disappointed....
review/text: I really do like my Senseo coffee maker.  I, like others who have reviewed the Kona Pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. I was excited to see that Kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'.  I have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews here, I could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable.  It just didn't make sense.  Well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee I made using the Kona pods also.<br /><br />My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally. The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod I have ever used in my Senseo.  The instructions for the Kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine.  The Kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package.  I always  wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the Senseo. After my problems with the Kona pods, my husband decided that I was not 'wiggling' them enough.  He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open.  So, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods.  That did not make much sense, but after several cups of Kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods.  The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water.  There is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done.  The pod itself is heavier when I take it out to throw it away.  So, I believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.<br /><br />Then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the Kona pods.  The problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle. The 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water!  This problem is one that I still cannot really figure out.  The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods I have tried.  So, I guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee.  I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate.  I have tried wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod.  But, that has not worked for me.<br /><br />So, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me.  I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get using other brands.  So, adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work.<br /><br />I have been reading of a product called an EcoPod.  It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers.  It might be the next thing I try.

review/summary: Great Choice for Senseo
review/text: This coffee is great!  The Senseo machine can be difficult to use as far as getting pods into it correctly.  I am not sure what has happened to the people reporting "steam locks" but I have had issues when:<br /><br />  - the pod is not inserted properly<br /><br />  - the pod holder is not seated correctly within the machine<br /><br />  - the pod is not prepared for insertion properly<br /><br />My issues were varied, but basically consisted of hot water  coming out of the sides of the coffee maker and no coffee would be brewed, and the pod would have to be discarded.  This happened to me with Senseo pods, and probably would have happened with the Aloha Island pods except that I learned how to deal with the machine.<br /><br />Also in some of these cases the lid to the coffee maker would be stuck, (possibly the dreaded "steam lock"), but I was always able to open the machine after a minute or so of wiggling the lock/release handle on the machine, which I would think most people would do automatically when the machine doesn't open.<br /><br />By properly preparing the pod for insertion I am able to use single pods for the Melitta One in my Senseo as well as the Aloha Island pods and of course the Senseo pods.  If you don't put it in just right, you will have problems.  The key is to spread the coffee equally around within the Pod before inserting it into the machine.  Do this by wiggling the pod around a bit (take about 5 seconds).  The helpful instructions with the Aloha Island pods say to "break up the coffee" within the pod before using, which has the same effect.  It took me five months to figure this out while using the Senseo pods, especially when brewing two cups.  I wish Senseo would have included a little note like Aloha Island did.<br /><br />During shipping the coffee can settle or collect within the pod, either on a side(s) or even in the middle.  This changes the thickness of the pod, ever so slightly, and the machines tolerance for different thickness pods appears to be extremely low!<br /><br />So smooth out your pods and enjoy, I think that any problems you have with pods are really problems with the design of the machine, not the pods themselves.

review/summary: Ah!  Senseo pods that rock!  Mahalo!
review/text: As a bachelor who frequently must grab a cup of joe at home and run, i was reluctant to waste coffee in my Braun drip machine, and disinclined to clean up after the French Press method.  A New York Times article convinced me that a Pod system would be the way to go, and i found the Philips Senseo machine to be the best at the consumer level.  Alas, the Douwe Egberts pods that come with are, um, IMHO, not good.<br /><br />A brief web search led me to Aloha Island's Senseo-style pods, and i ordered a box of their single serving espresso pods.  The package arrived swiftly, and the box of pods was swaddled in styro-peanuts:  nice touch!  i immediately placed a pair in the Senseo unit and let it do its thing.  Wow!  The quality of the coffee is, to date, unparalled.  Rich, smooth, and frothy, almost like a latte before the milk is added.  And i was surprised that the yield was about one ounce greater than with the DE pods.<br /><br />I'm a believer, an advocate, and a confirmed drinker and fan.  Thanks and Mahalo!

review/summary: Don't Waste Your Money!
review/text: I was thrilled to find Kona coffee in pods for my Senseo machine.  However, these pods do not really fit right.  Consequently, sometimes you get a full cup that is mostly water -- then you might get half a cup.  There is NO consistency in how much coffee will actually come out -- or how strong/weak the coffee will be.  I can't tell if it's manufacturing irregularities or whether the pods are just poorly designed.  In any event, only about one in five pods actually produces a drinkable full cup of coffee.  I emailed Aloha Island Coffee Company with my concerns and asking for advice, but have not yet received an answer after two weeks.<br /><br />I'm going back the the Douwe Egberts pods -- at least they are consistent and A LOT less expensive.

The first time I used a Kona pod the machine jammed and I could not open it for 24 hours,(caused a steam lock), about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo.  The next time I tried a Kona pod I got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try. I am not very impressed so far.  I am now afraid to try again.

review/summary: Top Quality Coffee, but Pod technology leaves something to be desired
review/text: Yes the coffee is the best quality, pesticide free.  There are technical issues with the pods. 1 pod was broken when I opened up the pouch it was stored in.  For any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable.  Also, many times the pod is not working, but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work (I have Black & Decker Home Cafe Machine).  Great coffee, but I felt that I had to really work for it.  I also feel that to charage $15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive, considering that they are being shiped from LA not HI.

review/text: After reading many of the reviews I think I have figured out the problem.  You guys have the wrong POD brewer. I have a BUNN and tried various different pods with it.  The Aloha Island pods are the best of the lot. I have been in search of a good cup of coffee for years.  The answer is a BUNN and the Aloha dark roast Pods.  I bought two el-cheapo pod brewers including black and decker and senseo.  I couldn't get a good cup of coffee even with the Aloha pods.  Once I ditched the cheap pod brewer and spent the $200.00 on the BUNN, all my troubles were over.  You guys will never be happy until you get a good pod brewer.

review/text: After reading the reviews, I was hesitant.  However, I've gotten a perfect cup every time so far with my Senseo.<br /><br />The coffee is very good, but it has fallen a little short of my expectations. I've previously brought Kona back from my Hawaiian vacations and ground it myself.  The pod coffee is not quite as good as fresh ground.<br /><br />UPDATE:  for my next shipment, this two-cup style was backordered.  Aloha Island Coffee Co. sent me the equivalent amount of coffee in single-cup style pods instead.  I've found these pods to work better, fit the Senseo machine better, and this coffee now does tasted just as good (or better) than fresh ground whole bean Kona!<br /><br />I think the single-pod style is quite a bit more expensive than two-cup style, but the difference is definitely noticeable!

review/summary: Flavor okay, not great
review/text: I struggled with rating this bar a 3 or a 4.  Taste is only about a 3, but quality of ingredients in providing a healthy and edible alternative to a candy bar rates it a solid 4. Below is the gist a a review I wrote for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ENWSBW">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Cherry Pie</a> comparing it with the PURE Wild Blueberry Bar.<br /><br />When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products.  I wanted something with few ingredients, not "fortified" and with some nuts in it.  I settled on the Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the PURE Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar.  I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices.<br /><br />The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc.  The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g.  The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg.  The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider.  Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats.  The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground.<br /><br />1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar.  One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin.  It has a much fresher and lively taste.  I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel.  It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar.  I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?).  In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Amazon.  If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try though.  I still get both auto shipped from Amazon for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts.<br /><br />For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories.  Stats are listed in the order I listed them in the previous sentence.<br /><br />Calories:  190, 190, 280, 210, 380<br />Total Fat:  8g, 9, 14, 13, 14  Saturated Fat:  0.5g, 1, 5, 8, 7<br />Sugars:  21g, 20, 30, 24, 0<br />Protein:  4g, 6, 4, 3, 10<br />Sodium:  0mg, 5, 140, 35, 1540 !!!<br /><br />UPDATE Nov 11, 2009  PURE has changed this bar.<br /><br />I got my regular shipment and noticed the bars came in a newly shaped box and new packaging.  Total fat went from 9g to 8g and they eliminated all sodium.  Total carbs edged up to 26g from 25g.  Protein remains 6g and calories at 190.<br /><br />The BIG CHANGE is that "Organic Wild Blueberries" drops from the 2nd item listed on the ingredients list to the 5th!  Blueberries are now after not only dates but walnuts, cashews and rice proein concentrate.  Bumping up the nut content would not be a bad thing, but since the total fat actually decreased and carbs increased, I think the nut quantity actually decreased along with the blueberries, but the date quantity increased.  This seems to basically be a date bar w/ nuts now and some minor blueberry content.  I'd love to see the actually quantity of blueberries in this bar.  Ironically, I can actually see blueberries scattered in the new bar, whereas the old bar was more of a dense blended mush.  The bar is noticeably lighter in color now (and density)...more tan than blue.  The new packaging implies a longer slimmer bar shape, but oddly the actual bar is shorter, wider and a tad thicker...package marketing?  The total weight is unchanged at 1.7oz.  I'm still looking for an alternative blueberry bar...I imagine cost is a big factor in blueberry content.  My 2 kids will still eat these but they noticed the change right away and are not impressed.

review/text: This bar is the closest thing I've ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food.  I have no idea how the folks at Pure Bar managed to make a chocolate bar that tastes so much like baked goods, using only raw and living ingredients, but it's wonderful that they have, and I mean to buy several more cases.  Any of the store bought brownies you've had won't satisfy you like this will - Entemanns and Hostess are not nearly as delicious and warm-tasting, and the health food and energy bars I've had that are chocolate flavored always end up tasting like wheat germ or oats.  It's easy to carry, one bar fills me up, and as a chocolate fan, I am happy to see that Pure Bar uses raw cacao powder - the real deal, and not carob chocolate substitutes.  You can definitely taste the difference.  This particular Pure Bar product makes for the best tasting snackfood or dessert I've ever eaten out of a wrapper, and unless you're on a completely raw vegan diet, it's going to be better for you than whatever meal you ate just beforehand!  If you like chocolate like I do, you're going to love this.  It's a soft, gooey brownie, pure and simple, walnuts and all.

If I fell into either one of those camps, I would instantly raise the rating at least a star.  But since I'm not adverse to occasionally ingesting an artificial ingredient or two, I'll give you the straight dope on this very healthy snack bar.<br /><br />The ingredient list is quite impressive, if only for the fact that someone who doesn't have a chemistry degree can understand it.  That in itself is refreshing.  They've even got a YES/NO breakdown printed next to the ingredients that goes something like this:<br /><br />YES!:  Certified Organic, Gluten-Free, Full Serving [of] Fruit, Organic Protein, Rich in Omega-3s, Good Source of Fiber, Raw, Vegan<br /><br />NO!:  Refined Sugars, Gluten Dairy or Soy, Cholesterol, Trans Fats, Preservatives, GMOs, Artificial Nothin'<br /><br />WOW!  5-STARS SO FAR!  Let's tear this thing open!<br /><br />At first glance, it looks just like holiday fruitcake that's been mashed with a rolling pin.  Mmmmm...  Maybe that's why it doesn't need preservatives and the expiration date is almost a full year in the future.  Smells a lot like fruitcake, too.  I lost my first test subject (my wife) on looks and smell alone.  (Minus 1 star for lack of family appeal -- I don't count the kids' outright rejection.)<br /><br />The first bite redeemed the bar.  It's tastier than I'd anticipated, full flavored and sweet without being powdery or sugary.  I think I might like this.<br /><br />The second bite lost the other star instantly.  I felt like I almost broke a tooth on a rather large fruit pit.  Guess I should have paid closer attention to the disclaimer on the wrapper that states, "May contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits."  I found a stem in the other half of the bar.<br /><br />As good as this fruit bar may be for me, I don't think I should have to strain it prior to eating it.  I have enjoyed similarly nutritious bars in the past and not one thought of seeking a dentist.<br /><br />Though the PURE BAR is EVERYTHING they promise (pits and all), I'll probably do some more "research" (read: taste tests) on other healthy snack bars before buying a case.  I will, however, recommend this bar to a family member who needs a Gluten-free diet, because it tastes significantly better than most Gluten-free snacks I've sampled.<br /><br />Just be careful and take small bites.

The site waxed poetic about the flavor, as well as the extremely high quality ingredients, but I figured "right -- these bars all end up tasting like dates no matter what flavor they are". Well, I stand corrected, the flavor on these bars is excellent and is by far the best I've tasted (and I've tasted quite a few). That's a real bonus, considering the fact that the ingredients are completely raw and organic and the whole bar is relatively low on the glycemic index. To those unfamiliar with raw food bars, take note: if you're expecting any of them to taste like "granola" bars or candy bars, you'll be disappointed. Think fruit sweet instead and your expectations will be met. I can also vouch for the fact that my 2.5 year old daughter loves them. On to the chocolate next...

review/summary: BEWARE OF BUGS FROM THIS SELLER
review/text: I love these bars.  I basically live off of them.  HOWEVER, this is now the second time that I have ordered them from Amazon where the internal boxes of bars have had bugs in them.  They looked somewhat like ants, but I wasn't sure what they were.  Just gross little crawly things creeping around inside and outside of the box.  I say beware because the bugs are tiny and you might think that they're not there when you open the package.  My advice would be to let the internal box of bars sit outside your cupboard on a counter for a day and see if you notice any bugs before you co-mingle the box with your household food. Gross, gross, gross.  So unhappy because other than that, these bars are great.  But I will never order them online from Amazon again.  Thank g-d Trader Joes and Ralphs are starting to carry this brand.

review/summary: small bar for a high price with an untrue claim and hidden fructose
review/text: As a person who is more involved with health and nutrition than the average person that has also purchased raw food bars before, I was happy that this was offered though the Amazon Vine program and I glady ordered the sample.  It tastes good and it claims to contain "nothing cooked, nothing processed," but that is not the simple truth.  The bar contains "agave nectar" which does not occur naturally.  It is not unprocessed and it is in fact, a highly cooked and processed sweetener.  It is derived from processing and cooking the core of the blue agave plant for many hours in order to break down its starches into sugars.  Agave nectar was originally touted as a "healthy alternative" to table sugar, but it is potentially much worse than table sugar on your body.  It is essentially a super high fructose syrup, just like high fructose corn syrup, but with a much higher fructose content.  Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55% fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90% fructose.  First of all, I don't understand why they thought they needed to sweeten this "raw" bar, and second, they used "agave nectar" which sounds good to the uninformed, but it is not a raw ingredient and it has a very high fructose content.  I think they used "agave nectar" to hide the additional fructose (or sugar) on the label.  There is controversy, but fructose and particularly agave nectar may be bad for you.<br /><br />You can research for yourself, google "agave nectar bad"<br /><br />and look for entries from "foodrenegade," "nourishedkitchen" and "living-foods"<br /><br />You can also google "fructose bad"<br /><br />check out the hits from "about" and "the american journal of clinical nutrition"<br /><br />Fructose and in particular, High Fructose Corn Syrup are the subjects of much controversy today.  There are studies that conclude that there is no appreciable difference between sucrose and fructose to our bodies (and of course, fructose is a component of sucrose).  There are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic.  Regardless of which camp you're in, "agave nectar" is a hidden source of fructose in this bar and it is not raw.  The fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims "nothing cooked and nothing processed" is nothing short of fraud.

review/summary: Not terrible but I won't purchase again
review/text: Usually, I go to Whole Foods and try to buy a single bar of a brand or flavor I haven't tried before purchasing an entire box... & I should have followed that rule before making this purchase.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I love the tart twang of cranberry and orange together - but the additional ingredients in this bar made it overly sweet for my taste.  I also found the texture to be quite gritty and overly moist.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars for the quality of the ingredients and because it would likely appeal to those who enjoy REALLY sweet fruit treats.<br /><br />I think in the future I will go back to Lara Bars.

review/text: Weighing in at about 6 gr/CHO this make a bread option for those who use insulin. Not 16 or 36.  Use it for Pizza, use it for sandwich, don't use it for birthday cakes and the like.  I've been using this for years and can attest that it is a winner. I am told that if you spray it with cold pressed olive oil, and cook (fry?) you can eat it with middle eastern spices.  However, be aware that even if you have a place which stocks this it's not always easy to find around the dates of some middle eastern religious festivals when everyone buy every loaf in site.<br />Stock up, and remember that with proper care this stores very well.

review/text: These pitas (and their lavish also) are delicious, low calorie, low carb and so versatile!  What more can you ask for from a pita?  I am borderline diabetic, so must watch carb consumption. Joseph's Oat bran and whole wheat pitas have become a staple for me.  I've stuffed 'em with veggies, used them for fajitas, used them as a pizza crust, cut them up and baked them as chips (both savory and sweet) and so much more.  Now that I've moved from New England where they were readily available, I find I must order them online.  It is no imposition when they are so well loved by me!!  I strongly recommend them!

review/text: I love, love, love this pita bread.  Its soft, not too dense, and is low carb to boot.  An entire pita is only 60 calories. SIXTY calories. It doesn't get much better.  My one complaint is that it is really hard to find in brick-and-mortar stores.  Some Walmart's used to carry it, but I haven't been able to find it for months.  The last time I was visiting family in LA, I found it and bought 7 packs of it so I could take it back home with me!  It holds up well in the freezer.  If I continue to be unable to find it in a store, I'll be forced to buy it online and pay shipping charges.

review/summary: amazingly good pita bread!
review/text: I have been buying this bread for a few years when I can find it, so far I've been getting it at the local Walmart up until lately they've stocked it. I checked here and it's out of stock here too. I will find it somewhere as it in good to have on hand to use for bread. It holds up better than any other low carb breads in the freezer so I generally have a few packs in the freezer. Love it for low carbing. It is soft and you can make pita chips for dipping with a brushing of olive oil, some salt and baking. It is one of my favorite staples. Disregard the idiot who posted in the wrong place for another item.

review/text: As a kid my mother would punish me with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (I would rather go hungry).  So needless to say, I am not a huge jam fan.  Maybe that's because I grew up on store brands or Knott's grape jelly.  Anyways, I relieved a 4 pack of Maury Island Jams as a Christmas gift and all I can say is I don't know what a Marion berry is but i love it out of this jam jar!!!  The raspberry is also the best I have ever tasted so far (not that I have tasted a lot though).  I am sure the other two flavors are great but I need to calm down on my consumption before I gain 10 lbs.  Crackers + low-fat whipped cream cheese + teaspoon of Marion berry jam by Maury Island Farm = Deliciousness. :)

review/text: I bought five different jams for my husband for 2010 Christmas.  He opened the marionberry first.  He didn't say much, just nodded and munched away, which means he really likes it.  I took a small spoonful and loved the strong berry flavor.  I'm not a fan of sugary jams so I was elated w/the intense marionberry taste.  It does have small seeds similar to a strawberry, so it's not intrusive in your mouth - you won't be picking at your teeth.<br /><br />I was looking for a high end gourmet jam and am very pleased that I bought this.  It's exactly what I was looking for.

review/summary: AN OLD FAVORITE STAND-BY
review/text: I have been called many, many things in my life (As a matter of fact I have a list somewhere here in my home office I have been keeping for years).  Some of the things are nice; many are not so nice and some, it you can believe it, are downright nasty.  One thing though that I have not been called is a "food snob."  Hey, I like good food but as to food in general, I turn my nose up at almost nothing.<br /><br />I love these Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli things.  Well, maybe "love" is a bit strong, but I most certainly have eaten my share of these in my life and quite likely will continue to do so.  The flavor is mild - I grant you that, but if you put some grated cheese on them and add a couple of shots of hot sauce, they are actually pretty good.<br /><br />I keep a constant supply of these in the pantry.  I am a night owl and at two or three in the morning while reading I at times get hungry.  Open a can of these and pop them in the microwave and zip - I have myself a tasty snack!<br /><br />These are also great grandson fodder.  Kids, or most of them that I know, love these things.<br /><br />Now almost nothing that comes out of a can should ever be referred to as "health food."  These are no exception.  On the other hand, relatively speaking, you could do a lot worse I suppose.  To be frank though, I am not too hung up on the "health food" thing and focus more on moderation than I do on content.<br /><br />Note:  There is a down side to this product.  If you drip the sauce of your shirt, it is difficult to remove.<br />On the up-side, I always use paper plates when I eat this stuff and my dogs love to lick up the leftover sauce.<br /><br />Anyway, for me this is good stuff.  I like it.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: Best bread ever
review/text: When I got this flour I promptly made a loaf of bread, using the recipe on the bag, in a very old Sanyo one pound bread maker that I was given with no instructions.  The loaf came out three inches high...hhmmmm.....<br />I did some digging around and came across an old book Smart Bread Machine Recipes by Sandra Woodruff. 1994<br />She only uses whole grain flours.  What I was lacking was Vital Gluten as many of the flours in this mix are very low in natural gluten.<br />Now I have wonderful bread that rises properly and it is soooo good. Just the right amount of texture and nutty taste. So looking forward to experimenting as I love Russian Black Bread.<br />As for having to add the gluten, my thought is that older bread machines must have either a shorter rise time or lower temps or both, because I do not see gluten as an ingredient on newer bread machine recipes that use whole wheat and other whole grain flours -- I find on the web. And I read reviews that stated that they used the recipe on the bag and had no problems with rising.  So that is my the theory.... it's my very old machine.<br />And what does a single person do with 20 pounds of flour ... I vacuum sealed three bags and put them in the freezer.<br />And thanks to the reviewer that stated they used it for cookies... heck never thought of that... but now I will.....oh and baked donuts made with honey....

review/summary: For Those Who Make Multigrain Dough but Don't Like a Heavy Grain Taste
review/text: I have switched from 100% white flour to a mix of white and multigrain flour for healthier breads. At first I was not happy with the limited brands I found in local stores. The taste was too heavy. I then ran across Great River on Amazon and read the reviews. Based on the reviews, I believed I had found a brand that wouldn't overwhelm the end-product with the flavor of the grains. After baking the first bread and pizza, I knew had found the brand that really works. Even my wife, who didn't want me to change my pizza dough recipe because it's the best, found my 'new' dough also produced great results. Depending on what I'm baking, I'll use Great River for 1/3 to 1/2 of the recipe with the rest using King Arthur un-bleached, un-bromated bread flour.

review/summary: makes great english muffins
review/text: I got this flour to replace the whole wheat flour I've been using for English muffins. At the same time, following some reviewers suggestions, I also got  gluten flour to help rising. I don't have a bread machine; I follow a general English muffin yeast-based recipe and hand knead the dough for about 11 minutes. I added 1 tbspn of gluten flour per cup of bread flour. I think this made a huge difference, as I've been having problems getting whole wheat muffins to rise properly. I also made some aluminum foil muffin rings to help the muffins keep their shape while they rose. The end result was a 1.5" high muffin, nicely dense, with a moist center and great texture that toasted perfectly. The flour is a keeper (especially with 20 pounds of it)

review/text: I bought this product here on Amazon.  It is wonderful!  Yes, it taste different than white bread and has a different texture.  That is why I bought it!  I am looking to increase my families consumption of healthy, whole grains.  I don't want all the preservatives in the store bought bread and find alot of the frozen healthier breads to be dry and not that tasty.  The breads and baked goods I have made with this flour have all been delicious!<br /><br />I have made my way through 2 of the bags so far.<br /><br />I have made the bread using the recipe on the package and my electric bread machine.  I have made the 1 pound loaf and the 1.5 pound loaf, both with great success each time. I made them using my quick, 58 minute cycle.  I make homemade butter to serve with it...delicious!!!  If there is any left the next day, we toast it and eat with more butter and homemade jam.  My husband and kids love this as a snack as well.<br /><br />I have also used it to make zucchini bread, along with some sprouted grain whole wheat flour.  I ran out of the sprouted grain bread and so had to use half of the bread flour to complete the recipe.  It was even better than when I used only the sprouted grain wheat.  So this weekend, I want to try my zucchini bread recipe with just this bread flour to see how it turns out.  I bake this in the oven...and it just turns out great.<br /><br />I also made some cinnamon rolls.  They turned out more like bisuits, because of the texture...but my family loved them!  I also made a challah bread with it...and again, it had a different texture, but was delicious!<br /><br />I want to try some of cookie and pie crust recipes with this next.  And will order some of the other flours from this company as well.

review/summary: Great Grains - AMAZING
review/text: I haven't used this for bread yet. Too busy right now, but my husband made oatmeal, chocolate chip cookies with Craisens and almonds. They were amazing. The flour gave them a nutty, bite. The cookies were gone in a flash.<br /><br />I finally used this for bread. OUTSTANDING. I am writing a bread baking book and am including a whole grain loaf. I used this flour plus a 1/4 cup of gluten flour for a 2.5 pound loaf. It rose up high and light. The texture is soft and stretchy with crunchies to boot. I was skeptical about using a whole grain flour nearly exclusively for bread but this is amazing!

review/summary: This bread flour is great
review/text: I saw reviews saying this may be old flour because some people had problems with their bread rising.  I had no such problem.  It rose just fine.  I actually called the company and asked them how to read the expiration date on their package since it wasn't obvious, and it was fresh.  They are also very helpful with tips if you need them.  There are lots of reasons bread does not rise including old yeast, humidity, etc.  I was wary but glad I took the chance and bought the flour.

review/text: I was a little anxious about ordering bread flour through amazon, but I live in an area where good flour is not readily available.  This product makes wonderful loaves that are light, but has that hearty chewey texture I was going for.  I add chopped sunflower seeds in for some additional protien and crunch.  I intend to get into the subscription plan.

review/summary: Yummy Bread Flour
review/text: I received this very fast and immediately tried a loaf of bread in the machine.  I made just the dough and except for a couple of mistakes on my part it was a wonderful bread.  I will buy this flour again and again.  Looks like the Ezekiel bread is staying in the store.  Next time I may substitute some light spelt in the mix.  I would recommend this flour to anyone who wants to eat healthy and have a good tasting bread. And if you buy the 20 lb. combo the shipping is free.

review/summary: Hoosier Bread Maker
review/text: When we bought our Panasonic Bread maker we also ordered 20 pounds of this flour. Wow, it makes good bread. And, I modify the recipe found on the label by grinding sunflower, flax, pumpkin and other seeds to put into the mix. Add eggs and sometimes some spices too. The flour acts as a good base and we always seem to get good bread no matter what else I add (within reason!!). So, will keep using this flour as it has proven to make good bread.

review/summary: DEAD FLOUR
review/text: I usually use another 9 grain mix with no problem whatsoever. Maybe I have a bad batch and fortunately I know a builder short of corner stones!! For the first time in 5 years of bread machine baking I am producing loaves that do not rise and come our rock hard, heavy and with a dry flour taste.<br /><br />Reading the other reviews I am inclined to think that I have been unlucky, however considering the cost and shipping I will not be trying again with this brand

review/summary: I like the taste and the fragrance
review/text: I've been searching for a white tea that tastes good. The idea of white tea with fruit interested me, specially when they call it "organic Very Berry White Tea With Fruit." I drink tea for several reasons. Tea is usually healthier than coffee, and I drink less coffee if I drink more tea. I'm also looking at ingredients with the teas I try. The box says, "Premium organic white tea is naturally blended with organic blueberry, blackberry and natural raspberry to create a refreshing and healthy cup of tea." On the bottom of the box the list of ingredients is given, and is a little different: "Organic ingredients: white tea, blackberry, blueberry, licorice and natural raspberry. Organic products certified by Ecocert-SA F-32600" This tea is supposed to be rich in antioxidants and "sunshine for the senses", so I'm glad to say that I enjoyed the taste. I think it will taste good both as hot tea and iced tea for the Summer.

review/summary: My favorite tea
review/text: Describing flavors is always difficult, so forgive me if I don't do it justice. It tastes of fresh berries and mild white tea, with a hint of citrus. It's refreshing but there is a certain warmth to it. I can't taste the licorice at all, which is great because though I like its properties (helps digestion), I hate its taste. This is the most balanced and delicious berry flavored tea I have ever had. The fact that it is organic makes it even better. Strongly recommend it.<br /><br />My local supermarket stopped carrying if for some reason and I was heartbroken. Looked everywhere for it, until it finally occurred to me that I could probably find it where I find everything else - Amazon. : ) Great price, too!

review/text: I thought I'd have trouble going through a case of wild rice so I split it with a friend of mine.  I have a couple of recipes that use it and I was having trouble finding wild rice in my local grocery store.  This stuff is great.  I've got on the internet looking for new wild rice recipes for an excuse to use it some more.  The package size is nice so you don't have to open a big honking bag and hope it doesn't spill all over.  I won't have any problems using up a case when this one is gone.

review/text: Yum! This is good stuff. I like ajvar in general. It's a great spread or dip for bread and also goes very nicely as a sort of "side salad" with meat and potatoes or rice.<br />What to compare it to? I would compare it to salsa in a way, but it's also a bit chutney-ish. It's not vinegary tasting, nor is it horribly spicy. I dont think it's spicy at all, even the hot stuff. It's bright reddish-orange and can stain easily too, so be careful!

review/summary: FINALLY
review/text: Finally a flavored sugar!  Splenda is awesome (does not create sugar imbalance in your body, which is the #1 weight gainer)!  The mocha is absolutely the best of the three offered, and I am a French Vanilla fan, usually.  The French Vanilla is a close second and the Hazelnut is a distant third.  One packet of flavored and one plain packet is perfect for one travel sz. mug (14oz).  No need to use two flavored packets as one packs a pretty good punch, which is good since they are a little pricey.  The only "con" is that they are difficult to open since there is no small start-tear on the top.  You have to open it with your teeth and they are the tall plastic packets Vs. regular sugar size paper ones.  A stupid "con", I know, but nothing can be perfect, can it?!

review/summary: AT LAST!
review/text: Flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now, but even if you buy the sugar-free kind, you're ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer. As if that weren't bad enough, it's partially HYDROGENATED!<br />Splenda Flavor Blends is a wonderful alternative if you're like me and just can't face black coffee. Please note that this is not a creamer. It sweetens/flavors coffee. If you find you just have to have creamer to "tame" down your coffee you can add a Splenda Flavor blend and a splash of skim milk or if you like things more creamy, buy some powdered non-fat milk and add that along with the Splenda Flavor blends.<br />Lots of times, I find products with Splenda already in them to be too sweet but I didn't think that was the case with this. All three of the available flavors (hazelnut, mocha, vanilla) taste great without being overpowering.<br />Finally, now I can kick that fatty creamer bad habit!
