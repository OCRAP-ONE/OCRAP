review/summary: A bad way to start the morning
review/text: I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing this coffee at the store. I'm not a hardcore Starbucks fan, but I saw this on the shelf and thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I'm actually typing this immediately after having taken one sip of the coffee this morning. I was skeptical the second I opened the bag; the aroma was just...weird. It didn't really smell like coffee; it certainly didn't smell like caramel. But I made a pot and took that first sip. And then I googled to see if I had missed the news about a poisoning scare with this coffee because it was just AWFUL. It has an unnatural burnt/chemically taste to it. I've choked down some bad cups of coffee in a fix, but I'm not going to do it from my own sofa. This pot of coffee is going down the drain and the remainder of the bag is going in the trash.<br /><br />I'll take a second sip, just to be sure.<br /><br />Nope. Still completely undrinkable.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Since I spotted this coffee on the shelf, it has been love at first sip.  It is a smooth, full-bodied, bold cup of coffee with just the right amount of caramel overtones...not sicky-sweet caramel, but just a delightful cup of coffee with a wonderful aroma and just the right touch of caramel for the mature coffee drinker.  I prefer it black, but for a wonderful relaxing drink for dessert, I sometimes add a bit of sweetener and half and half....HEAVEN!  I have also tried the cinnamon and vanilla, but the caramel is my favorite.

review/text: Good coffee. little caramel flavor. I feel that I can never go wrong with Starbuck's coffee. The taste is bold and smooth and comfortable. I also love caramel. I have had other caramel coffees and loved them. This was not one of them. The coffee itself does not disappoint, but I think they had a factory worker wave a caramel over the top and that was all. Not much of a caramel flavor.

review/summary: Perfectly balanced flavored coffee that is all NATURAL
review/text: I am not a huge fan of flavored coffees because 99% of them use natural and ARTIFICIAL flavorings thus they are strong, smelly, and have a bad aftertaste.  This coffee enticed me as it is all natural and the caramel flavoring comes from caramelizing sugar which is subtle yet smoothly delicious as it adds a rich buttery flavor that comes through cup after cup.<br />My mom does not drink anything but Folgers but when she came by for lunch she asked for coffee and I handed her a cup of this blend since I had brewed it for me and she loved it.<br />She even took the remainder of the bag home to enjoy.  That alone impressed me!  I have tried the cinnamon & the vanilla natural fusions and did not like them as much as this one. This is the only one I will buy again to enjoy on chilly fall evenings.

review/summary: Unpleasant flavor
review/text: I have been using Starbucks coffee for quite awhile and I do like it. When I saw the $1.50 coupon for their fusion flavored coffee I thought I'd give it a try and purchased the caramel flavored. The first pot I brewed full strength. It did not have a caramel flavor nor did it smell of caramel, it had a phony chemically taste. I first tried to drink it black and since that did not taste good I added half/half and sugar, it still had a unpleasant flavor. I tried diluting it with regular coffee (1 TBS caramel fusion and 4 TBS regular coffee) and it still had an unpleasant aroma and flavor.

review/summary: I am not a coffee drinker, but I love this coffee
review/text: I normally do not drink regular coffee. I will enjoy a Cafe Mocha or a drink made with expresso and heavy cream...so it basically doesn't taste like coffee. I bought this because I love caramel flavored drinks. I will agree that the caramel flavor is not as strong as one would think, but if you add a flavored creamer, it tastes wonderful. I used a caramel macchiacto creamer and it was delish. I can't wait to try this with a mocha flavor and maybe some Cinnamon and sugar.<br /><br />I never encountered the "chemical" taste mentioned above.

review/summary: Coffee Lover finds absolute Favorite!!
review/text: I love coffee. I hated it as a child only because mom did and i expect the stuff dad drank was crap.. i do remember him buying folgers instant when it first came out and saying it was one of the best..<br /><br />First time was the very early ice coffees at Duncan. From there any new brand and style. Gloria Jeans was favorite for years. Starbucks makes a great, well anything. i am not big into buying all there flavor enhancers. There standard expressos and capuchinos work best for me. Green Mountain has (before tasting this) the best IMO for the flavors. there are a few other brands that make good flavors but too many taste manufactured and candy like. i have a very enhanced sense of smell and taste. it is great for when i need to pick out fresh and quality but terrible when i smell bad odors.. so when i taste and smell things that are very strong to me , others don't notice or it seems very slight. With it so enhanced at times i get over load and have a hard time breaking it down. just some background so you understand that this really is a above and beyond flavor, for the ones that want it at times. don't get me wrong, i love just plain good coffee, but now it is nice to know i can get the best of flavors and coffee in one cup. i haven't had that option before.<br /><br />Hubby just bought me a bag of the flavor fusions carmel. first time ever. i usually go through a pound of beans in a month. Not sure if this comes in bean from but that is ok if i have them pre ground. i just like the flavor better of freshly ground but this coffee is the most smooth, the flavor is blended so well. Nothing about it tastes manufactured. If you try it with cream and sugar it is kicked up another notch of smooth flavoring.  WOW<br /><br />for now i have my favorite and my once a cup with no company coming over has now changed to 2+ before noon.  The bag he bought this saturday is 1/2 full. That's a record for me and it will make incredible ice coffee, i just know it!<br /><br />Best so far!!

review/summary: A Treat to Stick With
review/text: Our three pooches get a Beefeaters Munchy Stick every day, usually in the evening. They look forward to this daily ritual with great anticipation. When the treats are presented to the three girls, each assumes her position apart from the others and commences chewing. Between five and ten minutes the Stix are history, and three happy girls are searching for some fortuitous crumbs. We've been following this routine for years and the dogs have never tired of these chew treats. We do vary the flavor of the Stix, and have even purchased Beefeater variations on the theme that target the coat, calm jittery nerves, or help build cartilage with glucosamine. Occasionally we've run out of Beefeeaters and had to substitute other brands while waiting for our mail order supply to arrive. Our pooches seem to prefer the Beefeaters brand.<br /><br />No matter which flavor we choose, the girls love their Beefeaters Munchies.

review/text: Initially, I started buying this product because it is not made in China which had so many recalls.  I also was looking for ground raw hide chews that did not have chicken or beef since one of my dogs is allergic to that.<br /><br />In addition to all of the other premises, my dogs seem to enjoy these chews so much!  They're totally safe also since they desintegrade in their mouth while, at the same time, they help keep their teeth in good shape and clean.

review/summary: Top-quality food for your puppy...
review/text: Blue-buffalo is just the best dog food ever. I can't tell you how it tastes of course, but if you read the ingredient list, you will see your dog is not being fed corn meal and/or other by-products that affect the health of your pet. It will keep your pet healthy and this kind of quality diet will help your pet live longer. It is much more expensive than Pedigree or any other supermarket available food, but it is worth it. You are paying for true quality meals not just corn and bones that are grinded in the seemingly great Pedigree. If you go to the Blue Buffalo website, you can take the TRUE BLUE test to compare your brand of food to Blue Buffalo and they will give you a $5 OFF coupon for your pet food purchase upon completion of the survey. One thing to note is that even though this particular bag of food is for small breed puppies, it will not be easily chewed on by extremely small breeds like Chihuahuas. My Chihuahua was supposed to eat solid food since he was 2 months old, but could only chew BlueBuffalo until he was 8 months. It is a little tough because it addresses EVERY puppy, not MINI puppies. So, if you have an extra small breed pet, find a decent brand like Royal Canin MINI Baby Dog Food 30 while it develops stronger teeth to chew on Blue Buffalo puppy food. Blue Buffalo is better than Royal Canin. However, you have to make sure your puppy is ABLE to chew on his kibble so that it does not get malnourished from eating to little. Once your puppy grows strong enough to chew on Blue Buffalo, switch him/her. It is simply the best.

review/text: I just fed my 12 week old "Shinarian" puppy this mixing it with 1/4 Blue Buffalo and 3/4's Royal Canin Mini Puppy, and he seems to love the new Blue Buffalo! I've never seen him so excited with the taste and smell. I gave him a few pieces of the Blue Buffalo chicken and oatmeal to see if he would eat it, and he gobbled it up "nom nom" real quick! I will be switching from Royal Canin to this because of nutritional benefits of Blue Buffalo. Also it is considerably less expensive than Royal Canin. (15 lb bag Royal Canin = $41.99 @ $2.80/lb, while 15 lb bag Blue Buffalo = $30.99 @ $2.06/lb!) save almost a dollar a pound, and get better quality dog food!!!

review/text: Okay... first thing's first... You know the food is legit when there are ants all over the box that the food bag was shipped in, from it being at the front door of your house after a couple hours. lol Normally, people wouldn't like this but... dang... the dog food bag didn't even have a tiny hole in it! lol Those ants smelled it from a mile away! I suggest opening the box outside! :P<br /><br />Second... my puppy Chewie is an extremely picky eater! I was originally using the Science Diet, but after some research, I found that this brand is crap. Plus, with my dog Chewie not eating, I had to find something that tasted better! Needless to say, Chewie LOVES the taste of it. I have no idea how I am going to gradually change his diet because he is not eating the Science Diet brand anymore. He picks out the Blue Buffalo brand and eats only that!<br /><br />Thirdly, the smell of the Blue Buffalo brand smells so much more natural! I can tell that my two dogs are getting the correct nutrients just by how it smells compared to the Science Diet!<br /><br />So far, I love this dog food. I will update this review with more information on how it reacts to both of my dog's stomach! :)

After a lot of research, I felt like Blue was the best choice, and once I got it and fed it to my dog, I think she would agree, lol.  When I first starting mixing the Iams with Blue, she picked out every piece of Blue and left the Iams behind in her bowl.  You would think the poor thing was starving to death by how fast she eats this dog food. She loves it!  Not to mention, because it doesn't have a bunch of unnecessary fillers in it, you don't have to feed them as much to get the nutrients they need.  So overall, it's also much more cost effective and I know she's getting everything she needs.

review/summary: Great food for my chihuahua/poodle cross.
review/text: When I brought home my chihuahua/poodle cross, I had her on Iams. A couple weeks down the road and she had a hypoglycemia attack. I ended up switching her food to Royal Canin, the same thing happened. Natural Choice, same thing. Part of the issue was that she didn't really like any of the food and mostly picked at it, though she seemed to be eating enough. I finally splurged and got Blue Buffalo. I could NOT be happier. She has gone 6 months without a single hypoglycemia attack. She loves her food and I am currently transitioning her to the adult food. I switched my cat from Iams (which she had been on for 2 years) to Blue Buffalo and her coat is shinier than ever and her temperament has been amazing. We've never seen her so perky and happy. Thank you blue!

review/summary: Call It Stinky Dog
review/text: My puppy has eaten three different main dog foods and at least half dozen different treats and this breath NEVER smelled.<br /><br />I transitioned him to Small Breed Puppy<br />Chicken & Oatmeal and after about a week his breath was foul!  My wife won't pick him up any more because of it.  I smell him around his head area and it almost oozes from his pores.  Had his teeth checked and they are fine.<br /><br />I'm dropping the food and looking for something else for small breed puppies.  He also doesn't eat the black bits so that's a waste of money right there.

review/summary: Don't be fooled by EntirelyPets $2.99 Price for these!
review/text: I ordered three sets of these from EntirelyPets.  I even called them to confirm that the $2.99 price was in fact for 24 of these and was told YES.  When my order arrived, it had only one per set, not 24.  They keep changing their price here from $2.99 with $5.98 shipping to $66.00 with free shipping.  It seems like a bait and switch to get more orders because if you look at their reviews, you'll find that others also purchased these for $2.99 for 24 and received only one.  I even called to confirm and was told I'd get what is stated, yet I didn't.  When I followed up with them after receiving my order, I was told it was a "price mistake". When a vendor keeps making the same "pricing mistake" over and over, you have to start to wonder if it's a mistake or a bait and switch.  The item is fine, but not worth $2.99 plus $5.98 shipping for ONE, especially when the site specifically states that it is for 24 and even their own customer service stated I would receive 24 per set ordered.  I am submitting this review to warn others and to highlight to Amazon what EntirelyPets is doing.

review/summary: Great long-lasting chew - even for small dogs!
review/text: Though Merrick's website says this treat is for large dogs I totally disagree.  I recently bought one for my 13.5-pound dog and he LOVES it!  Though the treat is large it's very lightweight.  My dog never finishes a chew in one sitting since he has several bully sticks going at any particular time. This one will definitely be around for a while.  I feel it's worth every penny!

review/text: The first review of this offends my little chi/terrier's senses.  He LOVES this thing (even though it's a bit gross) and can carry it just fine across the room, into his crate, onto the bed.  In fact, now that I think about it, it's light enough (it's very light!) that a teacup could probably carry it/drag it around, too.  Don't underestimate the little dogs!  A perfect treat for any dog.

review/summary: Bait and switch tatics
review/text: Today is July 11,2012, and They are still wording ads like they are  having a huge sale. Again they used the excuse it was a pricing mistake. Same mistake seems to be happening for quite awhile and has never been fixed. In fact, some one takes the time to change the price up and down almost daily a few cents either way.<br /> Seems to me if it was a real , HONEST mistake then it would have been corrected the first time. not just keep adjusting the price.<br /> I  received 3 moozles for the price of $22  plus postage which brought the total to $27 for the moozles.<br />I also bought  snozzles and they charged me more for the postage ( $11 ) then the item it self cost.<br /><br />As for the items them selves. My dogs do like them. I get the moozles for the dobie and the snozzles  for the min pins. They do like both items.  Items themselves are great.<br /> Just the sellers not so much. so they only got a 3 rating<br /><br />BUYER  BEWARE

review/summary: $2.99 ea?
review/text: I'm still trying to figure out what people are saying here. 24 moozles at $66 = $2.75 ea. And yes that is each. But even at $2.99 each, that's a deal compared to what I pay at my local pet supply. It's $3.99 each there. So if I buy the 24 at $2.75, that's a savings of $1.24 ea even before taxes. Humn $1.24 x 24 = $29.76. Don't know where everyone has been shopping, but if you can find me a better deal, let me know. As soon as I get an extra $66, I'm biting on it - so to speak.

review/text: Wow, this is really great coffee.  I generally like strong brews from Diedrich, Peets and Starbucks (and Timothy for the KCup) and was kind of reluctant to try this one as many brands end up being too weak or bitter for me. The Camano Island Brazil Dark Roast is finely ground and makes a strong cup of coffee that isn't bitter at all.  Plus, its organic! I have added this to my subscribe and save and the price is unbelievable for the quality.  I enjoy it every bit as much as my usual brands, even more right now since its my new discovery.

review/text: While I can't define why I find myself addicted to this coffee I evidently am. I have been a heavy coffee drinker for 50 years and used to drink some coffees that today I would call swill but not this one. I ran out not long ago and had to drink a store bought brand and was getting desparate when my Camano Brazilian arrived.<br /><br />I find it to be a very smooth satisfying taste without needing the sharp bite and almost burnt smokey taste of some coffees. I also can drink it all day without acid reflex which seems to be true with most organic coffees.<br /><br />This is the first coffee I have ever signed up for auto shipping on and contrary to some other reviews I love the way it is packaged so I only have to open a pound at a time and of course I like the fact that is fair trade.

review/text: There are reviews here that rave about this coffee.  I don't find myself raving.  It is good coffee, and it has no bitterness, I truly appreciate this.  Is it amazing and am I hooked for life?  No.  It is good.  I live in a rural area and have limited access to exceptional coffee, this made me curious to try this.  But it is only a bit better than the grocery store coffee I have purchased.  It is organic and fair trade and these are selling points for me.  I found the packaging curious, a thin sealed plastic bag inside of a brown paper bag, I felt that it could have lost some of its amazing-ness by not being properly airtight.  It had absolutely no aroma upon opening.  Odd.  Once again, it is good coffee and no bitterness is evident, but my praise ends there.

Had to buy a billion other garbage flavors in order to get the watermelon. Now, thanks to me doing a lil' hunt (and recently having quit smoking), I've gotten my hands on them.<br /><br />Worth every penny, and then some. Such a rush that these little pieces of sugar bring me to my knees, every time! Either you like them or you don't. No sense in trying to convince people of buying a product they don't want.

review/summary: Jolly Rancher Twist Watermelon 160 Piece Box
review/text: ASIN B0014C2JFC - I'm copying this from my review of another listing for the exact same item because they're EXACTLY THE SAME!<br /><br />One of the original Jolly Rancher flavors, and a lifelong favorite around here, the 160 piece box is something I generally pick up locally to avoid the shipping charges that come with ordering online. To make sure you get the best price on Amazon, take the time to do a search because there are several listings and the prices vary.<br /><br />From the crinkle of the plastic wrapper as you open it to the last tiny sliver of mouth-watering flavor, everything about these candies is a flawless-summer-day-in-childhood memory for me. The flavoring is stronger than an actual watermelon and you can smell them before you open them - so don't keep them close at hand unless you're willing to give in to temptation! There's about 24 calories in a candy and, because they're yummy, I use them rather than cough drops for fighting off that dry mouth, throat-tickling cough. Any excuse!<br /><br />Also see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ES40MM">JOLLY RANCHER WATERMELON-160 PIECE BOX</a>. Is 160 pieces not enough?

review/summary: Poorly Described Item
review/text: I want to clarify that this review is more about the description and confusion over the product than the quality of the product. I did not realize that this item actually involves 9 jars of honey. Even though there is a "3 Pack" sign at the top - it gets confusing when you read the 3 - 3 ounce jars. I made the mistake of assuming the 3 pack was referring to the 3 jars in one pack. I suppose the price should have lead me to question it. Admittedly my mistake and maybe someone else is smarter. But for those who are not very used to ordering in packs - please note that this 1 item involves 9 jars of honey: 3 separate packs of 3, 3 ounce jars! What you see in the picture is just 1 pack. So, the picture is misleading as well. And this item wont return (because it is a grocery item). So be careful when ordering. I am sitting with 18 jars of honey (because I needed 6 and thought I was ordering exactly that when I ordered 2 of these items) - instead I got 2 times 9 jars.

review/summary: Fine taste at an everyday price
review/text: I have tried every tea commercially available, at every price point.  I have even received tea directly from China.  But, for consistent quality and fine taste, every single day, nothing beats Taylors of Harrogate and my favorite of their many excellent teas is Pure Assam.<br /><br />Taylors was founded in London in 1886 and today is the largest family-owned tea and coffee business in the UK.  Not only do they get their leaves from original sources in Asia and Africa, but they run a model business that gives back through a variety of worthy charities and has been repeatedly named among the top 100 companies to work for.  It is no wonder that their tea is so fine.<br /><br />Best of all is its price.  You can get more expensive and fancier tea (I've done it!) but you cannot get better tea.

review/text: I love, love, love Assam Tea and have now tried 3 different brands.<br /><br />Taylors of Harrogate is, by far, the best tasting Assam that I have tried AND at about a third of the price of allot of brands.<br /><br />In case you haven't tried Assam Tea, do yourself a favor and try some of this.<br /><br />Assam has a bold, yet not harsh taste and none the the acidity that a bold tea sometimes has.<br /><br />Assam is very good tea at any time of the day.<br /><br />"Once I had Assam, I have been spoiled to drink any other tea and once I had Taylors of Harrogate, I have been spoiled to any other brand of Assam".

review/summary: Excellen black tea, plain no milk or surgar
review/text: A good cup of tea in the afternoon to me is a bit of heaven.  My old standby for years has been Tetley's British Blend.  I then spent a month in Egypt, where they love their tea.  I came away craving Lipton Yellow Label loose tea, which seemed to be a favorite in Egypt.  The Yellow Label's a bit on the strong side so I usually add a bit of sugar.  Then one day,I found a unopened pouch of Taylor's Pure Assam Tea on the window sill.  My wife goes out with her girl friends to these decadent over priced tea houses where they have tea, sweets and plenty of gossip.  Well the pouch of Taylors had arrived via one of those tea houses.  Actually it had been on that window sill for at least a month before I somehow of other decided to try it.  Boy, talk about surprised, it was really good, no milk, no sugar, just tea.  It had all the qualities of a perfect tea, just strong enough, taste was of that magical flavor that has tea the choice of billions of people around the world.  This was one of the best teas I had ever tasted.

They sell enough of it that I have never had a stale box of Taylor's tea delivered.<br /><br />As I mentioned in the other review, their consistency is remarkable; the next box tastes just as I remembered the last box.<br /><br />I keep my teas as fresh as possible; for me it really makes a difference.<br /><br />Pricier than some, but worth the difference.

review/text: If this was sold as an ordinary black tea, I would say that is good. The general tea quality is somewhere in the class of some of Tetley and Twinings teas. But when I compare it with the average assam tea I can get from Indian food shop this tea is not so good. It is too bitter, smell is weak and colour of it does not match the true assam tea colour. At the moment I'm preparing it as a indian milk tea, in that way is drinkable.<br />Pity.

review/text: I bought this honey because I had recently been reading about the benefits of raw versus processed honey. As soon as I opened the package I tried a spoonful, and noticed that the taste wasn't as strong as the processed honeys I have tried, which is a huge plus. I usually can't handle the strength of honey, so I don't use it often, but this I could see using every day. The downside was the price. The jar is fairly priced (compared to the other raw honeys) but the 7 dollars and some-odd cents for shipping makes me take away a star. Overall, I would recommend this honey, at least to try.

According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

review/text: I am the companion to a small dog of unknown age and breed who has been troubled with a tender tummy for a few years.  Her vet has tons of medications to give her, but I don't need any of them since I tried the Wellness brand dry dog food and the moist.<br /><br />All her problems gave gone away.  It is amazing.  She has not been to the vet since her last yearly checkup.

review/summary: Fantastic Dog food!
review/text: I have the pickiest eater in the world! He loves it.<br />Gilbert (cockapoo), also had stomach issues. I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!

review/summary: So far, so good.
review/text: We have been feeding our 3 year old fussy Italian Greyhound this for about 2 years now and it's one of the few canned dog foods he likes. It think it's the sweet potato. Hopefully, it's healthy for hims as well.

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)
