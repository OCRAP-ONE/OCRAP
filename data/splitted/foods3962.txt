review/summary: Alvita Senna Tea Bags
review/text: I love this tea and drink it all the time. The taste is very nice and I do not even have to sweeten it or use lemon, as it has an almost sweet taste all it's own. I take alot of medicine and have much trouble with my bowels. When I drink 2 cups of your Senna tea I am opened up within 2 hours.<br />Thank you very much, I would not use that much laxative.<br /><br />Pat Kamadulski

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

review/summary: Light flavored tea
review/text: I got this tea because it is supposed to help with PMS and supposedly helps "prepare" the uterus for conception. I figured it can't hurt, so why not? I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br /><br />As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.

review/summary: A great product, you must try!
review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

review/text: My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.

review/summary: Good Things Come in Stinky Packages
review/text: I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/summary: Fenugreek Seed Tea
review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

If you eat out, you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in, and you do not have to worry about missing a dose.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: The tea has a mild, pleasant flavor and is easy to combine with others, without overpowering the mix. I've just moved to a new town, and I don't know where to look for the teas I need. Buying online saved me a lot of headaches. The boxes I ordered arrived promptly.

review/summary: Interesting taste
review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

review/summary: Saw this on Dr. OZ for eliminating crows feet
review/text: I watched Dr. OZ on television and he was explaining how to minimize and/or avoid crows feet. His advice? Drinking Fenugreek tea, taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights' sleep (6 hour min.). Well, I am going to give it a shot. This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually. I wasn't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon. Seems they have everything!

review/summary: Sage Tea helps with night sweats
review/text: I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/text: Jusr received this item...  Opened the package, and was terribly dissapointed.  It does not taste like or smell like smoked paprika.  I have been using smoked paprika in my cooking for years, this is not it.  This tastes and smells just like regular paprika.  Could I of gotten the wrong product?  the bottle is labeled smoked, but I am not sure what their idea of smoke is... McCormick knows what smoked paprika is, although expensive.  I thought this was too good for the money.  I guess you get what you pay for, and I paid too much here for regular paprika.  Of course this is no reflection on Amazon, still my favorite place to shop.

review/text: I had tried every store and warehouse clubs in our area and could not find the Smoked Sweet Paprika. I gave homemade cookbooks to friends for Christmas and one of my recipes called for 1 cup of Smoked Sweet Paprika. Everyone was waiting for the book because of the BBQ ribs recipe and it called for the spice. For 4 months I looked for it. The sauce requires a cup of smoked sweet paprika. I was so thankful that I could give not only the cook book but the valuable spice that went with it as part of their Christmas Present. With instructions where to buy the spice the next time they needed it... SOOO Thankyou Amazon for helping me find that perfect last minute gift for my friends....<br />,

review/text: These ruined my dinner.  I bought these croutons for a special poultry dish. The croutons smelled "off" when I first open the bags (I bought two), but I didn't think anything about it.  However, when I tried a couple, they left a really bad after-taste. The expiration date was okay; I thought maybe it was just a different type of seasoning and proceeded to use them in my dish.<br />However, when I served my guests, some took a few bites and didn't touch it again, filling up on the bread and side dishes.  After one bite, I was disgusted with the taste, which was definitely the croutons, but much more potent--they took over the dish! I took the unused portion of the 2nd bag and took it back to the grocery store for a refund.  I must have gotten a bad batch, but won't buy them again.

review/summary: Refreshing, fruity and amazing!
review/text: Out of the gold foil package, this matcha smells amazingly fruity. Super fruit amazing! The smell reminds me of really tarty berry yogurt. Brazilian Acai matcha appears slightly darker in powder form.<br /><br />I prepared this as a traditional hot cup. This matcha didn't froth up very well nor maintain froth, but I didn't really care. Interestingly, this matcha prepared has a different colour than normal, a dark forest green, probably from the acai berry powder. By the way, I used 1/4tsp plus 175f water.<br /><br />The taste of  Brazilian Acai matcha is quite fruity. A mix between a tropical flavor and blackberries or blueberries. There is also a natural sweetness to this matcha - adding any additional sweetener would be overkill I think. With the fruityness and natural sweetness, this hot cup is very refreshing! There is no tart or bitterness to this matcha! I honestly was expected this to taste tart or puckery.<br /><br />In the end, this was surprisingly good! Is this matcha totally cheating with getting a double whammy of healthy energizing matcha and acai? Don't pass up this matcha - I'm thinking this is up there on being one of my fav flavors from Red Leaf Teas!

review/text: Okay, so, fair warning. I'm not overly familiar with the acai berry or how it should taste. I've had acai berry/blueberry juice before, and loved it, so I'm hoping I'll love the berry on its own. Of course now, all I can think of when it comes to this tea is RuPaul's Drag Race with all the different queens trying to say "acai" for a TV commercial. It's like the Pink Dragonfruit from Tealish. I've never had dragonfruit, but it smelled amazing and so I tried it and I loved it. Now I'm on the hunt for an actual dragonfruit to try. So while I can tell if I like the tea and if it tastes good or not, I have no real way to tell if it tastes like the actual fruit at all. But that's okay! Everyone should be open to new experiences, and I am looking forward to this one.<br /><br />Okay, yum! It's kind of like blueberry on steroids? I don't know, it's got this amazing berry flavor with a round tartness....yes, round. It was the word that came to mind as I sipped it. It's just...lovely and unexpected. The flavor is very bold and very...unique. I don't quite know how to describe it, but I liked it. I definitely want to try more acai flavored things if this is what I have to look forward to! I'm not sure if I need to restock on this ASAP, but it's definitely in the running for my must-have list.

review/summary: Great Sticks; Packaging So-So
review/text: I don't buy these Macy's Cheese Sticks often, but it seems as if there are changes to the packaging each time.  The last time I had bought a supply, I was put off by the fact that the entire shipment was exceptionally dry and the "Melting Parmesan" was more like "Crunchy Crackly Whatsit".  This shipment (and I trust that the other 11 boxes are the same) was truly what it claimed (a pleasure).  On the other hand, the packaging wasn't up to par.  Many products today use a laudable packaging technique which provides the buyer with a means of locking the package closed, and this package is no exception.  Except that the Cheese Sticks package doesn't accomplish that which may have been intended.  I'm compelled to use a paper clip or rubber band if I want the package to remain closed.

review/text: I've tried many different vegetarian broths over the last 3 years and McKay's brand is, by far, the best! I have both the chicken and beef style and use them frequently. I highly recommend these products. I was able to find these products easily at local health food stores for a VERY affordable price. I recently made french onion soup with the beef style broth and it was impressive! A definate upside to buying the powder is you can make the broth as weak or strong as you'd like. Only 1 tsp per cup! It's MUCH cheaper than buying canned broth.

review/text: McKay's offers 3 different chicken versions;  msg, no msg, and vegan.  The item pictured is the no-msg variety, which is not vegan.  The vegan product says "vegan" in the spot where this one says "no msg".  Don't buy this if you want vegan. I believe this is an Amazon error in confusing two similar products. I find the msg most flavorful, then the no msg, then the vegan, but I like them all.  I am averaging the 5 star flavor with 1 star inaccurate description as anyone wanting vegan would not consider the other products acceptable.

review/text: I have purchased this same product from a couple of different places and find that each time I order it, the flavor is different and the texture of the honey is different.  Sometimes it is more crystalized and sometimes more paste like and very thick.  To soften, I microwave the bottle w/o the lid for about 20 sec. on high and it allows me to take a knife to it and mix it so that it is more spreadable.  I like the strong flavor whether consistant or not....

review/summary: So much better to grow your own!
review/text: The tiny little containers of wheat grass / cat grass that you see in the grocery stores and pet stores (ranging in price from $2.99 to $6.99!) are ridiculous, when you can get this 5 pound bucket for $15 or so and have it last for a long time.  I purchased The Sprout House Hard Wheat for Wheatgrass Sprouting Seeds about a month ago, and I can already see this is going to last me for awhile.  I have a recycled wheatgrass container from one of those grocery stores, and each batch takes less than 1/4 cup of wheat grass seeds to grow the same amount.  I'm literally growing the same amount of grass for pennies.  It's so easy to grow this for my cats, that I'm thinking about buying a manual juicer and growing some for us as well!<br /><br />The only down-side to this bucket is how hard it was to get the lid off!  But the opposite point is that it closes VERY securely, so you can be assured of keeping your seeds dry and free from contaminants.<br /><br />All around, I find this an excellent purchase and if / when I run out, I'll be sure to order from The Sprout House again!

review/summary: Perfect for Cat (or People) Grass!
review/text: Prior to purchasing a five pound bucket of The Sprout House's Hard Wheat Organic Sprouting Seeds, I was paying roughly half as much for five meager ounces of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HAVPLO">Petlinks System Nibble-Licious Seeds</a>, which I had very little luck growing.  At that price per ounce, it certainly didn't leave much room for experimentation, much less perfecting cat grass based growing techniques.<br /><br />After purchasing five pounds of organic seeds from The Sprout House, I know how to grow wheatgrass like a champ and still have at least four pounds of seeds left.  The method that works best for me is to soak the seeds overnight in a mason jar (with a homemade sprouting lid), completely drain the jar the next morning and then rinse the seeds every few hours until they've sprouted nicely.  At that point, I put a very shallow layer (about half an inch) of organic soil in a seed tray, layer the sprouted seeds on top, moisten the soil and seeds, cover with a sheet or two of wet newspaper & make sure the soil and paper stay damp (but not overly wet).  In a few days, the grass is high enough to push the newspaper off, at which point, I let it have ambient light.  In a few more days, I've got a thick (and gorgeous), miniature lawn for my cats to graze on.<br /><br />I only use about 3/4 cup of seeds for a seed tray that's roughly 10" x 21", so it's obviously a lot of grass for the money (especially given the insane cost of pre-grown cups of cat grass sold in pet stores).  My point is that even if you don't have a green thumb or have been put off by the thought of growing your own cat grass (or people grass), five pounds of seeds will be enough to prove how easy and cost effective it is to grow yourself.<br /><br />And yes, the bucket is awkward and hard to open, but there isn't any law that says you have to keep these seeds in the bucket.

review/summary: Wheatgrass, Natures Finest Medicine, but look close
review/text: The 2 star rating is because what you appear to see is not what you will receive, unless someone has started to make a less than 1 gallon container that looks exactly like a 5 gallon container, I have never seen one but I suppose it is possible. What you appear to see is a 5 gallon container, so please look close before you buy. I have been buying Hard Winter Wheat seeds for YEARS. The container displayed for this item appears, especially when compared to others selling a 5 gallon containers of Wheatgrass seeds, to be a 5 gallon pail. yet with this item you get only 5 pounds. 5 pounds of hard wheat seeds will not even come close to filling a 5 gallon pail. Every time I have bought a 5 gallon container of Wheatgrass Seeds it has had 35 pounds of Wheatgrass seeds in it, NOT 5 POUNDS. The Sprout House may very well have a high quality seed, but deceiving the buying public, in my opinion, is wrong and needs to be revealed, hopefully before even one person is deceived. If you search for hard wheat seed on Amazon you will see other companies selling containers that look EXACTLY like this one that contain 35 and not 5 pounds of seed, and the cost per pound is much closer to what it should be than this 5 pound container is. Maybe this was an honest mistake and not intentional. If that is the case, I am sure the mistake will be corrected. If I see that it is corrected I will modify or delete this review. But PLEASE, always do your research before you buy so what you expect to receive is what you do receive.
