review/summary: Outstanding
review/text: After loads of breakfast blends and ordinary mixes it's kind of nice when the seasonal stuff roles out. This is a great combination of pumpkin and spices. I've had several samples from local coffee shops and this is as good if not better. Taste is a very particular thing, but I'll give it five stars because it's among the best K-Cups I've tried yet.<br /><br />Enjoy

review/summary: A favorite for me
review/text: I absolutely love the convenience of K-cups and Pumpkin Spice is a favorite flavor of mine by Green Mountain coffee.  It's not always in stock so if you think you might want it, grab it before it's gone.  The price will vary on it as well, so as a general rule the closer you can get to thirty dollars on a 50 pack for k-cups the better.  I scored mine for thirty-one dollars.  There is a good spice flavor with the pumpkin and it goes well with my efforts to eliminate sugar from my coffee.  I'm just trying to enjoy the natural flavors with a hint of milk.  This is a great flavor for that goal.

review/summary: LOVE THIS COFFEE!
review/text: I just tried this coffee in the Keurig edition while waiting for my car to be repaired and, being the pumpkin coffee junkie that I am, well, temptation just provided me with a new favorite! This coffee has just the right amount of spice - not too heavy or too light, and just makes the perfect cup. Don't try Millstone's - yuck! Had SO much troule just choking that one down. This one, hands down, is my favorite flavored coffee of all time now. I just ordered 3 bags of the ground on Green Mountain's website since Amazon didn't have it. If you call Green Mountain, you'll find out that this is their NUMBER 1 selling flavored coffee. Highly, highly, highly recommend!

review/summary: Lacking in Flavor, not what I remember!
review/text: I normally love Green Mountain's flavored coffees-- I buy them almost exclusively. I was very excited to see the Pumpkin Spice flavor back for the year so I eagerly bought them. The first time I made it, I thought I accidentally reused the K-cup because it tasted so watered down. I tried again and again, and every cup is the same. It smells great and has some pumpkin flavor, but it is not strong enough because my coffee has never tasted so watered down before. I have to add quite a bit of creamer and sugar to hide it.<br /><br />I haven't had this problem with my Keurig before or since. I am still going to go through my 18-pack, but I don't think I will be buying these again. Hopefully next fall's batch will be better!

review/text: Every year I stock up on this coffee. I usually like pretty bold coffees but, although this one isn't bold, it has the perfect pumpkin & spices flavor. I can't get enough of it. It's, by far, the best pumpkin coffee around! I've tried many. Some stores have it on their shelves- like the one that sells bath & bedding items that has a twenty percent off coupon that never expires. ;)

review/text: I am not sure how I am going to write 20 words about this - it is good coffee and I enjoy drinking it. I even drank it during the spring, which is not the usual time to be drinking this autumn-like beverage. It does not taste as good as a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks (what does? those are so good!), but it is an improvement over standard coffee for when you want something different in my opinion. I am happy I bought this and would recommend it.

Some of the other pumpkin spice flavored K-cups that I have tried smelled really nice, but had absolutely no flavor.  This one fills the kitchen with that spicy aroma and has a full flavor!  I even run through a 2nd shot on smaller cup size.  It has that much flavor!

review/text: I really enjoy pumpkin coffee, even in May.  I love that I can order it from Amazon when I cannot find it in any stores.  In fact, I've started ordering all of my k-cups from Amazon since it is so much more convenient than running around trying to find what I want then standing in line.  I think it's a better deal, too.  This Pumpkin Spice is a mild roast and is not as rich as some other coffees I like but it certainly does the trick.

review/summary: Love this flavor!
review/text: I absolutely adore this flavor. Not only do you get a nice amount of pumpkin spice flavor per cup, but it keeps rather well- meaning that you can continue to enjoy this flavor even after other places stop carrying the fresh brewed stuff that they make themselves.<br /><br />OK, the basics of this are good. You've got a decent coffee bean base and as long as you don't add too much water, you can have a decently strong cup of coffee without it being too watery. (Unfortunately one of the problems with the Keurigs is that you have to measure the water to your personal preferences, otherwise you get an overly watery cup of whatever you're brewing.) The spice flavor is not only nice, but it isn't overwhelming. You can still taste the coffee over the spice, which is something that occasionally bugs me about some of the other flavors out there on the market. (Such as the Dunkin Donuts Strawberry Shortcake blend. Blech.)<br /><br />Would this replace a cup of freshly brewed Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, or WaWa coffee completely? Not really. It's good and I'll definitely purchase this stuff again when I see it, but it doesn't completely replace the stuff that you can brew in a bigger coffee pot. Like most Keurig products, this is ultimately a product of convenience. It's delicious and worth buying in my humble opinion, but it still won't replace "the good stuff".

This blew my mind! I'm in heaven and now back to order several boxes to tide me over before its gone. As for my search for my regular coffee Caribou Mahogany soooooooo good. Also, using amazon prime, I have my orders in 2 days, and save more than at a grocery store (which carries no selection).

review/text: Green mountain got it right this time! This is one of my favorite k cup flavors and the aroma is amazing. Just like dunkin donuts pumpkin spice coffee but way cheaper to brew at home. I am sad this is a seasonal flavor because I would drink this all year round! Way to go green mountain you found the perfect mix of pumpkin and spice and it is not overwhelming with the spice like all other pumpkin spice products I have tried!

review/summary: Smooth and spicy with light pumpkin flavor
review/text: The scent of nutmeg and cinnamon waft from the cup as the Keurig brews a fast rich cup of pumpkin spice coffee that satisfies my craving for a fall favorite that is great for home brewing when I cannot get to my favorite coffee house.  This will be on my seasonal rotation as it is a satisfying cup of spicy pumpkin flavored coffee that doesn't overwhelm the palate and doesn't taste artificial like I feared it would. It tastes best with 6 oz. of water and some milk and sugar added to taste.  I hope Green Mt. Coffee never stops making this blend!

review/summary: Odd taste--
review/text: I can definitely taste the "spice" in this pumpkin spice flavor, but I had tried two k-cups from this batch and could barely finish the cup.  There is an odd taste to the spice which I can't pinpoint.... even when choosing the right size cup, it still tastes like watered spice barely any pumpkin and even with the help of cream and sugar, I still can't get this to taste good enough for me to finish a whole cup.  This is for my family a wasted purchase as it will just probably end up sitting in the box for a very long time, if I don't throw it out before then.

review/summary: One of my favorite new k-cups this year!
review/text: I'm still sadden by how they only sell this in most stores from october through december. Thankfully Amazon does it year round! I have yet to buy it on here, but because it's $15 for a package of 24 (WAY cheaper than anything in store!), I'm willing to try soon from here.<br /><br />Enough about the price... lets talk about the taste!<br /><br />I'm very iffy about flavored coffee. Actually I'm VERY picky about flavored coffee lol I only drink vanilla or something without flavor. I've tried chocolate, gives me headaches. I've tried raspberry, gives me stomach aches. Hazelnuts, sometimes works but depends on the brand.<br /><br />But this, pumpkin coffee, is awesome! I've tried the actual one you can get at Starbucks and this taste almost identical to the $8 medium size ones you can buy! Even better, you don't have to leave your friggin' house to drive for a cup lol Ahh the beauty of keuring :)

review/summary: Its Pumpkin
review/text: We absolutely LOVE our Keurig.  I find myself drinking more coffee throught the day because it is so fast.  That being said, I like the Pumkin Spice coffee as a Fall seasonal item, but it seems to become available a little to late in the Fall.  So I make sure there is a little extra leftover from the previous year.  The biggest downside for me is that this coffee is weaker than most k-cups. I make a medium instead of a large.  My wife will combine a medium Pumkin Spice and a medium Green Mountain to get her desired taste. Smaller cups of coffee and having to mix coffee together really adds to the per cup cost too. But overall the flavor is good and has a nice pumpkin taste.

Could be spicier, could be more pumpkin-like, could be creamier, but all in all, a flavor I enjoy and would order again if offered at other times during the year.

This coffee is enjoyable and has a very nice flavor. I find I stock up in the fall and try to make it last through the year. This is a light to medium roast coffee with a spicy, fall flavor. If you look for a coffee that does not have that burned dark roast flavor this is worth trying.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I've had my Keurig for about two years now, and I usually only use it to make regular black unflavored coffee or iced tea.  My husband knew how much I loved pumpkin spice lattes from Starbucks though, so he ordered me a case of this thinking it was the same thing.  I usually never drink flavored coffee (flavored lattes are okay in my book, but flavored coffee weirds me out mostly), however I was pleasantly surprised by this coffee.  It doesn't smell or taste artificial like I usually think flavored coffee does.  I think it tastes great black (for all you Janeway types out there) but it's also not bad with a splash of cream and sugar.  In fact, with some warm milk and a spoonful of sugar added to it, it sometimes saves me from taking a trip to Starbucks to get one of those pumpkin spice lattes.  Even if you usually shy away from flavored coffee, I recommend giving Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice Coffee a chance.  Your kitchen will smell fabulous after you brew a cup too!

Besides the taste the ethics of this company is admirable. They support fair trade and donate 5% of their profits to socially and environmentally responsible causes. Which is another reason to buy this coffee.

review/summary: My favorite flavor so far...
review/text: I received a Keurig machine for my birthday last month. I have tried so many types of k-cups I've lost count! But, the Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice is one I'm sticking with. I wish it was offered year round, because when I run out; I am really going to miss it! It may not be an extra bold flavor, but it is full of flavor when used on the 6 ounce setting. I've been using two teaspoons of non-flavored liquid creamer and one teaspoon of sugar to a 6 ounce cup, and it tastes really good! It's the closest thing to a pumpkin spice latte I can make in the comfort of my own home. As a person who is relatively new to Keurig, I have learned that it is best to use exact measurements with cream and sugar, so you can figure out exactly how you like it and stick with it, so you can have a perfect cup of coffee every time. I should also mention that I do not normally like flavored coffees, but I love this one!

review/summary: Delicious, but cheaper elsewhere...
review/text: These are my favorite K-cups by far.  I stock up every fall so that they will last me the whole year.  But, save your money and buy them at Bed Bath and Beyond.  They're $11.99 for 18 cups there, and you can use a 20 percent off coupon to make them even cheaper...

review/summary: Weak.  Odd "spice".
review/text: One of the weakest KCup varieties I've tried.  It was like drinking spiced water.  No creaminess at all.  The spice is also a little off - very clove-y.  Brewed on the smallest setting it's drinkable but definitely not what I was hoping for.

review/summary: If you like this coffee that's fine and good. I didn't.
review/text: If you like this coffee that's fine and good. I didn't.<br />Pumpkin Spice Limited Edition on the box it states "A delicious coffee enhanced by the creamy pumpkin spice flavors of autumn."<br />"Where's the Pumpkin"<br />"Where's the Creamy"<br />"Where's the Spice Flavors of Autumn"<br />All I found was a very weak, cup of  "coffee"??<br />I tried 8oz then 6oz. It wasn't a good cup of coffee.<br />My wife didn't like it at all either<br />I tried cream,..... sugar,..... and cream and sugar.<br />I love most of my K cups and some not so much, but this one not at all<br />I had Pumpkin Spice at Hyatt Place in Hendersonville, TN and WOW it was so good,<br />so I order this thinking, just a little like Hyatt would be great. The closest it came to Hyatt's was Hyatt's water fountain<br />If GMC feels that I may have got a bad box - I would try a sample cup of what they feel is a good one.<br />I love Amazon just not this item

review/text: I look forward to buying these every year and what a let down this years shipment was.These make a very weak cup of coffee with just a faint hint of pumpkin spice. Shame on you Green Mountain. Not up to the standards i thought your company had.

review/summary: What happened to Pumpkin Spice?
review/text: [[ASIIN:B007PA32L2 Green Mountain Coffee, Pumpkin Spice K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers, 50 count]]<br />I am so very disappointed in the lack of flavor and aroma in the new packaging of the Pumpkin spice K-cup packs.<br />The packaging is different and it says "light roast".  This is definately not the same coffee that I've enjoyed so much over the last 2 years. I really hope they bring back the original flavor!!! What a shame!!!

review/summary: Pumpkin Spice is NOT nice!
review/text: My husband brought home a pumpkin spice k-cup for me to try. I was excited, as I love pretty much anything pumpkin. One sip of this, and I nearly gagged! It was so awful! Whatever spices they use to flavor this are way too overpowering. My husband thought I was over reacting and he took a sip and choked too! It really is one of the worst flavored coffees I have ever had. I would rate it a 0 if I could.

review/summary: Green Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice for Keurig Brewers
review/text: Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice K-cups only come out once a year usually in the fall. This is a favorite for me and my husband. I like to add some coffee creamer and a couple splenda or a little sugar.  Doing that turns a simple cup of coffee into a wonderful treat.  It's like having guilt free pumpkin pie!! You should defiantly try Pumpkin Spice K-cups when they are available.

review/summary: very disappointed
review/text: I was so excited for the return of Green Mountain's pumpkin spice K-cups this fall, but when I received my large order of pumpkin spice k-cups, I found the coffee to be much weaker and thinner than I remembered last year.  It had been a wonderful rich, full bodied coffee and now I'm stuck with boxes of weak, thin coffee.  Save your money or try before you buy - it's not the same.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I was apprehensive of buying a flavord coffee, I had a bad run-in with a cinnamon flavored coffee recently. This pumpkin spice coffee is very tasty. It smells good and it leaves my dorm room with a plesant aroma. The only downside to this coffee is it is a very light roast.

review/summary: More "spice" than "pumpkin"
review/text: For years I've been buying pumpkin flavored coffee beans every fall from the coffee shop in my local Borders. Its a flavor I look forward to every year! Well, Borders closed, but we just got our Keurig machine so I was excited to try the pumpkin spice flavor from Green Mountain.  The flavor is disappointing to this pumpkin fan, though.  It is very heavy on the spice; the pumpkin flavor is negligible. I would call it cinnamon coffee rather than pumpkin spice coffee.

review/text: MMMMMMMMMM the smell and taste of this is just a perfect to warm up on cooler fall days.<br />I am so glad my husband does not like pumpkin so I do not have to share!!<br />It is a light roast coffee, so I do not want to water it down by brewing too large of cups, but a nice medium cup of keurig coffee has a perfect smooth easy taste!!

review/summary: Pumpkin Spice K-cup
review/text: Actually ordered these K-cups for my daughter who likes them. I kept a couple of them to try and although I'm not big on flavored coffee, I kind of like this taste once in awhile. Probably would not buy a whole box for myself but keeping a couple of cups around is good for me. I think this is a taste that you would either like or hate. But I can see how it's really different from the sweeter flavored ones.

review/text: I love pumpkin spice coffee. I'm an addict of Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte so finding a good pumpkin spice K-cup was a mission for me. I thought the Green Mountain pumpkin spice K-cup was pretty good. It's not Starbucks but it suffices for a cheaper alternative. I preferred Timothy's pumpkin spice K-Cup to this one though.

review/summary: Not bad, not great
review/text: I love pumpkin spiced coffee and this one is good but not great, in my opinion.  I don't know what "spice" they used but it's drowns out the pumpkin taste (kind of like "allspice" does).  I like my coffee with just a little milk and many people are recommending this with a flavored creamer so that may help.  I like it enough to finish the box but probably won't buy it again.  I make my OWN pumpkin spice lattes (VERY EASY- look online for recipe) and will stick to that in the future.
