review/summary: the very best!
review/text: Having traveled many places, sampled many coffees, there has been only 2 places that had coffee worth remembering. One was a Philadelphia shop that roasted their own beans, and unfortunately they are no longer in existence.<br /><br />The other was Community Coffee, in Louisiana. I've never found another commercially available, or even small scale private roaster, whose coffee even comes close to this.<br /><br />Full, deep, rich, creamy, hints of chocolately flavor, strong but not acidic. Dark roast is where it's at.<br /><br />CC's columbian coffee is also excellent (and so are the specialty coffees like Sumatra, etc.)<br /><br />May be hard to believe, but even CC's decaf and instant coffees share the same characteristics, and preserve that excellent flavor.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon is lower than Community Coffee's own website, and includes free shipping for the price.<br /><br />This is my first time buying CC from Amazon, and I hope the product is fresh and as good as from Louisiana directly.

review/text: This is just ok.  The good news is that it's cheap.  But a few days ago I drank a really high quality (and really expensive) organic coffee and there was absolutely no comparison.  If you put lots of sugar or flavored creamer in your coffee, this might be fine.  But if you drink your coffee with little cream or sugar, get a higher quality coffee.

This coffee is full-bodied, but not so dark and strong. For a dark roast coffee, it tastes more medium to my palette. Give it a try...you will not be disappointed....

He raved about the Kona dark roast.  And he ADMITTED that the Community tasted better.

review/summary: Guns don't kill people. Shady meat producers do.
review/text: This product is not inherently evil, despite what the reactionist one-star reviewers would have you think.  It is used by the finest restaurants to create unique cuts of meat.  When you eat pasta made from shrimp or a filet of duck and rabbit meat, you know they where fused.  Europe banded it not because it's unsafe, on the contrary they found it safe, but because it can mislead consumers.  europeans are more into real food than us, like raw milk cheese, preservative free bread, and beverages lightly sweeter with real sugar. If you doubt this, ask a european what they think of chicken nuggets with cheese on wonder bread with a 46oz coke, yuck!  While I can understand why some people would find gluing meat strange, there is no cause for this outrage.  There are tons of thing that the meat industry in this country does that actually endanger our health and violate basic tenants of human compassion.  Meat glue is not one of them.  Please, stop posting one star reviews on a product you have never tried, and if you must, don't use straw man justification to prove that a natural product is dangerous.  Truth is, frankenmeat and imitation crab are wrong not because they are dangerous but because, like much of our food today, they are sold to perpetuate the American notion that meat should be so cheap that it becomes the basis of every meal. So only buy good meat, and eat less of it.  I, however, like using the product to attach a thick strip of bacon to a prime filet, and there is no scientific basis that that is dangerous.

review/summary: Comments from a professional chef
review/text: I would like to make this short and sweet. For the people that are experimenting and enjoying finding out what amazing things this product can do---- well done. For those of you giving it a negative review--- you're ignorant. I mean that in the nicest most literal way. As a professional Chef that has traveled the world working in many of the best restaurants in the WORLD I can tell you from first hand experience that this product is intended for things that I am guessing you just DO NOT understand. For example: Take a fish as thin as sole. You cannot actually 'sear' the fish to get nice caramelization on the flesh without overcooking it. This 'searing' is to acquire what is called the maillard reaction. The maillard reaction is the caramelization of the natural proteins, amino acids and sugars found in the meat or fish product. You do this to bring out the flavor--- it makes a HUGE difference. So, if you sear the thin filets it will overcook. Use the meat glue and you can 'glue' two filets together thus acquiring the nice brown color and NOT overcook the fish.... Easy peasy...... Get a clue and don't comment on things you don't understand. Ignorant as I mentioned before.

It works best to marinade your wild game first to have the flavors evenly dispersed throughout the meat.  Do this overnight in the fridge, then simply mix the meat with the glue, wrap into a tube in plastic wrap.  Wait a while and cut into tasty steaks.  You can even freeze the tube and cut into steaks later.  Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Banned by ignorant minds every where
review/text: First of all this is a natural product that is collected from healthy food grade livestock.  So your eating a small quanity when ever you eat meat.  Secondly this enzym is very delicate and it will be broken down by the digestive system long before it could enter the blood stream intact.  Thirdly this is not used by evil meat packing companies to make franken meat. It's around $100 dollars a pound so recovering the cost would make the Franken meat cost more so what's the advantage.  Forth is it banned in Europe?  I thought some said this product is made in France.  Not to mention Europe will ban anything if enough people complain about it regaurdless of the science and if the Europeans are as misinformed and reactionary as some of the commentors on here I wouldn't be surprised if it was banned.  And finnaly wearing a dust mask when using a podwer that binds protiens together is just good sense.  A lung full of any kind of glue would be a bad thing wouldn't it?  Super glue was developed for use in surgery to close wounds where they didn't want to use stitchs.  I'm not going to breath in a fog of super glue for the same reason as I wouldn't breath this in.  My lungs work better when their not glued shut.<br /><br />Now this product is for the cook that wants to try new things, experiment, have fun.  I'm going to try it after I perfect making foams in my new N2O charger.  Eat to live don't live to eat

review/summary: Quality Product!
review/text: I use this product regularly. If you know what you're doing and have great to professional cooking experience, you can create kitchen miracles. I use this to create custom cuts of meat or to bind different species together. My favorite application is to make a sort of Turducken Braciole. I debone whole turkey, duck, chicken and sometimes quail or squab and after removing the wings and legs, I butterfly the meat into flat sheets. I then use this product in between each layer of meat to bind them together as if they came from the same animal. I then roll the meat sheat around a long natural casing sausage to create beautiful tube of mixed meat. After seasoning, grilling and roasting, I slice the roast into discs and serve with a port wine reduction or gravy of some kind. It's allways a hit! This product is not for beginners. You must have a-lot of kitchen experience. But with experamentation you can work wonders. Ignore the one star reviews. Having read them all, none actually review the product or discuss their experience with the product. All are either vegan/vegiteran or anti-modern butcher practices activists using the review as a platform to spout their drivel. If you're buying this product here, chances are you're not supplying mega-marts with fake stake or faux roasts. You're probaby buying this for private home use or small resaurant use. When used properly there is no danger at all. If it was poisonous or unsafe to consume it would be illegal to sell in the US, which it isn't. All in all, this is a solid product and one I use often.

review/text: When you are making unique foods like shrimp noodles made out of actual shrimp, or using it to enhance the appearance of a dish in an artistic way, it's fine.  But don't be fooled by the so-called "world famous chefs" on amazon talking out of their rear ends. One reviewer says it's 100 a pound, and that you can't recoup costs if you use it in the way most use it.  That's called crap.  I can go buy a 2 pound pack of stew meat for 5 bucks, sprinkle some meat glue in, roll it up, and slice $40 filet out of them.  I just turned 5 bucks of meat scraps into $160.  You think they aren't using it?  I suggest you ask, because I PROMISE YOU, restaurants are using it on the sneak.  The manager might not even know; understand that information like that is purposefully compartmentalized.  The area manager may know that the pre-packaged steaks they get are glued meat, but the general manager probably wouldn't.  Plus there is usually a kitchen manager in most restaurants which is what most people don't know.  That person is usually responsible for the back of the house, the food delivery, and kitchen affairs.  He may not even know. Restaurants that make everything SPEC and/or from scratch like Ted's Montana won't use it, but best believe a local chain or individual restaurant will, and any restaurant that gets prepackaged foods in ready cut and measured portions.

They use enzymes from cow or pig blood to produce this product and therefore it could be dangerous if the meat is not cooked well-done to burnt.<br /><br />This stuff has been around for 6 or so years now and explains why some meats we've bought at the grocery store look the way (shape) they do.

review/text: This is outrageous that the compound sold here can be added to meat parts to make them a "whole" product. The separation of parts to be rejoined is HIGHLY likely to cause sickness in people, such salmonella, e coli, etc. This product should be BANNED in the US and everywhere else, as it is a human hazard, not only in chemical composition, but in the practice of butchery in every place worldwide.

review/summary: Quite tasty
review/text: Ferrara Pan Candy Company was founded in 1900, in Chicago, Illinois. It makes many small and tasty candies including Lemonheads (oh yeah!), Atomic Fireballs, Boston Baked Beans, and now Chewy Lemonhead & Friends! They look like the Lemonheads line (Lemonhead, Cherryheads, Appleheads and Grapeheads), but unlike them are soft and chewy.<br /><br />I found them to be quite tasty - sweet and enough tart to give them a little more zing than your run-of-the-mill fruit candies. I think that they are really very good, and a nice addition to the Ferrara Pan product line.<br /><br />(I do understand that they must seal them up better these day, but I must admit I do miss the old boxes that you could blow through and make noises with!)

review/summary: Great bowl for fast eating big faced dogs.
review/text: I just bought two of the 5 cup bowels from Dr.s Foster & Smith and they are great! They are of solid build, excellent rubber traction and dishwasher safe (although it's easier to quickly wash rather than take up valuable real estate in the dishwasher). We just picked up two 9 week old Newfoundlands (large breed) last week and can see how they have to navigate around the whole bunt cake style bowl, which should keep wolfing their food down to a minimum, as best as can be expected. This is quite important to us as one of our last beloved Newfies died from bloating a year and a half ago (the other who had been his shadow was never the same afterwards and died of kidney and other complications several months later). We had looked at some of the other bowls that had the large nubs protruding up from the bottom, and while the design looked good for dogs with slim snouts, I feel a big faced Newfie would have a frustrating time of it getting in there.  I highly recommend this product, even just as a good solid feeding bowl! Jody Koval

review/text: I suppose these might taste good, as I will know after I open them.  For right now, I will keep the five of them together to look good, but 3 out of the 5 were broken upon opening the box.  The box looked good and it doesn't appear they went through too much shaking or anything, they just are so fragile, they can't make it through shipment.  So needless to say, I recommend getting more than one package if you really want these for something special (birth of my son) and want to be able to hand any out.

review/text: I purchased a bottle of this in 2/12. Expiration date on the bottle was 9/1/12 so it wasn't sitting on the shelf forever or something.<br /><br />Absolutely no relation flavor-wise to beet juice.... more like Goldenseal. Absolutely bad bad icky.<br /><br />I thought that maybe the storage or concentration process did that to the juice so I bought some dried beet juice.<br /><br />The rehydrated dried beet juice tasted like.... surprise! Beets.<br /><br />I don't know what the story is with the flavor, but the guy at the health food store had told me to buy the dried kind instead of this because "people preferred it" and I should have listened.<br /><br />If the manufacturer reads this and wants to dispute the review please contact me and send me a sample of what this product SHOULD have tasted like and I would be happy to modify this. But from the expiration date I suspect this was supposed to taste like it did.

review/summary: A good tea at a great price
review/text: I've been drinking this tea for over a year now, and it is the main tea I drink.  I prefer other teas for flavor, for sipping and savoring, but this is what I drink the most of, as a refreshing and healthy beverage, and it is very good for that purpose.<br /><br />The Amazon description, saying this is Bai Mu Dan, is incorrect. It is actually fannings. Fannings is the second to the smallest leaf size. Fannings are used in tea bags because of their small size and economic price. On the Uncle Lee's tea website, this tea is shown just as white camellia sinensis. The Uncle Lee's Organic White tea that is described as Bai Mu Dan on the Uncle Lee website is $5 for 18 bags.<br /><br />The only other pure white tea I've had is Republic of Tea's Emperor's white tea, which I find superior to this tea, having a milder and sweeter flavor that is even more pleasant to drink without sweetener than this one. The Uncle Lee's white tea is closer to an oolong in both color and flavor than the Emperor's, with just a hint of bitterness and none of the herbal tones of a green tea.<br /><br />That said, the RoT Emperor's White is almost 6 times more expensive than this tea, and Uncle Lee's is still easy to drink without sweetener, so I'll save the Emperor's for special moments and use the Uncle Lee's as my "daily drinker."<br /><br />Having more flavor, I find that this makes an excellent iced tea.  I usually use 4 bags of this, and one bag of Republic of Tea's Cherry Green Tea, to a gallon of water plus 2 heaping teaspoons of natural cane sugar to provide just a hint of sweetness in a very refreshing iced tea that everyone loves.

review/summary: Great Tea.
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.

review/summary: ok but more salty than chicken flavor
review/text: I was expecting a paste type of broth mix but this is a fluffier dry mix.  It has MSG if you care about that.  I think it will work well as a salt substitute where you want a chicken flavor but too salty as a direct replacement for chicken bullion.  I would compare this to the broth you get in the chicken noodle soup packets or the chicken Ramen envelopes.

review/summary: So far the best among GRAIN-free AND SUGAR-free cookies...
review/text: ... because:<br />- They taste better. The others I've tried were "Yes! to cookies" (a bit sour), "HealthSmart Chocolite Cookies & Cream" (better classified as candies than cookies), and "Andre's Carbo-Save" (these come close to Lucienne's taste-wise).<br />- Unlike those other products, Lucienne's cookies are safe in terms of intestinal side effects: no FOS (such as inulin or oligofructose) no polydextrose, no isomalt.<br />- Unlike those others, Lucienne's cookies are dairy-free (and legume-free unlike Andre's).<br /><br />These cookies aren't too tempting, however. I've had truly addictive cookies made from almond and coconut flour, as well as a variation made from almond butter (those aren't sold online yet). But those addictive cookies would make me forget all the real foods, such as fruits and veggies. So I'm glad that Lucienne's cookies aren't doing this to me.

review/text: The cookies are very tasty and moist. Most similar cookies are tried before are dry and crumbly. Very pronounced nutty flavor, good consistency, not too sweet.<br /><br />The fact that it's sweetened with natural zero-calorie sweeteners (and not the dreaded aspartame, splenda, sucralose etc etc) was why I looked at these in the first place. I am healthy, not a diabetic or overweight. But in my opinion the sugar is the cause of many problems that take some years to develop. So I sought cookies that are sweetened with stevia. Fat I don't mind, vegan or not I don't mind. I don't want sugar, and I don't want artificial ingredients,  and these cookies deliver. Two thumbs up. The only thing I would like improved is the price.

review/text: With all that is known about the damaging effects of white sugar, why don't more companies wisen up? These cookies are a little pricey but well worth it. Each cookies is moist and flavorful, just the right amount of chewy lush apricot bits, heavenly almond, very rich and filling -- with healthy ingredients and zero guilt.<br /><br />Food should be good for us s well as delicious, and this product proves that is possible. Every bite of these cookies helps, delights, nourishes, heals and creates pleasure. That's my idea of Food!  Soon global awareness will demand only good products like this, and sweetening with stevia or xylitol.  Why trash our bodies with the ravages of white refined sugar to make people who don't care or who are ignorant rich? So supporting products such as this quality not only is good for us, it's good for the world.  Thank you Lucienne, thank you Amazon.

review/summary: Seeds of Change Quinoa Delivers a Keen "Wow!!"
review/text: I had heard so many great things about the quinoa "supergrain," which was considered to be the mother of all grains by the ancient Incas. However, I was a bit skeptical of Seeds of Change products due to past experience -- they were a bit bland and often resembled bird seed! Still I was intrigued enough to purchase and now am well satisfied. It's easy to prepare -- you just have to simmer it a while after bringing the grain / water mix to the boiling point. Altogether it shouldn't take you longer than a half hour (microwave instructions are also available on the package, but you may lose nutritional value that way). Once the 5.5 oz. package is prepared, I got at least three full servings out of it, but your results may vary according to your appetite. Since you get a large seasoning package in each box, I would caution the cook to use about half of that. It does contain wasabi or horseradish so be advised! We even mixed it with wild rice for Thanksgiving. This Cuzco mix also includes brown rice and millet, so you really get a tasty and nutritious mix. (Quinoa is supposed to contain all of the essential amino acids). While the instructions tell you to first saute' or brown the grains in a pan with oil, this step isn't necessary (we still added the extra-virgin olive oil to the water to prepare though). Seeds of Change should be proud -- so don't let this mighty quinoa wind pass you by. Embrace the change to supergrains!!

review/text: Most soba has a large proportion of wheat flour in it. Not this product, it's 80% buckwheat flour and 10% rice flour.<br />To readers not familiar with buckwheat, let me just say that you're not likely to put tomato-based sauce on this.Don't think of it as an across-the-board replacement for semolina style pasta. It has a unique flavor which, to me at least,is not compatible with<br />toppings for semolina pasta. You'll come up with ideas for toppings for this.<br />The price and the delivery were good.

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Pasta on the Market for the Price
review/text: I love this pasta and so does my family.  It's the best gluten-free pasta I have found.  I love the nutty taste and the firmer texture--one has to be careful not to overcook it though.  I make regular pasta and pasta salad with this and it always comes out great.  The fiber and protein contents per serving aren't bad, and because it's not wheat, there's no bloated feeling after eating it.  The only drawback is that it contains rice flour, which makes it higher in carbohydrates and increases the calories per serving.  Eden sells pure buckwheat soba noodles, but the expense for that is out of my price range.  The Organ noodles are less expensive and taste great.

For five years I have searched high and low and had mushy pasta, pasty pasta, flavorless pasta, hard pasta, and I'm certain other failing adjectives associated with the pasta I was eating. This is not the case with ORGRAN. The pasta is absolutely perfect! Follow the directions and cook for exactly 8 minutes and even those around you who can eat gluten will love this pasta. Just ask my boyfriend! Buy this! You will be so happy when you do!

review/summary: Tasty, healthy, good price.
review/text: I love almonds in general, and this particular brand is quite good.  They taste great, with just the right amount of salt and oil (for me, anyway).<br /><br />They're individually packaged in 6 oz. cans, which makes them an easy and portable snack.  Portion control is also easier with the small can size.<br /><br />I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.<br /><br />Almonds are relatively healthy too - high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.<br /><br />I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA.

review/summary: Perfect little guys
review/text: Yup, no stray pieces, just whole brown almonds. Which is to say that these are not "blanched" - blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond (not the husk) and leaves a pale buff-colored product. And the description of "lightly salted" is accurate. I can barely taste it. The can says the ingredients are almonds, vegetable oil (canola, safflower and/or sunflower) and salt. That's it. Gluten-free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be "Pasteurized", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a "light" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]<br /><br />They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just-created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo-carb and gluten-free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet. I'm pleased to report that these Blue Diamond Almonds are properly dated: on the bottom of the can it says "BEST BEFORE JUL 20 14". That gives plenty of time to use up six little cans.<br /><br />And about the cans, they seem to be metal bottom and sides, making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be breachable by the ubiquitous rodent. The little cans are nicely reusable.

review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.
