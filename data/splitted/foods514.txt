review/text: I'm not big on nuts, so I probably would have never purchased this product had it not been offered in the Vine program.  After tasting however, I am hooked.  The salt and pepper coating fresh cashews is out of this world.  It was a nice surprise, and a great new healthier snack for me.  This is worth a try.

review/text: We were so effusive in our praise of the last batch of Emerald nuts we tried that we'll sound like corporate shills when we say this one's the best of the lot.  The pepper adds a nice tang that lingers as the final aftertaste.

review/summary: I love regular salted cashews, and these were tasty, but
review/text: I'm not a big fan of pepper and found these a bit too spicy for my personal taste.  But, while I wasn't crazy about these, my 7yo dd, who is a spice fiend (loves pepper), LOVED these, as did my husband.  They both ended up taking the can over to my neighbor, who had to try them, and he told his wife to buy them, as he too now is addicted.  She already purchased 2 cans for him.  While I will be purchasing them again, they won't be for myself though.

review/text: I thought they were overly salty myself, but he said he could handle it. The pepper was less intrusive but it may well have been that the salt settles during shipping or handling and one cannister may be different than another.

review/text: These sea salted and peppered Cashews would make a great snack for the guys and gals that like Cashews.  I didn't really find anything about them remarkable, but I'm not a huge fan of Cashews. Also, I'm not sure that the  salt and pepper really added to the taste... I think they would've tasted fine without the extra spices.<br /><br />The Cashews themselves did seem like they were of high quality and fresh. So if you love Cashews (or nuts in general... no pun intended) you'll probably enjoy this product.  As for me, I'm enjoying the dark chocolate powdered Almonds made from the same company... much more.

review/text: These are darn tasty, but subtle they're not. The "pepper" in the name isn't just black pepper; these nuts are hot and spicy, and very, very salty. Good with a cocktail or a cold beer, they're too powerful to eat without a drink in hand. The subtle sweetness of cashews is lost in the coating; you could make the same product out of peanuts more cheaply without really affecting the snacking experience. All in all, though, they're a good nosh, the best of the three "Emerald" flavors I've tried.

review/summary: Not the nut for me
review/text: We have picked up a number of Emerald nuts recently.  We liked Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, 11oz Canister (Pack of 4) and absolutely loved Emerald Marcona Almonds, 11.5oz Canister (Pack of 4), but we did not care for these at all. I have no problem with the quality of the product, but I do have a problem with the recipe.<br /><br />In theory pepper and sea salt sounded like a great combination.  Salty with a slight peppery taste sounded great, but in reality, the pepper was overwhelming. Everyone in our family tried them and no one cared for them. The sea salt alone would have been good, and even a lighter coating of pepper would have been okay.<br /><br />We love Emerald nuts in general, this one just wasn't a hit with our family.

review/summary: If you need a kickier snack...
review/text: Emerald's nut snacks are healthy options. They are packaged in handy carry-along packages, so they're great for camping, car trips, or keeping in your desk drawer.<br />That said, this is not my favorite of the group.The sodium level is high, there are equal grams of sugar and fiber (2), and the ingredients include maltodextrin, sugar, granulated onion, and flavorings. So we are at least a step away from naturally good cashews. Compared to a packet of potato chips, the Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews have more fat, more saturated fat, more sugar, fewer vitamins, and only slightly more fiber.<br />I didn't care for the taste, either, though my husband enjoyed them. They were too salty for me, and the flavor didn't seem natural.<br />They were nice as an ingredient in stir-fry, though.<br />If you want to incorporate more nuts into your snacks but really you wish you were eating barbecue chips, then this might be a transitional food for you.

review/summary: Sea Salt and Pepper:  Too much?  Just right?  Yes and yes.
review/text: We loved these at first.  While we thought the salt and pepper was very powerful, the cashews themselves were large and flavorful, and the whole thing really worked.  We still love them, but it's a hit-or-miss proposition.  You never quite know how your taste buds are going to react when you open the container and toss a few in your mouth.  Sometimes, without a doubt, it's just a little too overpowering.<br /><br />The quality of the cashews is fantastic, the salt and pepper adhere to the nuts surprisingly well considering how coarse it all is.  There are times when I'd rate these a 4 or even 5, others where I'd want to go as low as 2.  3 it is.<br /><br />Would we buy them again?  I don't think so, but I had to stop and really think about that.  Emerald has a great product here, and we loved their Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, 11oz Canister (Pack of 4), but the moments where these are too much, are enough to keep us from going back for more when this can is gone.

review/summary: Cashews.
review/text: Well, this product is pretty self explanatory, and I'm not really sure who buys their nuts from Amazon.com, but when offered some by the Vine program in exchange, I couldn't say no (I love cashews!).  The only thing different about these cashews from your average roasted/salted cashews is the addition of black pepper.  I really did like the pepper addition, although plain salted cashews are still higher on my list.  The flavor is a bit stronger and I can only eat a few at a time.  I also think that if I ate enough of these salt and pepper nuts, I'd probably get sick of them and never want them again, so they're probably best in small doses.  Other than that, I'd say that the cashews themselves are good size and quality, and the roasting was perfect.

review/summary: Who knew Cashews could be so Powerful?
review/text: I really love cashews and these Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper ones were no exception.<br /><br />The cashews arrive in a very nice container, freshly sealed with a decent lid that keeps them quite fresh for a good week or two afterward.<br /><br />I never thought so much flavor could be packed into a tiny nut, but I was wrong.  This product is not for the weak of heart!  As soon as you take you first taste you'll be overcome by the wonderul mix of salt, pepper, and natural cashew goodness.<br /><br />I shared the nuts with a few friends and reviews were mixed.  Half loved them, and half thought they were just way too salty/peppery.  I think you'll really love these if you can handle the extreme flavor, otherwise you might want to look elsewhere.

review/text: We love cashews and as we have teenagers always have a jar of them on the counter for quick snacks so I was very interested to try these flavored cashews.<br /><br />The first handful was great. The seasoning is nice but if you have more then one handful the flavors become too strong really fast. A few of our teens tried them out also and had the same feedback.<br /><br />If they had had just a bit less seasoning we would have all liked them much better. If I were to get them again, I'd mix them with the same amount of regular cashews which would be just about the right amount of seasoning for me.

review/summary: TOO MUCH salt & pepper
review/text: I absolutely love the salt & pepper pistachios that Costco sells and I love cashews so I was looking forward to trying these. Unfortunately these cashews are so heavily seasoned that I got heartburn from them, and I hardly ever get heartburn. In my opinion when your mouth almost burns from pepper then it's TOO MUCH! The idea of a salt & pepper cashew is a good one but I'd take a plain roasted, salted cashew over these any day. To me, the delicious taste of the cashew itself is ruined by the seasoning.

Although the sea salt makes it really salty, the other flavoring ingredients (pepper, sugar, granulated onion, and spice) can be said to enhance the flavor.

"Natural Flavor" is listed as one of the ingredients, but I don't know what it means.

review/text: What can you say about an Emerald Nuts product?  They are always good quality nuts, and cashews are a personal weakness of mine.  The seasoning is an unusual choice and may be an acquired taste.  The pepper makes this snack surprisingly spicy, so if that's not your thing, don't try them.  I believe the flavor is growing on me, though I find more than a small handful is just a bit overpowering.  Maybe that's a good thing for me, as like with most nuts, this is not a low-fat snack.

review/summary: Tasty and packs a peppery punch
review/text: Having always loved cashews, even though they aren't exactly a low-calorie snack, I was looking forward to tasting this product. Nor was I disappointed, but I was surprised. The description promises sea salt with "a hint" of pepper. Well, it's a rather big hint. The pepper provides a shock to the taste buds with these cashews. Partly because one expects salt but not pepper with cashews, and partly because, as I stated above, the pepper is a bit thicker than you might expect. And it's somewhat tangy pepper, too. I like spicy, tangy foods so this is not a problem for me. After a couple of handfuls I had to force myself to stop before I wolfed down the whole can. I like them and I'll buy more. But do be aware that, if you like your food--especially your cashews--on the mild side, the tangy pepper here may be overwhelming. It's pretty bold, and my only caveat is, again, the pepper is more than a hint's worth.

review/summary: Toothsome crunchies
review/text: Football season starts next month and Emerald's SEA SALT & PEPPER CASHEWS might well be a perfect addition to the Game Day broadcast as I watch my guys, the USC Trojans, beat the bandini out of all challengers on the way to the BCS Title Game. Fight on! Of course, fans of that other squad across town, the UCLA Teddy Bears, would probably find this snack just as toothsome, but how great an experience can it be, munching cashews or not, watching grown men dressed out in sissy powder blue?<br /><br />I'd perhaps prefer a little less salt and a tad more pepper, but then I'd fall into the trap set my wife whose inclinations favor a low-sodium diet. At 270mg of Na per serving, these nuts are a bit too briny for her; if they contained less salt, I might be forced to share. And we can't have that, especially as she thinks football is for Neanderthals.<br /><br />No edible is perfect, apparently. The hand-wringing, food nannies make sure of that. Their handiwork is evident on the label with the warning:<br /><br />"ALLERGY INFORMATION: This product is processed on equipment that also processes other tree nuts or peanuts. May contain tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, milk, soy, or sesame seeds."<br /><br />Happily, perhaps because I grew up in a less fearful age when kids were allowed to go out and play in the dirt and become exposed to all those nasty germs and allergens and thus acquire immune tolerance, I can now eat these SEA SALT & PEPPER CASHEWS by the handful and not worry that I'll go into anaphylactic shock by halftime.<br /><br />Another nice feature is the ergonomically friendly can, done up in a soothing green color, that allows for an easy hand grip. Also take note of, and visit, the Emerald Nuts website, which is clever and amusing.

review/text: The first couple of bites are extremely salty and made me feel like I was over salivating due to all the salt on my tongue.  After a couple of bites, I found the nuts strangely addicting because of the nice pepper taste.<br /><br />I'm not positive if it was because of the amount of salt or the fact that it was sea salt. If the saltiness could be halved down or even paired down to a quarter what it is now, it would be much better. It may certainly fit the beer drinking snack scene, but it's not something I would give to my toddler due to the salt and spiciness of it.

It was enough to burn my tongue and lips and cause me to stop eating them, even though they tasted good.

review/summary: Too much salt and pepper
review/text: I'm a big cashew fan, but was unimpressed by this product. The nuts were fresh, but the seasoning was a bit too heavy-handed - they are very salty and the pepper has more of a bite than I liked.<br /><br />The seasoning gets stronger the lower you get in the can due to it falling off the upper ones and coating the lower ones. While tolerable when first opened, the seasoning becomes way too overpowering once you get half-way down in the can. I found myself putting the nuts in a dish and rolling them around a bit to dislodge some of the seasoning.<br /><br />If you're on a sodium restricted diet (or just want to cut down on sodium) you definitely want to pass on this.<br /><br />If they would dial back the salt by 50% and the pepper by 75%, it would be a great product. As it is right now, however, I'll have to give it only 2 stars.

review/text: The first thing you'll notice about these peppered cashew nuts is the packaging -- the large green plastic jar seems like overkill, but flipping it over, one finds that it's made of 7th-generation recycled plastic, so I suppose it's relatively eco-friendly (no indication of where it was manufactured; most likely in China)  So, we peel back the outer plastic wrapper (which also acts as a safety seal) and open the container, then check out the nuts.<br /><br />I have to say, the flavoring was much more thickly applied than I'd anticipated, with an almost pasty mix of pepper, salt and spices embedded on all the nuts. The second surprise is that the nuts are much moister than I'd have thought -- I prefer really crisp, dry-roasted nuts, and these were almost damp with the flavoring ingredients. Visually, there's quite a bit of black pepper in each bite, but it doesn't have as much kick as you'd expect. The pepper flavor, like that of the cashews themselves, is overshadowed by the rest of the seasonings -- the dominant tastes are of salt and dried onions, and the cashew umami is obscured to a remarkable degree.  Also, the salt doesn't taste very "sea salty", as it is competing with sugar, peanut oil and citric acid (which adds a nice lime-y tang, but also is buried in the mix...)  A much lighter seasoning might be better, one that concentrates on the flavors in this order: sea salt, dry-roast umami, citrus tang.  The other flavors -- onion, oil, sugar -- are just in the way.<br /><br />The final surprise came after I screwed the lid back on, set the jar aside and then came back for another sample. The lid popped right off, the jar slid out of my hand and almost spilled out onto the floor. Had I forgot to fasten it on properly?  Noooo... not quite. It turns out the screw-top lid  doesn't really fit very well onto the container. It screws on, alright, but it pops off quite easily, with slight force ranging from a short tug to just picking up the jar. Another half-turn worth of grooves would probably solve this defect. Also, it would be nice if the product info -- ingredients, nutrition value, etc. -- didn't peel off the container along with the safety seal.<br /><br />In sum, this is an okay snack food, but it could be much better. Mostly, a more subtle, less wham-bam approach to seasoning would help.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Roasted cashews (with peanut or cottonseed oil), sea salt, peanut oil, black pepper, maltodextrin, sugar, granulated onion, citric acid, spice, natural flavor

review/summary: tasty alternate to peanuts or almonds
review/text: These cashews are another nice addition to Emerald's line of nut snacks.  As someone who's addicted to peanuts and nuts for snacking (I usually have 2-3 containers open at any given time), I'm always looking for some variety, such as these with their salt+pepper seasoning reminiscent, in some ways, more of chips than nuts.<br /><br />The cashews themselves are high quality, large and meaty.<br /><br />Note the description is accurate, they liberally use both salt and pepper, so the sodium level in these is more than twice that of the similar cannister of Emerald almonds, and the pepper flavor is distinct.  Avoid if you dislike pepper or are on a salt-restricted diet.

review/summary: Interesting in small doses
review/text: A few years ago I gave a dinner party that had all the gay spontaneity of an open grave. Unbeknownst to me, each and every couple I had invited was on the outs with the others, but only in a quiet, teeth-gritted sort of way.<br />The food, however, was a smashing success, especially some spicy pecans that I threw together as I walked in the door about a half hour before my guests. I have never replicated the success of that first batch, but these cashews come close.<br />They have a good balance of sweet (the cashews themselves), salty, and peppery flavor. The pepper is not overpowering and strikes me as just right.<br />The nice thing about the snack is that a few satisfy. I tend to to eat way too many plain cashews when I buy them lightly salted. A very few of these make a nice nibble, and would go great with sake or a martini.

review/text: I will admit that I am very fond of cashews. I have to resist the temptations to pick through a bowl of mixed nuts and snag the cashews for myself.<br /><br />These cashews are salty but also peppery.  The peppery flavor means I can only munch a few of these at a time. This is a good thing. They are different. I would serve these at a party and a few make a good snack before dinner.

review/summary: Decent nuts
review/text: It's very difficult to review a food item, because taste is so tremendously subjective.  I liked the combination of sea salt and pepper; the nuts were salty without being too salty, and the pepper was just enough to be noticeable without being overpowering.  My wife thought that the sea salt and pepper would be better on a chip or something crunchier, and that the texture of the nut was jarring in combination with the seasoning.  In general, I think these are tasty nuts, and while I don't think I'd be inclined to eat these regularly, I enjoyed them.  Cashew purists who are looking for a pure expression of cashew flavor (which I love myself) are advised to stick with good old regular roasted cashews, however.

review/summary: they're salty, they're peppery and they're delicious!
review/text: I just cracked into the can of sea salt and pepper cashews and they are exactly what I expected.  Large cashews (not pieces), with a generous coating of salt and pepper.  They are salty, so if you are watching sodium or don't like a salty taste this probably wouldn't be for you, but when I want some salt, I want some salt.  The pepper was just enough to give them a bite without being overwhelming.  The valued added seasoning of onion/sugar combo was fine, I really couldn't tell that they were in there- I just know that I liked the taste and the size of the cashews.  Also, I like that the lid holds one serving size.  Short of portioning out your own snack bag this is a clever idea so that you don't overeat (if you don't want to).  Overall, a nice snack product.  I would definitely consider buying these when I buy flavored cashews again.

review/summary: Aw, Nuts...................Addicted!
review/text: I think there are a lot of folks that will NOT like these cashews, as they are not faint.  Imagine `salt `n pepper' potatoes chips and replace the potato flavor with cashews.  It is intense, but I am addicted.  These strongly flavored cashews are truly `over-the-top' in flavor and the citric acid and granulated onion only intensify the flavor.  There really isn't anything especially nutritious about these cashews other than nuts are good for your heart, but I'd think the salt would cancel that out.  This is one of those `love it or leave it' food products and I just happen to really, really like these.

review/summary: WOW! UNIQUELY EMERALD!
review/text: I have never thought about using salt and pepper on cashews or any other nut but I have to admit it is quite unique. I am from Texas and am rather fond of "hot". This snack has a bite to it and can stand up to any Tex-Mex jalopeno or Cajun cayenne. Since cashews are a good source for protein and a much better choice than a sugary treat, the added kick of pepper and the mixture with sea salt makes it all the more healthier. I like the canister size and shape as it fits well in the drink holder in your car for easy reach. I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a bit of spice to their life. Now, how about peanuts with salt & pepper?

review/text: These sea salt and pepper cashews are addictive. The seasoning makes them even more addictive than if they were just plain. Just as in Emerald's cocoa-dusted almonds, the seasoning is not overpowering. It's done just right. It's just enough to kick it up just that one extra notch. You'll be craving a drink to go with them, though. And I wouldn't recommend eating the dregs of the canister, either. The seasoning all settles down at the bottom, and if you try to eat it, it will rip your taste buds out.

review/summary: Addicting!
review/text: I have to admit that when I first tried Emerald's Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews I didn't like them. Emerald has great cashews and I initially thought that the true quality of the cashews could not be detected because of the seasonings (besides the sea salt and pepper I could really taste onion). However, like Emerald's plain cashews, the sea salt and pepper ones are addicting and once I got used to the seasonings, I couldn't put them down. My one real complaint is that they are a bit too salty, especially when you get to the end of the can where the salt tends to settle. The cashews come in a container designed to fit into a car's cup holder and the lid holds 1.5 ounce serving of nuts which is the FDA daily recommendation for good heart health. The cashews have no trans fats, are high in protein and are a good source of iron and zinc. Although they are seasoned, there are only 160 calories per serving which is the same number of calories as a handful of regular cashews.<br /><br />Emerald's Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews are addicting and delicious.

review/text: Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews is a pleasant treat for cashew lovers. The saltiness of the product is a little intense at times, but the taste of sea salt (as opposed to ordinary table salt) combined with some nicely-flavored ground pepper does give Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews a fairly distinctive flavor... and a good one, to boot.

review/summary: A Savory Snack!
review/text: I love nuts as a snack. They're good for you, high in protein (and other nutrients), and they just taste good. (Yes, they also contain fat, but if you don't overdo it, that shouldn't be of much concern.)<br /><br />So, after years of eating plain old nuts, I was delighted to try these Salt & Pepper Cashews. I was looking forward to trying something different, and these really have a unique flavor.<br /><br />They're salty, which is a nice compliment to the slightly sweet taste of the cashew, but the pepper is the real star here. It adds a perfect spicy/savory note, which wraps itself around that sweet/salty nuttiness for a real taste treat.<br /><br />Not too high in calories (my canister said 100 calories per serving), they should please most nut-lovers looking for something new.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Very salty and peppery
review/text: Initially the first few cashews were lightly salted and had a definite kick with the pepper that was different but still enjoyable. As you continue to munch out of the container, the salt and pepper are much heavier and totally masks the cashew flavor. I normally don't use much added salt although I do like spicy foods. I decided to rinse them off, let them air dry and then they were tasty. Mine were not oily or any of the other quality complaints I read in other reviews. I've tried other Emerald products with varying quality issues that somewhat reflect other reviewers' complaints. Amazon will replace a faulty product within 30 days which gives peace of mind and wallet when purchasing them here.

review/summary: Very tasty, a few at a time.
review/text: My children and husband and I LOVE nuts! I was worried these would be too strong for the children, but the 6 year old liked it, but didn't want another. The 4 year old ate an entire handful, and said he'd like more, but only with water, and the 3 year old ate about ten before she said, "These are REALLY pepper-ish!"<br /><br />I really enjoyed the strong taste - reminded me of beef jerky or something. But I could only eat a few - the taste is QUITE strong, but a very good taste! So, if you'd like some nuts that will hang around the house for a few days, these are great! Very fresh, good texture, and delicious, and you can't down the entire box in one sitting for sure.<br /><br />Sra. Gose<br />Author of Spanish Fun Activity Calendar

It's nice to throw in my daughter's backpack for a snack on the go.<br /><br />As far as the salt and pepper cashews go, the adults in the house loved them but not a big hit with the kids.

Don't get me wrong, they taste great as is, I just won't eat as much at one time since I'm concerned about too much salt in my diet. For me it's a guilty pleasure!

review/summary: Really Good Cashews, Surprisingly!
review/text: First, let me say that I like cashews and was a littly leary of the "Salt & Pepper" labeling. I had almost made up my mind that I wasn't going to like them before I even tasted them, because who could improve on the taste of lightly salted cashews? But I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I did actually like them and that they were quite good in fact. I think it was the "Salt & Pepper" labeling that put me off. Made me think of eating vegetables or eggs for some reason. In my humble opinion, they should be labeled something like "Light Peppery Seasoning" or something like that. The black pepper flavoring is quite light and enhances the cashew taste as does the light salting. I do feel this is a matter of personal taste though as my daughter tried them and wasn't too impressed. I asked her how she would rate them on a scale of 1 to 5 and she said 3. Not bad, but not exceptionally good either. I can't say that they are exceptionally good either, but I would definetly buy them again as I enjoyed the flavor which is slightly spicy but not overpowering.

review/text: I do like cashews & pepper though I restrict my salt intake.  Obviously, salted cashews will have considerable sodium & fat--they come with the territory, but if you're seriously considering this product to purchase, then the taste/cost are paramount.  I think the cost is fairly reasonable for this relatively expensive nut (much more than peanuts) and the taste is quite good--not as good as their cocoa almonds (Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, 11oz Canister (Pack of 4)), but pretty good.  I had to force myself not to consume the packaging (as well as the contents) on the 1st sitting.  Yum.  Enjoy!<br />p.s.

It's mostly due to the fact that I wasn't expecting the unusual taste.<br /><br />The cashews are large and the seasoning is bold.  The one thing that I prompted me to look at the ingredient list is that they actually taste very TART which was not expected due to the citric acid that's included.<br /><br />The product is good but I could do without the "tangi-ness".  So these stayed around the house much longer than the dark-chocolate dusted almonds made by the same company.

review/summary: STRONG SALT AND PEPPER TASTE
review/text: My experience.  When I ate these as the first food of the day the salt(not so much the pepper) was almost unbearable.  When I ate this after eating smothing else the salt was very tolerable.  These would be good with an ice cold beer.<br /><br />There seemed to be an equal amount of flavoring on eat nut.  Mostly the nuts were whole, but there were a few pieces.  The plastic container is substantial but the top is not airtight.  The unit price is around seven-fifty a pound.<br /><br />I enjoyed them but would not go out of my way to get them.

review/summary: A unique nut that bites back
review/text: The Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper cashew is a break from the normal salted cashew.<br />The back pepper adds a Cajun flavor to the obsequious cashew. The result is a unique flavor that makes other cashews seem bland by comparison. It makes me want to taste a cashew without any salt at all. The black pepper adds enough flavor that I think the salt may be unnecessary.

review/summary: simplicity is underrated.....
review/text: as another reviewer stated, my family also tested Emeralds Macona Almonds and loved them. So I was excited to try these cashews as cashews are my favorite nut.  Sadly, this product is a big time disappointment.<br /><br /> Like many companies, Emerald is now trying the "if "blank" sells well, then "blank" with crazy added seasonings will be better".  When it's not true-it takes the simple and delicious cashew and douses it with so much seasoning that the cashew itself can no longer even be tasted.  If you like cashews then skip this product and stick with this companies simply roasted cashews instead.

review/summary: flavorful, versatile, a nice twist
review/text: Emerald's Sea Salt and Pepper cashews are moderately spiced and benefit from not being oily or heavy.  In addition to salt and a slightly spicy dose of pepper, the cashews are coated with traces of sweetness and onion.  These cashews are great to have on hand as a snack, to accompany cocktails, or to add flavor to a stir fry or vegetable dish.<br /><br />So why a rating of four instead of five stars?  I prefer snacks to be packaged in glass containers instead of the plastic Emerald uses (however, chances of damage in shipment are next to zero in plastic packaging, so I see their reasons).  In addition, the nuts might benefit from slightly less onion flavor.  However, these are minor gripes, and mainly a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />Emerald's salt and pepper cashews taste great, can be used in a variety of ways, and are a great snack to have on hand.  Recommended.

review/summary: Sea Salt and Pepper with a Hint of Cashews
review/text: I love cashews and I would give just plain old unsalted cashews five stars, so it takes a lot to get a snack that's naturally five stars for me down to two stars, and that something is lots and lots of pepper.<br /><br />There's certainly more than a hint of pepper on these cashews.  There's actually so much that I can hardly tell I am eating cashews at all.  So, if you feel compelled to eat cashews for health reasons, like you need the fat that you'd get by sitting down in front of your favorite TV show and wolfing down a tin of 'em, and you don't want to taste them too much, I would recommend this product.  Otherwise, this is just overkill.

review/text: We opened and tried these cashews, and they were soon gone!  The predominant flavors of the sea salt and black pepper complement each other well.  The sea salt presents a more rounded and subtle salt sensation than ordinary table salt, and the onion, spice and natural flavor listed on the ingredients list no doubt to the excellent finish.<br /><br />If you eat the contents of a whole container in one sitting, as we did, you may find them a bit to salty.  This is not noticeable when eating just a few.

review/summary: It's All About The Pepper; It Just Sneaks Up On You
review/text: Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews is all about the pepper. The sea salt is nice, but it's a bit too light on these cashews. But the pepper....ahhh....the pepper.  It tastes soooo good, then the heat sneaks up on you for a good tongue curling, throat clenching burn.<br /><br />My husband adamantly told me to give this product a bad review. Why? Because Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews are ADDICTING to him. He can't stay away from them and doesn't know to eat these in moderation. LOL!<br /><br />Peppercorn's punchy taste is usually a turn-off for me. But for these Emerald cashews, it works. I've tasted other salt & pepper cashew combinations, but I like Emerald's version best. Maybe it's because of the sea salt (yummy!), or perhaps it's the quality of the cashews. Whichever it is, it won me over despite the fact I'm not a huge peppercorn fan. However, the pepper eventually does get to me. I find a small handful is more than enough at any one time.<br /><br />Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews. The verdict: Deliciously good peppery treat with a delicious heat that sneaks up on you. It's all about the pepper with these cashews. Keep a cold drink nearby.

review/text: These are good, excellent flavor, quite fresh out of the package, but a little too salty for my taste.  Not much to add, except to note that once you taste a few of these pepper and salt coated cashews, you want more of them. I like them a lot. My friends seem to like them also, but with one complaint that the salt content was too high. Everyone else (5 people) thought they were excellent as is, and would be better if they only had a good cold beer to go with them. One person thought that there was too much pepper for such a mild tasting nut (cashews). I just caught one of my friends redhanded with their fingers in the nut jar going for more.

review/summary: Nut-licious and a pepper-lover's dream
review/text: These were a five star hit in our house. As mentioned by others, this product is not "flavored" with a hint of anything...it is generously seasoned with a decent sea salt and a (to my mouth) quality pepper. I'd say the nut holds its own for 1/3 of the taste. For us, that worked really well. This was probably the biggest hit of any nut product we've ever had. If you want pure nut and no seasoning, you'd want to run screaming from this product. You need to be a serious salt/pepper fan for it to work. It took 1 day for us to consume this 10 oz can. Not proud of that fact, but it is a measure of how much we liked them.<br /><br />I dislike the temporary nature of the nutritional information. I don't think it should peel off as soon as you open the product. Otherwise, I'd definitely seek out and purchase this product...it's a winner.

They went way overboard with the salt, however.  This really detracted from the overall quality.  If you are a big fan of very salty items, this is your snack.  If you normally prefer moderate, low, or no salt seasoning then you should pass on this one. ( Or build up some muscle mass by shake-shake-shaking the salt off as much as possible.  :)

Now, comes the "but" regarding these Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews - someone had a heavy hand with the pepper.  For us, they're really hot, too spicey to be eaten by the handful and even in smaller quantities we find ourselves reaching for something to drink.<br /><br /> They are also tasty, definitely a different flavor for cashews.  Perhaps a cocktail buffet would be a good place for them where people will just  use a spoon to serve themselves several.

review/text: I like black pepper. When I cook, I grind my own and use as much as is called for by the recipe. On those recipes that I consider "keepers" and decide to tweak, one of the most freqent changes I make is to add more pepper. I tell you all this so you will understand that I'm not a Casper Milquetoast who can't tolerate anything spicier than corn flakes. I am fond of spicy foods, and when I order them in restaurants I do NOT tell the waiter, "Mild, please".<br /><br />The idea of putting pepper on nuts is, I think, a good one and could work well. But there is just too much pepper in these. And not a little too much, a LOT too much.<br /><br />The nuts themselves seem fine. Nice and fresh with good texture. I think the amount of salt is good, but that's difficult to determine with taste buds overwhelmed by pepper.<br /><br />If Emerald would use a quarter to a half as much pepper, I think this could be a winner.

He ate two or three and begged me for a beverage to clear his mouth, saying he thought he must be "allergic" to something in them, because they "made his mouth burn."<br /><br />I'm just baffled that the seasoning is this unpleasantly strong yet sold in a cannister that suggests a mild freshness. I truly regret that I could not give Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews a higher rating.

review/summary: Very Disappointed
review/text: After having the privilege to test Emerald's Marcona Almonds, I was very much looking forward to testing their Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews.  In fact, when the box came in the mail, I raced to open it so I could try out these little gems.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what I expected to be a favorable experience turned out to be terrible.<br /><br />My first taste of these nuts was like having orange pith (the white part between the peel and the orange) fried in oil, doused in a vat of salt and sugar and dipped in black pepper.  There is virtually no cashew flavor left in these little nuts.<br /><br />I love cashews.  I have eaten them raw and roasted in many ways for years.  This experience with Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews was an assault on my taste buds.<br /><br />The salt with citric acid combination is terrible.  When you combine it with the maltodextrin AND sugar, the cashew flavor is corrupted beyond recognition.  Then adding the black pepper makes it even worse.  A handful of these *nuts* is like dumping a salt shaker in your mouth.  It is almost repulsive.<br /><br />The nuts themselves are pretty greasy as well.<br /><br />I am very sorry that these cashews were treated this way.<br /><br />I would have preferred the graceful simplicity of simple roasted cashews with a DUSTING of sea salt and black pepper over them- nothing more.  The sugar and maltodextrin ruin this mix- and the addition of citric acid makes the finish quite bitter.  I do not like these at all.<br /><br />If you love sweet things and don't mind bitterness and a mouth full of salt, you might enjoy these.  However, if you love cashews and prefer the seasonings to COMPLIMENT them instead of overpower them, pass on these.

Too often snack foods avoid pepper, or when they do use it, they overwhelm the taste of the pepper with the salt.  This product is an exception.  The tang of the sea salt mixes well the large grained black pepper.  Emerald also uses large high quality cashews for the mix and not cheap smaller nuts that they can disguise with seasoning.  I love cashews in any event, but this product is simply the best seasoned nuts I have enjoyed for some time.

review/summary: I'm a cashew purist, but...
review/text: ... this is a five-star taste treat for sure!<br /><br />Had only tasted a couple of these once before, and found them quite interesting. Cashews are a personal favorite, and have been for years. Normally don't go in for anything but lightly salted or plain cashews, and personal preference over time has ruled out the dry roasted, chocolate covered or honey roasted varieties.<br /><br />That being said, expected that black pepper and cashews could go together but must say that these these turned out to be a surprising taste treat. The nuts were high quality and had a fresh taste which combined surprisingly well with the pepper and sea salt. These are only 160 calories per serving, which is the same as a handful of regular cashews. They are a good source of iron and zinc, and have no trans fat.<br /><br />Must also note that Emerald's "On the Go" canister" is an excellent variation from the standard packaging, featuring a handy lid that seems about right to measure a single portion.<br /><br />Ingredients: roasted cashews, sea salt, peanut oil, black pepper, others.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup)<br />Servings per container: 10<br />Calories per serving: 160<br />Calories from fat: 120<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br /><br />Pros: good sized cashews, lightly salted and a nice balance with the pepper, combined with an excellent natural buttery cashew taste. No trans fat.<br /><br />Cons: oil and sodium... but it's that sea salt that makes them great.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want some really flavorsome cashews, Emerald does a tremendous job with these. Will order more of them for sure...<br /><br />For those who prefer their cashews plain, try Emerald Nuts Cashew Halves & Pieces, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4) or Emerald Nuts Whole Cashews, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4), both of which have outstanding natural buttery cashew taste, and are packaged in the same handy canister.<br /><br />Warning: any of these can be habit-forming!

review/summary: Me No Likey
review/text: I LOVE cashews but I thought that these were pretty horrible.  Well, maybe horrible is too strong of a word.<br /><br />How about I just try to share with you what tastes I experienced and you can judge for yourself whether you want to give them a try or not:<br /><br />The package design is superb, a plastic container with a screw top that also fits perfectly in your car's cup-holder.  The nuts were nice and crunchy but although I like spicy things, these tasted overly peppery to me.  After you get through that, you get hit with an onion/garlic taste that lingers.  I probably should have done it beforehand, but when I tasted this I HAD to check the ingredients.  Yes, they did indeed not only pepper the cashews, they also added onion powder.<br /><br />Sooo... If the thought of eating crunchy cashews seasoned with black pepper, onion powder and salt sound like it might be up your alley, then by all means give these a try.  Somebody out there must like these, right?

review/summary: Sea Salt and Pepper - a nice change of pace
review/text: I buy Emerald nuts of all kinds on a regular basis.  I tried these and found that the normal cashew taste was present with a very strong presence of salt and prettty spicy pepper.  I did not detect that much of an aftertaste. Consistency was pretty much normal for cashews.  I highly recommend - as an occasional alternative to the "normal" brand.  The novelty factor for a product with this much "zing" is pretty high.  What tastes really good with the first handful... could pretty well go south after too long.<br /><br />I believe that this product makes for a pretty good desk ornament - your visitors will grab one handful, rave about what a trendsetter you are, then leave you without demolishing the whole container (which happens to me regularly with their honey roasted almonds).<br /><br />One thing that worries me is that so many folks leaving reviews have complained about the aftertaste and consistency. I guess I will have to buy a few more containers to check on the quality control!!!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

review/summary: Disappointment
review/text: Recently I had the opportunity to try and review the Emerald Salted almonds.  I gave them an overwhelmingly good review, although I had some qualms about the packaging.  The flavor was excellent.<br /><br />Now I have sampled the Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews. Granted people react to seasonings (salt and pepper) in  very different ways, but  the combination of salt and pepper on the cashews was not a taste bud delight.  The combination of both flavors added to the natural goodness of the cashews was disappointing.  Perhaps it would be popular in a party mix, but eaten out of the can the spices were a little too strong and distracting.  I like the idea of sea salt as opposed to normal table salt, but the pepper was not a bonus.  Edible, but not delicious...

review/text: Since I had liked the Emerald Marcona Almonds, 11.5oz Canister (Pack of 4) better than I thought I would and since I like cashews anyway, I was sure that I would like Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashew, 10oz Canister (Pack of 4).  What I didn't anticipate was how much I would LOVE them!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1CQP2">Salt & Pepper</a> makes an entertaining movie crime fighting duo, and in hair color it sounds a little better than "going gray", but as a flavor it did not appeal to me...<br /><br />until now.  I had planned to ration them out by the lid full per day, but the whole ten ounces was gone in a couple of hours.  I guess I should consider myself lucky that Amazon only sent me one canister to sample!  Some might consider the flavor a bit strong, especially if they enjoy the bare cashew taste, which is all but obliterated here.<br /><br />(sigh)<br /><br />Yet another temptation I must learn to resist!<br /><br />Note: I'm simply going to have to take their word for it that the "Twist-on lid locks in freshness" because mine didn't last long enough to test the claim.

review/summary: Pepper Pow!
review/text: Oh yum yum yum. Double plus tasty. A pow! of pepper followed by a strong left hook of salty nutty knockout.  These nuts be good.<br /><br />So the subtle taste of cashews is lost.  So there is also some sugar and maltodextrin in the mix.  But if you like the taste of black pepper and are looking for a bold (i.e. super strong, maybe even a burning aftertaste) experience from just a few nuts then this is it.  Good for just having a small handfull, or will be good sprinkled on an otherwise bland bed of lettice.  The light canister is egonomic, but won't be accepted by recycling programs as the plastic is index 7.

review/summary: Really good nuts overpowerd by the seasoning
review/text: I was looking forward to trying these Salt & Pepper Cashews as I love cashews. I am disappointed though. The seasoning just overpowers the nut. It makes you want to drink something, right now! The pepper sneaks up and gets you too! I'd expect that in a chili flavored snack, I think this should be more subtle.  It's too bad as the actual quality of the nuts is good. Whole and half pieces in good shape, not too many broken pieces.<br />I found something of interest as I read the label. It contains peanut oil. If you're allergic to peanuts but not all nuts, you need to avoid this too. Another note on the label. When you open the package you tear away the upper part of the wrapper. That takes away the top part of the nutrition label with some important information. It would have been nice to have lowered the information so it survived the opening of the package.

review/summary: Perfect Combo for Beer Drinking
review/text: Emerald's Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews come in a sturdy, ergonomically designed, green-colored plastic container with an ample twist on lid that both facilitates serving and preserves the freshness of the product. The well designed and clearly written label, however, came askew and wrinkled as it is printed in a plastic paper-like material that seems to easily slip around the two large indentations on both sides of the container.<br /><br />The cashews themselves were of an excellent quality, with superb size, texture and freshness. The flavor experience, on the other hand, is open to interpretation. I have never used much salt in my diet so I found them salty and the pepper aftertaste marred the cashew flavor to the point of masking it. In other words, I could pretty much only taste salt and pepper with a hint of cashew. Other nuts, such as peanuts and almonds, bear seasoning better than cashews therefore the flavor concept might work better if understated. Because of my particular lack of exposure to salt I double checked my opinion with several family members and friends and without any input on my part they all pretty much agreed with me: the seasoning combo was too much for the cashews, albeit they seemed great to eat while drinking beer.<br /><br />They have 270 mg of sodium and 2.5g of saturated fat. The ingredients, however, are all natural and they provide a high iron, potassium and fiber content, as well as being cholesterol free.

review/summary: Too Salty To Handle
review/text: Yes these are sea salt and pepper cashews, however they are SO salty that neither me or my husband could handle eating them. The sea salt did have a nice flavor to it (not regular old plain salt taste). However it just was really hard to eat and then we were both thirsty for long after eating a couple of handfuls.<br /><br />We are both black pepper lovers and we loved the black pepper taste.<br /><br />If only these had perhaps 1/3 the amount of sea salt with this same amount (or more) of black pepper then they would rank a 5 star rating.<br /><br />The nuts themselves are excellent.<br /><br />I have tried other nut products from this company and loved them.

review/summary: Love the Cashews, but a little Salty
review/text: I like the Emerald brand nuts. The canister is very convenient and easy to take along. I was a bit leery about the salt and pepper flavor. It wasn't as bad as I thought. I was mainly concerned that the pepper would be too strong. I actually found the salt to be a bit overwhelming. As I got closer to the bottom of the canister, the salt taste became stronger and the nuts at the bottom were very salty-almost inedible. If you love cashews this is a nice change from just salted as the pepper gives the nut a little "kick."

review/summary: An unusual flavor combination.
review/text: I love cashews, and I love black pepper flavored potato chips, so when I saw these, I knew I had to try them.  At first taste, I wasn't sure what to make of them.  The pepper taste was strong, almost overpowering the cashew flavor.  But I soon found myself enjoying the flavor, even craving them.  This is certainly not a flavor for everyone, but if you prefer savory flavors to some of the sweeter nut varieties out there, give these a try.  And I have to once again comment that I love the canister these come in.  They fit well in a car cup-holder, and I can just pop the canister in my messenger for a between-class snack, without worrying that the container will pop open, scattering nuts everywhere.

review/text: I love cashews but wasn't so sure how I was going to like them with pepper added.  At first, I thought they were just okay.  I ate a few and then put them away.  A short while later, I found myself wanting a few more and this seemed to just keep happening.  The pepper makes for an interesting flavor, and when combined with the sea salt - well, they became strangely addictive.  I recommend anyone who likes cashews to give them a try!  The only reason I gave them 4 stars, though, was that some of the cashews were overwhelmed with salt.

review/text: I have to admit I wouldn't normally throw pepper on my cashews but I liked the combination. There are other flavors as well (a hint of garlic, I think) so the label be slightly misleading. This product is definitely worth trying. My teen loved it too and it disappeared quickly in our house.<br /><br />If you like unique flavor combinations and are willing to kick things up a notch, give this product a try. Odds are, you won't regret it, if the preferences of several teens, 2 adults and one bird (who flew down and ate a couple of dropped pieces - we were outside) gives you something to go on.<br /><br />Some other details that might be of interest: not too salty, large sized cashews, nicely roasted. There. That should do it :) Enjoy!

review/text: These reminded me of seasoned nuts I've purchased at the Indian grocery in the past, but ten times better. The cashews themselves are fresh and large with a good rich cashew taste. The pepper and salt add a wonderful flavor and the result is a very pleasant snack with a great aftertaste that kept me going back for more and more. Yes, they were a tad salty (especially the last 1/4 of the canister) but to me that was the only drawback. I can see how, if someone did NOT like spicy or peppery foods, they might be "too bold" as others have said, but come on, they are salt and PEPPER flavor...what do you expect?<br /><br />I plan to get some more in the near future...my canister is empty!

review/text: I love cashews but often steer clear of anything I haven't tried (yep creature of habit) however, when 'Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews' came up for review I figured - what the heck - might as well give them a try.  The pepper is just enough to add an enticing spiciness to the nuts without overpowering them and the seasalt is perfect.<br /><br />I figured I'd snack on a few and save the rest for later, well I'd eat a few close it up and minutes later open the container right back up to nab a 'few' more.<br /><br />Will this replace my standard flavors - no, but I definitely won't overlook them and assume they aren't going to be to my liking anymore - I now know better.<br /><br />Of course my husband is laughing at me because he's been eating salt and pepper potato chips for about the past year and I refused to even try them.

review/text: After enjoying the Emerald Marcona Alomonds, I was really looking forward to the cashews. I love cashews and thought the Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper would be great.  However, it was evident with my first handful that there was way too much salt and pepper for my taste.  Maybe that was a good thing because it slowed down the momentum of how I usually eat cashews. Each time I had more, I had to wet a paper towel to soak up the excess seasoning.<br /><br />I quite imagine that for recipes that call for cashews, the pre-seasoning would probably be a welcomed addition.

review/summary: An Acquired Taste
review/text: I've been partial to Emerald's products so my favorable reaction to this one comes as no surprise to me.  However, I would warn that this may not be to everyone's taste - at least at first.  The sea salt definitely has more kick than the usual salted nuts and the pepper gives it a decided bite.  For those whose taste in nuts tend more towards sweeter concoctions, this may be a bit much.  But for those who like dark beer, strong coffee, and snacks with attitude, this is a welcome treat.
