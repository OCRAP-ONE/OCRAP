review/summary: No sugar cravings
review/text: Im 19 and was taking this for my skin and was hoping for breast growth. ( saw very little results ) but this herb keeps my sugar cravings under control! My cravings get terrible to where I get irratible and can't get sweets out of my head! With this stuff I was able to lose a bit of weight from a decreased appetite! You will be surprised how often cravings trick you into thinking you want food. Anyway also in conjunction with other herbs I've noticed more curves and a bigger butt. Boobs are semi larger but I'm losing hope with those. I will honestly take fenugreek for the rest of my life! Take that chocolate bar!

review/summary: not effective
review/text: Before I ordered this product, I read the review and decided to give it a try. I don't know about the others but personally, it was not effective for me. . I exclusively breastfed my baby for 6 months and I was producing at least 5 4oz-bottle a day and after 6 months, I don't know what happened but I produce less and less so I tried this product. Used this product for 2 weeks and drank a lot of liquids but still I have not produced as much as I was expecting I will produce. I only produced 2 bottles a day. So, now I stopped using it. I don't know if I did not use it right or it is not really effective.

review/summary: Wonder-full supplement
review/text: Fenugreek seed helps with digestion if you are not a new mother and breastfeeding.  From what I observed, my digestion became more evenly spaced over time, and I was hungry for food later than without taking the fenugreek.  I did not take the supplement regularly, however, and gave it to my sister who breastfeeds.  I can report her good news that the product works wonders for mothers and babies.  If you are a new mother and want an abundance of milk at your baby's feedings, I recommend this product and brand to you.

review/summary: Works in combination with Blessed Thistle!
review/text: I wanted to write a review since I didn't see many from moms who took Fenugreek while nursing an older baby, as opposed to a newborn. After we sleep trained my daughter and she began sleeping through the night at 8 months, my milk supply started to drop way more than I wanted it to. This may have also been because I was taking a b-vitamin supplement which included B6, which women take to suppress lactation !! (I know, I was kicking myself once I found this out!). I started taking 3 capsules of Fenugreek and 2 capsules of Blessed Thistle 3x a day (at meals), and increased my daytime feedings. To my relief, within 2 days my milk supply definitely increased. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: It's hard to say if this works, but I'm going to keep using
review/text: Before returning to work from maternity leave at 7 weeks, I'd already started exclusively pumping. Getting about 8oz per session. (Reading all the documentation about it, I was probably overproducing) The first week back at work was fine, no decrease. Second week, each day I was getting 1-2oz less a session. Third week, it dipped down even lower -losing 3-4oz/session. (So total, each session I was getting 2.5-3 oz- baby needs 4!) I started using FenuGreek, and maybe noticed an increase of about .5-1oz per session (taking 2 pills 3x a day). 4th week, I took 3 pills 3x a day...and this gave me an extra 1oz/session. I was producing just enough (barely) to keep up with baby and NOT enough to freeze any.<br /><br />I increased pumping sessions, to every 3 hours like clockwork- even throughout the night. This seemed to help. Luckily baby sleeps 6-7 hours now at night, so I could pump an extra bottle out during that time to make up for what I was lacking throughout the day.<br /><br />Side note: what helped me the MOST I feel - is stopping birth control. The dr. put me on BC at week 7, just as I stared back to work. When your supply is low, you'll try ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to get it back, so it's hard to say how much the FenuGreek helped. After 2 months of BC and FenuGreek I was keeping up, but just barely. On mo. 3, I stopped BC (still using FenuGreek) and with the added pumping sessions I now make enough for baby, and can freeze one 4oz bottle a day, and always have  3-4 bottles in the fridge at any given time - a must for daycare and the working mom! I'd rather use backup contraception than not breastfeed at all!

review/summary: Did the trick for me
review/text: I started taking these 3 pills 3 times a day with plenty of water and pumping and was able to stash at least 10oz or more in the freezer everyday.  I'm a working mom so I pump before I leave for work and then 3-4 times during my 9hr work day and feed on demand when I'm home with my daughter.  I was also drinking milkmaid tea twice a day.  I'm sure if it was the combination of the two but I was very happy with the results.  My freezer is overflowing with milk and I have plenty in the fridge for daycare everyday.  I never had a problem with any of the side effects other complained of but I did have a break in use for about two weeks or so.  I was still able to produce enough with out it but I liked the idea of stashing plenty for rainy days.  I'm not a fan of the maple syrup smell in my sweat & urine though.

review/summary: for my sister
review/text: I purchased this for my sister while sitting in the NICU with her and her newborn twins. She had been pumping trying to get her milk to come in so it could be provided for her 32 weekers:) She was very nervous as she had poor supply with her first child and now to try it with two, it seemed a challenge to say the least.<br />I searched nearby stores to try and find this supplement as it came recommended from several sources. I was unable to find it in our immediate area and so I went to "old faithful" amazon and found it here. I was pleased to locate it, but it didn't take a few days longer than I would have liked, although ordering them on my account and being able to have them shipped directly to her was convenient as we  live in different states.<br />I thought the price was a dollar or two higher than what I desired to pay, compared to other supplements for health. Nursing women is a positive thing for baby and mom and so making these supplements a bit more affordable may be something to consider.<br />All in all, I would recomend this product and seller, but I would still search for it at a slightly lower cost, if tie was not an issue.

review/text: I have to say that I was skeptical at first to try, but the pediatrician gave me the go ahead to take it.  My baby was highly allergic to baby formula plus she was a tiny baby.  I had to find something to increase my milk supply to help increase her birth weigh quickly.  I read every amazon review and I want to write one to also help another mom.  You may or the baby may get gassy but no pains...every baby is different.  This Fenugreek capsules works! It definitely increases your milk supply. If you are an organic fanatic, they sell it too but both capsules look identical.  Good luck to all the nursing moms.

review/summary: Has made a difference for me.
review/text: I have had a low breastmilk supply from the very beginning and have tried just about everything to increase it.  At the recommendation of a lactation consultant I started taking 4 capsules 3 times a day.  Within 48 hours I saw an ounce increase with each pump (which was huge for me).  It has continued to improve and I have been taking fenugreek for about 5 weeks.<br /><br />The downsides:  when I first started taking it it made my stomach a bit upset, but after about a week it was fine and everything was back to normal.  You will start to smell like maple syrup, I can think of worse things to smell like!<br /><br />Overall I really feel like this is helping my supply.  I will continue to take it until I am no longer breastfeeding.

review/summary: For nursing support
review/text: I bougth this to use while nursing my newborn.  I started taking it when she was 2 days old.  Nursing has been great, she gets plenty of milk & I have no concerns about running out of milk.  This is my 3rd time nursing and this time has been the easiest, i dont know for sure if it's because of the fenugreek, but all i can say is that my baby is super happy.  so i would reccommend it if you are concerend about running low on milk.  Also, i read that this herb also is a great breast health support in general, and can help prevent breast cancer, which runs in my family.  So i will definatly continue taking it even after i'm done nursing!  Plus, i gave 5 stars b/c amazon has the best price for this.  I checked 3 other popular health stores and the best price is online!!

review/summary: Watch out for bees
review/text: Fenugreek worked for me. After my milk supply started to diminish after going back to work I tried Fenugreek. I had to take quite a bit of it though for my milk to sustain my boy's hardy appetite. I never had an over-abundance of milk but I was at least able to get what he needed. The only side effect I had was my sweat smelled of maple syrup. My son also smelled like it. When I went outside I actually attracted bees! It became quite the joke between my friends and myself. It was worth it though to be able to continue feeding him on my own.<br />My poor second son was allergic to my milk so I wasn't able to see if it worked. I'll be trying it again with my 3rd son (due in a couple months) if I can't keep up with him. Bees or no Bees!

review/summary: Part of my regimen!
review/text: I have had milk supply issues since the day my baby was born, in part due to PCOS and hypothyroidism.  After both my lactation consultant and my baby's pediatrician recommended fenugreek, I finally tried it.  I have worked my way up to 4 capsules, 4 times a day, plus blessed thistle, goat's rue, alfalfa and domperidone.  Only after several weeks of this combination have I finally been able to stop supplementing with formula!!  I don't know which products are doing the trick, or if they truly are each contributing, but I wouldn't stop taking a single one and risk losing my supply.  For the record, though, I started fenugreek first and noticed an increase, though it wasn't until I had this whole combination that my supply has become sufficient.  I highly recommend fenugreek, and after trying several brands, I feel Nature's Way is superior to some others out there.

review/text: Now I have to give this product a 3, because yes it works, but there were some complications. I did not notice a difference right away like some mothers. It was about 3 days after taking 3 capsules 3x a day that i had an increase in my supply. I was able to pump about 2 oz after each feeding prior  to taking the fenugreek, then it increased to about 6 oz after each feeding (i was storing for returning to work) About the time I started getting a result, my son was getting the side effects of horrible tummy pains. It made him constipated to where he didn't have a bm for 7 days, and he stayed up for almost 20 hrs straight screaming at one point. (he was about 2 months old and a very happy baby normally.) For this reason I had to discontinue use. I would recomend it for mothers who are having issues with their milk supply, because this is not the case for all babies, and the product works, but i would recomend discontinuing use at the first sign of a gassy fussy baby because it takes several days to get baby comfortable again once it starts- I got NO sleep for 4 days in a row.... yuck.

It wasnt until almost more than half of the bottle done I decided to do more research and found out that this was the reason why all of a sudden I was noticeably gaining weight :(.  I will stop taking it starting TODAY!  but will con't pumping while at work and nursing even if I have to wake up in the middle of the night to keep my flow going.  I hope to stick with Blessed Thistle and Mothers Milk Tea Bags hopefully there are no more unwanted surprises.

review/summary: Ask yor doctor about possible side effects
review/text: Use with caution. When my baby was 5 weeks old I noticed that my milk supply was decreasing. I was taking 2 pills 3 times a day for about a week when I started felling really sick. I head strong headaches, I was weak and I had problem with breathing. My baby had a cough and was spitting up milk. She could not swallow, the mucus in her mouth was very thick. I learned from my doctor that fenugreek has very dangerous side effects: it can cause asthma;  reduces blood glucose levels which means it is not right for diabetics; promotes menstrual flow and can make yor menstrual cycles abnormal. I spent money on pills, teas, drops and my milk supply did not increase at all. I can breastfeed my baby only once a day now. I am happy with what I can give her although I see clearly that she hates formula. I give only one star because the manufacturer does not warn about side effects the product can have on mother and her child. I bet they know the pills are used mostly for the purpose of increasing breastmilk supply, yet they do not care about us.

review/summary: Great for runny noses!
review/text: Fenugreek has many different purposes and uses. The one that we take it for is either Runny noses or stuffed up noses when we start to get colds. This really works great. We will normally take Astragalus along with Fenugreek when we start to notice we are either stuffed up or have a runny nose. The two seem to work great together. The way that we use it isn't an every day vitamin, it's more of a 'when you are sick' vitamin. Depending on how bad it is, we will either take it once a day, or once in the morning and once in the evening.<br /><br />Hope this helped you out!

I use fenugreek to increase breastmilk supply, though the label does NOT indicate that use for it.

review/summary: Milk is flowing
review/text: I bought these for my wife whose had a tough time with breastfeeding. She had a C-section so it was about 4-5 hours before the hospital let our daughter nurse for the first time. Unfortunately my wife went home without getting things figured out and things got even tougher. The lactation nurse helped on an outpatient basis and strongly suggested Fenugreek. I purchased this right away and it was taken with each meal. Finally my daughter had that well-fed-can-barely-keep-my-eyes-open look on her face after nursing. Fenugreek taken 3 times a day has been the best advice we've received so far for breastfeeding. Even if your infant isn't crying, feed him/her at least every three hours maybe more if you can do it. Also, my daughter was an excellent sleeper and her pediatrician said to wake her up and encourage her to nurse. These suggestions along with the Fenugreek increased my wife's milk supply and made for a happy, healthy and chubby baby.

I am not sure exactly how much my 3 months old drinks when I nurse him directly but he seems to be happy with flowing milk!  This product is one of many things I try to increase the milk supply so I don't know if only this herb helped it, but I believe it did by seeing much difference in pump mount.. Anyway, I'll keep taking it since it is easy to take in capsules.

review/summary: Organic endocrine disruptor!?
review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: BPA? Yes and no...
review/text: I contacted Muir Glen directly and asked whether or not their cans contained BPA. You can see their response below:<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Muir Glen about bisphenol-A or BPA.<br /><br />Bisphenol-A is a component of protective coatings in metal food packaging, and provides an important food safety and quality function in canned foods. Scientific and governmental bodies worldwide have examined the science many times and have concluded that the weight of evidence supports the safety of BPA, including recent comprehensive assessments in Japan and in the European Union.<br /><br />In January 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced another review of BPA. This review in expected to take 18-24 months, and Health Canada and the World Health Organization (WHO) will participate.<br /><br />Most metal cans in the food industry utilize BPA in the can lining or can lid. Some of our products do, and many competitors' products do as well.<br /><br />Muir Glen continues to believe BPA is safe. However, we know that some of our consumers have wanted us to pursue alternatives. We have been working with our can suppliers and can manufacturers to develop and test alternative linings that do not use BPA for some time.<br /><br />One alternative has proven safe and viable in our processing of tomatoes - and Muir Glen is in the midst of transitioning to cans with liners that do not use BPA. It is an approved non-epoxy alternative. Can coatings used by Muir Glen also comply fully with all applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements for safe use in food contact applications.<br /><br />Your views are important to us. Again, thank you for contacting Muir Glen, and thank you for your support of our products.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Consumer Services"

review/summary: Dishonest labeling of "organic" when cans contain BPA
review/text: I chose these tomatoes because they are labeled "organic."  Since then I've discovered Muir Glen's cans contain BPA (in the lining).<br /><br />Because research shows solid levels of this chemical leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams, from infants to the elderly, I don't think this product can ethically be called organic!<br /><br />Most people empty cans of foods, such as tomatoes, directly into their recipes without thinking of washing them first. (How does one rinse or wash broth or soup, by the way?) In fact, many people like the salt and other seasonings in canned foods, and therefore, never consider rinsing them away. They believe it is safe to use the foods just as they are in the can, which is a reasonable assumption since that is how such products are marketed. Many, if not most, Americans do not yet realize that there is a problem and they are unwittingly feeding that problem to their families.<br /><br />There is something especially unethical and tragic about people paying a company higher prices for organic foods, thinking they are better protecting their health, only to be swallowing BPA with each mouthful, with many feeding it, an endocrine disruptor, to their children.<br /><br />BPA leeching into food is no better or safer than food grown with pesticides. Therefore, until Muir Glen stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks for either context.

review/summary: Great seasoning, perhaps not extremely fresh
review/text: We bought this for some Basque guests we had visiting. Strangely enough, they were really not familiar with it; it is from the French Basque areas (our visitors were from the basque areas of Spain). However, Gerald Hirigoyen refers to it multiple times in his "Pintxos" (Basque tapas) cookbook [a great resource with lots of wonderful recipes]. It's a fun spice to use for traditional Basque dishes. It is pretty close to paprika in flavor and character. It is NOT spicy hot or smoky like some other dried pimento pepper products from the region. Goes well with eggs, meats, and fish. I feel that the jar we received was either not very fresh or else the spice itself is just not that intense in flavor; don't really have any broader experience to compare it with. It does, however, have the complex flavor that Hirigoyen attributes to it and it would be hard to come up with a replacement seasoning if you have a recipe that calls for it.

review/summary: Better Than The Nutrition Label Indicates
review/text: Upon arrival, I read the nutrition info myself on the cereal box and was pleasantly surprised to find they were better than Amazon's listing. They have 6 grams of fiber (balanced soluble and insoluble fiber) in a 1 ounce (28 gram=3/4 cup) serving and only 5 grams of sugars, all for only 100 calories. All this isn't worth much though, if they don't taste good, right? Well, they are good, very yummy, even out of the box. They are rather like "Life" cereal, regular flavor, just a bit less stripped of the good stuff in taste. The whole grains really shine through and they tend to stay crispy in milk much longer. I enjoyed a bowl of them topped with just a fine bit of honey so that the flax seeds I topped them with would stick and not sink to the bottom, a bowl plain with milk, and also a bowl made into a "Muddy Buddies" healthy version. I bought these initially to make the recipe "Muddy Buddies/Puppy Chow" recipe healthier (using alternatively sweetened chocolate, freshly ground almond or peanut butters and some date sugar to toss in after coating. These would also be a great alternative choice for other "Chex" cereal recipes. I like them so much, I will give up my usual choices in cereal that provide the same, or less, amount of fiber for TWICE the calories and that also soak up too much milk in the bowl. Give these a try, they won't replace some of the worst offending sugar laden "kid's" cereals with no one noticing, but these are really a good choice and tasty, and are always handy for those "chex mix" recipes with a healthier spin. If a sugar addict really needs more sweetening, just let them top these with a better choice in sweetener of your own choice, not a giant company's choice in what makes them the most profit. Best of all, we can have something affordable we like the taste of without supporting these huge companies that are ruining our health and economy , as well as putting the family farmers out of business. I can't think of any reasons why I wouldn't recommend these.

review/text: My local Whole Foods sells Nature's Path products for $3.79 a box, so this Amazon.com price is an excellent deal.<br /><br />The cereal is hearty and crunchy, although it becomes soft in a few short minutes when submerged in milk. I sometimes add a little sweetner, as sugar is not added artificially. My housemate (who grew up in France & Italy), loves this cereal, as he says it reminds him of his European 'grainy' musli-style cereals. However, I am not a big fan of what is sold as 'Musli' or 'Muslix' in this country and Heritage Bites are nothing like this.<br /><br />Think Chex style bites and crunch, without the Chex fake crunch, slimy coating, preservatives and sugars.

review/summary: Great cereal that doesn't get old
review/text: I've been eating this cereal for years and enjoy it very much. The mixture of all the different grains results in a great taste and health benefits. Also, this cereal soaks up milk pretty fast, which means that it's quick to eat because you really don't need to wait for it to soak at all - pour in milk, pour in cereal, wait maybe 30 seconds at most, and start eating! Otherwise it will get soggy.<br /><br />Also, I've been eating this cereal on an almost daily basis for many years and still haven't gotten tired of it. My only complaint is that the way Amazon ships it results in a little too much pulverized cereal at the bottom of the box.

review/text: This cereal is like Chex only healthier.  It has outstanding flavor, and stays crunchy in milk for a resonable time.  It's a great way to get the nutritional benefits of all different grains (before they were genetically modified) wrapped up in great flavor. Get some!  You won't be sorry!

The sad part was when i recieved, it was stale and HARD TOO!!! Im so upset but I dont want to call them up again. So overall the flavor it so gooooodd but dont order it unless you like your candy stale. But i also ordered the rainbow quatro belts and they are great and not hard! try those out instead!!

review/summary: hard, wadded up, dried up, arrives in a trash bag
review/text: I have ALWAYS been impressed with shipping/handling/delivery of every pkg I  have received from Amazon-and there have been hundreds in all departments! So, when this candy arrived in a beat-up, huge box, along with my other order of 6 bags of carmel corn, with no padding-i was shocked! the belts actually looked like they were pulled off a factory conveyer belt by the handful and thrown into a cheap clear garbage bag that was full of sugar & wadded at top then, halfway heat sealed, along with what used to be carmel corn but now looks like corn meal from having been bashed by 6.6# of the candy-I was SHOCKED! There was sugar everywhere!  Everytime I moved box or bags, that sugar was on me, the floor, table, sofa! What made matters worse, the 6 bags of carmel corn were heat sealed in & to a large plastic bag! So,  when you opened the big bag, each small bag was now stuck to it & had to be cut out! Since, they were smashed into nearly a corn meal, it leaked out & follwed the fate of the sugar. There was no invoice inside,the label on candy was heat scorched & ripped!! this left me not knowing anything abt the candy,where it came from, exp. date? and no one or # to call.I'm hoping an Amazon official will read this & make things right. I love shopping this sight & have NEVER left a bad review. But then again, i've never had my foyer & living rm. & myself covered in sugar & popcorn crumbs. I hope no one else had to experience this fate, but if you did, please state so. This way Amazon can track this bad shipment packer down  & eliminate this problem.

review/text: :) Well my honey recommended this for help in healing a freshly stitched up chainsaw induced wound. Well how sweet it is... it not only accelerated the process but helped take some of the sting out of the experience. I did not apply directly into the wound at first....just around the edges. I did this at night, covering up the sticky stuff with a large bandage tapped securely in place & left it on as i slept. After the wound closed i lightly applied it directly on it about every other day for a week.<br />My recovery was quick....so quick i did not need to use allot. Now i am in the next phase of my recovery, scar reduction & physical therapy & doing great. Proper wound management care is essential from day 1 until fully recovered as the better job you do the better your chances of a quick & complete recovery. So if you have your antennas out looking for something above & beeyond your standard remedy i recommend trying this sweet stuff & sticking to it :)

The flavors have a bitter edge to them. I kept trying different flavors from different sources - even at Amazon on the Internet - and cannot tell you how disappointed we are. I now have over 100 packets in my cupboard that no one will eat.  I find that they can be used for no-bake cookies so they won't totally go to waste.  This cereal has been a favorite of my family for generations but unless it changes for the better, it will be history in our household.

review/summary: Munching Goodness
review/text: Having grown up with Triscuit as an occasional treat, I was delighted, not to mention a bit nervous, when Kashi put out their own version of the "woven" whole grain cracker. Previous attempts have, in my opinion, missed the boat, and Kashi, for whatever reason, has been putting the occasional odd ingredient in some of their products making them inedible to certain parts of the population.  Kashi Heart To Heart Whole Grain Crackers Original are one of their sure hits.  There is no dairy included in these crackers where there is in some of Kashi's other crackers.<br /><br />The texture is perfect lending the cracker an excellent bite as well as denseness that will hold up to whatever you want to put on them--I haven't tried it yet but I suspect that they will even hold a bit of sauce.  Little pizzas!<br /><br />The taste is close to Triscuit but not the same.  If I were to have a side-by-side taste-testing of the two crackers, the Triscuit would fail for two reasons:  The Kashi cracker is a bit thicker and provides a more satisfying crunch.  Additionally, the Kashi cracker is far less salty than the Triscuit.  I have not compared the sodium counts here, just the flavor.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend Kashi Heart-to-Heart Whole Grain Crackers for flavor, crunch and this: when that emotional need to ar#@!gh comes, these crackers make a lovely foil to keep you from doing just that.  They are also a great munch.

review/text: We have bought a lot of Kashi Heart to Heart crackers since DH had a heart attack last year, but we've never tried the originals. I didn't realize it, but these are the woven wheat type of cracker like Triscuits, not crackers like the other ones we've been buying. They are not as salty as Triscuits (or they couldn't claim to be heart-healthy), but if you make heart-healthy spreads to put on them using flavorful salt substitutes, you won't miss the salt. They can be used for everything you'd use Triscuits for. I'm really glad these are available.

review/summary: Does not dry overnight; thick gel hard to apply evenly
review/text: Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make "ladybug spots and antennae," which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug "heads") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.

I have found out that at least with my old bread machine I get a better loaf with the rapid rise wheat cycle and light crust... Am ordering again...

review/summary: I got horrible food poisoning from this soup yesterday
review/text: I've had this soup a number of times before.  Not only do I agree with the other reviewer that the quality of the soup has gown way down over time, but I had a can of it for lunch yesterday and got really sick, still am dealing with stomach problems today and am unable to go to work because i'm so weak and dehydrated.  I haven't had food poisoning like this since I lived in Ecuador over 5 years ago.  If i were you, i'd stay away from this brand all together, it's not worth the risk.  Not sure who else I can tell about this to try to get a recall of the soup.  It seriously made me violently ill, coming out both ends for hours and hours.

review/summary: Sad misuse of trade reputation
review/text: Years ago Dominique's New England clam Chowder was by far the best canned chowder available, He apparently sold the rights to his trade name and did not have any further control over the recipe. Over time, the manufacturer made several unfortunate changes to the recipe, apparently not realizing that to try to compete on price was futile. Soup sold through regular (non-gourmet) channels and priced a few cents higher than Campbell's won't sell. A truly premium product priced 50% higher might succeed. What we have today is a chowder in the identical can it has always used. The can looks the same, but the soup inside is now no better than several chowders available in grocery stores. It is a non-premium product trading on a destroyed reputation. It may be a blessing that it is now hard to find. To complete the tragedy, Campbell's probably makes the beset chowder available today, though it is not very good.
