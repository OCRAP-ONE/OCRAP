review/summary: Newman's Own
review/text: My cat eats well and has good digestion.  Last spirng I switched her from Science Diet to Orijen, which had been recommended to me by the owner of one of those fancy pet stores in downtown LA.  He said the it was low in carbohidrates and all natural. Within months she began bleeding.  I took her to the vet who recommended that I start feeding her plain canned turkey cat food until they could find out what was going on, which I did.  That episode costs me $600.00.  After a course of antibiotics I went back to Orijen and she immediately started bleeding again so I threw the Orijen out.  I started with Newman's Own six months ago and have never looked back.  My cat is happy with the food and there is no sign of blood anywhere.  I recommend Newman's Own.

review/summary: All our cats love it!
review/text: I've tried a number of all natural/organic wet food brands for my fur babies, and they seem to like Newman's the best. They wont' even touch some brands, and when I'm spending over $1 per can, I can't afford to buy food they won't eat. Newman's seems to have really good ingredients that I can feel good about giving them, they all love it, and it's priced reasonable on Amazon, compared to the $2/can for organic stuff at my local stores.

review/summary: Watch for dented cans. I will re-rate this product later
review/text: The last 3 cases I've ordered had some dented cans located in the center of the case. I've read other coplaints about this also and wanted to warn potential buyers. The problem is not with amazon but with the manufacturer and how the cans are selected to be stocked inside the cardboard flats. I keep ordering for convenience and love Amazon. My cat loves the product and it is hard to find locally or stocked in a store far away. I sift through every case to make sure the seal hasn't been broken on any dented cans and usually throw away a few. My next case arrives in about a week. If it is dent free, I will revise my review and rating.

review/summary: Inconsistent in product quality
review/text: This is my fist batch from amazon of the salmon and chicken formula. Purchase 3 cases from another pet food store and our cat loved it. When we opened this new one from Amazon, it didn't smell the same as the last batch, this one smelled like rotten fish and the last one smelled good. We have tried to give this new one to our cat and he refused to eat it (when he would beg for the other one and finish it promptly). I inspected both a can from this new batch and a can from the old batch and everything is the same including all ingredients. The only difference I could find was the older batch had a 2014 date on the bottom printed a little differently from the 2015 best by date the the new one....? I don't understand why this product has such inconsistent quality or maybe Newman's is not making the same quality product as they used to. Too bad since I would like to find a organic cat food that is not super expensive cause I'm not going to buy this one again.

review/text: I am very happy with this product. Not only is it organic without any by-products but my 2 older cats love it! I bought a case shipped and sold by Amazon LLC so I got free shipping and a good price. Unfortunately when I tried to buy another case the next month Amazon was investigating a problem they were having with the shipping or something and so I am going to have to look elsewhere for my Newmann's Own cat food until they resolve the issue. I am pretty sad about that but otherwise the cat food is great!

review/summary: I wish this worked with our little darlings!
review/text: I do all the research before buying pet food.  I had high hopes that this one would work with out kibble eating cats as one of them needed to eat food containing more moisture as well as healthy ingredients.  When I opened the first can it smelled and looked good.  I was confident our cats would scarf it up and beg for more.  No way.  They made dainty little burying movements and then walked away.  All I could think of was how much I had spent for such puny results.  Now we are back to using the top grade of kibble and Fancy Feast, which our cats will eat.  However, the good news is that everyone we gave some to from the first case reported back that their cats loved it and they were going to keep using it.  Fancy Feast is cheaper so that is good, but I have no idea what is in the product.  I just trust that our cats are getting enough moisture.  I do regret that we are not using  Newman's Own product since I like their philosophy.

review/summary: Almost a 5
review/text: I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.  It is great because this food is supposed to go to the cat at room temperature.  Unfortunately,  I believe I checked when I was considering changing to these smaller cans and found that they are more expensive for the amount my cat eats per day than the larger cans.  The only reason I don't give this product a 5 can be remedied by either Newman's Own or Amazon.  I am a prime member but since subscribe and save does not use prime I have to double order.  There are 24 cans so prime once a month (regular shipping time vs. 2 day prime makes it longer than once a month) won't keep my cat feed for the month.  I don't understand why subscribe and save does not honor prime membership.  When customers choose subscribe and save they are giving Amazon long-term consistent business. I guess if Newman's Own packed 40 or 48 cans it would work better with subscribe and save.

review/summary: Cats like it
review/text: I have two Siamese kittens who are on a mostly all canned food diet. The Chicken & Salmon formula is one of the foods in their current rotation. They seem to really enjoy eating it, although I wouldn't say it's their favorite food. You can see bits of the ingredients (rice?) in the food, and the texture is not too firm, but certainly more firm than a pate-style food. I have already ordered my second case, and plan to order more in the future. These 5.5 oz cans fit the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084E66">Petmate Kitty-Kap Can Cover</a> quite well.

review/summary: I loved that it was organic! My cat- not so much...
review/text: I purchased the Chicken & Salmon formula with the notion that- Hey! I watch what I eat, My kitty should too! Needless to say, my cat Mia was less than thrilled. In fact, she took two wiffs and walked away :( Granted I was feeding her Fancy Feast before- which I recently found out is like feeding your cat Mcdonald's every day! Super tasty but void of any nutritional benefits whats-soever... So after a few unsuccessful meal times, I tried spiking her meal with a dash of Fancy Feast? No dice. She ate the Fancy Feast and I swear gave me this look like- 'Nice Try Bucco- and you thought you were SOOO sneaky...'<br /><br />So to the previous Fancy Feast feeders- I say maybe try something else to slowly get your cat onto the health track? Or you might end up like me with 20 cans of food I can't use :( I've been trying other brands that have more gravy- with slightly more success! (Emphasis on the slightly-she drinks up all the liquid and I'm left with chicken strips!) Maybe I have a oober picky cat? But I'm thinking I will keep on trying and probably give this one another run once I've detoxed her from her fast food craves..

review/summary: Best Choice for my Cats
review/text: I tried literally everything, from high end to low end, before settling on Newman's Own.  The reason?  All of my 5 cats enjoy the flavor (organic turkey) and come running when it is time to eat.  I feed them Newman's Own organic dry cat food as well, so their diet is about half and half.  I have one cat that suffers from IBS. She has to take prednisone daily, so I'm hoping the change in food will improve her condition.  Though Newman's products are expensive, I believe the organic ingredients will make a big difference in my cats' overall health, which in turn will mean fewer trips to the vet and more money in my pocket.  Besides that, I love the fact that there is strict quality control and oversight in everything that goes into a can or a bag, and all the proceeds from the sale of Newman's Own pet food are donated back to animal shelters and the SPCA.  No profit to me means that this company really does have the cats' welfare at heart.

review/summary: Super Finicky Cat Loves It!
review/text: This is for the Chicken & Brown Rice Canned Cat Food Formula<br /><br />My cat (now 15 yrs old) has always been a picky eater.  The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food. But alas, they discontinued that product line, switching to pouches and tubs (both of which he refuses to eat).  He will eat 9 Lives from time to time, but it gives him gas and appears to be high in fat (based on the pool of fat when can is dumped out in dish).  I have desperately tried numerous brands and flavors of cats foods for a number of years, but to no avail (Some brands and flavors I could get him to eat for a day or two, but then he refuses to eat it any longer).<br /><br />Then I came across Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice at Dillon's Grocery (owned by Krogers) during a stay in Hutchinson, Kansas and he LOVES IT!  And, it appears to be fairly low in fat, which is a huge plus for an elderly cat with liver troubles (he currently has to be given Denosyl, which is also available on Amazon, to keep his liver in check).<br /><br />For those unaware, a cat with liver troubles is recommended to receive a low fat, low sodium diet, with no fish meal and no organ meat.  I've read online that vets recommend chicken and brown rice blended cat food. So, while I dont know exactly how much sodium, fat, and organ meat this product has (ingredients do list chicken liver, ocean whitefish, and sea salt), it appears to fit the bill (Ie: it doesnt have a pool of liquid fat when put in the dish) and so far my cat is doing well on this product (at long as I continue to medicate him with Denosyl, due to his liver disease - which helps protect the liver and keep the bile production down to a minimum).<br /><br />Unlike most other canned cat foods, he eats the entire can and begs for another!  Today he's eaten every bite of FIVE of the small 3oz sized cans!<br /><br />Ounce to ounce, it's a little more expensive than some canned cat foods, but well worth it in my opinion, especially since none of it is going to waste (whereas with other brands I have been going through 3-5 5oz cans of the other brands of cat food, twice a day - morning meal and evening meal - simply to find one that he will eat and then he only eats 1/2 to 2/3 of one of them for each meal, which makes for up to 9 wasted 5 oz cans a day!).  So, in the long run it's cheaper for me at least, and no headaches of trying to get him to eat something.<br /><br />I'm am extremely happy with the product and my cat is very happy with it as well.

review/text: Product Basics: My cat loves this stuff, although I only serve it once a week.  It's fairly consistent from can to can; to date, I've only opened one can that was "watery"-ish.  The texture is usually very thick and solid.<br /><br />Product Received, including Packaging & Delivery: Since a case will last several months, I was pleased to see the expiration date was well in the future.  The product arrived in a small box, packed with airbags to protect the item - not glamorous, but efficient.  The box was slightly dinged on one corner; one of the airbags had broken from the impact, but the product was protected.  No cans were damaged.  Delivery was quicker than I anticipated (took about a week).<br /><br />Amazon Experience: Amazon makes it easy to order this stuff; I've even arranged for automatic shipping (you can speed up or delay the next shipment, if you're worried about timing).  This is the best price I've found for this product.  Overall, I would buy this product from Amazon, again.

review/summary: Totally disgusting!
review/text: I went back and forth on getting my girls some of the beef flavored Newmans because 2 of the 3 can't eat chicken.  I am always looking for a good quality food to add to their rotation.  There was a pretty good sale on the beef flavored a few days ago so I bought it.  I opened a can to give them for their dinner and I absolutely could not give that to my girls!  It had an awful grey color to it and was the consistency of wall paper paste.  My cats like to chew their food not lick it up so I knew they would have an awful time with this one.  Newman's has changed.  I have tried most of the flavors over the years and I have noticed that the cans are underweight and seem to have almost as much rice as pate in them.  Will not be buying again but thank heaven for Amazon that always makes it right without any hassles.

review/summary: To offset the 1 star reviews
review/text: I was looking to see if this pet food was cheaper on Amazon than it is at my local pet store (it is) and I saw the 1-star reviews and was shocked. I understand that people are having issues with the listing versus what they get in the mail but that has nothing to do with the product itself, which is what you should be reviewing here, maybe with a disclaimer in the review of the food about the mix-up. Amazon is where I go for reviews of products and notes on shipping mix-ups hardly ever tell me what I need to know!<br /><br />That being said, I love Merrick Before Grain. When I adopted my little strays they were living in the zoo and surviving off of raw ground meat and fish, so when I brought them home I chose a grain grain free food because I thought it would be the easiest transition on their stomachs from what they were eating. I've also done some pet nutrition research of my own, and while I'll concede that cats can process nutrients from grains in their foods, it just doesn't seem right to me that they many pet foods have most of the protein coming from vegetable sources, so I stayed grain-free even after the initial adoption.<br /><br />Recently, though, my budget has gotten tighter and I'm close to a ramen budget and decided my cats would have to be put on a ramen diet, too. I did the gradual transition to a new food the way you're supposed to, a little at a time, and the cats didn't seem to mind the change at all. As soon as the cheaper food took over, though, one of my cats started having terrible gas and had some minor tummy troubles. That bag is just about through so I'm going to start the transition back to this food.<br /><br />A big bag of this food ended up cost less per-pound than smaller bags of lower-quality foods, anyway, so I decided the additional cost was worth it. There are also several more expensive brands (Wellness, Blue Buffalo) that have grain in their cat food formulas, unless you opt for their grain-free variety which is even more. Merrick offers the grain-free choice without being the most expensive option out there, and is even comparable in price to many brands that have lower-quality ingredients.<br /><br />All-in-all, definitely worth a try! The canned foods are great, too, but my cats have decided they only like wet foods that are in gravies and won't eat the pates Merrick has.

review/summary: My cat had a problem on this food!
review/text: I had exhausted many different "no grain" dry cat foods before finding this one. It had excellent ingredients in it (wish it still had the probiotics in it like it used to though) and it was made here in the USA. My cats loved the taste, they took right to it, but after a week on it, I noticed blood in my cat's potty box covering pieces of stool. I wanted to see if this was from newly being put on the food or if my cat had eaten something they shouldn't have, so I left them on it for a little over a week. Still, every time I cleaned the potty box I found the same thing, lots of blood coated stool. So I switched them for a week back to a different "no grain" brand and no more blood...so this time I put them BACK on the Merrick to see if they had just had a tummy problem that cleared up (I really wanted this food to work out), but, within a day of being on it, blood all over the stool again. I don't know what in the food would cause this or if my cat was allergic to something in it, but they will no longer be eating it. Sad to put another potentially great product back on the shelf...on the plus side it cleared up my cat's dandruff!

I have researched cat foods extensively, trying to get the best that I can since I lost 2 cats to tainted pet food. Merrick is the absolute best. Other companies say they have great ingredients, but their products are either processed by a bad food company plant, or overseas. Not so with Merrick. Everything is made in their own facilities in Texas, and they get all ingredients here in the USA, all certified as human food grade, except for 2 vitamins they just can't get from here. My cats love this food! I would like to remind everyone, however - you should make your cat's diet primarily wet food. Feeding only dry doesn't get enough water intake into them every day and stresses the kidneys. This increases the chance of kidney failure or urinary stones as they get older.

review/summary: Not a good choice for my cat.
review/text: After our father died, my sister inherited Duke, our dad's 4 month old orange tabby kitten.  My sister kept him for over a year, but decided she couldn't keep him anymore, so in 2010, I grudgingly adopted him.  (I'm sentimental and couldn't let a cat that once belonged to our dad end up in the hands of strangers.)  I am a rabid dog fanatic.  I like cats, but don't have the same enthusiasm for them that I do with dogs.  I never had a feline companion of my own, so Duke became my "starter cat".  Well, I turned out to be lucky.  Duke is not the hide-under-the-bed-and-hiss kind of cat.  He's adorable, funny, affectionate, and loves Slappy, my elderly German Shepherd mix.  He's definitely a keeper and I love him to pieces.  He's three years old now, and he's stuck with me for life.<br /><br />So, being that Duke is my first cat, everything is a learning process.  I thought that semi-solid, extremely smelly poop was simply a variation of the norm for cats.  I was feeding Duke Before Grain, pretty much since the day I got him.  Duke liked it and had no problem scarfing it down.  (The little fattie will eat anything.)  I liked the quality ingredients and the lack of filler grains.  Meanwhile, his "Litter Box of Horrors" was a nightmare to clean.  The stench was overpowering.  Duke would do his business and the poop would stick to his legs.  I had to throw him in the shower several times a month.  Eventually, I had to follow him around the house with baby wipes after he used his litter box or else he'd leave stinky poop stains on my floor, couch, bed, or carpet.  I simply figured that since he's fat, he couldn't clean himself well.  I never attributed it to the food.  Why would I?  I assumed I was giving him the best.<br /><br />Last year, he was treated for a urinary blockage caused by struvite crystals.  Then, a few months ago, while wiping his butt with baby wipes, I found blood.  Quite a bit of it.  I opened his litter box, and his stool was covered in blood.  Off to the vet we went.  No problems detected.  Lots of money spent.  I was told to put him on Hill's Science Diet.  That stuff is garbage and if ANY vet tells you to put your cat or dog on it, it's time to find a new vet.  Anyway, the bloody poop happened again a few days later.  I decided that yes, I was going to change his diet, but no, it wouldn't be Hill's Science Diet.  Taste of The Wild ended up being my choice.  Within days, all the problems went away.  Duke has very firm stool now, there's no blood, the litter box stench is more tolerable, and no more "Hershey's Kisses" on everything he sits on.  No more baby wipes and showers, so I don't have to hear his mournful cries when he's subjected to being scrubbed down.<br /><br />I'm not saying that B.G. is a bad food, but I'm saying it was a very bad option for me and my cat.  There was something in there that my cat couldn't tolerate.  I won't buy it again.  I'll keep him on a combination of TOTW and raw.  It works for him.

review/summary: Cannot recommend this food
review/text: I tried this hoping for a less expensive alternative to Evo for my three cats. Unfortunately, I got what I paid for. Although my cats appeared to like the taste just fine, after two weeks on this food they developed runny and stinky stool, not to mention they used the litter box a lot more. I recently had enough and switched back to Evo cold turkey. No exaggeration, but 24 hours later I noticed a dramatic improvement. I then dumped the rest of the Before Grain in the trash.<br /><br />I don't know if it's the yeast culture, the potato flour, or both, but one of those top ingredients did not react well with my cats. I volunteer for a shelter that feeds its cats Science Diet and I've never noticed anything this bad. That's why I gave Before Grain one star, as I'd sooner feed my cats Science Diet. If you're looking for a budget grain free food, you can do much better than this.

review/summary: Causes crazy stinky poo!
review/text: I tried this on my indoor kitty, and she likes it, but it makes her poo knock-me-out smell. The poo smelled so bad that it wakes me up in the middle of the night when my kitty likes to do her business, and I had to clean out the litter box at 3am! When you do that for more than a week, you decide the benefits of the good food for kitty do not outweigh the liabilities of being working up in the middle of the night.<br /><br />So, I started feeding it to the local feral kitty clan, just to get rid of it, and their coats are all shiny, their eyes are brighter, and their bellies are beginning to fill out. So, it's obviously good food, but not for my kitty. Back to the more expensive Spot's Stew for me.

review/summary: Wonderful overall
review/text: A few years ago, my 5 year old cat abruptly decided that he hated the cat food I had him on.  While I was standing in the store, trying to decide which he might like better, I foolishly made the mistake of reading the ingredient lists.  Now, I'm not a fanatic, and I'm not about to put my cat on a raw diet or anything like that, but I'd read these lists of grains and chemicals and oh, yeah, some minor chicken parts, and it just seemed wrong.  Cats are obligate carnivores, and more to the point, I suppose, why was I feeding him something that looked like the nutritional equivalent of Cheetos?<br /><br />I found an excellent brand at the time which of course went out of business within 2 months, and then I tried a couple of the fancier brands out there.  He was on Evo for a bit, and liked it well enough, but to avoid issues if they suddenly decided to go out of business, I was trying a few other brands as well, and impulse bought this one.  When I ripped open the bag, it of course split and spilled all over the floor.  He chased down and ate every. single. piece.  And i knew we'd found a new primary catfood.<br /><br />He's been on it for 4 years now, and his coat is great, his weight is steady, and the catbox is a LOT easier to clean. (Well, except that I also bought him a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00063446M">Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain</a> which he adores and drinks masses more water with than a water bowl, but those things balance out, right?) He also throws up a lot less, always a blessing.<br /><br />For people who are unsure about the cost, as I was to begin with when I switched my cat to a better quality diet, something to consider is that they eat less on a higher quality diet, and they process more of it.  So while the bag of food was twice the cost of a grocery store brand, he finished it off in more than twice as long.  He takes about 3 months to eat through this bag of food, and he free eats about 2/3 a cup a day.  He'd probably like it better if I feed him from smaller bags because the fish oil in the food will age badly over time (though I keep it in a sealed container once open), but a house with multiple cats won't have that problem (and let me repeat, for the houses with multiple cats: The catbox is much improved.)<br /><br />I haven't tried the pork variety, but he HATED the fish variety, and I couldn't blame him--it was uberstinky.  But tastes vary between cats, so the friend I gave it to had no complaints from his cats.

He has been on diet food for 6 years and I could not get him to lose weight (he also has pica and anxiety related to food, so food limiting worked minimally). This is the only food that keeps him satisfied between meals. Plus, both cats enjoy eating it! I am happy to say that after 3 months on this food, he has lost 4 pounds. I use subscribe and save and the price is much better than my local pet stores.

review/summary: 7 cats are rating 7 paws up
review/text: I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in p�t&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.

review/summary: Reduced Ear Problems
review/text: Two of my three cats had been having ear wax build up.  Cleaning their ears was a major battle and didn't seem to help.  The vet cleaned their ears out really well, and suggested that I try the cats on a grain free food to see if that helped with the ear wax (possible allergy to grains).<br /><br />While this food has more of an odor than the NutiMax food they had been eating, I simply moved the food to a location where I won't smell it as much.  The cats like it and eat it with no problem.  I have had less problems with vomiting and their ears are far cleaner and less irritated.<br /><br />I chose this food because it is affordable, I can get it shipped to me free (prime membership), it is grain free, and the reviews were pretty good.<br /><br />I'm going to keep getting this food because the cats eat less of this food than they had been eating of the NutiMax (they free-feed) and therefore the cost comes out to be about the same.  I'm also sticking with it because the cats are looking very good - their coats, their ears, their teeth.

review/text: My three cats love this brand of food. The chicken is only the second "flavor" I've bought them. Before, I got tuna and they loved it! They seem to love this just as much. This cat food lasts my cats much longer than more popular brands, despite the fact that they have "free food" and are constantly eating it. It took them two weeks to finish a 6lb bag, so I'm expecting this 11lb bag to last them nearly a month. When that's taken into account, along with the sheer fact that it's so healthy for them, it makes the price of it very worth it. I'm going to try to continue to buy this for my cats.

He started getting sick--vomiting losing weight and the vet was constantly putting him on antibiotics and he even had to be force fed with a syringe when he stopped eating completely. I saw this food in Petco and just thought to give it a try and am I so glad I did. After one bag of this stuff, Coco had a new lease on life. Now he's been on it almost a year. He plays again, eats with relish and seems like a much younger cat again. I will never buy anything else.<br />The one star reviews are shameful as they do not represent the product itself.

review/summary: Only "Healthy" food my cats will eat consistently
review/text: My cat had severe food allergies- probably to the grains.  Classic symptoms- would eat his belly full and then empty it on the carpet a few minutes later.  A few hours thereafter, hungry again, he would repeat the process.  He was starting to get thin and his fur was somewhat matted since he stopped cleaning himself.  Luckily, my sister-in-law is a pet nutritionist. I was always skeptical of that title until she suggested my cat had a grain allergy and she turned out to be correct. I tried several different grain-free foods and the results were immediately evident. No more bulimic eating / purging.  Both cats' fur is soft and shiny again. Only thing was, after a few dishes both cats would tire of it and I would be stuck holding the rest of the bag.<br />This food is different. OK, I usually add a treat- I sprinkle a few bits of Deli-cat on top just for an extra treat, but in the morning the entire dish is empty.<br />I'm on my 4th 11 pound bag and they are still happy.  So am I.<br />All cats are different, and your results may vary, but mine are certainly doing well with this food.  My only complaint is that Amazon is often out of stock on it, so I have to order early.<br />Wolfgang

review/summary: Excellent for cats with grain sensitivity
review/text: After adopting my cat, I noticed fairly quickly that he spent a lot of time sneezing and coughing, and would sometimes have asthma attacks. (Yes, feline asthma is a thing.) I did some research online and found many suggestions that grain-free food can help control feline asthma. I first tried Blue Buffalo's grain free line, and that kibble was good for some months, but I also wanted to feed wet food, and their canned "Wilderness" line didn't seem to agree with my cat's sensitive stomach. At that point, I switched to Before Grain, both wet and dry, and my cat has thrived on it. He also has only had one or two asthma attacks in the past year, as opposed to at least one every few weeks before switching to grain-free food.<br /><br />I think the important thing to realize is that all cats will react differently to different foods. What works for one won't work for another, and it might take trying several different brands or even flavors within a brand to find the food that is best for your cat.<br /><br />However, I do purchase the dry food at the local Petco rather than online. It is cheapest there. The wet food cases, however, are about equivalent in price, so I buy them here on Amazon.

review/text: I was on a business trip with my husband and we took our poodles along.  I needed treats for the poodles and saw these - figured I had nothing to lose.  WOW, my dogs loved them!  Usually they will hide their treat and try to steal the treat for the other dog, but with these they never left their own.  Amazing - I must buy more!

review/summary: Dogs love this bone!
review/text: I have two 70 lb. dogs. One chews on anything but the other chews on almost nothing. Both will immediately attack this bone and have a ball chewing on it. The one dog usually ignores regular rawhide but I didn't have to wait and see with this, he took to it right away. The price fluctuates wildly with these kinds of bones, so watch for a sale. I paid about 3 bucks.

review/text: Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC.  I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red "meat" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Too big for my dog
review/text: I have a labrador retriever. He weighs 82 lbs. He loved the bone, but I made the mistake and allowed him to eat the bone in one sitting. It was too much of a shock to his digestive system.  The next morning he developed diarrhea. I' m not sure if the bone is the reason the diarrhea lasted so long, but to be causious I will not buy the bones again.  To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting.  I believe the product would be best for larger dog's than mine, or for smaller dog if the owner regulator the amount of the bone that is eaten at each sitting .

The texture takes a little getting used to at first; they are a bit stickier and chewier than your average "power bar"--and perhaps a little sweeter than you might expect.

review/summary: Vino Italiano kits
review/text: For the price and items included these are great kits. I went by several other reviews and made 5 gallons rather than 6, definitely makes a difference. Instead of using the yeast supplied I get quality yeast that vitners use. For this wine and the Cab I used BM4X4, it does wonders to the wine. Great body and mouth feel. After the secondary fermentation I added Hungarian med+ toasted oak cubes and allowed it to bulk age for three months prior to bottling. Bulk aging brings out more complexity in the wine and because of the size of the carboy the wine is less effected by temperature variations.<br /><br />After three months in the bottle in a wine fridge at 58 deg the wine is just as good as a $50 Barolo purchased at a wine store. Yeast is everything to the wine, get advice from a winery that produces the types of wine you really enjoy, most will be glad to tell you. BM4X4 only comes in 500 gram packaging so I have enough to last quite a while (I use about 1tsp per batch - follow the manufactures instructions to prep the yeast before adding to the must) . Sealed and stored in the fridge you will get your money's worth for the quality of wine it produces. When adding oak, get cubes instead of chips, the chips will be spent in a week, 2.5 to 3oz of cubes in a 5 gallon batch for three months is almost the same as 1 year in a barrel, so taste after the first two weeks for flavor up to the taste of oak you desire. It's better to add more later to taste than add too much and over power your wine.<br /><br />I've made several batches of wine and the Barolo is by far the best one to date. The Italian Red came out very pleasant, but again, the yeast makes all the difference. To date I've made six of these kits and will continue to do so. I've made kits from other companies, but the price didn't show in quality when a great yeast and the type of oak for the flavor desired is used. Morewine website has some great reading on oak varieties and effect on wine. Do a little research and anyone can produce very nice wines.

When making the kit I did find the SG at 1.080 and the target was around 1.090. It came out a little thin. I opened a bottle las night after letting it age for since 10/10/2009. I was suprised with how it turned out. It was very drinkable. You have to remember it isn't going to taste like a $20 bottle of wine.  I would buy it again in fact I have a white wine kit going now and just ordered a more expensive malbec kit to try.

review/text: I took a chance on this one and glad I did. I got it to add a little zip to Christmas baskets.  What I found was that it was very user friendly, and fun.  Did note that it is a little off kilter when first bottled so if you intend to make it, drink it, you may want to back sweeten to your taste.  I did not. But a couple of months in the bottle made all the difference.  Color was clear and deep, and it was the hit at Christmas.  I am impressed. If you are like most of us who just want to kick back with a nice tasting wine in the evening with the roast or a steak off of your grill, this is a nice wine for the price.  It did finish a little high in alcohol content, not a bad thing.

review/summary: Great For the Price and the Non-Snobbish
review/text: I ordered this kit mainly due to the price. I started making kits last year and all mine are higher-end $100+ kits that take at least a year to become drinkable. I saw the price of the Vino Italiano and with free-shipping it was a no-brainer. The kits are balanced for 6 gallons and some reviews went to 5 gallons. I middled it and did a 5.5 gallon kit. The wine came out very nice. It is light and as many have said, but it is a very good table wine. At my Christmas party, the wine was a hit. I bottle in  1-gallon jugs with re-usable twist tops (can purchase online or at a brew-store), which save me time and money with bottles and corks. Definitely worth it for beginners or even hobbyists that don't always want to tap into their higher end stash. Enjoy

I suggest replacing 1/2 gallon of water with additional juice or reducing the volume by 2 or 3 quarts. On the upside it includes corks, shrinks and labels that most kits dont. I'm happy with it.

review/text: This was my first kit purchase and as many, I was skeptical.  It has been two months and I have to say that the flavor and nose are really surprising.  I am a wine aficionado through Parker and also a collector. I know a little about wine.  The wine tastes wonderful, has a lasting taste, not overly astringent or hot.  It is around 13 percent alcohol.  I took the advice of some of the previous posts and made only 5 gallons.  It was the right choice.  6 gallons would have been much too weak for a titan wine like Borolo.  I recommend it highly and let it rest.  It gets much better.

But more importantly the wine is excellent.  It has a nice rich deep fruit aroma and a clean rich flavor.  I did make this as a 5 gallon batch instead of six (thanks fellow reviewers!).  This is a great value, and exceeded my expectations.  I have been home brewing beer for almost 20 years and wine for close to 10 so I have seen my share the good, bad and the ugly kits.  A word to the wise here... pay particular attention to your sanitation.  I recommend the many no-rinse sanitizers (check the many home brew catalog sites).  Sanitize everything, its easy to do with the no-rinse products.  The quality of my wine and beer really improved when I focused on my sanitation.  Also I do filter my beer and wine and I highly recommend that as well.

review/summary: Petty decent table wine
review/text: I started this wine (my very first) on March 18th - just under 5 months ago.  I closely, but not exactly followed the advice in Duane's review.  I reconstituted to about 5.25 gallons instead of the 6 called for in the instructions.  Instead of using BM4X4 (as Duane suggested), I used BM45 since it was easier to find in small quantities.  I rehydrated with GoFerm, per directions, then added FermaidK about 4 days into the fermentation.  After secondary fermentation was complete, I bulk aged in a carboy for a little over two months with about 2.5oz of Hungarian Medium+ oak cubes.  I finally bottled it in mid/late June.  My tastings during the process had me concerned that I either made mistakes along the way, or this was just too cheap a kit to really make anything drinkable.  Even a month after bottling, I was still concerned (though it had been improving).  I'm happy to report that I opened another bottle last night and it's really starting to become a nice table wine.  While I wouldn't compare it to any true Barolo's I've had, it does stand up reasonably well to Italian red blends in the $8-10/bottle range.  Pretty good in my book, considering it only cost about $2/bottle.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a pretty good kit, with a few modifications.  But give it time.  The biggest key I'm learning in winemaking is patience.  If you make this kit, you'll have a decent table wine in 3-6 months.  I've since started the Vino Italiano Cabernet Sauvignon and will bottle that in a couple weeks.  Again, I've modified it, but it's going to be another pretty good table wine for two bucks a bottle.  Can't complain.

review/text: It's been two weeks since I began bulk aging this Barolo kit and I am impressed so far.  The wine, even at this early stage is very drinkable, and has a beautiful, deep red color.  My only regret is having stabilized it before doing a malolactic fermentation, but I will do that on the next one.<br /><br />I took reviewer Duane's advice and used BM 4X4 yeast which I was able to buy in 30 gram packages from Fermentation Solutions in Campbell, Ca.  I also made this kit to 5.5 gallons and added 1 1/2 lbs of Zante currants (available on Amazon) for body.<br /><br />Though I have two much more expensive Winexpert kits going, I expect I'll be drinking this Barolo as my table wine while the other more expensive kits age.  You won't go wrong buying this kit, and with a few tweaks you'll have a very nice table wine for under 2 bucks a bottle.

Then I added about 5 pounds of Thompson seedless and Red Flame grapes plus one banana.<br />So it has only been four weeks but yes, it is very tasty.  Keep your expectations in line with the price.  I think these are great kits to play around with.  They come with labels, corks and shrink sleeves.  I always bottle these in 2 liter soda bottles and then paste on one of the labels.  The Barolo label has a statue of a Greek God.  Love drinking this wine and looking at the label. ;)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELJK78">Vino Italiano 4 Week Wine Kit, Barolo, 15.5-Pound Box</a>

review/summary: EEEW! Bad grape juice meets stale Riesling...
review/text: I am an avid red wine drinker, I love it!<br />I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur, but I spent years bartending in several fine dining establishments and at the end of my shift would get to indulge in the finer things I'd never actually spent $40-$50 a bottle on myself.<br />Six years later, two kids, now a stay at home mom and army wife I have literally resorted to $4 bottles of red wine at walmart (because formula, diapers, school clothes, etc obviously come first).  I'm always looking for a new hobby (as if running a household and carpool and sports aren't enough to do with my husband deployed 8 months a year!) and thought wine making would be a lot of fun and could involve my oldest son as a helper since he's into science and really that's what this is.  I followed the directions to a tee, and it is SO GROSS!  It tastes like stale grape juice, but has that tingly carbonation feel that you sometimes get with reisling.  It's really, really bad.  And I forced myself to drink a glass after running it through the aerator I own twice, and I really don't think there's much alcohol content at all.  I don't drink to get drunk or anything, but after a hearty glass of wine you should feel a little something!<br /><br />Also, when it said "KIT" and had vague information on the description, I was under the impression it came with everything!  You need to buy an additional $150 of equipment on here.  This being my first wine making experience, I was unaware of that.  TOTAL BUST!<br /><br />I'm going to try another brand and see if I have better results, I'll update!<br />Thanks for reading!

review/summary: This is a Refill kit!!! Do not be fooled.
review/text: I ordered this as a Christmas present. When we opened it we found out that you need about $200 worth of equipment to make this. I am an amateur beer maker and thought this would be alot of fun. When you order extra there it says REFILL kit. That is EXACTLY what this is! A REFILL KIT!!! This advertising is extremely deceptive. It also says nothing about all the extra equipment you will need, so here are the thing you will need to buy;<br /><br />*Primary Fermentor: food grade plastic (30) little capacity.<br />*Carboy 23 liter glass or food grade plastic<br />*Racking tube and siphon hose<br />*hyrometer, thermometer, and test jar<br />*long hadled plastic Spoon<br />*Bottle Brush<br />*Bottle corker<br />*filter and filter pads From A wine retailer<br /><br />And now you are ready to go!!!

review/summary: Don't buy this low-grade marzipan
review/text: I ordered this marzipan last Christmas, amazed by the great deal that I had found.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the old addage is true:  you get what you pay for.<br /><br />This marzipan is made with corn syrup instead of sugar, so it doesn't have the same texture.<br /><br />Even more interesting is that I froze the unused marzipan in the same bag with a 'better' variety.  Within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste, whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later.  They were both in the same bag together, so it can only be the ingredients themselves that didn't hold up.<br /><br />This may be fine for gourmands, but a more refined palate is going to recognize the difference right away.  I am so glad that I didn't buy the ten pound block like I originally intended.  It may be suitable where the marzipan doesn't take center stage, but when the marzipan flavor is important pay the extra money for a 60+% almond paste made with sugar.

review/summary: WARNING OUTRAGEOUS SHIPPING COST!!!
review/text: Buyers Beware, 1 lb. of Marzipan for $4.99.. Sounds great, right?<br />What they neglect to tell you is that there is an additional $9 shipping charge!!!!!!<br />Insane.<br />If this company *ever* thinks they will get another dime from me, they are sorely mistaken.<br />I placed my order along with some books, and Amazon does not itemize the shipping charges, only gives you one lump sum for all the items you order... At *no point* does Amazon or the company tell you what the shipping is for this item, unless it is the only item you order, and then only right before the final checkout.<br />It was only after paying, when I received itemized email invoices that I was informed of the $9 shipping charge.<br />What an incredibly shortsighted business practice.<br />1 lb Marzipan, for $16. No thank you.

review/summary: Biermann Marzipan 1 lb
review/text: First of all, the picture shown is not what's received.  It came in a round plastic container, not in a wedge shape.  That doesn't matter much though.<br /><br />What does matter is this marzipan was so-so; I've found some brands of marzipan can be amazing, terrible, and so-so.  This one is so-so.  Also, I thought I was buying unflavored, plain almond paste marzipan, but it turned out it was flavored with apricot kernels- which sounds delicious, but practically it only came out okay.<br /><br />The marzipan I get at my local European Deli smokes this one by miles and miles, but is much more expensive.  I'm going to try a different brand on Amazon.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: I used this to make a traditional Swedish dessert.  Product arrived quickly, and tasted great.  In fact, it tasted better than any other marzipan I have purchased, and rated on par with that I have tasted in Europe.  Yes, it has a little corn syrup in it, and yes, shipping does cost a bit.  It's 5 lbs after all, so it is to be expected.  Be smart and buy in bulk.  Wrap it well and freeze leftovers.

review/text: We use it mainly for frying up chicken strips and sometimes mushrooms.  We were buying it one box at a time from Martin's or Krogers, so I figured why not go the "pallet" route and buy a whole carton.  Best decision I ever made in my entire life, not like some horrible decisions I've made, including buying 25,000 shares of Facebook on opening day.  My wife is made at me about that, but I don't care.

review/summary: Excellent for Pressure Fried Chicken
review/text: I have been looking for a good batter mix for my pressure fryer and found it!!  I used to buy the mix from Pro-Selections, but it was expensive.  4 bags for $30!  It was good but I noticed it said it was mixed for them.  After looking around it appears that Drakes probably makes it for them.  I bought this blindly as I never heard about it before.  After some googling, I found that this is a pretty popular brand back east.  I tried it out this past weekend and it is pretty much the same as the Pro-Selections mix but at a much better price!  I will try to use it with some other foods, but my primary use is for Pressure Fried Chicken!

review/text: This fry mix has been a family favorite for over 50 years.  Growing up in Michigan where it is manufactured and living on the west coast I could only get it when visiting.  I was delighted to find the product through Amazon.  It makes great onion rings which was what my mother primarily used it for and pleased many a guest at family BBQs.  I have also used it for baking fish and was happy with the result.

It's very creamy and once you start eating it it's hard to stop. My husband is not big on pasta, but when I made it with this sauce he couldn't get enough.

review/text: Pasta Knorr Sauce Parma Rosa Creamy Tomato / B000I2OOPW<br /><br />Pardon me while I rave about how incredible this pasta mix is, but I'm just totally in love with this sauce. I love to eat pasta, but I am usually confined to the higher-fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux. That means no spaghetti and meatballs, which has been frustrating for me, but that's life, eh?<br /><br />Then, while I was browsing the sauce aisle for Knorr alfredo packets, I found this Parma Rosa sauce. I have no idea what 'vodka sauce' is that the other reviewers reference, but whatever this is, it is GOOD. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a creamy tomato alfredo, but even though it is creamy, it is also very light and pleasing to taste, not cloying. The tomato taste is exquisite, and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains. The taste itself is absolutely wonderful - I can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself Parma Rosa later - it's that good!<br /><br />The Knorr sauces are fairly easy to make (the instructions are serious when they say to 'stir constantly', though, and I think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix) and they store indefinitely in these dried packets (another reason to buy packets, besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars!). Oh, and buying them on Amazon means I get them for half the price of the local market! For the Parma Rosa, I also add about a third of a pound of seasoned, browned ground beef as easy 'meatballs'. The portions are such that I can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet, and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge - this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Dirty little secret
review/text: Pasta sauce from an envelope?  Never.  What kind of a plebian do you think I am?<br />For this sauce, I'll make an exception.  Knorr sauce mixes are generally a cut above the rest, but this particular blend is creamy, cheesy (in a good way), and easy.  It's a nice side for grilled chicken with Italian herbed vegetables, and with some shaved grana padano on top, no one will think it's from a packet.  Also, Amazon has a great price, and the larger quantity doesn't take up all that much room in the pantry.<br />Let's see:  creamy, cheesy, easy, and cheap? Hey, I think I went to high school with her.  But this one won't mind waiting in the pantry when mom comes over.  Check it out.
