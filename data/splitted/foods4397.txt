review/summary: not lemon balm?
review/text: Ordered this stuff because of the wonderful antiox etc you retrieve from lemon balm, kind of stunk you could only purchase 3 at a time instead of one.<br />But I grow lemon balm in my own garden and dry it for teas etc, and with this I thought YAY none i have to dry and wait for the tea myself. But from observing it NO SMELL of lemons in the tea can itself..as a tea I dont taste any lemon...so makes me wonder what it really is only because with my experience with lemon balm as an herb smells and taste like a lemony scent..with this nothing.

review/summary: Poor Flavor
review/text: I am a long-time fan of butter toffee peanuts.  Nowadays, the only place I can find them is at WinnCo in their food bin section.  I LOVE the flavor of their peanuts but am skeptical to buy food in bins.  As an avid Amazon shopper, I discovered these peanuts and thought I'd give them a try.  The package arrived within the estimated date and in great condition.  However, the flavor was blah.  The toffee coating was horrible - no taste at all.  For the price, I expected them to taste at least as good as WinnCo but no such luck.  Won't be buying these again.

review/summary: A 20 year romance.
review/text: A friend gave me my first Flake over 20 years ago.  Her father had brought home a precious handful of them from a business trip to the UK.  Boy, she must have really loved me to give me one of my very own!<br /><br />Cadbury makes good chocolate, but what sets these apart is how they are made.  Of course - they are flaky.  They are so fragile, they will fall apart in your hand really easily.  Because of this fragility, they also melt in your mouth very nicely.<br /><br />One of the best (and I think this may be traditional) ways to indulge with a Flake is to stab it into a malt or milk shake and then let it fall apart.  Yum!

review/summary: Cadbury Flake Chocolate
review/text: We (esp. my wife) are not fan of american chocolates as they are way too sweet to our liking. For some reason, I have always felt that the european chocolates taste better, smoother, and are less sweet. I quite strongly believe that it has something to do with the 'high fructose corn syrup' being added to almost all the sweats (and even other stuff) here in the US. My wife got to try 'Flake' chocolate from the shops at the airports on one of her international travels and ever since got hooked to it. She wanted to buy these from the local stores but none carried it around here. We decided about giving this wonderful shop on Amazon a shot, and got back exactly what we were looking for---original european flake chocolate!!

review/text: the first time i've had it was at some deli in times square for $2 a piece! i tried looking for them in every grocery story, duane reade and cvs and none of them have this! i also found it at ChipShop, a british restaurant in Park Slope, Brklyn, selling them but its not convenient to go there every time i get my Flake craving. Alas! Amazon have them n they deliver from upstate NY!<br />This chocolate is not your typical moist and glossy cadbury chocolate. It is truly in fact flaky but every bite is just rich of that Cadbury Milk Chocolate taste.<br />The price is right for a box of 24, better than getting it at the overpriced delis here in New York. I am so glad to find it here.

review/summary: One word. Divine!
review/text: Being from England, I cherished and remember fondly of eating Cadbury. When I moved to California, the main American chocolate is/was Hersheys. Yuck! Once you've eaten REAL chocolate made in Europe, you will realize American chocolates are god awful and taste like dirt compared with silky/luxurious British chocolate.<br /><br />The flake is one of the most decadent/soft/meltiest (not a word, I know.. But there's no other way to describe the pure awesomeness that is the flake) you'll ever eat. It is kinda like what it's called. It's thin layers of chocolate instead of one hulking chunk. If you live in America and want to try this but don't want to buy it in bulk on Amazon due to the fact your uncertain on how you'll like it you can buy it from British goods stores or Cost Plus World Market if you live near one. They carry a minor selection of Cadbury goods, I think these went for 2-3 bucks.<br /><br />I recommended this to my cousin when we we're at world market and he thought it was going to be mediocre.. Boy was he surprised, he gobbled it up lol.<br /><br />**Update 3/28/11<br /><br />If you live near a world market, they sell these. Pricy but a nice pick me up. I bought a 4 pack for six bucks I think, when they usually sell for bout two bucks each. lol I was at world market trying to find a flake egg, but that particular store didn't have it!

We used to get them over in the UK as kids and I could see the kid in him again when he saw this case of Flake bars. I think he was even more excited that he didn't have to share any of them with me!

review/summary: French Vanilla Coffee-mate...oooh la la !!!
review/text: French vanilla flavored Coffee-mate makes for an excellent milk or cream substitute for people who want a cup of coffee, cocoa or even tea when they don't have access to a refrigerator to keep milk or cream on hand. Coffee-mate therefore comes in very handy in many workplaces, naturally, but it adds so much extra flavor to your beverage that you just might wind up using this instead of milk or cream even if you do have access to a refrigerator with milk or cream in it!<br /><br />Coffee-mate is easy enough to use--just add three or four teaspoons full of it into your cup of coffee, tea or whatever beverage you want to sweeten with this wonderful french vanilla taste. Amazon correctly notes that Coffee-mate is also both dairy and lactose free if that matters to you; and it is kosher as well.<br /><br />A few caveats: Coffee-mate does have saturated fat. The nutrition label claims it contains no trans-fats but I notice that it contains partially hydrogenated oils. This may indicate that the trans-fats in Coffee-mate are present but very negligible.<br /><br />I would use Coffee-mate by the expiration date on the bottom of the plastic container; and the container gives you simple instructions for turning this powdery substance into liquid just in case you want to do that.<br /><br />Have further questions? Just give them a call or surf on over to their website. They provide you with the website address and a toll free number if you have more questions about Coffee-mate.<br /><br />Overall, french vanilla flavored Coffee-mate provides an excellent, sweet tasting substitute for milk, cream and anything else that contains lactose. You may want to use it to sweeten your coffee, tea or cocoa even if you have access to fresh refrigerated milk that you can use. It's THAT good.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!

review/summary: The original coffee-mate is still the best for coffee
review/text: I have tried both the French Vanilla Coffee-mate and the Hazelnut Coffee-mate.  While both taste ok, they 'distort' the flavor of my 100% arabica coffee (Member's Mark 100% Columbian instant coffee) to a significant extent so much so that the resulting coffee drink tastes distinctly 'uncoffee'-like (if you get what I mean).  The 'Hazelnut' and 'French Vanilla' version makes my Member's Mark coffee taste like a cheap, 3-in-1 flavored coffee mix.<br /><br />While I don't like the exotic flavors of Coffee-mate at all (both the 'Hazelnut' and 'French Vanilla' version, I give no more than 3 stars), I'd give the 'Original', regular Coffee-mate 5 stars out of 5 as it simply is the best creamer out there if you want your 100% arabica coffee to taste like real 100% arabica coffee even after adding the creamer.<br /><br />On average therefore, I'm giving this product (Coffee-mate assortment) 4 stars. (5 stars for the original, 3 stars for all the other exotic flavors for an average rating of 4 stars).

review/text: I love Oreos. Oreos are my all time favorite snack. There is not one time in my life that someone has asked me if I wanted an Oreo and I said no. It's too bad that I can't have milk , cause Oreos and milk are the best!<br /><br />  What I like about Oreos, is that they come with several oreo , they're not expensive. You never get tired of them. Everyone likes them , and since everyone likes them, they're great to have at a party or any special occasion.<br /><br />  My complaint is that they always get stuck in my braces, and the white cream in the middle comes off real easy.<br /><br />  Oreos are in a round shape. The outside of the cookie is black and it says Oreo in the middle. The middle has a thick white cream. if you put your finger and thumb in a round shape that is about how big they are.<br /><br />  Me and my friend go to the store and buy them when we have money. The Oreos are always good when there from store it seems like. I have had Oreos other times too.<br /><br />  I think that this product is good for just about anyone. I have never met anyone who does not like Oreos. If you don't like sweets then I don't think you would like this product that much. If you don't like chocolate then you probably won't like it either, cause the outside of the cookie tastes like chocolate.

review/text: I have a miniature schnauzer who experiences skin irritations each summer. This past year, we switched from Natural Balance to save money and saw a huge change in our dog's skin and coat. Our dog was bald on each side of his back from dry skin, itching and irritation. Along with other remedies to help, we switched back to Natural Balance food and within a week our dog was again growing fur back in the irritated spots. We used other things topically to help, but we really do think that the food quality of this product helped. We recommend this highly.

review/text: The EVO 95 has been the one thing that has stopped my cat from bleeding when he uses his litterbox...in other words, it stopped his colitis/internal allergies and he's been a healthy, active, loving cat since.  I couldn't get over the difference simply changing from a diet of hard/soft mix...which I was first on Royal Canin for him and then tried SD z/d...then went to this.  It worked...period.  To those bashing the company, quit the hysteria!  IT WORKS...and now both my cats are on it and doing well.  I lost two cats last year, and mine are doing well on this diet...and I'm thankful to have it!

review/summary: It changed my life!
review/text: East Cape Manuka Honey is incredible! It's fantastic for a variety of uses: 1) a spoonful approx. 20 minutes before meals seems to drastically reduce the chances of suffering gastro-intestinal distress (such as from IBS or other upset); 2) I haven't been sick with any colds or flu since consuming one or more spoonfuls a day even when repeatedly exposed to sick friends, family and co-workers so I believe it boosts the immune system; 3) as a facial or spot treatment vs. acne (adult or teenager), this honey rapidly speeds healing of existing acne and prevention of future outbreaks; it also leaves my skin smooth and tight; 4) as a rapid wound healer, there is nothing better I've found in nature or science. For me, it works faster and better than any OTC antibacterial cream, from reducing pain signals to promoting actual healing. One tiny 2.5 oz. jar lasts me about 4-6 weeks of conservative daily use. The honey has a smoky, somewhat medicinal flavor that isn't very good but isn't bad, either. You get used to it. After all, the results are worth it!<br /><br />Be warned, not all honeys are created equal. Only New Zealand Manuka Honey with a UMF rating is legit because it is tested and certified by the New Zealand government to have the correct "Unique Manuka Factor" rating and purity. The reason New Zealand Manuka Honey is so powerful is the bees feast on the New Zealand Manuka tea tree plant (which is ten times more powerful than its Australian cousin). This results in their honey being loaded with antibacterial properties! Because Manuka Honey is rare and expensive, a large number of fakes are available that claim to be "bio-active" or "UMF equivalent" to whatever UMF number (12+, 15+, etc.). These knock-offs do contain some Manuka Honey but are not 100% pure; they are cut with other honeys which make it cheaper to produce and less effective. Yet many will charge the same price as the real deal for this inferior product hoping customers won't know the difference! I've tested regular store-bought American honey vs. a "bio-active 15+" knock-off Manuka Honey vs. the "real deal": East Cape Manuka Honey UMF 20+. The American honey had minor benefits, the knock-off Manuka brand offered a clear improvement (2-3 times better than American honey) but was still not strong enough. However, the East Cape UMF 20+ gave me results that were right off the chart! I won't settle for anything less now.<br /><br />To combat acne: You should wash first with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V96R1G">Manuka Honey Propolis Soap</a>. Apply the honey directly as a spot treatment or all over as a mask once or twice daily and leave on for 30-60 minutes, then wash off with cold water.<br /><br />When I first began using Manuka Honey, I had quick results but like anything, you have to stick with it or the acne comes back. If the honey doesn't get rid of your acne completely (like me, although it did do an amazing job of reducing it), you should also try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DI8K4">Manuka Oil 100% Pure East Cape 10ml/0.34oz</a> (again, you should wash first with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V96R1G">Manuka Honey Propolis Soap</a>), maybe alternating between the oil and the honey masks once each per day (whatever combination works best for you). The oil is even stronger and more concentrated than the honey; some people may find it too strong when applied directly. If this is you, then you can try 2-3 drops diluted in a solution of water and/or witch hazel. The oil is also handy for healing minor wounds like hangnails, paper cuts or cat scratches; I place a drop directly on the wound several times a day and it works like a charm. The only downside to the oil is it has a strong medicinal odor (not awful but not good) so I wouldn't use it right before leaving the house or inviting friends over. It might also sting a little when it first goes on but this should vanish within a few minutes.<br /><br />Note that the higher the UMF rating, the stronger the antibacterial properties. For therapeutic uses such as mentioned above, I wouldn't go with less than UMF 15+ but prefer 20+. Natural Solutions/East Cape makes both and there are other brands that are also UMF-certified but I haven't tried them. All of my Manuka orders have been through Koru Naturals and they have been lightning fast to ship and quick to respond to emails (they've also securely packed my honey each time to avoid breakage in transit). Koru also offers a nice selection of other healthcare items from New Zealand (lanolin, etc.).<br /><br />One final word: I'm not a doctor. I'm not offering medical advice. Different sites offer different treatment suggestions (which I encourage you to read and consider before use). I can't guarantee Manuka will work miracles for you but I know it did for me! Both my MD and naturopath proved  useless in diagnosing or treating my skin problems; problems that had plagued me for nine years. Only Manuka proved effective and I'd tried everything from prescription drugs to diet changes. Your results may vary but if you suffer from any of the problems I've mentioned above and nothing else has worked, you owe it to yourself to at least try Manuka. It changed my life!

review/text: THis is an outstanding product which I am using to help combat ongoing problems with sinus infections.  I started using this, with my  doctor's ok, after reading about a study at the University of Ottawa on the anti-bacterial properties of manuka honey from New Zealand.  The study showed the honey to be more effective than antibiotics in combating certain bacteria.  This particular honey has a high number (+20) to indicate its strength.  The company sends it in a timely manner with helpful literature.  I use it in the saline nasal rinse that I use twice a day.  I add 1/2 teaspoon of the honey.

review/summary: manuka honey
review/text: I was looking for a product with some powerful properties in it, as I have quite<br />a few medical problems.  I had heard about Manuka Honey through a friend on the net that had been using it for quite a few years.  I was shocked at the price for<br />so little an amount, but purchased it anyway.<br />I tried the honey twice a day for a week, and looked forward to it every time, and wished I could add several more spoonfuls, however being diabetic, that would not be wise.  Manuka has to be the best honey I have ever tasted, there is really nothing else to describe it to, nothing comes close to the taste, the  thickness, it's wonderful. Unfortunately, it is too expensive for me. $31.00 is alot to pay for such a small amount.  I even tried to cut down, but that is impossible, it's just too good.  I just have to end this review by saying, I've had the best, and will always be looking for specials on it, so I can maybe purchase it again, or triple up on it.  If you buy it you will not regret it.<br />you will not forget it, and you will fight yourself to leave it alone....

review/text: I bought this Manuka honey for my husband who is for years suffering from stomach ulcer and acid reflux disease. Recently, his condition got severe and as a result of increased acid reflux, his throat/esophagus got affected. Despite all the medicines that he is taking i wanted him to try a natural remedy and that is when i came across Manuka Honey. I bought one bottle (UMF 20+) 2 months ago and after finishing the first bottle, he felt much better. Now i am going to order the fourth bottle today. It really helps and works for us. I also applied it to my face where i have lots of pores and waking up next morning, i have seen the pores reduced and skin tight. But it doesn't stay long, you need to apply it everyday forever in order to get significant result.<br /><br />Shipping is super fast and packaging in great. Only down side is the price, it is way too costly but worth the price.

Hopefully one day I will find something to get rid of my life long acne problem. The smell is not bad, though I chose not to taste it based on the smell.

review/summary: Poor Documentation, Is this really raw pure honey?
review/text: From the recent reviews mine will not be popular.<br /><br />1.  This honey is incredibly expensive for a very small amount, even less than noted in the ad.<br />2.  I buy unfiltered, unheated,  unprocesseed raw honey from many countries and areas all must be without proximity to flowers with pesticides and or abominations.  This honey states (if you can wade through the UMF stuff, in very small print, that it is filtered to remove particles.  I want the pieces of comb, I want the pieces of pollen, I want the natural particles that came from the comb to the jar - the pure enzymes etc.  Further, this honey is heated albeit limited according to the fine print.<br />3.  The material in the four page pamphlet is very limited focusing on the UMF +20 designation which is supposedly very important.  The first page is just pictures and the name of the honey and company.  The second page is white small print on a pale yellow background which makes for very difficult reading.  I like that the honey comes from isolate protected trees far from any farming and contaminants.  The third and fourth pages are more on this UMF +20 stuff.<br />5.  TASTE - the honey, if you are new to it, has very distinctive flavor because of the unique tree from which the honey is collected.  It has a slight off (a hint of bitterness maybe) flavor.  I liked it.<br /><br />Overall you get limited clear information on how they process the honey, and the cost is outragous compared to many other raw, unfiltered, unheated, unprocessed comb to jar honey where you get four or more times as much at a fraction of the cost with most if not all the same health healing benefits.  Also, the brochures talks about the lack of peroxcides.  I have never heard of this before and question what it means in a practical sense. I will not buy again.

review/summary: My Favorite "Plain" Black Tea
review/text: I'm no tea expert, but I've sampled quite a few of the Bigelow varieties.  English Breakfast is a great basic black tea, much more full than the flavor in a black tea bag from a generic or major brand 100-bag box.  I don't find it to be bitter at all, unlike some black tea varieties.  I try to let it steep for no more than 2 minutes in the cup (the package suggests 1 to 2 minutes), as additional time seems to introduce a bitter component that increases with time.  If you want a stronger flavor, you might experiment with 2 bags, rather than 1 bag for longer time.  However, this is a fairly strong tea, and I'm happy with the strength from one bag.  I consider English Breakfast to be my "standard" tea for when I'm not looking for some variety.<br /><br />Don't confuse English Breakfast (pink bag) with another Bigelow black tea variety called English TeaTime (deep blue bag).  There's quite a difference, with the English TeaTime being much weaker.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.

review/summary: A very good product
review/text: I have been a coffee drinker for over 40 years.  Recently the doctor told me that I had to stop due to the amount of acid.  My wife has always been a tea drinker.  I tried her usual Lipton but it had a bitter taste.  We were looking for something with a really nice taste, good aroma and not real expensive.  We found the Bigelow breakfast tea and it has proved to be exactly what we like.  Plus the cost from Amazon is better than any we could find in our local markets.  Also the auto order feature means we get it every month in the mail, one less thing to have on our shopping list.

review/summary: Pop the champagne, no dents!
review/text: After reading the reviews and ordering other canned goods from Amazon, I was afraid I was going to get a package that looked like it had been kicked around by angry shipping employees or disgruntled UPS men.  Not so!  My package arrived looking like a small corn army contingent sitting in a low cardboard case and wrapped tightly in plastic.  I looked closely at each can and found no dents.  Now that being said, if you DO find dents, as I've learned from another reviewer and my own recent experiences, you can tell Amazon.  Granted, it's a little extra work.  There is no quick button to push under your Account.  You'll need to write them a message to get a replacement.  Another reviewer said dented cans are to be expected but I don't think we should lower our expectations.  It's not like these are charity foods Amazon is giving away and we can't be too particular!  Amazon must know we can take our food dollars elsewhere and that they need to give shoppers incentive to take the risk of buying groceries online, be it in low prices, quick shipping, or great customer service when something goes amiss.<br /><br />But you want to know how the corn tastes.  It's okay, perfectly fine, a little crunchy.  Perhaps I expected to be blown away & amazed due to some of the other reviews, but I was already in the habit of buying low/no salt corn without added sugar from the grocery store so I was already used to --and liked-- plain, unamended corn.  I'd buy it again.<br /><br />Tidy fact: Research by Cornell, cited by the Whole Grains Council among other sources says, "Corn has the highest level of antioxidants of any grain or vegetable."  [link was omitted so just google that phrase for source] Oh, how I do love corn!<br /><br />Update Oct 1: I quickly became hooked on this corn and when my stash was dwindling, placed another order.  Sad to say it arrived with dents, although some minor, in 7 of the cans.  These dents looked like they happened prior to shipping.  I trust Amazon to make it right but don't enjoy the nuisance factor.

review/summary: Good Corn, Bad Cans
review/text: I purchase a lot of goods from Amazon, including bulk groceries. The corn is a fine product, but the cans are another story. Out of 2 cases, I was only able to save 7 cans. The rest were horribly dented or caved in and went in the trash, as no one else wanted them. I do not eat food from dented cans due to the failure of lining or seal. Yes, a couple cans dented at the seal actually leaked, meaning bacteria could also get in. Unfortunately, the cans were packaged in this unacceptable condition from the factory. Shame on Libby's for poor quality control. I will no longer buy canned goods online.

review/summary: Decent taste - 5 servings per box
review/text: I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says: "10 bars" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars).<br />The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case.<br /><br />On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these).

review/summary: Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me
review/text: I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.

review/text: I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2" wide, 4" long, and 1/4" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away.

review/summary: Great taste, but not very filling
review/text: I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon.

review/summary: Overpriced! Not what you are expecting.
review/text: My main beef with this product is with the labeling.<br /><br />The box is labeled very deceptively. This goes double when inspecting the packaging from the Web (as you are doing now). "10 bars" is prominently displayed on the box. Lo and behold, once you open the box, only five bars are present. Upon further inspection, you see that printed in mice-type on the box is "5 two count packages". The net weight of the entire box is 7.4 ounces. That's less than one cup of granola. That's when you realize you've been had.<br /><br />You can buy a mega-size box of Nature Valley granola bars from a warehouse club for less money than the "Pack of 2" you'll find here. I mention Nature Valley because in a blind taste test you won't be able to distinguish that brand from these Clif bars.<br /><br />Seriously, if they are selling them for this much on Amazon, I'd be shocked and chagrined to see what they go for at the camping stores which is their retailer of origin.<br /><br />I consider myself embarrassed to have been duped so badly on this one. Clif has seriously damaged their brand credibility. Live and learn.

review/text: I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks. I find that I need something with me in case I get hungry. Fruit doesn't travel well. Granola bars do well in my bag. But chewy bars get too sticky. And most crunchy granola bars are so hard I am always worried I would lose a tooth or two. I saw these at Nutrition S'mart yesterday and picked them up. I tried one before I got home. They have a great crunch, not too hard, and a wonderful flavor. Now I want to try the other flavors but my local Nutrition S'mart only had 2.

Anyway, these are highly recommended if you want a delicious crunchy peanut butter granola bar that just happens to have all the nutrition we've come to expect from CLIF. Yum-O!

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: These bars are awesome. The White Chocolate Macadamia is the only one I've tried, but it's goood. The only complaint is they break part too easily, but I can say, much better than Nature Valley. I hope these stay around for a while.

review/summary: Great taste but some drawbacks
review/text: These taste great but they are small bars.  My biggest complaint is that I have to eat these while standing over a sink or trash to avoid making a mess.  I've gone through 6 or 7 boxes and not one package has had two completely intact bars.  Most of the time there are just lots of crumbles from the edges of the bars but occasionally you'll find a bar that was jostled around enough to be broken into three or more pieces.  Certainly, this is a combination of the composition of the granola bar and lack of completely protective packaging.  But be warned that you will have lots of crumbled Clif Crunch bars if you order this through Amazon.

review/summary: a dark chocolate lovers' delight, a blueberry lover's disappointment
review/text: "Cocoa" is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly-sweet than many others.  They taste like they contain dark, as opposed to the easy-to-find milk, chocolate. I recommend them to dark chocolate lovers and ordered three more boxes, straight-away.<br /><br />On the other hand, the blueberry bars are a loser, in my opinion. There is only a faint blueberry flavor.  This blueberry-lover would just love one choc-full of dried blueberries, adding the appropriate blueberry flavor to these crunchy snack bars.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: I came across these granola bars as part of the Subscribe & Save program.  Much to my dismay, the subscription service option was discontinued.  They are so good, however, I've continued to purchase them.  Even my children really like them and they usually only like granola bars if they are packed with so much sugar and covered in chocolate to the point you can't distinguish them from a candy bar.<br /><br />I like the Clif brand and what the company is trying to do, besides offering a more wholesome granola bar without compromising taste.<br /><br />The granola bars are certified organic by QAI and packaging is made from 100% recycled material.  Hey, every little bit helps when you're trying to reduce your carbon footprint.

review/summary: Clif never lets me down
review/text: This crunch granola bar is on par with every other product from Clif.  It is, as the name would imply, very crunch and extremely delicious.  My favorite granola bar was Nature Valley, but this definitely took the cake.  Simply put, it's delicious.

review/summary: Pretty good for CRUNCHY
review/text: I normally do not like "crunchy" bars because its a hit and miss proposition. Sometimes too hard, sometimes too soft (feel like Goldilocks). But the taste and texture gets a passing grade from me. Will buy more.

review/text: Love the peanut butter crunch bars.  Normally buy them at Walmart for 3.99 per box.  Walmart has been out so I looked here.  $15.75 is outrageous for 2 boxes.

review/summary: Great tasting bars!
review/text: I've tried a wide variety of granola bars and I have to say, these are some really great tasting bars. If you like peanut butter, you will love these. Each box comes with 5 packages of 2 bars a piece. These are a great snack for the middle of the day. I'm looking forward to trying out the other flavors. If you get it with S&S, the price is very low as well. Overall, this is a great granola bar at a great price!
