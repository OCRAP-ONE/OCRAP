review/summary: The best food... EVER
review/text: I have three puppy mill rescue Pekingese and I have tried about every other high end dog food that I could think to try.  This is by far the best dog food that I have found to date.  One of my dogs has terrible food allergies and can't eat ANY other foods without getting a bad reaction.  Another one of my dogs previously had very bad tear staining, but when I asked around I heard various reasons why (I was told hard water- switched to deer park with no results) and after eating ziwipeak my dog's tear stains are GONE.  It's unreal.  Most importantly... they LOVE it!  Even when I walk past the bag, they go nuts.  Worth EVERY PENNY.

review/summary: ZiwiPeak Addict
review/text: My dog loves his ZP. He's primarily a ZP venison kind of guy due to allergies, but with trying to introduce new protein sources to him I've turned to the other varieties of ZP including the Venison and Fish and Lamb. Both were gobbled down without hesitation. Clearly he doesn't know that the food is good for him, or I suspect that he would be requiring it to be doused with canned food! But that is the wonderful thing about ZP - it is super high quality with no grains or fillers AND dogs love it. And my boy Titan looks better than he ever has; he's always been a strong dog, but on ZP he looks like he lifts weights. He's been on an exclusive ZP diet for about 4 or 5 months and his coat is shiny and velvety like a champion racehorse.<br /><br />Something to attest to the supreme flavor of this food: recently I was running low on ZP and so I had to supplement with some raw venison. I put down a bowl of raw venison for him while I was rationing out the ZP. He pushed the raw venison chunks around and then looked at me and gave me that familiar nod as if to say "you gonna give me some of that?" No raw venison for him. Titan wanted his ZP and nothing more.

review/summary: Excellent food for allergic pets
review/text: My dog, Lucy, suffers from a host of allergies.  Of the higher quality dog foods on the market, Ziwi Peak is the only one without carrots or barley (two foods she cannot have).  Lucy loves this food and her allergies are much better--there are no grains, fillers, colors, preservatives or vegetables (I can give her those separately from home).  Without Ziwi peak I would be making stuff at home.  This is convenient and well worth the price--I only wish I could find a local retailer so I wouldn't have to order online...

review/text: Tuffy, my 7 lb Pomeranian, has been the pickiest eater these 12 years and I have spent many hours searching for organic/natural products for him. It's been very difficult to find food he likes, but he went right to the venison and I am elated!<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with air-dried products and was surprised how dense the pieces are. He's eating a little more than recommended, but that's okay with me, it's good stuff.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, not only because Tuffy likes it, but it is also a great value.

review/text: I agree that the price on this is a bit high, but our dog loves it and still goes crazy whenever it's meal time.  She didn't do well with many of the so-called organic products because they still contain a lot of low quality grains/starches.  Even better, there's less dog waste to clean up too because the product doesn't have useless fillers.

review/summary: Great raw food that dogs love...and grain free!!
review/text: We have loved ZiwiPeak for a few years now, when it was introduced to us by our local pet boutique.  (which is now out of business, unfortunately) It is available in venison, venison-fish, beef...and our dog loves all three, but due to past health issues we tend to stay with one of the 'venison' ones.  There is no odor, they look like little dried out beef jerky, but are not that hard.  They also have great treats.  It is a complete diet and it IS concentrated so feed only about 1/3 of what you would normally feed.  I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Pugs love ZiwiPeak!!!
review/text: A must have if you are looking for an alternative to a raw food diet.  Both of my pugs LOVE IT!  It is a little pricey, but you only use a tiny scoop for each portion for a small dog. WORD OF CAUTION: after using ZiwiPeak for several months, I noticed my dogs were gaining A LOT of weight.  You really have to stick to the manufacturers directions.  This is dehydrated food and a little goes a long way. I love too that they use ranch raised animals with no hormones or antibiotics or fresh fish not from farms.<br /><br />From the Raw Food Diet to ZiwiPeak:<br />After much research and debate with both my husband and my veterinarian, I decided to try a raw food diet.  Well, the raw meat was just nasty and my pug would go for several days without eating.  Proponents of the raw food diet say this is normal because the raw meat/bones took longer to digest, but truly, my dog just seemed ravenous.  Normally she was very polite when we ate, now she was begging and even jumping up trying to get food off of the table.  I just couldn't take any more.  Yes, her teeth were gorgeous and her digestion seemed better, but the poor dog seemed very unhappy with her food.  We tried to the frozen food that you thaw out and that worked okay for a while, a nice treat now and then...but then we found ZiwiPeak!

review/summary: Air Dried Venison Formula-Dogs Like It
review/text: I have been a raw feeder now for about a month. I've tried various high quality frozen and Freeze/Air-Dried dog food. I love ZiwiPeak's philosophy re quality and the ingredients seems to be top of the line. This is a nice idea for traveling with dogs who normally eat frozen raw (hard to go camping or car-tripping with frozen raw dog food). My Chow Chow first sniffed the food, walked away, then came back and ate it. My shih tzu walked away and left it (though she doesn't like dark meat generally - normally she eats fowl or rabbit - sometimes lamb). I am currently dog sitting for a poodle who will eat anything and he gobbled it right up. I may not purchase this product again simply because my dogs are really picky. But, I would purchase it if I had a dog like the poodle I am sitting for; as mentioned above, I feel this brand's ingredients are top of the line.

review/summary: 8 month Shih Tzu loves VENISON!!!
review/text: I guess my little pup went through what can be typical for the Shih Tzu breed to be a finicky eater.  He began walking away from his water moistened dry food: Blue Buffalo puppy, Nutro, Merrick (all of the same flavors).  I got this as my cousin had sent me some venison jerky she makes for her Yorkie's and they love it.  I put half the serving size bowl of this down for my little Weston and he lapped it up, looking up at me lovingly for more.  I gave him the rest of the serving size and he galloped away with more energy (even MORE than he normally showed) and played hard, napped and his eliminations were smaller and neater to clean up.  It seems that he is getting more nourished and retaining the nutrients he needs.  His coat is even more soft and supple.  This is a great product to take on trips without any mess or extra bowls, etc to pack.  Thanks, ZiwiPeak!!!!

review/summary: Good supplement for raw diet
review/text: I originally purchased this product to serve as my dog's main food since he is allergy-prone with skin issues and a survivor of mast-cell tumor disease.The vet had recommended other "veterinary prescription" kibble(potato/ rabbit) which seemed to really slow down our dog's healing process and worse, seemed to be doing more harm than good .  After giving up on vet reco 6 months later, we started experimenting with a number of 'healthy' and 'raw' alternatives, I landed on this just before going 100% raw. Though I have since gone 100% raw and eliminated all grain and processed food from our dog's main diet (with vast noticeable improvements in his health), I still use this food as one of his acceptable 'treats' and when I'm behind in making his raw meals. The texture is the consistency of beef jerky and the pieces are cut pretty small (think holding a small strip between your thumb and index finger about half the size of a fortune cookie paper...  It would be great for training since they are small pieces to feed frequently and more moist than dry kibble. It may be pricey to use as a main food , but it was great quality and seemed to be trustworthy ingredient sources. He likes the taste a lot too... but I can't vouch for that part.

review/text: I love Java Juice--not only for the way it tastes, or that it's certified organic or even kosher, but that I can take it anywhere. When it first came out, I took it on an AIDS ride. You could tell all my friends in the photos afterwards. We were the ones smiling and ahead of the pack. (Everyone else was DYING for good coffee. We just pulled into fast food places or gas stations and asked for hot water.) I ran out of my supply at dinner that night, because everyone wanted to try it. I think a lot of riders got hooked. I've also taken JJ on trips to London, Portugal, Italy and Israel (not that the latter 3 don't have extremely good coffee in cafes, but when you're out sightseeing in the country, it's not always so easy to find them). But probably the time my JJ came in most handy was on a trip to Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park is so beautiful, but after we left Asheville NC there was like NOWHERE to stop for anything. Good thing we brought some bread, cheese, nuts, Java Juice and a thermos of hot water!

There's really no point in chewing a gum that's laced with a harmful chemical, just because it has a healthy component too! There are many brands of gum that contain only Xylitol without any other harmful ingredients. This gum is just an advertising gimmick to grab a market share of those folks who are health conscious, and may not realize how harmful Aspartame is. If you're purchasing this product in order to contribute to your overall health... then skip it! Aspartame is a powerful neurotoxin that everyone should avoid like the plague!!!

review/text: This gum only had 0.17 grams of xylitol which is a powerful sugar alternative for preventing dental carries. (see wikipedia)  Recommendations are to have at least 6 grams of xylitol daily for full efficacy.  At that rate, you would need to consume 35 pieces of this gum for it to be effective.<br /><br />Also this gum contains other products such as sorbitol which inhibits the effects of the xylitol.  I would look into other products such as &lt;...> or spry/xlear or zellies for pure xylitol gum.  This trident gum is only a marketing scam.

review/summary: Great for drawing on candy melts!
review/text: After attempting to use Wilton food writers on candy melts (successfully, but difficult and very spotty), these AmeriColor food writers are a dream! They're so smooth, and make perfect, crisp lines. Plus, the tips are very flexible, so lines can be thin or thick, depending on the amount of pressure applied. I use them for candy chocolate-covered cake pops, and plan on keeping a supply of these markers on hand at all times!

review/summary: Great pens for decorating
review/text: I love these pens, they are great for decorating fondant pieces, icing, or cookies. The markers are taste-less but are very bright.<br /><br />Edit: I bought these over a year ago and they have lasted a long time, I use them mostly for drawing on fondant and they work great. They slowly started drying out over 3ish months ago but I just dipped them into water to hydrate them. I didn't have to buy a new set till about a month ago when my black pen would no longer work. Overall I think this was a great buy! Lasted a lot longer than I thought it would.

review/summary: So much better than wilton
review/text: I bought the Wilton edible markers first and returned them immediately because they just didn't work.  I was trying to put details on cake pop (candy melt surface) and the Wilton pens just poked holes and didn't leave any ink behind unless you pushed really hard.  The Americolor pens worked with just a small amount of pressure and created very small marks or larger if you tilted the pen.

review/summary: Did an okay job.
review/text: I ordered these to decorate cake pops.  I've never used a food marker before, but I was expecting a little better coverage from the "ink."  If you press too hard the color barely disburses; so make sure you use a really light touch.  With every color you have to apply more than one layer of color for full coverage.  However, the red would literally remove the prior red layer.  They eventually got the job done, but I will be looking at other brands to see if they perform better.

I noticed some inconsistency in wetness/dryness between different colors; the purple and pink don't work as well as the others in the bag.  Don't know if it's characteristic of the color or inconsistent product quality.  Would definitely purchase again.

Yet, after a few lines, the markers stopped producing ink. I even tried to suck on the ends to draw more ink out, but that was ineffective. Also, I found these same markers at a local craft store for only 9 dollars! Waste of money.<br /><br />Pros: This is the only set which includes such a variety of beautiful colors.

I only had a little black come out, and it was tinted slightly purple. None of the markers could make a solid line without a lot of scratching and pressure, and they were completely dried up after only a few strokes.

If the fondant seemed to be getting soft during the process of writing, I just popped the cake back in fridge every 15 minutes or so. I just had to remind the kids to not press very hard...the lighter touch the better.

review/text: I am an avid baker and make cakes which I sell. I purchased these to write on a fondant 'gift tag' for a cake I made. Normally I write with chocolate or icing, so this was my first experience with a food coloring marker. The marker did ok... the color goes on very light ( I was using black ink on white fondant). I drew over the writing three or four times to get the desired effect. Because I've never used any other brands, I cannot speak to the quality of these. Over all, it served my purpose and I think it would be useful in iced cookie decorating and detailed work.

And use light pressure.  If you need to repeatedly go back over your lines, you'll have issues.

review/text: These are the best food color markers that I can find - the color is true, the tip reasonably fine. But it is a very wet marker, and doesn't make a crisp line. I just wish I could find a TRULY fine-tip food color marker or even a pen, especially in black; stencil and drawing projects would be so much easier (as it is, a fine paintbrush and gel color is the only thing that'll do that job). Still, these beat Wilton hands-down (which isn't hard, because Wilton is AWFUL).

Specifically, I was most interested in the black pen to draw a smile on the bee's face.  This was my first time using any kind of edible markers so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I had read that the Wilton ones tend to dry out quickly and it is difficult to write with them.  These markers were easy enough to work with.  The only other issue for me is their shelf life.  I have had them for about a month and have not used them recently so I cannot say, but for edible markers these got the job done.

review/text: Of all the Gloria Jean flavored coffee's I have to say in my own opinion, Butter Toffee is by far the best. It has a stronger smell than flavor and blends well with stronger un-flavored coffee (I use Timothy's Black Magic). I really enjoy flavored coffee although the husband does not...but he LOVES this one. That has got to say something.<br /><br />It's a perfect dessert coffee as well as the first cup that greets you in the morning.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've been buying this product at Walmart for a year or so for over $11.00 for the K-cup 18 count. When I went to amazon an ordered the product that I've been paying so higher for the k-cups for my keurig brewers that when my son told me about amazon I was amazed I will never purchase any k-cup from Walmart or any store. THANKS AMAZON!

review/text: My husband and I disagree about our coffee all the time. He likes it to be strong, black and he isn't a fan of flavored coffee. While I am the complete opposite, I add cream, sugar and love flavored coffee. That being said we both love this coffee. He says it doesn't taste like the "girly" coffee I usually drink. And I don't think it tastes like mud. lol. Most coffee lovers will enjoy this to the fullest. The only drawback is that all 50 come in the same box which happens to be the same box they ship in.

review/text: This coffee is the perfect blend of medium roast and medium boldness and intensity.  The flavour is the best hands down and I have tried many k-cups.  I bought the variety packs and this flavour was always the first to finish so now I just buy this alone. I definitely look forward to this in the morning great way to start the day.

review/summary: Relaxing Coffee
review/text: For anyone that appreciates a relaxing cup of coffee I really recommend this flavor.  It has a smooth taste as you are drinking, no bitterness at all.  Leaves a faint taste of butter toffe after every sip of coffee.  For anyone looking<br />for bitter coffee with a strong taste, this is not for you.  I drink this at night coupled with a truffle or two.

review/summary: Best Ever
review/text: Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee is the best flavored coffee I have ever had. 50 pack would save some money per cup except that the last two boxes have had several K-cups where the tops are not sealed.  If you don't notice the problem before you brew then the coffee grounds blow by the normal brew process and you have grounds all over the brewer. I had 8 bad K-cups in the previous order and had seven in this order. Not very good quality control.  But the coffee is the greatest. I haven't found the K-cup defect in other flavors.

review/text: I really enjoy this coffee.  The butter toffee flavor is subtle, but definitely present. I drink my coffee black, and I can imagine that adding sugar and / or cream would enhance the toffee flavor, but as someone who enjoys the flavor of coffee itself, this subtlety is just enough to make me think I'm indulging myself with a treat for breakfast.
