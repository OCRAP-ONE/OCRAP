review/summary: Great Chews, But Go For the Medium Size at Minimum
review/text: My dog loves these chews; unlike the Cheweez he enjoys these are a nice - albeit more expensive - alternative to freshen his breath.<br /><br />That being said, I have a 16-pound Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and would not recommend anyone purchasing the Petite chews, even for smaller dogs.  They are so small and stick-like that I would be concerned to have my dog eat these without supervision to avoid choking issues.  Not to mention, they were gone within two minutes.<br /><br />Go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P05K6I">C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews, Medium-Size Dogs, 30 Chews</a> instead.  They are rectangular and shaped more like flatbread chips instead of beef jerky.  Additionally, they are larger and will last much longer for your dog.

review/summary: Didn't sit well with my dog
review/text: My little Lhasa Shih had terrible diarrhea after eating one of these. It was nice to have something to keep her busy and chewing (and she did like it), but it is not worth risking her health (or the clean-up time) for.  These are going back.

review/summary: Singing dogs for these C.E.Ts!
review/text: I have two Chinese Crested Hairless dogs and one chihuahua (NYCNakedSirens dot com) that hate having their teeth brushed (but we still did it anyways, dental gel on a q-tip three times a week). Pearly whites are important on camera. We just tried these C.E.T chewies and I am SO thrilled by what  an amazing improvement has taken place beyond what the dental gel had ever achieved.  Apparently, the C.E.T. does something that cleans bacteria right up under the gumline too.<br /><br /> I am extremely grateful that the designers of the product deliberately attended to solving the "choking" risk.<br /><br />And best of all, the dogs just LOVE them.( I mean, let's talk about dogs being descended from wild wolves here now!!<br /><br /> :)<br /><br /> I just wish the packaging were environmentally-friendly or even a cardboard box.

review/summary: My Dog's Absolute Favorite
review/text: My dog won't go a day without a "chew stick".  If we've forgotten to give it to her, she reminds us at the pantry door.  She LOVES them.  I think they have made a significant contribution to her cleaner teeth and breath.  These will not replace brushing, but they are apparently delicious helpers in the overall effort.

review/summary: Wonderful product!
review/text: These chew strips are a welcomed treat for my dog.  She has no idea that they are helping her teeth stay healthy. Although she is twelve years old now, her teeth are in great shape.  Her vet suggested their use about five years ago, and since then she has been getting two chew strips a day. I truly think it does make a difference in the overall cleanliness of her teeth.  The only improvement I would like to "smell" in them would be a breath freshener!

review/summary: Easier to chew and digest than rawhide
review/text: Our elderly terrier always liked rawhide chews but she tended to gag on them and then they were difficult to digest.  She seldom enjoyed that chewing exercise.  The C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews are the perfect chewable treat for her now and the byproduct is brief moments of breath freshening.  It does not take the place of eating kibble and my brushing her teeth, but she really enjoys these chews and they are just the right size for a small dog of 13 pounds.  In the past, I purchased the larger size and cut them with heavy duty scissors, but these petite chews are fine as is.  Unlike rawhide chews, these are consumed rather quickly and don't require the strongest of teeth, so they are much better for older dogs who still like to chew.  I think they are a little pricy, so I look for special values which occasionally occur on Amazon, always much better than the price at the vet.

review/text: These were on discount so I figured why not try them being that my dog's mouth smells like his other end if you know what I mean. After two days of giving him 1 chew a day, he started vomitting everywhere. It has to be these chews as we haven't given him anything else new lately and he rarely ever vomits. I think I will be sticking with greenies from now on.

review/summary: Part of our doggie DeSTINKification program...
review/text: Ok so we had an issue over here with Gracie, a Chigi who was, well, a bit smelly all about.  Body, breath and the rest.<br /><br />She's 1/2 Chiwahwah and 1/2 Pembroke corgi.  Kind of a sturdy, mouthy, snappy, over-protective monogamous low rider.  She's built to love one person, a lot, and she corners well (low center of gravity).<br /><br />So we tried lots of things to DeSTINKify the pup.<br /><br />Here's what we ended up with.  (NOTE: These items are listed in the order of most effectiveness but altogether, the pup is looking and smelling super sweet these days.  If we could only get her to act right...)<br /><br />1) Diet issues - MOST IMPORTANT FOR maximum DeSTINKification<br />  -  Change food to Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Canine Calorie Control CC 32 High Protein Dry Dog Food<br />  -  no more wet food and go easy on the table scraps<br />  - one scrambled egg each week<br />  - add to the kibble some yogurt or cottage cheese or peanut butter with some water to broth it up<br />  - sweet potatoes help as well but go easy on the carbs you'll end up with a fat hyper indoor dog, if your dog is primarily in doors<br />  - Omega 3 fish oil make a nice coat so you can mix that into stuff, for your dog that is<br />2) Brush teeth EVERY DAY!!!!!!  with CET Vanilla/Mint toothpaste - seriously unbrushed teeth is the leading cause of medical issues in doggies.  Medical issues cost money and make us feel sad for our puppies so do both of you a favor and JUST DO IT!!!!<br />3) hand out one or two of these CET chews or what I like to call doggie breath mints every day<br />4) bath once a week with a nice oatmeal shampoo like DermaPet DermAllay Oatmeal Shampoo<br />5) spray their coat down a couple times a week with water mixed with a little lavender oil in it, works better than any of those silly spray on dog cleaners.  You can spray this in their beds as well.  you can also dry clean your dog with ground up oats and a few drops of lavender oil mixed into that, just rub in the oats for a few minutes and then brush the puppy out.<br />6) don't let your doggie roll around in Canadian duck doo doo, Gracie snuck that in on me once and WOW what a stench!!!!!<br /><br />If you love your doggie, you'll love 'em even more if they are smelling sweet all the time!!!!

review/summary: Happier Dog, Nicer Breath
review/text: Heard about this product from a friend who mentioned it cured his dog's breath situation.  Our dog had a bad case of bad breath and I was not about to pay $650 to the vet for a dental cleaning. So I bought a bag. She's small (10lbs) so we give her a half chew each evening before bed.<br /><br />We have seen a 1000% improvement in her breath... the odor is gone and she smells great again..NO DOG BREATH!!!  Inspected her teeth, MUCH cleaner than before and while she will still need a proper cleaning at some point, this product did the trick. Great product.

review/summary: A daily delight for my babies
review/text: Each morning my dogs are so excited to get their chew.  I wish my son was equally as excited about brushing his teeth.  The quality is consistent and they are palatable.  I like that it is munchy rawhide (made into small pieces and then pressed together) instead of a rawhide strip and there are no dyes that will transfer to my carpet.  While it is not a doggie breath cure-all it's good to know that it is a step in the right direction.

review/summary: Very happy that my Maltese loves them ~
review/text: It's been years since I've had a puppy but I recently acquired a Maltese.  My last dog was a miniature Poodle who ended up late in life with bad teeth and I don't want that happening with my Maltese, so I bought these in hopes that starting early with him would create some good habits.  Well, turns out he loves these chews and treats them as treats!<br /><br />They are just the right size for a small dog - in this case, 5-1/2 lbs and they do not have a bad odor.  In fact, to my nose they don't smell at all.  He recognizes the package and will beg for one, sometimes eating it at one sitting.  Since he's teething, I find it easy to offer one when he's chewing on something from which I want to distract him and it works.  Now if housebreaking would just go so smoothly . . .<br /><br />A friend with an older small poodle verifies that the poodle also likes them.

review/text: Our Vet recommended these for our two dogs who he had cleaned their teeth and suggested we try these if we could not brush their teeth every other day. So we thought we would buy a bag and try them. We also have a Yorkie, and her teeth had a great amount of tarter on them. Well they all three like them, and our Yorkies teeth are 95% free of tarter, it's amazing!! Their  breathe is so much better, these chews are something we will continue to give our dogs! I can't wait to take our Yorkie to the Vet in Oct. and see what he thinks when he checks her mouth and the tarter is GONE!!!!<br /><br />Tena Hinderliter

review/summary: Two birds with one stone!
review/text: My dog absolutely loves these dental chews, but I love that they're good for him and clean his teeth. I started with a sample from the vet, and ever since he's been hooked. He's only 14 weeks old, but I figure why wait on oral hygiene. As he gets permanent teeth and grows a bit more, I think I'll switch to the next size up. I like to use them as an after dinner treat, and they keep him occupied for a good while (adult dogs may get through them a little quicker). Obviously, not all dogs are going to like the same thing but Blu goes bananas for these if I just touch the bag! These are much cheaper than at the vet's office and I think a great deal when you compare to similar-types of products at big box stores, that may or may not work. I plan on keeping a steady suppy of these around the house!

Even though they do chew on it - I think they'd rather have something with a bit of favor to it and have no issue ignoring these chews for long periods of time.  These chews really looks like a piece of cardboard to me.  They are a good size for toy or tiny toy dogs.  And apparently they are suppose to clean the teeth, but I haven't really noticed a big difference on the amount of tartar on my dog's teeth if she eats it more frequently.  I think the best dental health for your dog is still to whip out the brush and toothpaste - I haven't found anything that compared to that yet.

review/summary: My Chi's Love 'Em!
review/text: My 2 Chihuahua's, 4 year old Penny and 1 year Bella Louise, LOVE these chews.  It's like doggy crack.  Every day when I get home from work and let them out to do their business, they know they're gonna get a C.E.T. Chew. They're a different color and different smell from the larger ones, but my babies love them just the same.

In addition to the enzymatic action of this product, she gets an application of Orazin at night and an occasional brushing.  It's been about 1 year since her teeth cleaning and they still look pretty good.

review/text: My puppy received 2 of these in her take home packet from the vet today... she just tried one and she loved it! She is half boxer and half lab... and she loves to chew, so this was perfect for her. I tried a Nutrident bone earlier... and it was gone in seconds... it just crumbled as she ate it. It took her about 20 minutes to chew the C.E.T. bone... and she loved every minute of it... and it didn't crumble and get all over the floor. Great product... I will be buying more!

review/summary: Not For Picky Dogs
review/text: I wish I could say I loved these like everybody else, but my dog refuses to eat them. I adopted her just a couple months ago, so I am still learning things about her, and apparently she is a bit picky with her treats (if it is helpful for anyone to know, she's a chihuahua mix). I've learned that she prefers treats that have a stronger smell and are bit moist or chewy.<br />Anyway, one positive thing I can say about these treats is that they don't have that strong, pungent odor some dog treats have (like jerky treats, for example). They're compact and I imagine they would last for a while. But if you have a picky dog, they might not be the best choice for them.

review/summary: Great Organic Cake
review/text: I have tried several organic baking premixes. By far, this is the best. Follow the directions and the end product is terrific. What is really terrific about it, is that you can use this mix as a starting point and make some minor modifications to turbo charge the recipe. I use butter instead of oil. I also use two egg whites whipped into soft peaks.<br />I add two tablespoons of natural vanilla extract. You could add more chocolate. Just melt some bitter sweet chocolate (melted) into the liquid ingredients.<br /><br />After I have mixed the wet and dry ingredients, I gently fold in the two whipped egg whites. This adds more rise to the cake and makes it more tender.<br /><br />I do use commercial canned frosting, but you could make your own.<br /><br />You could feed this to your kids for breakfast. Honest. Think about it. If you use organic eggs, organic milk, organic butter...you have a real breakfast treat. Much better than a chocolate chip store bought muffing.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6IDY">Arrowhead Mills Chocolate Cake Mix Organic, 18.6 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Not crazy about it
review/text: Being a big fan of chocolate and cake and organic products, I thought that this product would just fit the bill. However, I was disappointed that this tasted more like German chocolate than the luscious rich chocolate depicted in the pictures. This was the opinion of my family and friends that we had visiting also (does that count for 6 reviews?). The cake was moist, but otherwise, lacking in real chocolate flavor. Next time I'll definitely add chocolate chips and/or syrup since I still have five boxes left. I have tried other Arrowhead Mills products in the past that were very good, but this product just does not do it for my family.

review/text: I just attended a 2-yr-old's birthday party and the chocolate cake was wonderful.  I'd feared it would be either one of those 'shaving foam' cakes that look nice; or one of those horrible oily cakes that taste of, well, cooking oil.  But when I bit into it, it was what I remembered good chocolate cake being like, but never find in cafes etc.  Wonderful, honest chocolate flavor and rich texture but not oily.  I was surprised to learn that it was made from a mix - this one - and now I'm in despair about my diet .... so tempted to buy it...

review/summary: IT is sooooo fluffy!
review/text: I've had this cake mix in the pantry for a few months and decided to bake it tonight. Depending on the oven, it might take more than the suggested baking time on the box. Mine took about 35 minutes.<br /><br />It is very very fluffy. If this was a bread mix, it would be one of the best breads ever :)<br /><br />It is not very sweet, which is great for me, since I don't like stuff that's too sweet. And that is why I added a very thin layer of frosting on top.<br /><br />It's perfect to have in the pantry, for those times when you feel too lazy to try new recipes and you just want something quick and easy. You can add pecans or walnuts or any other nuts, if you prefer.<br /><br />I'd say it's definitely worth the price. A betty crocker mix, full of artificial ingredients is probably at least $2, so for $4 you get a cake mix that is at least organic and free of HFCS.

review/text: This is absolutely the best boxed cake I've ever had. They do not sell this is any stores around me, so I decided to put out the money and buy it on Amazon. I got it shipped next day with Amazon Prime for $3.99 so I could make it for a birthday. Everyone loved it, I will be making this again soon.<br /><br />Also like other suggested, I used a stick of butter (4oz) and milk with 2 large eggs. I softened the butter first in the microwave for 20 seconds. Mixed that together, then added the powder mix to it and beat until it was nice and smooth. The texture reminded me of thick pudding.<br /><br />I baked it for about 30 minutes, and it came out perfect.<br /><br />This cake is to die for, you won't regret buying this if you're a chocolate cake lover!<br />I put chocolate icing by BettyCrocker on it, not too thick but thick enough where it's just right which made it a lot better.

review/text: 2 of the inner bags were broken by the time it reached us. Amazon thinks this has NOTHING to do with the quality of the product but just a packaging issue, and doesn't want me to publish my review. But this is powdered food that suppose to be sealed in its inner bag. I wonder either the seller or Amazon can guarantee the food is not contaminated! I don't have time to ship it back, since my husband's birthday is tmr, plus I don't know how to return just the damaged ones, since it comes with 6 packs. If this is only a packaging issue (like the outside packaging is broken), I think it's acceptable, but 2 broken inner bags? I certainly will never order again!

review/text: Grandma Lucy's Artisan Dog Food is the only dog food my chihuahua (Dash) will eat.  Chihuahuas are so very picky when it comes to their food. I spent three years searching for a food that would make him happy. A friend recommended Grandma Lucy's and for Dash it was love at first bite.  We've tried both the chicken and the lamb mixes and he seems to prefer the lamb. It's a little pricey but for those of us who love our pets, we'll pay the extra to keep them healthy and happy.

review/text: This food is a great alternative to homecooking for your dog. It is grain free, has alot of fruits and vegetables, and it only takes about 5-10 minutes to prepare. I feed this to my dogs in the morning, along with some kibble. The bag says to feed quite a bit if you are only feeding this, and it was just way too much. Now I just put a spoonful or two in their bowls with the kibble. They seem to love it, although my picky dog took about a week to get used to it. I am pretty picky about what I feed my dogs, and have probably researched way too much on dog foods. I feel great about feeding this, and have never heard of any recalls for Grandma Lucy's products!

review/text: I have a 9 year old Standard Poodle, with liver disease.  My vet recommended Grandma Lucy's for him in an effort to allow his liver to rest.  My Vet explained that kibble dog food has a lot of carbohydrate in it, and the carbs make my dog's liver work much harder.  It is a bit on the pricey side, but worth it to me, since I love my dog.  My dog is NOT a picky eater, but<br />it did take him a few days to get accustomed to the consistency of this food.  It is a bit like "oatmeal" after it has been prepared.  Now he loves it.  My younger dog is a VERY picky eater, and she LOVES this freeze dried food.  Even though my vet did not recommend it for her, I am feeding it to both of them now.  It's a great food to get my picky eater to eat.

What they failed to mention was that for my 30 lb beagle I would need 2 cups of "dry" food per day. I did the math which meant one bag would last 8.5 days. That is too expensive for me! I used to make Sadie's food for less then this. I returned the item on Oct 10th. Now 11 days later I still have no refund but I did recieve an email last night that they have recieved my order back and "IF" I am due a refund I will receive another email.

I grew up using it to make several different pasta salads and other shapes, like the elbow or shell, just don't taste as good.  One day I found this DeLallo on sale at my local Whole Foods and snapped it up.  Come to find that it's made in Italy with bronze plates and obviously high quality ingredients.  The pasta is first quality, toothsome and tasty.  I love this pasta so much I choose to save a buck or so a bag and buy a case from Amazon and with prime shipping it's a real bargain.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Waste of time and money.
review/text: Raccoons have been raiding our bird feeders and I purchased this product for a humane way to drive them away.  I sprayed the product liberally around the perimeter of the deck where the feeders hang on metal poles mounted to the deck railing.  This did not deter the raccoon in the slightest.<br /><br />The bottle cautions against spraying directly on wood as it might discolor it, but I went ahead and not just sprayed but DRENCHED the areas of the deck and railing where I knew the raccoons were entering and exiting.  I sprayed the product particularly heavily at the base of the pole holding the feeders since that is where the coon has to stand to reach up into the feeder.  The raccoon sat right in the middle of the area I'd sprayed and didn't appear to be bothered by it at all.<br /><br />Perhaps this product might stop raccoons from eating something it had been sprayed on.  Maybe.  Can't say since that is not the purpose I was using it for.  The product did not live up to it's claim of repelling the raccoons from the treated area and I will be returning the remainder of this bottle for a refund.<br /><br />I'm giving it 1 star only because zero was not an option.

review/summary: Works if you use it correctly
review/text: Critter ridder is meant to be used to deter an animal fro using its mouth.  Spray it on your garbage cans, garbage bags and it works. I have left garbage with meat, fish and food in a plastic bag and nothing else, and if the bag is sprayed not one racoon touches it.  You cant use to form a perimeter, it is not a barrier, it just really really bad and no animal will bite twice.

review/summary: Squirrel Ridder Extreme!
review/text: OK, I was a little reluctant to buy this because of some of the negative reviews, but the fact is that for the purpose I needed it for, it worked EXTREMELY well! I had a squirrel infestation under the eaves (and eventually in the walls) of my house. I tried many things, including Bounce Fabric softener, live traps, and soiled kitty litter. Nothing worked, they just gnawed away at my walls. When I used the critter ridder, they were gone by the end of the day, and haven't been back since. Yes, it is a little pricey, but for the effectiveness, and damage prevention, it is well worth the price. i can't speak to other pests, but this stuff WORKS ON SQUIRRELS! One note of caution, I was a little careless when applying the spray to some lovers in the attic, and inhaled the merest wisp of over-spray. I thought I was going to drop dead on the spot, but the effects wore off after not too much time - use care when applying.

review/summary: What a joke
review/text: I have two dogs who think that they need to poop on my window well covers. I bought this product to try to discourage them from relieving themselves there. Not only did it not work, it seems to have been the dog version of a neon welcome sign signaling them that it is okay to come by.<br /><br />After applying the spray as directed I left the area for a few minutes and then looked out the window to see if the dogs were curious. To my surprise and disgust there was poop on my window well covers and my dogs both were licking the treated area as though they were at the ice cream parlor on free sample day.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone, congratulations to those who this stuff worked for, I myself think it is crap and a total waste of money.

review/text: I have two rabbits who have the run of the back yard - with a brick fence.  Well apparently word got out and all the neighborhood cats decided our yard was a great new hobby.  I've seen possums back there too, and a little hawk tried to get Felix.  Well I bought this stuff, sprayed the top of the brick fence and the surrounding trees.  I also sprinkled the granules in a couple places.  Now we have had total peace for over two months - I just respray (generously) when it rains, which is not a whole lot here in Southern CA.  The rabbits are kings of the yard again (which is not easy when you're that far down on the food chain).

Unfortunately, the squirrels came back any time I wasn't around to chase them away.  No matter how heavy I put it on there they still ate the leaves.  For clarity, I live in Austin, TX and the these are called rock squirrels.  They look like a normal tree squirrel but have black heads and the 1st third of their body.  I doubt their genetic make up is much different from tree squirrels.

So we placed, in liberal quantities, 'Critter Ridder' spray all around the tree where the feeder hangs, as well as on the tree itself, in the hope that Havahart's ad copy promising that 'Critter Ridder' was "great as a squirrel repellent - deters them from birdfeeders!" was actually true.<br /><br />However, within one hour we had MORE squirrels than we had BEFORE we applied this laughably bad product.<br /><br />What a waste of money; but I bet you Havahart is laughing all the way to the bank on this one...

review/text: You do know that Natura Pet has been acquired by Proctor and Gamble in 2010.  I don't believe they will have the same quality ethic as the original company.  I have noticed that the Evo food I buy now has the putrid smell of lower quality meat--a smell I associate with cheap pet food bought off the grocery store shelf.  That was never the case with the original food.  The original boasted of providing human-grade meat and that's why I went to this brand after the pet food scandals some years back.<br /><br />The labels haven't changed--it looks the same as before but it is not the same product.  As usual, large companies will purchase a smaller successful company, keep the name, and then start cutting the quality but keeping the price the same--riding on the reputation of the original company.  It may still be good--my pets appear to like it--but it is not the same product as before.  I feel that now, I'm paying a premium price for an ordinary product.

review/text: I know and agree with most other reviewers about the cats sticking their noses up at this food but unfortunately after my 18 yr old cat, Jazmen, was diagnosed with early stage kidney disease and was also diagnosed with diabetes (but with diet we have this under control) this is what the vet has recommended. I mix a little pumpkin in bc it can make her constipated. She has gotten used to it and does "happily" eat it now. If it prolongs her life and keeps her kidneys healthy that's all that matters to me. I do give her some Wellness pouches as treats once in awhile bc that is what she ate before and she just LOVES them. They are still relatively healthy being grain free and it is what I feed my other cats.

review/text: We breed and raise cats who are typically not picky eaters. We purchased a case each of the large cans of Venison, Beef and Duck. The cats wont eat any of the three varieties. The food is very solid with a paste consistency. It also smells unpleasant. It is an expensive product with supposedly higher/better nutritional value. But, if the cats wont eat it, it has no value at all. When I called to talk with the manufacturer, they said they'd let some one know my complaint. Since they didn't take my name or contact info, I doubt they'll do anything. If you are wanting to try this food, go to the pet store and buy one can to try it out. Dont get stuck with 3 cases as we did.

review/summary: Tis the season for vegetarian-friendly jello shots
review/text: Being the good guest that I am, when I was invited to a friends' house for Thanksgiving, I offered to bring some dish along with me.  Being the good hosts that my friends were, they stated that no dish was required, but I could bring something if I wanted to.  Being an I.T. person, the obvious choice was alcohol.<br /><br />Agar agar has been used in many Asian desserts for a while, but with the molecular gastronomy movement, it's just really starting to take off in the United States.  If you know what agar agar is, there's not much to say about Roland's version - it's packaged in 3oz packages, each package containing several strands or strips of the agar (they are tied with a nice little red ribbon that you can see in the item image). They are not bleached, not certified organic (but come on, agar is seaweed), and have no listed additives.  It's literally just agar agar that's been dehydrated.<br /><br />Agar agar is a tasteless substance which can replace flavorless gelatin in recipes.  The only bad thing about agar is that the conversion of gelatin to agar is a bit tricky.  Although in most instances you can do a 1:1 substitution, variables like acids and enzymes can play havoc with the agar.  Also it should be noted that agar can set up much stiffer than gelatin if you go overboard with the amount.  Imagine the jello becoming more of a gumdrop consistency.<br /><br />I did not know that some of the people coming to the Thanksgiving dinner were vegetarians, so when I brought out my various jello shots the sad vegetarians told me that they cannot drink/eat them because gelatin is not vegetarian friendly. I told them that these jello shots were made from agar agar, which is a seaweed.  Thus the vegetarians were happy and allowed to get drunk with the rest of us meat-eating heathens.
