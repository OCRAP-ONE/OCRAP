review/summary: High quality yummy treat for dogs!
review/text: My puppy loves these treats! She's allergic to wheat and gluten so it's hard to find treats for her (and ones that she likes). She has naturally dry skin and these definitely help! The omega 3 & 6 fatty acids provide what she needs to keep her coat healthy and shiny. It's great-- they don't contain any wheat, soybean, glutens, bad preservatives, or by-products. Not to mention that the salmon and sweet potatoes in it are known to be easily digestible. She gets so excited when I bring out the bag. Worth the money! Highly recommended!

review/summary: WARNING MADE IN CHINA!!!
review/text: I am downgrading from a 5 star to a 1 star because they are made in CHINA. Treats from China have been associated with kidney and liver failure and rare cancers in dogs. Another series of dog deaths from treats from China has been released. There is no oversight. These treats may be OK but I will not take any chances. I am really irritated with Amazon and the vendor for not disclosing the source of the product. They say in the online description, "read the label carefully". In very small print the country of origin is disclosed. I do not knowingly feed my dogs anything from China.<br /><br />These are great treat. My dogs love them and they are no artificial stabilizers or fillers. However, at most other on line pet websites they are half the price. Usually Amazon is competitive in pricing but not on this line of products.

review/summary: Duck!  Treats Are Coming
review/text: These two-millimeter long treats don't have the pronounced smell of the tuna treats. Like the other Omega treats these are easy to break in half, but are small enough for many dogs to eat in one piece. The shih tzu pair, with their dainty snouts, prefer to have their duck treats torn or cut in two. Since the first ingredient in these Duck treats is duck liver, the girls are becoming treat snobs and act as if they are actually dining on Foie gras. I don't have the heart to tell them anything different.<br />Often the Omega Duck treats are mixed in with several other snacks on the breakfast plates. Always the duck treats are the first to disappear. It's funny to watch Piper push aside the other treats so that she can pick out the pieces of Omega treats. I have some reservations about the treat's country of origin, but the girls love these things and their lip smacking comments have all been positive.

review/summary: Smelly, but they make my doggies very happy
review/text: First of all, they stink.  Imagine fish lying around in the sun for a couple of hours.  Yeah, they're that smelly.<br /><br />But that, as it turns out, is why my dogs love them so much.  These treats are so special, in fact, that they're only given out when we want to get our girls into their crates, like at bedtime, or if we're going out or something.  They even know the bag...all I have to do it get it out of the cabinet and they're running off into their crates, waiting happily for their treats.<br /><br />I had read the review from the person who wrote that a fishbone had been found in one.  What I do is bend/break them down the middle before handing them out so I can feel if there's something sharp inside.<br /><br />So the bottom line here is...if my dogs love them, then I love them.  :)

review/text: Jablum Jamaican coffee is Jamaica itself, especially the Sandals Resort at Ocho Rios. If you ever make it to Jamaica, be sure to buy plenty of Jablum in the airport's Duty Free stores . . . it is far less expensive, but not necessarily fresher. Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican "blends" offered in stores and on the Internet). Thank heaven for the Blue Mountains (the "blum" in Jablum)!

review/text: I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other "Jamaica grown" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price.

review/text: When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.

review/text: Believe it or not, I bought this at a yard sale for 50 cents.  The packaging was perfect and looked exactly like the photo.  It doesn't expire for another 6 months.  I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)

review/text: Domino makes a fine sugar.  I like it.  I frequently buy it in the 5 and 10 pound bags at the store.  But when I saw these canisters I thought I'd buy some for 'backup' -- because I hate running out of 'the necessities' like sugar, flour, salt....<br /><br />In any case, I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the first canister I opened, after only two months, showed signs that the sugar had come in contact with moisture.  I took note of the lumps but didn't decide to write this review until after I opened a second container, only two weeks later, and it also showed signs that even with their transparent seals in place, that the containers were NOT air proof. The sugar was entirely usable, and that's not my complaint, but don't you also find it odd that this was the case for these coffee-canister-like containers.  As far as that goes, I don't remember having the sugar in the paper bags do this until after an extremely long period of time has passed.  Like a year.<br /><br />SUMMARY:::<br />Good sugar, but if you are planning on hording, don't count on this sugar remaining moisture free for years.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/baker of sugary goodness

Since the first ingredient in these Duck treats is duck liver, the girls are becoming treat snobs and act as if they are actually dining on Foie gras. I don't have the heart to tell them anything different.<br />Often the Omega Duck treats are mixed in with several other snacks on the breakfast plates. Always the duck treats are the first to disappear. It's funny to watch Piper push aside the other treats so that she can pick out the pieces of Omega treats. I have some reservations about the treat's country of origin, but the girls love these things and their lip smacking comments have all been positive.

review/summary: Smelly, but they make my doggies very happy
review/text: First of all, they stink.  Imagine fish lying around in the sun for a couple of hours.  Yeah, they're that smelly.<br /><br />But that, as it turns out, is why my dogs love them so much.  These treats are so special, in fact, that they're only given out when we want to get our girls into their crates, like at bedtime, or if we're going out or something.  They even know the bag...all I have to do it get it out of the cabinet and they're running off into their crates, waiting happily for their treats.<br /><br />I had read the review from the person who wrote that a fishbone had been found in one.  What I do is bend/break them down the middle before handing them out so I can feel if there's something sharp inside.<br /><br />So the bottom line here is...if my dogs love them, then I love them.  :)

review/text: When my next door neighbor moved she left a bottle (about 3 tbs. in it) so I tried using it in a couple recipes that called for lemon oil.  Also discovered that adding 1/2 tsp. of lemon oil to a Betty Crocker Vanilla Pound Cake mix, and substituting two Tbs. of fresh lemon juice for some of the water makes the best lemon pound cake ever.  Mix a couple Tbs. of lemon juice, fresh lemon zest and enough powdered sugar for a glaze and you've completed the cake.<br /><br />The bottle will last forever, so I share with my daughter.  You just can't compare it to lemon flavorings - it's far better.

You can compare the prices and sellers for yourself.  One item not currently available, B000WMI6NY, is likely to be the best deals, since Amazon usually offers free shipping with purchases of a certain dollar amount.  The others, once you add shipping to the sale price, seem to me to be over-priced.<br /><br />First there were M&Ms, which are good.  Good enough for Reese's to take the idea and expand on it.  And Reese's Pieces are so good that M&Ms stole the idea back - and doesn't do peanut butter anywhere near as well as Reese's!  Like M&Ms, Reese's Pieces are little dots with a candy-coating; inside is a creamy peanut butter.  They don't compare with M&Ms Plain, but they beat the peanut butter out of M&Ms Peanut Butter!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/text: I have had my Keurig for ten days now.  Since I was waiting for my Amazon-ordered Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf to arrive via Fed Ex, I was using the free variety sampler pack that came with the machine.  I was certain that the whole Keurig thing was hype.  The coffee was weak.  The coffee was fruity-winy, just what I dislike in my coffee mug.  I had even tried the hot chocolate and thought it was about the same as Swiss Miss in an envelope:  crappy-tasting and limpid.  Last night, things started to look up:  I had a Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice herbal tea, and that was verrrry good.  And today, my Dark Magic arrived.  Just had two cups.  It's dark.  It's rich.  It's bold.  It's smooth.  It accepts my half-and-half and stands up to it.  It's a heckuva cup of coffee.  Maybe I'll keep the Keurig after all.

review/summary: Rich, Full-Flavored and Non-Acidic
review/text: Recently my cardiologist forced me to give up my beloved coffee with caffeine. I have always been a coffee addict drinking up to 7 cups a day of Green Mountains darkest, richest blends. Sometimes for added oomph I would add a shot of espresso. So imagine my chagrin when forced to give up my beloved coffee? You may ask yourselves why was I giving up coffee? Why wasn't I switching to decaf? Well, lets say that what I remember from the past was that decaf coffee wasn't delicious. It was rather nasty to my taste buds. Sanka Instant and Postum...blech.<br /><br />Since I had been drinking Green Mountain Dark Magic WITH caffeine, I decided to try it in the decaf form. And WOW. What a difference from those weak wanna be coffees that taste like warm water that a brown crayon was dipped in and called coffee.<br /><br />Testing Dark Magic against the French Roast decaf...well thank god Dark Magic is even better since the French Roast Green Mountain will no longer be available.  At least according to Keurig when I asked them.<br /><br /> I had previously thought that the French Roast was the best and that the Dark Magic rated a distant third, but I have a feeling that I had gotten a bad batch since what I have been drinking is excellent.It is surprisingly rich, full flavored, non-acidic and with none of the aftertaste that some coffees can have. I don't think for one minute that I would be able to tell the difference if I was to be served this in a blind taste test.<br /><br />Well this just goes to show that sometimes the past and how we remember things can come back to bite us on our you know whats. I would have been truly suffering had I not found this product!

review/summary: If you like a big cup of coffee...
review/text: If you like a big cup of coffee, buy the "extra" and/or "dark" cups.  They contain more coffee for the same approximate price as the non-extra cups (as the packaging is the expense in K-cups).<br /><br />I make 14 ounces of coffee from these Extra-Bold Dark Magic Decaf cups, then add two ounces of milk.  (Of course, if you like strong coffee, you'll need to make the usual 8 ounces.)<br /><br />Note: Be careful when ordering decaf coffee from Amazon: Amazon has a big fat bug in their search algorithm:  If you search for decaf, they will happily serve up regular coffee instead. Make sure before you click the Buy button that you really are buying decaf.  Otherwise, you may be awake for the next 40 days and 40 nights.

review/summary: The Best K-Cup Decaf So Far and I've Tried Many
review/text: What can I say. I've now tried nearly every Extra Bold Decaf K-cup made and this is my favorite. It's a full bodied, rich, complex coffee that tastes "better" than 95% of the leaded coffees I've tried over the years. I set my Keurig to the 10 oz. mug setting, push the button, and enjoy! My second favorite (and very different) coffee is Coffee People Donut Shop Extra Bold Decaf, although I am looking forward to trying Coffee People Extra Bold French Roast.<br /><br />PS. I have to drink decaf only now, but no compromise in taste thanks to this great coffee.

review/text: This coffee has a very bad, bitter after-taste.<br /><br />It's not really bold per se, either.  It's basically a morning blend light roast, but just made too strong.  A bold ought to be a darker roast in my opinion.  This coffee is for people who have lost their sense of taste.<br /><br />I feel bad throwing this coffee out, but once I tasted the Newman's organic decaf (smooth and tasty), I can't go back. The only hope for this coffee is that it will compost.

review/text: For anyone who still thinks that decaf coffee means Sanka crystals, you are missing out on good flavored coffee without the caffeine.  I enjoy drinking several cups of coffee a day, but the caffeine can make me edgy.  So I balance out my regular blend coffees with a decaf like the Green Mountain extra bold.  You still have plenty of robust coffee flavor, but no caffeine.  I highly recommend it.

It's full bodied, tastes great (and I use the 12 oz water setting so it would be even stronger at 8 oz.) and it doesn't give you the jitters.  I just wish Amazon would offer it on their "Subscribe and Save" program.  It's a tad expensive.

review/text: This coffee is rich and tastes great!  Served it to friends who do not like "decaf" and they had no idea that this was a decaf.  The flavor is really good.  I took off a star because it is not as aromatic as the Nantucket blends.  To me, a coffee should have a coffee aroma when brewing and therefore making my anticipation greater.  Also, the fragrance of brewing coffee reminds me of my Grandma making (remember this?) perked coffee; and, truly, this is a good thing.

We are so excited just to be able to find our favorite, impossible -to-find coffee at Amazon, and to be able to purchase in quantities larger than the standard 18 ct. box. Even factoring in shipping costs, Amazon's unit price is less than most retail outlets, Walmart included!

This Dark magic Decaf tastes so much like regular that I have to double check my k-cup after I brew just to make sure I put in the decaf.  It is strong, rich and has no weakness or after taste.  I have been searching YEARS for a good decaf. I wasted a lot of money on weak decaf,Starbucks Verona decaf was the closest I came, and this is even better, and it is a k-cup!<br /><br />Bravo Green Mountain, thanks for the great brew.

review/text: These k-cups are certainly bold and strong, but the finish is flat and thin. It's lacking in overtones after the initial dark wave. I just started exploring k-cups since my machine arrived last week. Initially I was surprised how watery the house blends are. I wanted something dark and rich in texture. But so far, I'd rather drink Tully's French Roast extra bold k-cups which is just about as strong as Dark Magic but with a wider spectrum and better finish.

After my first 2 cups of 8 o"clock french roast in the AM, I switch to decaf, cold brew,dark roast with chickory. My greatest addiction is chewing Sonic ice by the bag over which I pour all this wonderful coffee. My sister introduced me to this Dark Magic espresso blend for an afternoon pick-me-up while on a visit to Shreveport, La. and I've been in love ever since. Hot or cold it is very smooth and a real treat any time of day,mixed with a little milk,or however you drink yours. Try some. What have you got to lose!!
