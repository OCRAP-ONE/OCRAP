review/text: This ginger paste gives my food great taste.  I think it tastes better than ginger root purchased at the store.  It's easy to use, I don't have to peel or grate.  It also keeps well either stored in the pantry before use or in the fridge afterward.  Great product.  It saves me time when cooking for my family, saves money and gives my recipies/food that perfect ginger taste.

review/summary: Is It Soup OR Is It Broth?
review/text: I ordered this item several weeks ago.  At that time the label said "Kreplach in Chicken Broth."  Now the label says "Chicken Kreplach Soup."  Same UPC code on both.<br /><br />I always took a soup to be somewhat more robust than a broth.  I was getting ready to try the chicken/matzo balls soup when I realized what had taken place with its kreplach brethren.<br /><br />That said, it's not bad, but it's a far cry from what mama used to make.  I just wish it had more substance to it.

review/text: I have a cockerspaniel and this is the only dog food that keeps his skin from being dry.  I have tired more expensive foods and yes he would eat them but they didnt do much for his skin or his coat.  I noticed the change about two weeks after using the product.  Im sure if you have a high maintenance companion then give this brand a try.

review/summary: Noticable improvement in dog's coat! Excellent dog food.
review/text: I have 2 weenie dogs. The newest is a long hair. The past 3 before her were all short hair, so I guess I never saw the importance of a really good food for coat purposes before. I tried to buy good food for health purposes only. Well, being short on funds for a while and temporarily taking care of a total of 4 dogs, I switched from Eukanuba (which I thought was really good) to a brand sold at Walmart, that while not the cheapest there, was definitely a lot cheaper. However, we noticed a HUGE difference in all the dogs coats. Especially our long hair. Her hair got realllyyyy thin. You could see her SKIN on some parts. So, I started researching the best brands for improving the coat and found Avoderm. I am sooooo pleased. Her hair not only came back, but it came back thicker, fuller and softer than ever before! We were also having problems with flakiness on the tips of the ears in all the dogs which also went away with the switch. I'm a loyal Avoderm buyer now and searched everywhere and was driving 50 minutes away just to get it after moving to a tiny town in a new state with no large chain pet stores. You can imagine my surprise when I realized I could get it on Amazon, and it was even cheaper than driving to the store. Easier and cheaper!! It's a win win!! This is good stuff!

review/summary: Great Dog food!
review/text: Avoderm is a great dog food for your dog. Avoderm has had great results for my dog which is a Pekepom (half pomeranian and half pekinese). I used to feed my dog Purina Beneful and there has been a significant difference in my dog since.<br /><br />Ever since we switched to Avoderm my dog's hair is much fluffier and softer to the touch. His hair used to be more like a Pekinese, long and a bit rough. Now his hair is much softer more along the lines of his Pomeranian side. His stool has been of a smaller amount and more solid. One con of the dog food is that his stool has more of a strong smell.<br /><br />Buy Avoderm for your dog, you won't regret it!

review/summary: Not as advertised
review/text: Let's start this with Amazon took care of the issue with this product promptly and courteously so FIVE STARS for them.  Now the abysmal packaging and quantity/quality of this product.  Run, stay away, don't think about it, just keep moving along.  Not in a holiday box but in a brown box with a 11"x14" piece of colored paper that can be taped to the front to cover the cellophane. And no little view hole either like the picture.  The brown box it comes in is about 5" deep but the interior brown box of contents is supported by 3" of cardboard underneath. The 2" deep contents box has 1" of scrap paper pressing the contents into the cellophane.  So what is in that 1"x11"x14"?  Not much! 1 packet of hot chocolate for a 6 oz cup?  That's like a shot.  The littlest 3-4 packages of other stuff not worth mentioning but think 1/3 the size of a small kids lunch bag of chips.  The mustard is in a jar smaller than what the airlines serve jelly in. (1 Oz).  The cheese wheel is more cardboard and little cheese.  The knife to cut the cheese came out of some playdooh set.<br /><br />Let's just say this isn't worth $5 and due to the packaging, it can't be gifted without shame.

Why include a small jar of mustard that didn't go with anything?  The only decent tasting items were the two (less than an ounce) Ghiradelli candies.  Many of the cheese straws were broken pieces.<br />I consider it to be a total waste of money and false advertising.

They're really not straw-shaped at all, but they had a nice spicy cheese flavor to them.<br />Three Pepper Crackers - these were a big hit with my husband.  He loved the taste and texture.<br />Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt - a tasty nutty snack<br />Brie Cheese spread - this spread went well with the crackers provided, and spread fairly easily with the enclosed cheese knife.<br />Chocolate Squares and Hot Cocoa Mix - these were Ghirardelli, and what can I say about Ghiradelli that you haven't heard before?  If you've had Ghiradelli you know it is some of the best chocolate around. Yum!<br /><br />All in all, this would be a nice gift for anyone who isn't on a special diet.

review/summary: Tasty Treats but Not Exciting
review/text: It is always fun to get a gift box or basket but the Wine.com box needs a better presentation.<br /><br />This gift box includes small quantities of upscale food items. Included in the box are; Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt, a small jar of mustard, 2 squares of Ghirardelli chocolate, cocoa, cheese straws, wafer crackers, a small bag of chocolate chip cookies, a round of cheese wedges and a small knife. One concern I had was on the cheese. I was unable to track down the company that makes it to ask how long it could last without refrigeration. But I did call a rival cheese company who shared that if unopened some of their cheeses could last a year without refrigeration. So hopefully this is the same.<br /><br />It is really hard to judge the value of a gift basket or box. I have sent flowers that were quite pricey that lost their bloom in a week yet delighted the recipient. Just recently I sent a fruit gift, from a popular fruit company, which included 6-8 pears, 6-8 oranges and 6-8 apples. It was on special but still pricey at around $60. The person on the receiving end was thrilled. With gift baskets there is a tendency to pay much more than the actual value of the items included. And a lot of it has to with presentation. Giving a fruit basket for example, is more exciting than say handing a person a bag of apples from the grocery store with best wishes. And getting one can be so exciting.<br /><br />And that is where the Wine.com basket fails. For ease of transportation, the goodies are packaged in a cardboard box with nutmeg colored paper shavings. This is placed in a larger box to prevent any damage which is nice. However, the red wrap and gold bow are not on the box. It is just a plain cardboard box.<br /><br />The packaging is substantial and fine but it is just not exciting. And presentation means a lot when it comes to gift baskets. So I have to ask myself would I be excited if I were on the receiving end of this gift instead of having received it as a Vine review product and my thought is, "It's ok". It is just not exciting.

review/summary: Very Good Quality Food Items, but Overpriced
review/text: I think reviewers are being a bit harsh on this product. I think the quality of the food products in this gift basket is above average. You just don't get a whole lot for 40.00 dollars (plus shipping & handling, of course).<br /><br />The included chocolate is Ghiradelli--one of the better American made chocolates available, but sadly there are only 2, 2x2 squares of it. There's a few ounces of spreadable cheese--something like Laughing Cow cheese (semi-soft cheese) in texture, but with pepper in it. You also get an inexpensive, but workable, cheese knife with a wooden handle. There's a handful of good quality almonds (3.5 oz). A small 3/4 oz. jar of sweet/hot mustard. Two bags of cheese crackers- of which one bag tastes like Cheez-It's. Ten or so quarter sized chocolate chip cookies-which taste more like Keebler Pecan Sandies with chocolate chips. And 1 or 2  nut covered caramel candies. Oh and .85 Oz of Ghiradelli Hot Cocoa Mix.<br /><br />The edges of the cheese began to harden after about a week after receiving the gift box. The wedges were refrigerated 3 days after receiving the gift box were kept unopened in their foil wrapper.<br /><br />If this were, 25 dollars I would say it was a good deal, but unless you are totally out of ideas on what to give someone or can't figure out how to make a gift basket yourself...I would avoid, buying it. Not because of the food, but because it's too expensive for what you get.<br /><br />The cheese hardening is disconcerting, however.

review/summary: Plain wrapping and sky-high price make it a bad buy
review/text: This Wine.com Especially for You This Holiday Gift Box comes in a cardboard carton with a matching size gift card that says "Season's Greetings". The goodies are in yet another cardboard box shrink-wrapped in cellophane inside the carton. I have uploaded three pictures depicting this gift box as the receiver would have seen it. Frankly, I wasn't impressed with the packaging; I don't think the gift receiver would be either. As a gift, the packaging should be a bit more elaborate. The goodies are in very small portions, totaling 20-1/2 oz., even though the web page described the shipping weight as 4.4 pounds. The price and the shipping charge are stunning (See my comment below). For the shipping alone, one can buy a very nice gift basket made by Wine.com from Amazon. Check this out at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DKA7HM">Wine.com Something Sweet & Savory Gift Basket</a>. I doubt that I will send this gift box to anyone - not at this price and the embarrassingly plain packaging.

review/summary: Kind of pricey for what you get
review/text: First and foremost, let me make it clear that this item was received free to test and review through Amazon Vine Voice in May.  I have no idea how long ago this was packed together.  Nothing appears to be stale.<br /><br />The packaging was a plain cardboard box with a thin cardboard insert that takes up the length & width of the box, in an attempt to make it look like there's a wrapped Christmas package inside.  The whole thing was nicely protected for shipping.<br /><br />I've never had Cheese Straws before and wasn't sure what to expect.  They seem to be a cross between a thick cracker and a cookie.  These are Aged Cheddar by Sonoma Cheese.  The taste is pretty strong and be prepared for a hot feeling in your mouth afterward.  The package contains 2 servings.<br /><br />Three Pepper Water Crackers contains 4 servings that have the pepper visible on the crackers.  A thin, dry cracker that has a mild taste.<br /><br />Sonoma Jacks Parmesan Peppercorn gourmet cheese wedges have 6 individually wrapped wedges.  The main ingredients listed are Monterey Jack and Parmesan cheese.  A somewhat plastic/rubbery texture, although the taste is okay; nothing special.  A small cheese knife/spreader is included.<br /><br />Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies are bite-sized with 2 servings.  The cookies appear to have a somewhat breaded coating on them that poured out of the package as crumbs.  The cookies themselves were intact and I liked the taste.<br /><br />Brown & Haley Cashew Roca.  These were really good and are doubly wrapped for freshness.  Too bad there are only 3 in the package.<br /><br />Nunes Farms Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt.  I generally eat plain almonds so I was happy to find that the salt is very light and added just enough to make these more interesting.  3 servings per package.<br /><br />1 sleeve of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Hot Cocoa Mix.  I'm saving this for later.<br /><br />2 Ghirardelli Chocolate squares with Caramel filling.  It's Ghirardelli.  Enough said.<br /><br />1 Napa Valley Mustard Co Hot Sweet Mustard.  Label claims it's rich with honey; the main ingredient is sugar but honey is listed in there as well.  I really don't understand why this was included in the box.  There isn't anything to try it out on so this hasn't been tasted yet.<br /><br />As of this writing the price appears to be $39.99.  I just can't see myself purchasing this as a gift at that price.

review/summary: What a waste of money!
review/text: This is my first review ever.  After seeing the price charged, I felt I had to let people know what to expect for their $39.99.<br /><br />We received this as a gift from a company with which we do business.  Unlike other reviewers I was able to find in the box a small flimsy thermal paper printed sheet saying "nk you for your business!  Happy Holidays from ..."  That's right - the paper was sliced off so that the whole word "Thank" did not appear!<br /><br />Then, there's the contents!  The picture on amazon.com makes it look like there is a lot of stuff and the description says "generous" and something about using it for entertaining (again, implying large quantities), but, the quantity of each item is actually miniscule.  You get:  2 - 1 1/2 inch Ghirardelli Chocolate Squares with caramel filling (the same as the individual foil-wrapped candies that come in those small bags of Ghirardelli chocolates), 3.5 oz of Nunes Farms Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt, 2 oz of Cheese Straws, .85 oz of Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mix (makes one cup when you add milk!); 4 oz of Sonoma Jack's Parmesan Peppercorn Cheese Wedges; 1.27 oz of Cashew Roca; 4 oz of Three Pepper Water Crackers; 2 oz of Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies; 1.75 oz of Napa Valley Hot Sweet Mustard and a wood handled metal spreader. The person who wrote the description must have very small parties!<br /><br />The amazon.com picture also misleads you into believing that the assortment is gift wrapped.  If fact, that is not the case.  The items are arranged on a bed of shredded and crinkled brown paper in an open brown paper box which is shrink-wrapped.  Then there is a completely separate piece of heavy printed paper that is what you see in the amazon.com picture (and that you could easily mistake for gift wrapping).  The shrink-wrapped package and printed paper are packed in another brown paper box - this one opens on a hinge.  Then, that box is surrounded by crunched up brown paper and packed inside another box for shipping. The aforementioned flimsy thermal paper "gift card" and a packing slip are in this outermost box - amongst the crunched up paper.  A lot of trees died to send this paltry food assortment!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I do appreciate receiving a gift but I hate to see well-intentioned gift givers taken advantage of.  In this case, the company that sent this gift box to me was clearly ripped off. I would suggest that this $39.99 gift box should sell for closer to $9.99!

review/text: The bars arrived on time and was really really fresh, they are more fresh than the bars at the store. It came in a very classy box (like every candy bar pack here on amazon)and it was crunchy. Plus, you may also tell by the other reviews it is only about 50 cents per bar, as when you go to the store, they are usually over 1.00 dollar. This is a great deal, from desserts from satisfying your sweet tooth.

review/summary: Warning! "Free Shipping" this isn't...  Updated May 14th 2012
review/text: First, disregard the original review (below the dashed line), this is now "Five Star"! The product "Postage Due" charge appears to be a case of Mail Fraud, and has been reported. The seller, "Free Shipping Tigers", refunded the charge and is attempting to collect it from the USPS. The delay to hear back from them was due to the USPS never returning their attempts to contact them.<br /><br />"Free Shipping Tigers" could have turned this over to the Post Office and not refunded my money, since they did not ship it "Postage Due". I applaud them and will definitely buy from them again!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I received my package late because it arrived "Postage Due" (and no small amount, several dollars) and had to play Package-tag with the Post Office.<br /><br />Let me make this clear, the Crunch bars are delicious and everyone is enjoying them. Go ahead and buy them.<br /><br />This is a warning about the listed seller "Free Shipping Tigers". Apparently they ship the item free alright, because YOU have to pay to receive them.<br /><br />I contacted the seller for a refund (through Amazon.com). After waiting the three days to hear from them, I have now filed a claim with Amazon.com in order to get my money back. (That was today. I will update this when I hear from them.)<br /><br />Again, "Free Shipping Tigers", the sellers still listed as of the time of this review, sent this package "Postage Due". So when it is listed as "Free Shipping", that seems to mean THEY don't have to pay, but YOU will! Later!

review/text: If you can use the calories, or if you have an iron constitution and can parcel these bars out, say one per day, then this is for you.  These are the best candy bars there are, and the only drawback is that they are good.  Eating only one per day, about all that I could spare(calorically) requires the patience of Job, and I don't have that.  So, now I admire these bars but can't have them anywhere nearby.  If only they sold a candy machine that would dispense them, one per 24 hours...

review/summary: Excellent Thai Fortune Cookies
review/text: I ordered these from Amazon (they arrive in a pack of eight boxes). I'm giving some of the boxes for part of an upcoming anniversary present for my parents who are Thai. I already gave some of the boxes to some of my co-workers,and their kids, grandkids, nieces, and nephews love them. And instead of handing out candy to people who visit our workplace, I now hand out these. These Thai fortune cookies are conversation starters. These Thai fortune cookies are the alternative to the same old Chinese fortune cookie. These Thai fortune cookies have no preservatives, no MSG, and are gluten-free. And they are coconut-flavored in a subtle way, and they are not hard like the typical Chinese fortune cookie. I have Thai and Chinese blood so I appreciate both Thai and Chinese fortune cookies. (Even though if you actually visit China, which I have, a lot of restaurants there don't serve fortune cookies. You get fruit as desserts instead.) People who have TMJ and jaw problems like me can't eat the typical hard Chinese fortune cookie. But these Thai fortune cookies are great. The Thai fortune cookie is shaped in a way that you can put the cookie in your mouth and let the cookie dissolve so that you don't have to chew. Let's just say, in my opinion, this cookie is a safer option for little kids, senior citizens, and people with TMJ to enjoy. All the cookies come individually packaged in nice "A Taste of Thai" wrappers, and they're small enough to put in your purse, bag, or car to travel. Since I was a little girl, I've always liked fortune cookie messages. The fortune cookie messages from this "A Taste of Thai" company and Good Karmal caramel candies are the best - they are the least cheesiest - and their messages carry some philosophical meaning. Here are some sample messages from "A Taste of Thai" fortune cookies: 1.) "Sometimes one impresses by saying something and sometimes one creates as significant an impression by remaining silent.", 2.)"Words have the power to both destroy and heal. When words are both true and kind, they can change the world.", 3.) "Neither fire nor wind, birth nor death can erase our good deeds.", 4.) "Remember always that you are just a visitor here, a traveler passing through. The moment of your departure is unknown." You get the point. "A Taste of Thai" is a registered trademark of Andre Prost, Inc. Each "A Taste of Thai" fortune cookie box has a Thai recipe on the back. All the boxes I had showed a sticky rice with mango recipe that you can serve with the fortune cookies. You can visit the "A Taste of Thai" website to check out their catalog of Thai recipes and cooking videos. They also have a link to the Thai Turtle Trust website, an initiative they started in 2007 to help save and bring awareness to the conservation of more than 72 turtle and tortoise species in Asia. Anyways, I highly recommend "A Taste of Thai" coconut fortune cookies and Good Karmal caramel candies. They taste great. They make excellent gifts. They get people's attention. The fortune cookie messages are nice. And they are reasonably priced. If you want something different, this is the route to go! I'm so glad that Amazon sells these Thai fortune cookies!

review/summary: Excellent twist on the fortune cookie
review/text: A coconut fortune cookie that tastes good and has intriguing words of wisdom?  Yes, they exist and you can buy them off Amazon.<br /><br />I happened upon these cookies in the international foods section of my local market.  I'm weak when it comes to resisting treats with coconut and I think fortune cookies are quite fun.  A Taste of Thai coconut fortune cookies are splendid with tea.  They are flaky and have a distinctive coconut taste.  If you love coconut, you have to try these.<br /><br />Each cookie comes individually wrapped and that makes them perfect for travel or as favors for parties.  The "fortunes" inside the cookie are more akin to sage advice.  I like this aspect.  These are sophisticated fortune cookies that delivers words to contemplate while you nibble away.

There are "only" 12 cookies in the box, but that's clear if you read the nutrition info...plus, if you're wanting to buy lots of cookies, there are plenty of other options out there. These are fun and delicious and the fortunes are fantastic.

review/text: I think these cookies are delicious. But what a rip-off! You can get the REAL thing, Thai crispy rolls, at an Asian market for about $2 for a big bag. This brand makes them very small and there aren't many in the box either. The real ones by comparison are probably 8 times larger... about the size of a big highlighter or marker. These are about the size of my pinky finger. These are known in Thai as Tong Muan.

review/summary: Weak fortune cookies
review/text: I was somewhat enthused to try these based on the other reviews.  However, there are really not many cookies in each box.  Maybe a dozen.  The packaging is really wasteful and the size of the box is misleading.  Second, the cookies don't taste so great and are a lot smaller than a normal fortune cookie.  Some of them had a sort of "burnt" flavor.  Finally, the fortunes.  This is maybe the lamest part.  They are exactly the same in every box!  and they aren't even good fortunes.  They are more like little inspirational thoughts of the kind you have heard before.  Some of them are good thoughts to be reminded of, but they could have wrote more fortunes than that.  They shouldn't be predictable and repetitive.  And the cookies are just too small, and honestly, for what's supposed to be a premium product, ordinary fortune cookies actually taste better to this palate.

review/summary: It's Gnocchi But There's Better Gnocchi Out There!
review/text: Bought this to use for some soup (chicken gnocchi soup, Olive Garden recipe) as well as the occasional pan-frying with some EVOO, garlic and parmesan cheese. Aside from the soup, this gnocchi has an odd flavor to it and honestly I only purchased the whole wheat gnocchi because the original potato variety was out of stock at the moment. It DID save me 1/2 the cost by buying this brand as compared to the local store prices however I won't be purchasing it again. In the soup, however, it gets cooked long enough that it doesn't taste like much and merely acts as a 'dumpling' so it's not obvious in the soup. I tried everything and nothing changes the flavor from "eh" to "good", unfortunately!

review/text: This is the best tasting decaf I have found.  I tried about a dozen different brands and this was the only one that I found to have the richness of regular without any sourness.  The grind is fine enough to use in my Jura automatic espresso machine. It makes fine French press too but reduce the steep time to accomodate the finer grind.<br /><br />MY STORY:<br />As a nursing mother I need to watch my caffeine intake.  As a former full-time graphic designer, I had a massive coffee habit that needed taming.  I really LOVE the taste of coffee and was used to having 2 double lattes a day, one in morning and one around 2:30 PM.  So I tried doing one shot regular espresso and one shot decaf espresso in both my lattes to cut my daily intake by half and spread out the caffeine out so my body could process it without passing a huge slug of it to my baby.  It worked ok but the decaf never tasted right, it always lacked richness and tasted sour; until I ordered this.  I was amazed and delighted that this decaf really tastes like REAL coffee!  No sour notes or weakness to spoil the great flavor of my regular shot of espresso.  Now both shots tasted great and this momma gets her coffee AND has a baby that still naps soundly.<br /><br />WORTH EVERY PENNY!

review/summary: Primary Flavor is Sugar
review/text: I don't want to say these are awful but I won't ever get them again. The praise in other reviews, especially for the hickory strips, convinced me to try them. I now suspect the praise was "planted" by vested interests.<br /><br />The weaknesses of the product are legion. First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.<br /><br />Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.<br /><br />Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.<br /><br />At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close. For a vegetarian jerky product that is both tasty and relatively healthy and won't leave your fingers covered in pancake syrup, I recommend Stonewall's Jerqee.

review/summary: Warning: These smell and taste like dog food :(
review/text: I am a vegetarian, and I wanted so badly to like this vegan jerky. As soon as I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was that the jerky is very moist, not like real beef jerky at all (which I understand to be dry and chewy). Also, it smelled like pure dog food. I decided to take a bite anyway, and found that it tastes exactly like it smells. All I could think about was that I was eating dog food. I gave it 2/5 stars because one of my friends actually liked it, and apparently so do a lot of Amazon users since it comes highly recommended. Hopefully you like it better than I did, but beware if you are easily put off by unpleasant smells!

This vegetarian product is one of the nicest I have had the pleasure to enjoy for quite a while. I cannot compare this to the real thing, since I have never tried the real thing, but if this is not acceptable to vegetarians, vegans and non vegetarians, I would be most surprised.

review/summary: Packaging Impossible to Open
review/text: These are great tasting tofu jerky strips!  Low in fat, high in protein, and pretty low in calories (99 calories in this flavor) across the board.  This flavor can be a bit spicy, depending on the batch.  My last batch was great, but the current one has some very small, but whole peppercorns throughout the jerky.  It's still good, but I'm on the fence as to which batch I prefer.  The only real complaint I have is that the packaging is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to open without a pair of scissors.  It's not real great for on-the-go when you have to wrestle with the package with both hands and your teeth to get it open.  I can't understand why they made the packaging this way, what a bummer.

review/text: I took one bite of one of these things and had to throw all the rest of them away. The taste is indescribably yucky, sort of sweet yet caustic. The worst part is the TEXTURE! It was like trying to bite through soggy cardboard. Utterly disgusting. I guess if you were trapped in a collapsed coal mine and awaiting rescue and there was NOTHING else to eat, you might choose this over a coal-mine rat, but it would be a hard choice.

review/text: The first thing I noticed is that it smells JUST like the canned cat food I give my cat. This was a big turn-off, but I have had good experiences with wheat gluten in the past, so I gave it a shot. The flavor is nice, and has a decent aftertaste. The texture is OK, but not what I would expect from a "jerky".. I would have preferred something much chewier. I did eat them, but it's not something I will purchase again.

This stuff comes covered in a greasy, slimy coating.  After trying hard to get passed that, on to the actual jerky...it's not chewy, like jerky is supposed to be, it is too easy to bite off a piece.  And the flavor is beyond description, in a bad way.  I've tried almost all of the flavors now, and would never buy ANY of them again.  They have a weird perfumey taste.  So, they're slimy and taste awful.  That about sums it up.

review/summary: made in Taiwan?
review/text: I bought this without realizing that it is a product of Taiwan.  Considering all the health risks from eating foods made in China, I don't think I can trust the ingredients used in this product.  As I understand, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea, all import many food ingredients from China, and they have found many harmful chemicals in them (I am not even including those that are unsanitary, i.e. made from sewer water).  So what guarantee is there that this product do not contain carcinogens or other harmful chemicals?  FDA do not, and cannot, test every single foreign product coming into U.S.<br /><br />Eat at your own risk.

review/summary: Not as good as it could be (misleading ingredient label also)
review/text: A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much.<br /><br />  With that said, there is a company making soy jerky that has better flavor, texture and quality. They even make jerky that is unsweetened. Most importantly, this company tasty eats does not have any garlic or onion powder in any of their products.<br /><br />  This was the biggest, we felt, downfall of this product. Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has "vegetarian spices" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion. But there is. In these primals strips, all are having some form of garlic, possibly onion.<br /><br />  We found tasty eats soy jerky to be Perfect. Really, in quality, texture and also the fact that they use no onion or garlic whatsoever.

review/text: First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to "spices". Here it is part of the "vegetarian spices" ingredient.<br /><br />  The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available.<br /><br />  Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5. This primal strip does not compare.

Well, even calling the company, they are not forthcoming, because we could taste garlic in it, and compared to "tasty eats" soy jerky, this does not even compare.<br /><br />  So first, the ingredient "vegetarian spices" includes granulated garlic powder, possibly onion. In ayurvedic terms, this is not Sathwic for one's body.<br /><br />  We totally recommend the soy jerky by tasty eats. We ordered six cases of the ginger. They use no onion or garlic in any of their products. Most companies do list "spices" but they will almost always label garlic or onion powder separately. This company who makes the primal strips does not. After all the comparisons, we found tasty eats soy jerky to be the best taste, quality and texture.<br /><br />  In fact, they are out of Teriyaki, their best selling jerky, the original flavor, peppered and hot n' spicy. But we will order cases of them when they become available.  They provide a first class jerky that is healthy and proper for everyone; esp. vegans and vegetarians.

review/summary: "Better than meat!" says the carnivore.
review/text: I am a card-carrying carnivore.  Having said that, I am also the Laziest Man This Side of a Lebowski.  Even chewing is too much work for me.  Given that, Primal Strips are heaven.  The texture is very close to meat, but is consistently chewable, with none of the gristle often associated with beef jerky.  Spam is too gooey.  Real beef jerky makes my jaw ache, and I end up spitting out gristle too frequently.  But this?  This is perfect.  If "they" replaced meat with this Soylent Brown-type food, I'd happily leave the Real Thing behind.  I'm not sure of the health benefits.  I guess it's good for me.  I've seen people who are healthier than I eating it, so I figure it's nutritious.  Anyway, it tastes robust, has a perfect texture, and is a perfect snack.

review/summary: Tasty but with a big drawback
review/text: Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is "imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west."<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the "wet" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).

review/summary: Very Convincing Meat Replacement
review/text: I ate beef jerky every single day at my school cafeteria when I was growing up. I loved the stuff. And then I became a vegetarian and, alas, I thought my beef jerky days were done for. Until I discovered this. It is very convincing - the texture isn't gross or suspect like many fake meat products. It isn't too tough, is a bit moist, and has a nice flavor. It is much softer than Tofuky Jerky beef jerky replacement, so the texture is easier to deal with, but this flavor is more sweet than the spicy Tofuky Jerky version. I'm excited to taste other flavors to see if there is something a bit on the spicy barbecue side rather than sweet barbecue side, but in general, I really like this and it might convince even the most skeptical meat eater. My dad even liked it, which is saying a lot - he is an old school eater who was very skeptical of anything vegetarian.

Everyone I have given samples to has been amazed.  They are expensive, as far as that goes.  But you cannot go wrong on flavor and texture.  These are so darn great that I have't tried any of the other flavors or textures so far.

review/summary: Even a snack a meat eater would like
review/text: I am not by any means a vegetarian (I eat my steaks rare), but I do try to eat healthy.  Beef jerky is a great snack if you are on the go (I travel a lot), but the constant intake of red meat is not good for you.  So, I tried the Primal Strip vegan strips.  I have had every one that they make.....and they are all good.  The Thai Satian Peanut is by far my favorite (the hot and spicy shiitake mushroom jerky is my second favorite).  I have recommended this snack to even the most devout meat eaters and they even like it.  I give it 5 stars - but just like everything - they are not for everyone.  I recommend buying them individually first, and if you love it then come back to amazon and get a box (amazon is the cheapest for the boxes).

review/text: This Hickory Smoked flavor is my favorite of the Primal Strips lot. The strips are moist, tender, unusually flavorful, and just the right size. Even my carnivorous relatives in Wisconsin took to these Strips. My only outstanding concern is that Primal Strips are manufactured in Taiwan, which  means their production is outside the domain of US food safety and inspection. However, having consumed over two dozen of these strips in the past month, I remain happy and healthy.

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: This is a great tasting product.  The texture is just tough enough.  Great to have on hand for a quick pick-me-up.  It's a bit peppery so it does have a little kick to it if you hit a peppercorn.<br />Highly reccommended.  I love it.  Just bought myself a pack of 24.

review/summary: Great Tasting Vegan Jerky!
review/text: I was looking for an alternative meat source for a backpacking trip my husband and I are taking soon and discovered this great tasting vegan meat jerky. It tastes great, but is a bit to salty for my tastebuds

review/summary: I'm torn...but I'm still eating them.
review/text: I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.

review/summary: I wanted so much to like it!
review/text: First, I expected this to be like dry jerky.  This was wet and soggy with a spongy texture.  There is something so off putting about the flavor, it's like wet dog food.  The first bite seemed okay, but I could not finish it even though it was small.  Regretfully, I decided to buy this anyway based on the reviews... I read all the one star reviews and thought "Heyyyy now, it can't be that bad! These people must be clueless. they must be expecting it to taste like real jerky, of course it's not!"  I was soooo wrong.

review/text: Wonderful! I have a busy job that keeps me occupied with little time to take meal breaks. I take a couple pieces of this and some fruit and veggies, and I get to have healthful snacks instead of relying on fast food or candy bars. Helped me lose 20 (and counting) pounds!

review/summary: The perfect snack
review/text: I cannot give high enough praise for these incredibly delicious and protein packed little snacks. Even my very food fussy 5 year old likes them. They are the perfect light lunch or snack to throw in your purse for a busy afternoon. The flavour is delicious, sweet and smokey. At under 100 calories and packed with 10 grams of protein, you can't go wrong. I HIGHLY recommend these snacks, they are worth every penny.

review/summary: Tasty and filling!
review/text: The flavor is robust and tangy, and the texture is very pleasing and moderately chewy - not enough to hurt your teeth, just enough to satisfy! Also, they're not salty-tasting at all. The "jerky" flavoring is moist enough to make a little mess on your fingertips, but you can suck it right off. :)<br /><br />I have bought these in single-serving sizes in our local grocery store as well. I buy them every week and carry them with me for emergency sustenance.

review/summary: finally!
review/text: i've searched high and low for a delicious, healthy, meatless jerky product.  i'm a pescatarian, so tuna/salmon/halibut jerky is great, but super expensive and often incredibly high in sodium.  i found these in the aisles of pcc and absolutely fell in love.  first thing i did was search amazon for them, and here they were!  the price is better, and i knew i would eat these every day.  i take two to work and have at least one at home.  i would recommend these to anyone, carnivore or vegan, looking for a delicious, healthy source of protein.  wow!

review/text: I have searched for a good vegetarian jerky for several years.  There have been some hits but more misses.  This is one of the best; a great BBQ flavor and a consistency similar to real jerky.  Definitely worth trying.

review/text: I absolutely love this stuff -- the mesquite lime flavor is sweet, spicy and tangy, and the consistency of the jerky is chewy yet moist. At 74 calories and 10 grams of cholesterol-free meatless protein, you can't beat it as a snack.

review/text: This is my favorite flavor from Primal Strips.  I like the others but ordered this one last since it sounded weird, but it's great.  The lime flavor is strong and their texture is very good (moist and chewy).  Lowest calories (same as Thai Peanut) from their line.  An excellent no-guilt snack!

review/summary: Worst jerky ever
review/text: Disgusting, slimy, stinky!  I love jerky but have a weak jaw and have trouble chewing it. A diet website recommended this meatless jerky, so I ordered it to try it.  Absolutely horrible!  I recently gave the entire order (except for a small bite I tasted) to a friend to be donated to feed the homeless.  I hope someone may like it.  It comes from the package wet and slimy and has a clove-like odor.  That's about all I can remember about it.
