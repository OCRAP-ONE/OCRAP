review/summary: love this stuff
review/text: I became hooked on muesli when I was on a cruise last year.  The muesli served on the ship came directly from Switzerland and I believe that it was not as sweet as this.  I preferred the less sweet version but this is very good also.  It is very chewy and certainly appears to be nutritious based on the list of ingredients.  I tried making the chocolate chip muesli cookies by using the recipe printed on the package.  They were awful, in my opinion.  If you want to eat  it as a snack, mix some in yogurt rather than trying the cookie recipe.  I definitely recommend this product.  It is much better than anything that I've found in the health food stores.  I would give it five stars if it were a little less sweet.

review/summary: Cheap but you get what you pay for
review/text: I ordered this after the Familia muesli that we've been eating jumped in price, but it is a bit dry, reminiscent of sawdust. Drowned in soy milk and topped with fruit, it's bearable, but I don't exactly jump out of bed excited to eat breakfast. I'm looking into making my own muesli now; it can't be any worse, and it will definitely be cheaper.<br /><br />On a related note, I had shipping problems AGAIN after 14 years of great service from Amazon. The muesli I ordered never showed as being shipped, and I ended up contacting customer service. They apologized and said that they were shipping it out  with free 2-day deliver added. That's great, but when it did ship, I was charged $11 more than my original purchase price. A quick call to customer service corrected that, but this is happening with every order now, and yes this was delivered by Lasership in an unmarked car. Sign of the times I guess.

review/text: This cereal tastes great and is very nutritious - a really good alternative to bland Quaker Oats...<br /><br />A word of caution. If you are not familiar with eating oatmeal products and you decide to try this product out, please avoid the mistake I made described in this story:<br /><br />One morning, I was picking up my friend to carpool to work with. I decided to try his Muesli while waiting in his kitchen so I dumped a bunch of it into a bowl, not realizing how much it was going to be. Well, I finished the entire bowl and I felt great - nice and full. At around 1 pm, however, I felt this *tremendous* pressure in my lower abdomen. So I quickly left my desk for the bathroom while doing my best to hold in what I had know idea was about to come out. Let's just say I was lucky that no one else was in the bathroom. This continued for 6 hours...<br /><br />I argue for every 1 cup of Muesli expect 1 cubic meter of methane production - at sea level.

This stuff doesn't float like crappy fluff cereal.  So when you make some, it seems like you don't have that much.  When I was looking at the product I didn't see that it had raisins, but it is brimming with them.  Raisin Bran's two scoops has nothing on this stuff.  I really like this product and I would like to try more Bob's Red Mill products in the future.

review/summary: Very high quality carbs!!
review/text: This is IT for breakfast!!  I eat this for breaky everyday with westsoy organic unsweetened soymilk and fresh blueberries.  I feel awesome for hours and I totally feel different if I eat something else. I am a 42 year old female, work out 2x daily, and controlling my carb intake but I was feeling tired as I was slowly losing weight comfortably. So I looked for a very high-quality low-glycemic cereal to eat before my morning workout.  I eat a 1/4 cup muesli with 1/2 cup of the soymilk.  This combo gives you net 17.5g carbs (23.5g minus 6g fiber)& 8.5g protein.  It doesn't initially sound low carb but believe me, those carbs are worth it! OMG! what a difference in my workouts...AND I got over a weight plateau while starting to lose my tummy!  Oh and all of the other great benefits each of these ingredients offers your body.  TRY IT for a week and notice the difference.  If you're not used to an earthier, less sugary food...you'll get used to it and will appreciate the lovely subtle flavors...and HOW you feel and LOOK!

review/summary: Great m&uuml;esli: the kind that could actually be sold in Switzerland.
review/text: Having lived in Switzerland for several years, one of the things I missed coming to this country was the ready availability of good breakfast cereals. I have never quite understood how the sugar-filled granola stuff could ever have been mistaken as healthy and nutritious.<br /><br />Since the stores in my area do not carry decent m&uuml;eslis (Trader Joe's has a "blueberry" m&uuml;esli, whose "blueberries" are actually blueberry-flavored cranberries...), I tried to order online, and ran into this product on Amazon, which I ordered based on the reviews.<br /><br />It turned out to be a lucky choice. Bob's Red Mill m&uuml;esli is the way m&uuml;esli should be: a short list of ingredients (10), none of which require a degree in chemistry to understand. A mix of cereals and nuts, to which a delicious combination of dried fruit add a wonderful fruitiness and a subtle sweetness. Great with cold and warm milk, yoghurt, or as a base for a Bircher-style m&uuml;esli.<br /><br />This m&uuml;esli ranks right there with some of the best stuff you can buy in Switzerland, and if you have ever had m&uuml;esli there, you know this is no small praise.

review/text: First let me say I'm a health nut most of the time.  I eat fat free popcorn, fat free butter, fat free cheese, I use artificial sweeteners and I get the leanest meat I can at the super market.  The problem I had with this cereal is that it's way too dry and has no real flavor.  If you look at the label it's 100% all natural and it tastes and feels that way.  I added a bunch of artificial sweetener to my cereal and I struggled to put it down.  I love the super market healthy cereals that have granola, nuts, raisins but this is for the super hearty folks I guess.  I have a 1/2 of bag still and I think the rest is literally going to the birds.  My honest review and I review items less than 1% of the time.  I just had to post something other than a 4 or 5 star for something I just did not like.<br /><br />Taste = 1.5 outta 5  / Too Bland literally tasteless<br />Price = 2.5 outta 5 / Good price too base taste is lacking<br />Recommend = No / Even a health nut has his limitations<br />Buy Again = No / Sorry, I can't do it!

review/text: I grew to love muesli while spending a lot of growing-up years in Europe. This version is even better than the one I grew up on, in my opinion, because it's not just oats, but a combination of several rolled grains. It also has a great combination of fruit and nuts added to the mix. In summer, it's great with blueberries, added pumpkin seeds, and milk. When the weather gets colder, it's delicious cooked, and only takes a couple of minutes. I add either maple syrup or stevia for sweetening. In short, this is a wonderful, healthy cereal mix that I never want to be out of!

The best way to eat it (for me at least) is to buy a nice big tub of low-fat Nancy's yogurt (or any other "real" yogurt) then mix it in a bowl with some of this muesli and a dash of fruit-flavored (some kind of berry is usually the best), sugar-free coffee syrup like Davinci or Torani. That will give you as much protein as a couple eggs, a bunch of complex carbs, low fat and no sugar. It's probably about the best breakfast you can eat and it tastes like it's terrible for you.

review/summary: Only Good If You Like Muesli
review/text: Let me explain why people either rate this as 5-star or 1-star.  Muesli does taste like cardboard, but this good muesli tastes like good cardboard.  Just kidding, but not far off the truth.<br />Some who rate it low perhaps are expecting granola.  I know lots of people who see and taste real muesli for the first time are disappointed.  It takes some getting used to.  Muesli is an acquired taste, kind of like beer.  This muesli would have disgusted me as someone new to muesli just as a fine Pale Ale would have tasted bitter and awful to me if it had been the first beer I had tasted!<br />This Bob's muesli is really good if you like real muesli (not the Kellogg's variety softened up for the American pallette.)

review/summary: We love this Muesli
review/text: We started buying Muesli for breakfast during a trip to France last month - and when we returned to our home in Columbia SC, couldn't find a product similar to what we enjoyed in France.  I looked around on line, and the product description of Bob's Red Mill Muesli sounded like what we liked.  Turned out to be the same - we love it - and have just re-ordered.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli
review/text: One of the reasons I like this product is there are no added sweeteners - just whole grains,nuts and fruit.  I add additional sunflower seeds, ground flax seed,oat bran and milk to the muesli and heat it in the microwave for a minute or two.  I then add a spoonful of yogurt (usually the fruit flavored type) for a nice, easy breakfast cereal.

review/summary: A quick healthy on the go breakfast.....and cookies too.
review/text: In the morning I am typically in a rush and so it had been difficult to make breakfast, yet alone a healthy one.  I started combining Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muelsi with a 6oz container of plain yogurt.  The Muesli has just enough sweetness to make the combination enjoyable.  I now have this every morning and it gives me a good start to the day, it's quick, tasty and economical too.<br />I also tried the recipe that is printed on the package for Bob's Chocolate Chip Muesli Cookies and that is a yummy treat.

review/text: Bob's muesli is chock-full of good stuff.  It is real grains, nuts and raisins in a natural, portable form.  Healthy, full of fiber, convenient - it is also less expensive than the boxed and advertised, often oversweet, other brands of muesli.  A classic and a good value.

review/summary: The best muesli I've found
review/text: Since visiting Switzerland years ago, I've been in love with muesli cereal, which is what we were frequently served for breakfast. I'd never heard of it before then. I've tried ever since to find something similar, and ended up making my own. Finally! Bob's is the real deal! All the right stuff in perfect proportions. A little bit goes a long way, so it turns out to be very inexpensive. And very healthy! Just a note, this is not to be confused with granola. (It's much better, and better for you, in my opinion.)

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli--absolutely delicious, and NO sugar!!!
review/text: This is our favorite cereal! We love it with fresh fruit added, but it tastes good plain too. My daughter likes hot cereal, so she cooks hers slowly in milk--turns out creamy and delicious. I enjoy mine with cold milk. I especially appreciate that there is no sugar or other added sweetener, just the sweet goodness of whole grains, nuts and dried fruit. This is also delicious sprinkled over yogurt--add some blueberries or chopped up strawberries and it tastes heavenly! I usually keep unopened bags of Muesli in the freezer.<br />I used to buy it at the grocery health food aisle, in the 18 oz bags, but they were expensive--about $5.99 per bag. Now I get FOUR 40 oz. bags--all for less than $28 and Free Shipping! Plus, since Amazon offers it as a subscription, I get an additional discount.

However, after eating it three times, I have strangely learned to love it and now I've been eating it for one month.<br /><br />So this was an acquired taste for me that I will definitely order again when I get tired of my steel cut oatmeal.

review/text: This is a good muesli. I am not going to repeat what others have said. It is an excellent product but<br />1. I wish it was organic<br />2. Too much flour - or powder taste - by the time I am at the end of the breakfast I feel I am eating flour-paste.<br />3. Wish it had more nuts.<br />4. SHOULD HAVE MORE FIBER - especially considering the ingredients.<br /><br />Other than that this truly is better than most of the cereals I have eaten.

review/summary: So filling that I lost weight without even trying!
review/text: I'd use this product even if I didn't one to lose weight because it is delicious. If the price gives you pause, I just want to note that each bag can last a long time. Add some of this to yogurt, let it sit a few minutes and you've got a filling snack or addition to a meal. If you prefer it hot, you can add it to milk or water and heat it on a stove or in a microwave. The taste is wonderful! A hidden feature was that my spouse and I were able to lose weight because we found this muesli satisfied our appetites and we didn't have to use much per serving. It does expand quite nicely when heated. When served cold, it takes extra time to let it sit with yogurt or cold milk or whatever base you use. If you have issues with constipation or irregularity it may well help you - it certainly decreased my spouse's irritable bowel issues. This is a staple in our household and is not overly sweet. If you prefer sweeter breakfast foods, you can add honey or another sweetener to taste but we have gotten used to this without additional sweeteners.

review/text: Bob's Red Mill Muesli has the perfect taste for a hot breakfast cereal and is awesome in cookie recipes.  It is not "fruity" smelling like so many others, but has just the right amount of naturally sweet date pieces in it.  Can be made in a couple of minutes in the microwave, although I still prefer to cook it the "old-fashioned" way on the stove.  A big bowl of this muesli will give you energy all morning long and you won't get a mid-morning craving.  Try it.

review/summary: 10 pounds of healthy breakfast
review/text: This is the real deal.  I douse it with unsweetened soy milk, and chew it up prior to my coffee so I'm only half awake at the time.  If at least one of my meals is healthy, and more than palatable, good deal.<br /><br />Forget the unsweetened claims, there's plenty of dried fruit.  But otherwise, as a low-fat, high fiber, burn-some-calories-chewing food, it does good.  I don't soak it long enough, so it is gnarly to chew up, especially when I need to eat fast to catch the bus - an adventure in the morning!<br /><br />Why does the label claim servings are an ounce?  That would make these 10 lbs last 160 breakfasts, I'm sure my serving is 4X bigger.<br /><br />If I want something tastier, however, I recommend the granola from Oat Cuisine of Alameda, CA - nicely brown, crunchy, and not too sweet, which can be ordered from their web page.

review/text: As a Type 2 diabetic, I have to be careful about food -- especially with what I eat for breakfast. This is REALLY good -- as good as any muesli I've ever tasted, both hot and cold.<br /><br />Dress it up with a little fresh fruit or nuts, and vary them, and you will have a breakfast you can enjoy every day, but still have a variety!<br /><br />Then, my wife had the inspiration to add some dried cherries (available from Amazon), some chocolate chips, and some chopped pecans and made some superb cookies from this. They had the texture of an oatmeal cookie, but were IMHO far superior to any oatmeal cookes I've tried. If you want the recipe, send me a comment, and I'll send it to you.<br /><br />The product is delivered in convenient bags that are well sealed and protective of the product.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

review/text: Each night before I go to bed, I put a cup of it in a pan, a cup of water, and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.  I sometimes add extra sunflower seeds and flax seed because I like the extra crunch and nutty flavor.  I let it soak until the morning to neutralize the enzyme inhibitors in the nuts and grains.  This takes all of the gastrointestinal distress out of eating it and releases the energy packed punch for my day.  I add a little more water and just bring it to a boil and it is cooked just right.  Love this with yoghurt and frozen blueberries stirred in.  Sometimes I take the bowl with me, stir in the yoghurt and blueberries and eat it for lunch at room temperature as one of my favorite lunches.  Good tasting, high energy food.  Great quality.  I've been buying this brand for years and have never been disappointed with the quality.

review/text: I used to be the type of person who never ate breakfast, but after buying this stuff I never miss a day.  I wake up at 4am every morning which does not give me a lot of time to eat.  I generally leave my house at 5am.  I put half a cup of muesli in a container with a half cup of milk and some honey and buy the time I get to work (an hour and a half commute) the muesli is a perfect consistency.

review/text: I'm not a big fan of oatmeal but I wanted to eat something healthy and eat something with omega-3 since I'm breastfeeding.  This muesli is surprisingly good! I even add extra flax seeds (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ED7M2W">Bob's Red Mill Organic Raw Whole Flaxseed Brown, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>) in it to increase the omega-3 level and it adds a delightful nutty flavor to it.

review/summary: A hearty muesli
review/text: I like it enough to have it on subscribe and save.  It goes well with yogurt.  I usually add some blueberries, dried cranberries, or other seasonal fruit.  This muesli is a bit heavy on the sesame seeds, so I usually mix it with some other cereal, such as granola or generic muesli.  This is nothing like the boxed swiss muesli's (Familia, etc.), which seem to be sweetened and ground into tiny pieces.  Nor is it similar to the super market variety, which are mostly processed flakes.  This muesli seems to be a good mix of grains, nuts/seeds, and a small amount of dried fruit.

review/summary: Extremely high quality cereal that is versatile and economical!
review/text: After continual disappointment with the varieties of granola and muesli available in our community I decided to give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDSES">Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 18-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> a shot.  My husband and I are extremely delighted with this mix and have quickly gone through the four 18oz bags that came in or initial order.  In fact, we just reordered it in the larger 40oz bags (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDS6Q">Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 40-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>) because the cost per ounce is a little less expensive.<br /><br />It can be a little boring to eat the same thing over and over again each morning so mix it up by having small Ziplock baggies of various raw nuts and dried fruit available to add as a topping.  In our house, walnuts and extra raisins are a big hit though we also enjoy adding fresh fruit or a dollop of preserves from time to time.<br /><br />In the weeks that we have been eating this Muesli, both my husband and I have been amazed with how much more efficiently our bodies are digesting and eliminating waste.  We not only feel better, but we are finding that we are looking better too.  While keeping the old adage of "all things in moderation", we only eat a third cup of this cereal each morning mixed in with a half cup of fat-free vanilla yogurt and find that we rather miss it if we opt for something else!

review/text: I really enjoy this muesli, so much that I have sent packages to my family members and friends. It's definitely more interesting that oatmeal, which was my previous breakfast staple, and after comparing nutritional information, I think this is the better way to go. I also made cookies with this, which turned out pretty well - I'll have to tinker with that recipe to get it perfect. I think buying it on Amazon.com is the best value, compared with grocery store prices.

review/text: During a recent trip to Ireland, I got to try Muesli.  I had no idea what it was when I first had it, but then when I got back to the states I was so disappointed that I couldn't find anything like what I had.  Then my friend said she found some in the grocery store, and it was this!  It is almost exactly the same, no added preservatives, sweeteners, or anything.  It's all natural deliciousness, and I found that buying it here saves about $10 over the supermarket.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: A good, but not a great muesli
review/text: For those used to great European mueslis, this product may be a mild disappointment. It has relatively high content of nuts, seeds and fruits (although can't name a percentage), which is good for flavor. It could hold its own in Europe and stay on the market in the middle of the pack, but it doesn't set itself apart.<br /><br />One thing that was a little disturbing esthetically was that the grain flakes (on the oats, I believe, in particular) are marked with crinkly crease lines that made it perfectly clear they had been through some serious industrial machinery, like a stamp of some kind to flatten them out. Maybe this is standard muesli production procedure worldwide, but I've eaten a lot of mueslis and haven't run across such a blatant industrial fingerprint before. It was kind of unsettling and takes away from the illusion that you're eating an "all-natural" product. But again, this is only esthetic. If you don't look at your muesli, you won't notice it.<br /><br />If you've had one of the truly great mueslis, like those made by Dorset Cereals of the UK, or even very strong second-tier mueslis by companies like Alnatura of Germany, this muesli will seem run-of-the-mill by comparison. I haven't had a better muesli in the US yet, however. I'm still looking. Until then, Bob's Red Mill is perfectly OK and gets the job done.<br /><br />At the Amazon price of under $28 (March 2009), this is a pretty good bargain too. So that should also count for something. Recommended.

review/text: Warning! Warning! you might want to comb through your muesli for rocks. I just crack a piece about the 3/4 by 1/2 cm size rock with my teeth.  I am disappointed and thought Bob's Red Mill would have a higher standard of quality than this other brand.  This might be an isolated case, but having that size of a rock escaping their quality control is unacceptable.  And thank god that the rock crack into two pieces and not my tooth.

review/summary: Healthy Natural Cereal
review/text: I hadn't tried any of Bob's items, but didn't hesitate much after I saw the rave reviews on this product. I read the ingredients, and they are all grains, nuts, and fruit- no sugar or anything else for that matter.<br />I ordered 4-40 oz. packs, which equals 10lbs, if I am adding correctly. If you have Prime, it comes to roughly $2.90 cents per lb... Pretty good deal. The UPS man was laughing because the box is "all there" and "definatley not a bill".<br />My brother (the workout man), was hesitent when he looked at the packages. He said "where are the clusters!?" I told him to "hold his durn horses, and just get the yogurt and grapes, and We'll try this on for size first."<br />The Taste - very grainy, and nutty. Semi crunchy, with good seeds and nuts, which are sliced almonds and walnuts. Slightly sweet flavor is also nice with the dates and raisins. *this is not a sugary treat, but rather power packed crunchy grain mc delicious pow"<br />Very Good with Greek yogurt, or milk.<br />We already are almost done with the first bag, I'm a fan.<br />Also, the cocker spaniel really likes this stuff.<br />-"Be grateful, be kind, be happy"-

review/text: Duff vs Wilton fondant<br /><br />1. Duff tastes a lot better than Wilton!<br /><br />2. If you cover your cake with the chocolate (brown) Duff fondant it smells like heavenly chocolate!<br /><br />3. Duff roll really thin - so the amount you buy is less in lbs, but you also use less (unless you're doing figurines).<br /><br />4. It's easier to fix a flaw with Duff than with Wilton.<br /><br />5. If it's a really hot day, it's harder to work with Duff - it get's really sticky, so keep your powdered sugar close (or just put the fondant in the fridge for a couple of minutes to cool & harden it)<br /><br />6. The Wilton white is whiter - the Duff white that is almost a cream color.<br /><br />7. The Blue Duff fondant is NOT the color indicated on the container. The container says it's a bright blue, but the actual fondant it a softer, ocean blue.<br /><br />After usuing Wilton rolled fondant for a really long time, I've switched to Duff. Mainly for the taste. Nobody wants to eat the Wilton fondant & I don't like the idea that the most expensive part of the cake gets thrown out.

review/text: I bought this from a local store near me and i bought white. I use butter cream fondant all the time but from wilton or other brands and i thought i would try out Duff's. The only real problem i had with it was that you couldn't paint on it with gel food coloring like i could with the other brands; you had to mix it in which didn't make the desired color i was looking for. A good thing is that it kept long without needing to be refrigerated, just pop in the microwave for like 10 seconds and its pretty easy to mold and flatten (well as easy as fondant can be). Another thing, they reccomend buying the wilton fondant roller if i were you i would buy the larger one even if it seems excessive because it makes for a more even roll.

review/summary: Great stuff, but takes a couple of days to be effective
review/text: We have active dogs and live in a rural location where they can chase ground-squirrels and rabbits through brushy areas. As this seems to be a particularly bad year for ticks, we decided to invest in this product as it had good reviews. At first I was concerned because for two days after application I was still finding ticks on the dogs. Then poof! No more ticks showed up on the dogs. I do not know how effective it is on fleas, as we had not noticed any fleas on our dogs prior to using the product. We applied it almost a month ago, and the dogs are still tick-free. We will definitely be purchasing more of this product.

review/summary: Amazing great taste!
review/text: I normally use the regular Spectrum shortening but decided to try the butter flavor. It was amazing. I used it to make vegan brown rice krispie treats and the kids, my husband and I all loved it. I did not notice any chemically smell or taste and I am very sensitive to off tastes and smells in my food. I am also an avid butter addict trying to cut back and I loved this product in everything from baked goods (banana nut bread) to sauteed vegetables. This is a great substitute when you are serving vegan friends but want to preserve the butter flavor in your foods

review/summary: Works great!
review/text: Not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about.  I use this butter flavored shortening in many recipes that call for butter or flavored shortening and it tastes great to my family, my son's classmates and other unknowing friends and family members.  :-) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LL7EHG">Spectrum Naturals All Vegetable, Butter Flavor (12/24 OZ)</a> The butter flavor is there but I didn't stick my finger in the container and taste it.  I used it and it tastes great when used in baking and cooking on the stove.  I like it A LOT BETTER than Crisco's shortening.  And since it's allergan free, my family can once again enjoy this convenience.  Try it out; you won't be sorry.  Thanks Spectrum for another great product! Now, if only Shoprite & Wegmans will start to carry this product.....
