review/summary: Sampler Cheesecake
review/text: It's absolutely delicious.  This is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten.  I highly recommend it.  So, what are you waiting for?  Order it!<br /><br />You can thaw out the slices the way I did if you like.  At 30% power, heat 4 slices in a regular microwave for about 55 seconds.  Don't cover them while you are doing this.  Plus, there are slips of paper between each slice, so you need not cut anything or worry about adhesions.

review/summary: Creamy & Delicious...but...
review/text: Cheesecake arrived within a week of ordering.  Packing was amazing, ice in the pack was still frozen, and so was the cheesecake. We let it thaw to room temperature.  It is delicious, creamy, crust is perfect...but for me personally, it is super-sweet.  Typical of my taste, I just don't like super sweet anything. So, if you have a love of cheesecake that really is 'New YorK' style and really love super-sweet, then this is perfect for you.  For those of us who love creamy cheesecake with a nice crust but are more reserved on the super-sweet, think twice.

review/summary: Update of previous review
review/text: This is a resubmittal of a previous review.  Originally, when I received my cheesecake I was very disappointed with the careless way it had been packaged and delivered - and I said so in my review.  I NOW say that if anybody ever says that Omaha Steakes doesn't care about their product feedback, do NOT believe it.  After submitting my original review, I was contacted by Mr. Sendgraff of Omaha Steaks who apologized for their poor packaging and inormed me that Omaha Steaks has a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all their products and, that he was refunding my entire purchase price, including shipping.  Even after I told him we had eaten the cheesecake, and it was really quite good, he insisted that my experience had not met their 100% satisfaction guarantee standards and my refund would stand.  I say, THANK YOU, Mr. Sendgraff, you are a credit to Omaha Steaks Customer Service and have restored my confidence completely.  I'm looking forward to my next purchase of an Omaha Steaks product.

review/summary: Healthy, hearty and tasty...and how to cook it.
review/text: This cereal really tastes good. I make it in the microwave, first heating the fresh cold water to boiling, then adding the cereal, stirring and returning it to the microwave to finish cooking. I let it boil and bubble for a bit in the microwave, which is when the cooking really occurs. I often let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after it stops, to set up. Years ago a ham radio guy asked me (over the air!) whether I knew how to make gourmet microwave hot cereal. I said no - wondering how you could make anything gourmet, especially cooked cereal, in the microwave - but that I didn't express out loud... so he explained to me the above method, with emphasis on heating the cold water before adding the cereal. And definitely not using hot tap water, as that has the O2 chased out of it, or some such. So I guess that must be it!<br /><br />I used to laboriously mix various cereal grains to achieve this kind of mix, but with this product it is all done for me. It's also good with raisins added.<br /><br />I'm delighted that Amazon is selling some of these healthy food items that are hard to find in parts of the country. The special offers bring the price within reason.

This with absolutely no excercise; just limiting myself re fat and calories. My total stayed high at 257, but the ratio improved from about 4.4 to 3.6 - - - My weight dropped by 3.3% - -  The cereal is good by itself, but I add real maple syrup and either raisins/craisins or chopped dates to make it a real treat either for bFast or a late night snack when I'd otherwise go for potato chips or the like...

review/text: This cereal is great.  I love multigrain cereals as they as so much tastier than just oatmeal. As I am too busy in the mornings at home, I ship it to my office to make at work in the microwave.  I just add hot water from the hot water on demand spot on the water cooler slowly stirring it in until it is about half cereal/half water and cook in the microwave for about 4 minutes.  I add dried blueberries and have with skim milk and a little Splenda.  Very easy and much healthier than eating bagels.  Thanks for offering a great product at a low price!

review/summary: Great Healthy Hot Cereal
review/text: I found this in the grocery store while looking for whole grain oatmeal. It was cheaper for the same amount of cereal, and is even more nutritious than oatmeal alone. The taste is great, I make mine on the stovetop with soy milk instead of water so it's nice and thick and creamy, then I add some brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. It's also good with a banana mashed into it, and as a special treat sometimes I mix chocolate syrup and peanut butter into it. I also like to let it soak for a few minutes before I start cooking which seems to help with the texture (it can be a little gritty). Overall a delicious hot cereal that I would choose over oatmeal any day.

review/summary: Best Breakfast Ever!
review/text: I had been having Hodgson Mill's oat bran (which is also a great cereal) when I noticed this also on the shelf at the grocery store. I know that flax is good for you so I thought I'd give it a try. I like it even better than the plain oat bran because of the nuttier flavor and texture. I will say that I don't fully cook it according to package directions -- 2 minutes in the microwave, let sit for a few minutes, and that is it. I add one square of dark chocolate after cooking, and let it melt. Then I stir gently and top with a bit of skim milk. Keeps me satisfied easily until lunch with no spikes or drops in energy levels. Happy to see it available on amazon.

review/text: This is a nutritious cereal that keeps me full all morning without blood sugar spikes.  The texture is neither too fibrous nor too mushy and it doesn't taste like the usual barnyard animal feed.  I make mine with milk instead of water then add anything that sounds good or that I have on hand just to keep it interesting.  One morning it may be blueberries, the next chopped apple.  Toss in some nuts for extra texture and protein.  Changing it up each day is what keeps it from becoming monotonous.  One reviewer mentioned adding peanut butter.  Never thought of that - it would probably be good with peanut butter, honey and bananas.  It's probably even good buttered and salted!

I simply sprinkle on or add to other foods to increase their nutritional value, much like you would use wheat germ.

Of course I eat reasonable lunch and dinners, swim at least three times a week, but the cereal starts me with a good day's nutrition.  I only add Olivio and pi-water salt to season the cereal.

review/summary: No Doubts Expressed by My 10-Month Old Twins - Although I Have Some Doubts
review/text: It's good to give your baby a naturally orange food if you expect nutrients that are normally present in orange foods.  Squash is one of the original flavor brands from the vegetable variety pack, the first case of Earth's Best I ever bought.  While sweet potato followed by carrot were their favorites, they liked squash right from the start.<br /><br />I think it was pretty innovative to mix squash with turkey (as opposed to chicken).  This combination worked well and they loved it from the first taste.  I sincerly don't think those of us parents had it so good at this tender age.  We might be handing the next generation for too much public debt, but at least we're starting them out with healthy and interesting foods.  But is this as healthy as it appears?<br /><br />I believe your baby will love this one if he/she is anywhere near mine in age and I would love to hear comments should others try this one out on their precious little baby.<br /><br />Ingredients listed on the label: Organic Butternut Squash, Water, Organic Ground Turkey, Organic Whole Grain Kamut Flour, Organic Whole Grain Quinoa Flour.<br /><br />This one was different in that water was not the first ingredient.  It is not runny, but all the flour surely absorbed the water anyway (note how much flour must have been used).<br /><br />One jar has 60 calories, 12% protein, 2% vitamin C, 6% calcium and 4% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/text: Before buying in bulk, it's best to pick up 2 jars to try each flavor and ensure LO loves it.<br /><br />Wish I'd bought more than one of this!  Lil girl ate it all for lunch & dinner and loved it.  It's definitly one of the thicker meals I've seen so far but I feel she enjoyed it more because of it and it does move her in the direction of solids rather than pureed.<br /><br />Great deal here with subscription service; costs $1 at Publix and $0.99 at BabiesR'Us

review/text: Other than the fact that this baby foot is very runny, it's fine.  It has a very bright color that is hard to get out if it hits fabric and it's smells okay.  I'm not thrilled by it, but it's not bad, either.  I would probably choose it occasionally for my baby's dinner.

review/summary: I Advise NOT to Order Even Though Product is Good.- Please See Comments
review/text: My twin 10-month old baby soldiers are learning to walk.  They're not quite there yet but making giant strides.  They eat a lot too.<br /><br />They loved the chicken tomato pastina right away and I'm tempted to add olives but can't find any without salt.<br /><br />I don't think you can go wrong with this one in terms of whether your babies will eat it.<br /><br />The ingredients per the label: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Ground Chicken, Organic Tomato Paste, Organic Whole Grain Couscous (from whole grain durum semolina), Organic Garbanzo Bean Flakes.<br /><br />The couscous absorbs the water and helps this dinner have one of the best consistencies of all the Earth Best varieties we've tried.<br /><br />It has 15% protein, 50% vitamin A, 15% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron; and 70 calories.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />Postscript: I was happy with the product itself but much of the time it arrived with broken jars. I got reimbursed for the broken jars, but I still had to clean the broken glass and food mess off of the good jars.  Please see the comment section.  I am not the only one that had this problem.

review/summary: Made in USA!!!
review/text: For me, the most important thing is that I know what my dog is eating. I will not buy any dog food/treat not made in the USA or Canada. This severely limits my options.  Thank goodness for smaller labels like Cloud Star.  I only wish that other pet food companies would take a hint and stop using Chinese ingredients and start making a better quality product (on a side note, Newman's own is a good organic brand that makes good treats).<br /><br />Anyway, my little buddy has pancreatitis, so he cant have high fat/low quality food.  I used to feed him those chicken jerky strips, but after the pet food recall I check all the labels and have not been able to find anything that isn't made in China or "irradiated for safety."<br /><br />These treats are %5 (min), which is pretty low.  Aside from knowing that these treats are made in the USA, as are all of the ingredients too, the best part about these treats is that they really are soft and chewy.  I can break one up into about 10 pieces super quickly and my dog thinks that he is now getting 10 treats instead of one.  Either way he adores these treats.  I'm glad I've found something that is well priced, quality, good for training, and made in the USA!<br /><br />Here are the ingredients (not bad considering this is a treat!)<br />Chicken, unbleached wheat flour, tapioca starch, maple syrup, glycerin, rice flour, wheat gluten, gelatin, natural flavor, sea salt, garlic powder, natural smoke flavor, phosphoric acid, sorbic acid, mixed tocopherols (natural preservative).

My dog will do anything for these treats, including breaking out of a fun playdate with pals with a single soft spoken word from me.  If I don't have the treats with me, she will ignore me for several minutes in the same scenario.  These treats are a must have in our life!

review/summary: Great Mid-Value Treat for Your Dog!
review/text: I've been feeding Soft and Chewy Buddy Biscuits to my three dogs for years. They're great because they break apart easily, so you can give them whole or break them down for training or to fit appropriately in interactive toys.<br /><br />Some dogs may not be thrilled about the lamb flavor as much as other Buddy Biscuit flavors (our three dogs seem to favor the Beef and Grilled Chicken), but I've never seen a happy dog turn them down.<br /><br />I note these as a "mid-value" treat because I've tried using these as a high value treat for a fearful dog, and they just didn't cut it. It's not surprising, as high value usually needs to be something like cheese or meat, but I did want to make the distinction.<br /><br />That doesn't mean they wouldn't be high value for your dog (every dog is different), but they do not work for us.<br /><br />They are not "mid-value" as in quality. They are high quality treats, with good ingredients, made in the United States. We currently buy every flavor we can on Amazon through Subscribe and Save, if that says anything about how we feel about them.

She looks forward to them every night. I only give them to her before bed as they are kind of expensive. She gets all excited when she sees me reach for the bag. She has been eating them for 2 yrs. now and has had no problems at all. My Niece, bought them for her for Christmas 2 yrs. ago and I just had to call her to find out where she got them. Emily has been eating and loving them ever since.

Our youngest Yorkie has a few food allergies and we have not had any problems with these.  We buy the 4 pack and they go a long way, worth the price and made in the USA, that is worth it all.

review/summary: Utterly delicious neat and born to be mixed.
review/text: For the record, I'm not a liqueur drinker. I'm a whiskey drinker who prefers single malt scotch and single barrel bourbon neat, never anywhere near ice and aired for 10 minutes before first sip after well sniffing in a small cylindrical glass. I was expecting to HATE Red Stag - but it seduced me because it puts the taste of bourbon first. It smells like bourbon with a hint of cherry pipe tobacco in the glass: notes of popcorn, molasses, tobacco, leather, and cherry. At first sip the first taste is bourbon: corn, honey, bacon, and molasses. The mid palate explodes with cherry and tobacco and leather. It's sweet, but it's oddly sophisticated. The finish is sweet with honey, cherry, and smoke.<br /><br />It's utterly delicious. I polished off my glass like a hungry wolf. The cherry is robust - but tastes real. It never obscures the bourbon which shines through with character, age, and American cowboy splendor like Johnny Cash's voice.<br /><br />I'm a whiskey snob, but this liqueur is the only whiskey adulteration I've ever loved. The cherry bourbon alchemy is killer mixed with coke. It's even better in a modified Manhattan. I suspect it will work in any mixed drink where bourbon plays a part and you'd consider putting in a cherry.

review/summary: OK, but no Trader Joe's
review/text: I've been eating Trader Joe's Organic Oatmeal with Flax every morning for over a year now. I add one banana and it provides just the right amount of sweetness - no extra sweetener needed. Trader Joe's cereal is popular and sometimes sells out, so I wanted something for those times when I didn't have any more at home. Arrowhead Mills Organic Oatmeal with Flax sounded a lot like Trader Joe's; even the nutritional values were very similar, so I figured I would give it a shot. Well, it's OK, but lacking a certain natural flavor that Trader Joe's has. Even adding a sweet banana didn't help and I had to put in additional sweetener, which I'm trying to avoid. To tell the truth, even adding the sweetener didn't help that much. It didn't satisfy and only left me craving Trader Joe's. Now when I'm at Trader Joe's and my cereal is in stock, I make sure I buy some - even if I don't need it. I don't want to run out. Sorry, Arrowhead Mills; close, but no Trader Joe's!

review/summary: Mint Surprise
review/text: I'm a fan of delicious tea, and this seemed to have everything I want in a brew. Green tea? Check. Delicious fruit flavors of peach and mango? Check. On Amazon? Consider me sold!<br /><br />However, I must have missed that single line of the description that says "contains peppermint leaves" because I sure was surprised when my delicious fruit tea came out tasting like a candy cane (and a bad one at that). The mint overpowers every other flavor, but the addition of fruit undercuts the peppermint, so it's not really a mint tea OR a fruit tea. It's mostly just a "bleh".<br /><br />So awful I couldn't even give it away. Most people just smelled it and went "no thanks"...can't say I blame them!<br /><br />That said, Tea Forte has some good teas. This just isn't one of them.

review/summary: You have to know the product to get it right!
review/text: I'm writing this review to provide other interested customers with a more realistic expectation than the other review listed with this product does... The first time I've tried the Tea Forte Green Mango Peach tea was via one of their silken infusers. I LOVED the flavor of it, I didn't even notice at that point that there was any mint included with it. When I received the loose leaf tea I ran into the same issue the other buyer did: The tea had a strong mint flavor overpowering almost all other flavors in this tea. I went ahead and used much less tea leafs (I have one of their 12oz Kati tumblers and used just 1 tsp of tea leafs with that)and only left the leafs in the hot water for a minute or two. With that I was able to get the desired flavor. I can see how someone, that hasn't used the silken infuser and therefore has no idea what this tea is supposed to taste like, would be disappointed with this product. If you use the method of brewing I've described you barely taste any mint flavor and the mango and peach flavors come out as intended/desired.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher pareve. Very mild. Was interested to try this chili because I especially like barley in soups. The light chili use, mild tomato, barley, and great northern beans make this chili a more white-style chili, as opposed to some chilis that are reddish from lots of chili powder or darker browns from kidney beans. Easy on the tummy. The partially pearled barley is somewhat chewy. Made without texturized vegetable protein (soy) and with maitake mushrooms. I like chili with penne or other shaped pastas, over organic rice, or alone with pitas or any kind of toast. Very mild mushroom flavor note. Hint of spiciness. Great choice for those who prefer a soy-free choice with mushrooms. Great combination of organic ingredients. Also can be used as a base for your own chili by adding more diced fresh veggies, tomato, chilis to taste, and spices. Add water with the added ingredients and simmer to your desired consistency. Made with organic great northern beans, organic barley, organic tomato puree, organic brown rice flour, maitake mushrooms, organic onions, organic chili peppers, sea salt, organic red bell peppers, and organic spices. Labeled vegetarian on the bisphenol-free can, but is also vegan. 400 calories, 18g protein, 2g fat per can. Happiness arises from supporting what one finds to be good.

review/summary: GOOD COFFEE -- BUT IS IT BETTER COFFEE?
review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: THIS IS EXPENSIVE COFFEE -- BUT IS IT WORTH THE EXTRA COST?<br /><br />Millstone considers this particular variety to be a medium roast variety, but I found it to be somewhat on the lighter side. I think I prefer 'Yuban Columbian' due to each heavier yet not bitter taste, but this 'Millstone' coffee could easily be gotten use to.<br /><br />AFTER TRYING IT SEVERAL TIMES:<br /><br />Upon trying this coffee several times I have concluded that it is necessary to make it with less water than is suggested if you are looking for a more full bodied brew. If you like the lightness of it as is, then this will be a good though expensive choice.<br /><br />THIS IS HOW THIS BLEND IS DESCRIBED AT THE MILLSTONE WEBSITE:<br />"Hand-picked from Colombia's mountain ranges, this classic coffee is distinguished by its full body, rich flavor, and medium-high acidity. It's perfect for drinking any time of day."<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: MY CHOICE WOULD BE 'FAIR-TRADE - CERTIFIED ORGANIC'<br /><br />Millstone does in fact offer a wide variety of 'Fair-Trade-Certifed Organic' products. If I were to try Millstone again, I would look specifically for 'Fair-Trade Certified Organic' blends where I feel the extra cost may be more justifiable.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

I was a bit panicked about giving up my coffee habit but found the Teeccino herbal coffee (chocolate mint is my favorite) to be a great alternative.  I haven't given up the caffeine completely but I have reduced it by more than half and I'm sleeping a lot better.  The other good news is that I lost over 50 pounds cutting down on the cafeeine and eating clean so  I am now at a healthy weight.

review/text: Chocolate and mint? Nothing better. I really like this drink! It is fine tasting plain but I really enjoy it with a little sugar and half/half. I like this better than coffee. Of course, I don't like coffee unless it has sugar and cream so maybe that is just me! But I definitely recommend this teeccino. It is the only one I buy because it is so good!

review/summary: Love this flavor!
review/text: This is an awesome alternative to coffee. I LOVE coffee, but have currently cut it out of my diet. This, however, is a nice replacement in the morning. The chocolate mint is my favorite thus far, and tastes great. The mint is not over-powering which I was afraid it might be. I like that this product has a bold, rich flavor which helps it replace coffee and not seem like a watery alternative.

review/summary: My favorite coffee substitute yet
review/text: I've tried the roasted orzo thing and all sorts of decaf coffees in my quest to eliminate caffiene from my life, and this chocolate mint herbal coffee is by far the most amazing thing I've tasted.  Its super smooth, no off tastes or aftertaste (except mild minty smoothness), and tastes so similar to coffee that I dont have to keep choking down the other subsititutes (I dont know what I'm going to do with the other 4lbs of roasted italian orzo I have).  After all the failures, I never thought I would actually find something that I could replace real coffee with, but by gosh I found it.  And just to make sure it tastes like coffee I gave my girlfriend a sip (she dislikes coffee) and she said that if it wasnt for that overwhelming coffee flavor, she loves the mint with a hint of chocolate... success!  I'm definately gonna try this out on some of my other hard core coffee drinking friends and family and see what they think.

review/summary: Signals Whiffle Ball Games Are Over and Dinner Begins
review/text: My name never carried well across the neighborhood to the yard where I most often struck out at the plate. Sound, as is the case with many a young boy, was only one way to call me.<br /><br />Misty evenings, just as the sun committed to drop westward, an hour after my father would drive up in his Buick Special, I smelled Worcestershire sauce from our charcoal Webber. This meant the Whiffle ball game ended, and, win or lose, I had a different plate to step up to.<br /><br />The scent created a state of emergency. Bats, balls, and, if we used any, bases were gathered by their respective owners, and we all ran home like lovers impassioned in lustful want.<br /><br />His recipe for steak was simple. Get it from Jerry, a butcher he knew for years, dazzle it with ground pepper and the smallest sprinkle of Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce. Like smoke signals, the air became the messenger, or, for me, a siren seducing me homeward. No other sauce would do. His reasons had no merit for me at six years old, but I never had cause to question.<br /><br />Such as it will be for you. Big bottles of Worcestershire sauce will be what you need, but a small bottle will be inspiration enough.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: I grew up on pastina and eggs.  I'd been looking for a whole wheat version, because my young son loves pastina as well.  This one is really good - it has a taste almost the same as regular pastina (acini de pepe), and it is organic.  The noodles are a bit smaller than regular pastina, and cook a little darker.  I used a mesh strainer as a regular strainer won't work. Too bad you have to order such a large quantity.  But we'll be eating it a lot this year!

review/text: I just got mine set up at the office today and I love it.  I am already getting compliments on it.<br /><br />I should note however that there is one very tiny issue with it - however it isn't enough to make me take any stars away from it on this review... and that is the curved brick pieces are about a 50 degree angle.  The issue is that in order to make most designs you want to put two together in order to make a nice and neat 90 degree angle, however you cannot do that with these pieces.  Like I said, it is a very tiny fault with the product, otherwise I love it.  They supply just enough soil and gravel, I had 5-6 brick pieces left over and I only used maybe half of the grass seed.  All-in-all I am very happy with the product.

You can't keep airating the soil because that would kill any grass growing.<br /><br />Feel ripped off.

The local Walmart, Target, Publix and Albertons bags are of the 9.7 ounce variety, not this huge gigantic bag.  So this is in essence, two of those bags for this price.  Pretty even I would think.<br /><br />I love this stuff and it for all things that need sweetening.  I put it in coffee, a little in my high fiber cereal, sometimes in high protein smoothies, sometimes to sweeten my green tea, and just about anything else I can make that needs extra sweetness.<br /><br />I don't bake yet so would think I need the bake friendly version.  ;)

review/summary: Versatile sweetener
review/text: Splenda, which is a brand name for sucralose, started out in powder form in packets to compete with other sweeteners such as aspartame and saccharine, primarily to be added to drinks. The granulated form extends sucralose's uses to encompass all those in which sugar can be used. I have baked with it a couple of times, with good results; and it is especially convenient that it is formulated to substitute for sugar cup for cup, teaspoon for teaspoon. This obviously means that you prefer sugar in a sugar bowl rather than packets, you can use this just as you would regular sugar.<br /><br />The sucralose molecule is rather similar to that of actual sugar, which may account for the similarity of taste; but unlike sugar it contains virtually zero calories (note that "zero calories" does not mean "no calories," but rather an amount less than 1 calorie per serving. It's not enough to worry about, and most diabetics can consume it safely in reasonable quantities.<br /><br />Sucralose is my favorite artificial sweetener, but it still falls a little short of the taste of real sugar. The only way I know to describe the difference is to say that it tastes a bit lightweight. I use it to sweeten iced tea and find that a small amount of honey adds substance to the sweetness. This product is a boon to calorie watchers and, in this form, to cooks as well. I would be remiss not to note, however, that at least one grocery chain sells its own version of granulated sucralose, which I have found indistinguishable from the Splenda product except for having a lower pricetag.

review/summary: 2200 Calories of Tasty Zero Calorie Artificial Sweetener
review/text: 2200 Calories of Tasty Zero Calorie Artificial Sweetener<br /><br />Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated.<br /><br />I like the taste, after taste and texture of this product.  I love sweets, but I am working on losing weight.  I exercise every day, but that is not enough.  I had been adding a lot of granulated Splenda (and the granulated generic sucralose sweetener) to my diet drinks, fruit, juice and almost everything. It says zero calories, so a big time sugar junkie like me should be able to eat just as much or more than the amount of sugar that I would have eaten and still lose weight.  But it was no calories, so I used even more.  Suddenly my whole world was sweet.<br /><br />But I was gaining weight and it didn't add up.  So I looked at the bag and written on there was that the product was a source of minimal calories.  I looked up sucralose and went to the Splenda web site.  There it explained that legally, if a serving has less than 5 calories then they are entitled to call it zero calories.  But the vendor decides how much is in a serving.  If you make the serving size small enough, any food can be labeled zero calorie (that's an industry serving regulation if I ever heard of one).  Splenda says the serving size is 1 teaspoon and as long as it has less than 5 calories they can call it zero calories.  Sucralose by itself really does have nearly zero calories in any amount I would use.  But I was still gaining weight<br /><br />So I looked at that bag again.  The numbers just were not adding up.  What else is in there; it sure isn't pure sucralose or there would be a lot less product in the bag.  Well, the filler is malto dextrin.  This is a safe well known sugar that has been in food products for decades.  It has calories, but not as much as table sugar.  It's about 1/8 of the calories of regular table sugar.  That is a significant reduction.  But it is not zero.  If you are using it for baking, you use a whole lot more than one teaspoon.  The bag really ought to have the calories per cup, for those who wish to use the product for sugar replacement in baking and cooking.<br /><br />I was using so much Splenda that I was adding an extra 500 calories a day.  This 1.2 pound bag has about 2200 calories.  I've switch over to pure liquid sucralose.  It's not the same and my body missed the real sugar in the mix, but I'm getting used to it.

review/text: I am a diabetic, and have been using this product for a couple of years.<br /><br />I substitute it for sugar in any recipe.<br /><br />The subcription price is equal to that of Costco's, but with Amazon's free shipping, why use Costco?

review/summary: Love my Splenda many-calorie sweetener (but hate the deception)
review/text: Splenda is a great sugar alternative...but it's not zero calorie. Surprised? Turns out they get to call it zero calorie because they set the serving size at 0.5 grams, which is under one calorie...so they get to round down by usda rules. Doh! By weight, Splenda has only about 10% less calories than granulated sugar...but then, that's by weight. Splenda is so light that it's improbable one would stuff as much in their baking as they would of sugar. By volume (cup for cup), Splenda is approximately 25% the calories of sugar. I really hate the dishonesty the manufacturers use in their advertising...they've conned most people into thinking they're eating something without calories when they're not. So if you buy this, maybe write an email to the makers to complain, then realize you're making something that has fewer, but by no means zero, calories.

review/summary: Splenda is Splendid
review/text: Reviewing a grocery item may seem a bit odd, but having this item on an auto-buy thru Amazon guarantees that we will not run low on our household sweetener, and will never need to put it on the grocery list or look for it "on-sale" !  Auto refilling our pantry at the best price available is a no-brainer.  The product speaks for itself, and a word of caution to those buying Equal, or Aspartame.  New research should make you think long and hard about doing so - look it up online and you will see.<br />Thank you Amazon for offering Splenda at this price and for offering Auto-ship too !!

review/summary: Great Price
review/text: I love Splenda in my iced coffee and occasionally on plain Cheerios.  The package I received from Amazon was well within the expiration date, arrived on time, and was the same granulated Splenda I have come to love.  It lasts me a very long time.  The bag is huge!

review/summary: Great substitute sweetener!
review/text: I love using Splenda for sweetening lemon and lime water--it melts pretty good in cold liquids and even better in hot liquids.  Haven't used it much in baking yet.

review/summary: Splenda, splenda everywhere . ..
review/text: With Prime, Ship and Save and the size of the bag, the cost can't be beat in NYC.  We also love that it comes right to our door.  It would be great if Amazon could find a more environmentally friendly way to ship it, however.

review/summary: This is a double sized Splenda bag
review/text: We bought this on sale from Amazon for under $10 to see if it was similar to the type we usually purchase at our local supermarket. This is the same Splenda, but is in a double sized bag. When comparing this to the Splenda at most supermarkets, compare the number of ounces. This bag was twice the size.<br /><br />It arrived on time, and we may purchase this from Amazon again. Considering the size, it is comparable when shipped by Amazon prime to the cost of our local stores.
