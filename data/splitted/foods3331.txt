review/summary: Lindt 85% from Amazon came in the original formula
review/text: I ordered a 12-pack of the Lindt 85% cacao chocolate bars from Amazon in January... They are my favorite variety.... the 90% is too bitter for me, while the 70% has too much sugar. But the 85% is just right...and perfect for slowly melting in your mouth... And supposedly good for you health too, if taken in moderation.<br /><br />But despite some of the comments above, the box I received had the same (good) formulation for the 85% bars that I've seen in the past -- 5g of protein and 5g of sugar per serving size (four squares), along with 15g of carbohydrates (5%).<br /><br />I find I'm really satisfied by eating just two squares after lunch... And taking each square, and snapping it into four smaller pieces, thus eight small pieces in total... Letting each piece slowly melt in my mouth tastes great and is very satisfying as well.

review/summary: Love the chocolate,  but not the price
review/text: This chocolate is heavenly! It is dark and creamy and melts in your mouth. It leaves a pleasant taste you mouth when it is gone.  My only problem is stopping at just one square.<br /><br />It has an exquisite taste!<br /><br />Amazon is always my first shopping stop - usually the price and convenience of buying on line cannot be beat.  However, in the last year the price on these bars went way up.  I use a nice tool that allows me to see a history of product price for the past year, you can find it by searching for price history alert and selecting the one that has the word camel in its name.  I find it very useful.<br /><br />On the positive price in terms of price, I discovered that Lindt Stores sometimes have a shelve with 'seconds' which means the mixture of ingredients is a bit off but you cannot detect the difference in the taste unless you are a professional taster. I could not. These seconds go for 10 bars for $15. Can't beat that for a totally amazing chocolate.

review/text: Eat a total half square a day for a chocolate fix (1/8 the quoted "serving").<br /><br />As you get used to it (it's bitter compared to what you might be used to) you can eat more at a time, but that only raises the daily price without increasing satisfaction, and adding a few more calories.<br /><br />The bar costs about the same at Kroger grocery.<br /><br />UPDATE: bars arrive pre-broken some of the time, not that it matters.  You're going to break them anyway.  They're well packed so it's not obvious how UPS manages to do this.

review/summary: Bitter After Taste
review/text: I'm a newbie to the world of high cocoa chocolate bars. I got one of these at my local grocery for $2, amazed they'd carry such a high end product, it's a very small store. My only previous purchase was a box of Chocolove 77% bars from Amazon. I've consumed one of a dozen bars.<br /><br />In comparing the two products, the only significant difference is the noticeable aftertaste of the Lindt bar which was not present with the Chocolove product. I'm talking several hours later after I'd brushed my teeth and gone to bed, still an aftertaste.<br /><br />Otherwise, both were very smooth with a rich chocolate taste. I chased the Lindt bar with a couple of dark Hershey kisses, amazing how sweet a Hershey kiss is after eating some high cocoa chocolate.<br /><br />Two other observations:<br />1- A 3.5 ounce bar is huge. One bar is good for at least three servings for me. YMMV.<br />2- The Lindt bar had a sealed foil wrapper, whereas the Chocolove bar had a folded paper and foil cover with no real seal.

review/summary: Delicious Dark Chocolate
review/text: If you're looking for some dark chocolate, you may want to try Lindt.  It's smooth, silky and tasty.  Now that nutritionists recommend an ounce of dark chocolate with 60-70% or above cocoa a day, chocolate doesn't have to be a guilty pleasure. It's a non-guilty pleasure.  After all, chocolate is a vegetable, as a friend pointed out.  Chocolate is a bean.<br /><br />It's great for an after dinner treat and I find I can eat a piece or two of this bar without wanting the whole bar at once.  It's wonderful flavor and smooth texture.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: I didn't love this chocolate.  I bought it to try as an alternative to Endangered Species 88% Extreme Dark because it contains a teeny bit of soy and I'm trying to avoid all soy.  Compared to the latter, you can definitely taste the cocoa powder in this bar... tastes like hot cocoa in the back of my throat; not a bad thing necessarily just not a true and rich/ bitter dark chocolate.  Probably more pleasing to the American palate, but I think I'll risk the 2% soy for the delicious taste of Endangered Species and cross my fingers that they'll eventually find an equally delicious formula sans soy!

review/summary: Great Bar, expensive on-line
review/text: This is my favorite chocolate bar! Looking at the particulars, it's sugar content is much lower then most other makers. On a sugar restricted diet, this is MUCH better then regular chocolate, (sometimes 22-30gm sugar vs 85% with 6-7 grams). The choice to me is do you want a bar of sugar with chocolate flavor or the rich taste of cocoa? It is an acquired taste, but easily so. I now find regular chocolate is too sweet and tastes of sugar, The only drawback is that it is more expensive here on Amazon, I get it locally at about $2.20 a bar. So shop!

review/text: If you're used to super milky, super sugary US style chocolate and have no previous experience with dark chocolate please buy a single bar of this from somewhere and try it.<br /><br />If you enjoy espresso coffee and red wine this will be right up your alley. The delicious bittersweet taste is divine. The chocolate is not over sweetened but does have a very slight vanilla(?) taste.<br /><br />If you're new to dark chocolate try starting with a 60% dark and work your way to perfection.

review/summary: Healthiest Chocolate that's Good Tasting
review/text: There is not enough sugar for most people to consider this the best tasting chocolate ever, but for a serious chocolate lover, this is the best there is.  The ratio of protein to sugar in this is the highest of any chocolate I've seen that is not 100% cocoa. The amount of protein in it lets you know how much real cocoa is in it.  My rule is to never eat anything that contains more sugar than protein, and this very nearly passes the test.  No other chocolate I've found even comes close.  It usually tastes better if you eat it a few months before the expiration date.

review/summary: Authentic Dark Chocolate for True Dark Lovers...
review/text: Before you buy this item in a pack of 12 bars, make sure you buy one from CVS and try it first. This is truly an excellent chocolate of choice for people like myself who love their chocolate as dark as possible. I have always associated chocolate with M&Ms and Hersheys bars until I tried this variety. The richness is not comparable to anything you have ever tried. Lindt 85% is not particularly bitter, and comes with a hint of natural vanilla. It really gives me that fix when I need it.<br /><br />Some reviewer has noted the bitter after taste which does not wash off. That is true. Therefore, you must have previous dark chocolate experience before you make this purchase. It's not for everyone; just like coffee or liquor is not for everyone either.

review/summary: Pleased to have chocolate again
review/text: I have always loved chocolate, very milky chocolate. Then I was diagnosed with a cow dairy allergy and thought I had to give up chocolate all together because I could never eat dark chocolate even with a very low percentage of cocoa, like the sugary dark chocolates. I was bold enough to try the 90% as my first dark chocolate bar and while it was way too bitter at first, it only took three squares before I was hooked. I loved the snap while also letting the square melt in my mouth. I started eating half a bar each day for a few weeks until I slowed myself down and had to switch to this 85% but it is still great. I also use it in baking cookies and it works really well. I usually order from whatever seller amazon lists on the product page, but wanted to comment on the direct shipment from amazon. I ordered these bars during 90 degree weather in southern CA and was worried they would arrive melted (couldn't resist, I needed my chocolate fix), but amazon shipped them with two ice packs surrounded by styrofoam at no additional charge. The packs were obviously melted by the time they arrived, but the chocolate was perfectly fine. Thank you amazon :).

review/text: Cheaper and with greater cacao content than the other product I've been buying, I'm now a Lindt customer.  There is a big difference in flavor but that's due to the 85% cacao content so I'll have to forego my American sweet tooth and develop more of a sophisticated taste; if the Europeans can do it so can I!  Join me, fight higher prices and become sophisticated at the same time, it's not hard.  Beside, this stuff is good for your heart.

review/text: I think it's great you can buy a pack for a little less than going to the store each time you want a new bar of dark chocolate, especially when you eat it nearly every day.  It not too sugary like other chocolates because of the high cocoa content, which is the way I like it.<br />I'm changing my review because they no longer use demerara sugar - they responded to my question that their sugar can be from sugar beets, which are genetically engineered. So I have started buying Equal Exchange chocolate from the Tropical Traditions site.  It's more expensive, but oh so good, and the chocolate is properly fermented.  I'm talking about the 80% Extra Dark chocolate.

review/summary: Still melts in your mouth
review/text: I've recently "discovered" these gourmet dark chocolates and am enjoying trying out different brands.  At this concentration of cocoa, most of the chocolates become very similar.  However I will say the Lindt 85% is smoother than other brands (Endangered Species 88%).  Whereas the Endangered Species 88% is harder and less solvent in your mouth, this chocolate will melt in your mouth - allowing you to enjoy the flavor more.<br /><br />At roughly 75 cent/ounce this is not cheap chocolate, so you'll want to savor and enjoy it.  Letting it sit in your mouth and melt is a much better experience than chewing it to bits and swallowing it.  It doesn't' radiate flavor quite like milk chocolate does, so you have to work the chocolate a little bit to get full flavor.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that this chocolate (as is typical) is very high in saturated fat.  This is very typical for this percentage cocoa though - where the higher the cocoa, the more fat a chocolate has in it.  One square (this bar is comprised of 10 squares) has about the amount of saturated fat as a cup of 2% milk.  This treat is best enjoyed in limited quantities after a nice meal.  You definitely would not want to scarf the entire thing down at once.

My wife and I love the coffee and it's flavor. It has a bold flavor with a smooth finish. No bitterness or bite at the end. I just finished the first of 4 bags I have. It has lasted a long time and I look forward to each and every cup.

review/text: This is a fantastic deal on a fantastic product, the third bonus is that it's shipped to you door!  No schlepping these heavy containers into the car, out of the car, etc.  The boxes are safer, from what I understand, than cans that can leach harmful toxins into our food.  Can't beat this deal even with coupons at the store.  We make soups all year round, and appreciate the automatic shipping!  Yum!

review/summary: No complaints here.
review/text: The chicken broth is fine and I am assuming if you are about to purchase 3 gallons of Swanson Chicken Broth, then you are okay with the flavor. I sure there are better fancy broths out there, but they also cost more. This one here is a great deal, although you can catch broth on sale at your local grocery store as well.<br />As far as purchasing mine on Amazon, the shipping was great. They bubble wrapped the whole inside so no damage occurred to the products.<br />Realize also that I would recommend opening a chicken broth you didn't intend on using in a week or two. If you don't think you can routinely use 48oz of chicken broth in that time frame, I would recommend buying a smaller size.<br />I give the product five stars because it work great for me, tastes great, and was at a great price.

review/summary: Very good -- but packaging/shipping/pricing needs to be improved
review/text: I ordered these kosher bagels twice in the past month.  The first time they came within 2 days or so, and they still had that fresh bagel aroma.  They are not quite as chewy or big as the ones my Bubbe used to get in Queens, but still good.  The second time, there was a delay of about 2 days before shipping, plus 2-3 days to get to us in Tennessee.  Although they weren't stale, the flavor naturally wasn't quite as good. The bakery, Davidovich of New York, included a 7th bagel for free.  (Maybe as compensation? Anyway, thank you!)  Their enclosed card marks a location on a map in midtown Manhattan, but the package was shipped from Woodside, Queens.<br />The bagels are good enough that I may try them again.  It would be nice if they would offer some varieties other than Plain.  How about Poppy Seed, Onion, Egg, Sesame, or "Everything"?<br />Also, I urge the seller to provide better packaging for shipment around the country, perhaps a vacuum seal, since the shipping method is UPS Ground.<br />FLASH (11/5/09): The seller has now more than doubled the price of the 6 bagels, from $4.50 to $9.50, PLUS it's still $5.49 shipping -- way too expensive, in my opinion!  Maybe they intended to provide FREE shipping, which would be a $.50 reduction vs. the previous total?

review/summary: Better than just another cracker
review/text: On a trip to the grocery store a few weeks ago I picked up a bag of these Pretzel Crisps in the original flavor to try out, while my mother grabbed a bag in the garlic parmesan flavor. A few days later we each brought our new pretzels to one of my daughters softball games to snack on. As I ate mine, my mother insisted I try hers. Oh wow are these garlic parmesan ones good! It's not even a flavor I would normally have thought I would like, as I tend to like simpler flavors. But these are just so good, even a picky eater like myself love them. So on my next trip to the store I picked up 3 bags for myself and I'm snacking on them now.<br /><br />If you can envision a pretzel that has been rolled out flat with a rolling pin, that's what these are like. You get more of the crispy outside and much less of the white flour center you usually have with pretzels. Because they have a flat design, they even work as crackers. So you can top them with cheese, meats etc and use them with dips, just like you would a cracker, only they taste even better. They are very crispy, but don't crumble or fall apart when trying to eat them. The bags are resealable, and the seal works extremely well. The best part is since they have so much flavor, you can eat just a few and it feels like you've eaten a lot more. Lots of flavor is a smaller package.<br /><br />The nutritional info is:<br />Serving size: 10 crackers/pretzels<br />Fat: 1.5g per serving<br />Calories: 110 per serving<br />Carbs: 22g per serving<br />Sodium: 410mg per serving<br />And there is a warning that these are made in a facility that processes milk and soy, for those with allergies to them.

Flavors were pretty traditional: semi-sweet raspberry truffle, milk chocolate caramel, peanut butter shell, "Aspen" creme (very buttery) and so on.  My assortment came in a brown box with a yellow ribbon and contained a photo guide to the contents.  A definite treat!

review/summary: A lot of green for your money
review/text: I ordered 100 stalks from Betterdecor on June 15, 2012 and they arrived three days later on June 18 by way of the U.S. Post office.  They are bundled in packs of ten each, wrapped in damp paper towels with the roots in water crystals, all of which were enclosed in a sturdy plastic bag.  Foam peanuts protect the plants. So, the stalks (or stems) came fast, with healthy green leaves and healthy red roots.<br /><br />What you see on the internet is  what you get in your package.<br /><br />However, instead of receiving 100 stalks, I actually received 106 stalks, six more than what I expected.<br /><br />In addition, instead of being about 4 inches, the stalks measured at about 5 inches tall, so this, too, is much better than I expected.<br /><br />If you measure the stalks with the green leaves, they are about 8 to 8 1/2 inches tall.<br /><br />The item price ($27) and shipping cost ($2.50) are well-priced, so this is an excellent product at an extremely affordable price.  You pay much more if you go to a store.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />Here are brief directions which include information edited from the product description.<br /><br />1. Give bright or medium light. Avoid direct sunlight or leaves will turn yellow.<br /><br />2. Keep the roots below water.  Tap water is fine.  Before watering, you may let the tap water sit for a day for the chlorine to evaporate.  If the water is heavy on fluoride, you may also use filtered or distilled water.  To keep the water clean, change the water once a week or once a month.<br /><br />An excellent source of water is fish tank water (from a fresh water tank). I've been using water from the fish tank and the plants look green and healthy.<br /><br />3. Regular indoor room temperature is fine.  Keep the minimum temperature above 50�F.<br /><br />One may grow Lucky Bamboos in just plain water, with rocks or stones to hold them in place or you may plant them in regular potting soil.  I actually prefer putting them in soil.  For me, it seems they do better in soil.  Water regularly if you plant them in soil because the plant dries up if you forget to water.

review/summary: Snikiddy Southwest Cheddar Cheese Fries
review/text: This review is for the Southwest Cheddar cheese fries by Snikiddy.  I've tried the regular Cheddar cheese ones as well, but that's a separate review.  I do have to say, the Southwest is much better than the regular flavor.<br /><br />Snikiddy is an all natural brand.  They use better, pronounceable ingredients.  Although there still is corn content.  They claim they are gluten free, vegetarian, no msg and even kosher.  This particular flavor has ramped up spices in its flavoring mix.  It even has white pepper, which is unusual for a snack food.  But good!  There's jalapeno powder too.  So you can definitely tell they took the Southwest aspect of this snack seriously.<br /><br />I really liked the taste of this snack. Unlike the regular cheddar, it had a tastier cheese flavor.  But wow, was it ever spicy.  My nose started running while I ate it because it was so spicy.  But even with the spicy, you could still taste the cheese.  The texture was still a little chewy while eating after the initial crunchiness, but with a better flavor it wasn't as bad.  The spiciness is a little much at times, but definitely worth it for the flavor.<br /><br />I really did enjoy this particular flavor of Snikiddy fries.  And considering there are limited flavors of Snikiddy snacks in my area I'm glad I liked at least one of the flavors.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I felt deeply motivated to say that I have to disagree with the reviewer who said these smell like old ketchup. I just didn't get that at all. To me, they smell like what they are. Disclaimer: I can't say I even know what old ketchup smells like. I'm kidding, but I do disagree and if I had read that review before trying, I may not have tried them.<br /><br />Anywho, found these at a local grocery store first. Took a chance on them and we were very surprised about how good they are, so I came here to buy them in bulk (quite a bit cheaper). They taste fresh and they don't leave me with a heavy feeling like the "andy capps" (or however you spell that) hot fries do. Super good snack and quite a bit heather than the others for sure. Every one we've shared them with ends up eating a bunch.

review/text: I use this in addition to my morning smoothie.  Aside from the green color, I really do no notice too much of a change.  With that being said, I use a lot fruits, veggies and some peanut butter in my smoothies so every flavor does get masked.  A great way to get your fiber and protein.  As with any high fiber foods you will notice some intestinal digestion changes.

review/summary: Great
review/text: I love buying dogfood on Amazon.  You are able to buy quality food, normally at a discounted price, and the shipping is free if it's fulfilled by Amazon.  It's a no brainer!  Why go to the store and lug a 30 lb bag of dogfood around when you get get it shipped to your house 2 day mail for free.<br /><br />So, if you're skeptical of buying dogfood on Amazon- don't be! I've been doing it for at least a year or two.<br /><br />Now, for this food specifically: It's high quality and my dogs like it.  I also noticed that when I purchased Wellness my dog had the WORST gas ever.  THis does NOT give my dog bad gas.  I do notice that the dogs eyes are a little gunky (which I heard can be attributed to their food) but not more gunky then when I was giving them the Costco Nature's Domain Salmon and sweet potato. (Also, a good deal but you can only buy at Costco)Their coats feel nice... and they have normal bowel movements.<br /><br />Overall, good deal and i recommend.

review/summary: Carafe explodes
review/text: There is some fault with this coffeemaker that makes it explode when washing it. I had not made coffee for 24 hrs, so it was cold when I decided to clean it with dish soap. Suddenly I heard a loud pop and the carafe was filled with glass. Luckily my hand wasn't inside and only one shard flew out - away from my face. I have no idea what caused it, but I'm thinking the carafe had some sort of flaw. I called Melitta and they have sent me a new one, but honestly, I'm kind of afraid to use it. The woman I spoke to said she had not heard of this happening, but I've found similar stories on the Internet, so it's not just me. It's a shame, because it's a very pretty coffeemaker and makes good coffee, as all Melitta pour-overs do. It's just a dangerous one.

review/text: This has many uses beyond pumpkin pie. It is a rich blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger and comes packaged in an air tight foil bag similar to coffee. At the 1lb size it is a bargain for the quality. It really has a robust, fresh flavor, and is great to add to yogurt, smoothies, coffee, tea as well as baking. Frontier has very good spice products in general but the Pumpkin Pie Spice is the best on the market as far as I am concerned. It can even be added to rice for an interesting twist and of course puddings, breads, cookies, ice cream etc. A very versatile spice mixture for any season and has multiple uses. Can't go wrong with this fine product!

review/text: The company shipped a little slower than I expected, but I'm spoiled by Amazon Prime! The product produces a thin, lightly crunchy coating that is sweet and spicy, tasting similar to red hot candies but not as intense. It's no wear near the glumpy, clumpy coated popcorns you buy in the box at retail stores, and that's fine by me. The commercial stuff is just too thick, hard, and sweet. Just be careful measuring this out to use - if you inhale any, you will be sorry! It will burn your nose and make you cry ....

But once I bit into one, I knew that these weren't the candies of yesterday.  I don't know if the candies were old or if they melted and rehardened.  Or maybe my tastebuds changed drastically.  These candies were terrible...the chocolate was almost pasty in color and the chocolate and marshmallow was completely stuck to the wrapper.  The texture of the marshmallow was mealy and they tasted very old.<br /><br />I immediately contacted Amazon and sent them back for a refund.<br /><br />I have never had trouble with food products from Amazon, in the past, so I am sure this is an isolated case, but I definitely will think twice about buying candy from my past.

review/text: I ordered this to use in my popcorn machine.  I was uneasy about how the kettle would handle this product, but since I have a great kettle cleaner I went ahead and ordered it.  I am sure glad that I did because this is FABULOUS!  It leaves no mess in the kettle at all.  When it starts to pop the first kernels that come out are the best coated ones and then as more pop they get less coated, but if you mix them all together I think you get great flavor.  Just remember this is a sticky coating when it first comes out so unpopped kernels stick to the popped ones so watch out for those.  Still a great tasting product that I will keep purchasing...

review/summary: big european coffee
review/text: is what my husband said this coffee reminds him of.  He likes a mid (not strong) taste.  I don't drink coffee hot. My idea of coffee is a wonderful smell in the morning that I will make and add to a latte or I guess I mean a chocolate/coffee smoothie that I make at home.  This one suits that bill.  It is a full flavor to me or strong.  I believe it would even make a second cup if I so desired.<br /><br />Would I pay a huge amount for it?  No, I think this coffee is relatively expensive. There are only 15 pods in the box and it happens to have Marley on the box.  Is that the reason for the cost or is pod coffee just expensive?<br /><br />Since I don't have a pod machine I boiled a cup of water and added it to the pod in a cup with a spoon holding it down.  Worked well for me.<br /><br />Good coffee but not worth what they want for it.

I was really expecting the coffee to smell great when it was brewing, but maybe it is to mild.  If you like milder breakfast type coffee or chai tea you will love this coffee.  I added a little light cream and it was very good, be careful with the cream it needs very little.  My first cup I put to much light cream and it overpowered the drink.  I would buy this again, it is something nice to give as a gift or serve to company.

review/text: I'm still not a food reviewer. The problem is that I can't turn down free coffee. That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store. I subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box. Drinking this coffee won't fix the world or make your life more fulfilling, I'm fairly sure.

review/summary: Roast is too dark for  a Yirgacheffe
review/text: While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee.

review/summary: A tasty treat
review/text: We saw that some of the coffee reviews said that the coffee was weak when "teabagged."  We put a few pods of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOLXM">Marley Coffee One Love, One Heart</a> into our old-fashioned stovetop percolator and let the steam do its magic.<br /><br />Yum. Great flavor, and strong enough. Even though I prefer my coffee whitened and sweetened, I was surprised that I enjoyed the Marley Coffee black. This coffee was great alone, and would probably do well as a mixer for cooking or alcohol recipes.<br /><br />Next time, we may experimentally open the pods and try the in the Keurig; however, we *were* satisfied with the percolator.
