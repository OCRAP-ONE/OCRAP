Log Cabin was a staple around the breakfast table on Saturday mornings with my five kids waiting for their pancakes and the Log Cabin syrup!  Delicious!

review/text: This is a top-notch quality dog food that does NOT contain horse meat as most dog foods do.  This product is made from real chicken just like we eat.  Purina has gone to great lengths to perfect this product and has shown to really care about providing a wholesome alternative to the disgusting, inhumanely manufactured, regular commercially available dog food.  If you truly care about your dog then you will want to spend a few dollars more and treat your dog to a real diet rather than last week's runner up at the local horse race.

review/text: Simply the best rolled oats for those who like their oatmeal lightly cooked (not "creamy" mush.) This is a really nice hefty oatmeal which is excellent cooked with water or cold with milk. My personal recipe for summertime is to mix a half cup of oatmeal (uncooked) with flax seed meal (6g), chopped nuts (9g) and chopped dates (19g) then add 1/2 c. skim milk and 1 c fresh berries. Let soak for a few minutes whilst making tea and enjoy! The perfect alternative to sugary sweet cereals on a hot summer day...

He used to drink PG Tips (the regular and the Special Blend), but now that he's tried Barry's Tea, he prefers Barry's.  If you're looking for a nice strong basic tea (in a bag), look no further.  (On the weekends, he prefers some of the fancier and more expensive brands of loose tea, but during the week this tea is great.)

They had little jars filled with olive size pink salt and you pour the oil over them, close the lid when not in use. I thought I could do that myself. I found these on Amazon, just what I was looking for. Perfect size and price.  The salt does not influence the fragrance of the oils at all, the perfect diffuser. I even will smash some with a hammer for my salt grinder. Spice Lab shipped it out quickly, very happy with the product and Spice Lab.

review/summary: an old favorite
review/text: Bisquick has always been my go-to brand for the thickest, fluffiest best tasting stack of pancakes my whole family loves. They used to print instructions on the box for the "ultimate, mouthwatering version" which has a little sugar and I think baking powder or lemon juice (google this?) and they are even better if you can imagine!<br /><br />My only problem is now that I am living at a higher elevation, the pancakes come out drier and less fluffy and I have yet to crack the secret to getting them just right the way I enjoyed them for over 25 years. Still working on it though and if someone knows the secret, please leave me a comment.<br /><br />The waffles are excellent as well but again a little better at less than my 3700ft altitude.<br /><br />The blueberry muffin and coffee cake recipes are fantastic, still come out perfect, and are definitely "company is coming" special treats.<br /><br />Excellent biscuits; I also use the biscuit recipe to make a topping for chicken pot pie.<br /><br />Also makes great shortcakes for strawberry shortcake (S.Utah = peach shortcakes around here) in the summer.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: My dog loves it!!!
review/text: My 20 lb Schnauzer has been on various high grade (expensive) kibbles and none of them have been just right. He has terrible breath which I can tell is linked to his eating dried kibble and they seem to irritate his stomach at times. I've been interested in feeding a raw food diet for awhile but have always been put off by the expense and the high maintenance.<br /><br />I decided to try Honest Kitchen and add various human grade raw protein sources to it (which isn't required). I'm extremely happy with the easy preparation and my dog loves it. He refuses to touch kibble now. It looks a lot like cooked oatmeal after it is hydrated and you can tell that it is human grade food. You just mix it with warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes. Its quick and easy. This is so easy it wont be an issue when I travel with my little guy.<br /><br />The box says to feed 1/2c to 1c of food for my size dog. I've been feeding a 1/4c and adding an egg or half a raw chicken patty. I also add a scoop of plain yogurt for probiotics if I have it in the house. A 1/2c hydrated serving seems like it would be too much food and like I said my dog wont touch his kibble so I know he isn't still hungry.<br /><br />My dog has never been happier and I don't think this will cost much more than the kibble. I'm happy and will be buying the 10 lb box next time.

review/summary: Smells great & gentle on puppy's digestive system
review/text: After suspecting that a protein intolerance was at the root of my newly-adopted puppy's month-long diarrhea episode, I began to research different puppy foods. No amount of antibiotics & prescription food was fixing his mysteriously loose and bloody bowel movements.<br /><br />Puppy had been eating a high-quality pet food based on the diet of canines in the wild. I have no issues with that brand, but it certainly wasn't right for my pup. I needed to find a low-protein puppy food that did not include beef or chicken.<br /><br />...Keen is the perfect fit. It is low protein and uses turkey as its protein source. The organic ingredients and simple ingredients list was a huge plus.<br /><br />The first bowl I made for pupster made me HUNGRY - it smells so good! Just like camping food for people.<br /><br />I use this food, combined with another lamb-based food specifically for puppies with allergies. This is due to the cost & amount that puppies eat.<br /><br />His stools are now great and he goes positively ape-shiz when I start mixing his food. I DEFINITELY recommend this product.

review/summary: Honest Food for my Dog
review/text: With my dog's former food he wouldn't get excited at meal time and he'd eventually eat it.  With Honest Kitchen, the moment I mixed it the very first time he was dancing and pacing just waiting to see what it was I was fixing.  Then he was super thrilled to know it was for him.  Now every time I get his bowl ready, he's antsy waiting to gobble it up!  He is a hairless crested and with this food his skin and hair have improved dramatically.  He is more active and overall happier.  It's easy to prepare and well worth the few extra minutes taken out of my daily schedule to feed him high quality food.

Plus this is 1.5oz and the vitamuffins are a full 2oz...so bigger, better, and comparable in price.<br /><br />If you are a committed vitamuffin lover don't even think about branching out...not worth your money.

review/text: I had no idea these were so overpriced until I checked them out on the company's website.  I thought they would still be OK since I had already bought them for my little shihtzu, but when I opened the bag, they smelled really weird to me.  I called the company to tell them I thought something was wrong with them because they smelled nothing at all like the larger peanut butter treats.  I was assured by Marianne that they should.  She is sending me a replacement and a trial pack of another flavor for little Sheldon, so we know their customer service is good.  She thinks that they weren't stored correctly before they were shipped, but that's all she could guess without seeing them herself.  I order some of the dogranola treats and they are another hit, just kind of big.  The bigger treats are great and probably the smaller ones too...just not these.

This is probably my favorite Navitas Naturals product so far. The only thing I have problems with, and this has nothing to do with the pomegranite powder itself, is the resealable bag it comes in; I've bought a lot of Navitas Naturals products and while I like most of them a lot, the bags they come in tear fairly easilly, especially along the top where the bag seals. Other than that, great product, I absolutely love it and will continue to buy it.

review/summary: Excellent Product!
review/text: I love this powder. I've used it in drinks and desserts and just love the flavor and reddish color it produces. It has kind of a tart flavor but is still neutral enough to use in any sweet dish. I've also used it as a drink (like kool-aid, only healthy). I just added a bit of honey with the powder and some water and it was delicious. So fast and easy. The best thing about this product is that since it's freeze-dried whole fruit, you get all the nutrients and enzymes in a convenient easy to use powder. On top of that the price is reasonable considering how much you get. I can't imagine how many pomegranates it takes to make one bag but I'm sure it's a lot and pomegranates are expensive and hard to get. Unlike the other reviewer I had no problems with the bag at all, seals just fine and I've had it for a month now. Very happy with this product.

review/text: I just bought this product today. I plan on adding it to my smoothies/protien shake that I make every morning. Today I made agar-agar (kanten) dessert with it. It has a wonderful tangy taste. I have stirred it into my coconut water as well. I would love to use this as a food coloring in my frosting as suggested by a reviewer. What a wonderful idea! I am thinking that I could probably make a salad dressing with it as well. My head is bursting with ideas as I am writing this review. This is a fantastic product!

review/summary: No More Dunkin's!  Hello Harmony!
review/text: OK, So my wife and I used to be a Dunkin Donuts Hazelnut coffee snobs, and after a few years of being a loyal buyer, they stopped brewing their Hazelnut blend and substituted it with their normal roast and a hazelnut "flavor shot".  I was like, "what a stupid dum@zz thing to do!" So I set out to boycott them!  After alittle searching, I found this blend of Hazelnut, and I was hooked!  By far this is best Hazelnut blend or roast I've had.  I've been drinking this for over 2years now and I home brew it....and it's so taaaasty!  Now I boycott all those "NAME BRANDS", StarSux, Pete's wicked Gross, Dunkin D'Oh!-nuts, Green ROTGUTain....and Honey Don't! I'm a Harmony snob through and through!  In fact I won't drink any other coffee unless it's this Harmony Bay Hazelnut or Gloria Bean's White Chocolate (Mmmmm soooo goood), thankfully Gloria Bean is just a once a year treat! So, hook yourself up and buy this Roast you won't be let down....and Gloria, if you make your White Chocolate Coffee in a home roast, I'll buy it...so long as it isn't (@ $4.89 a cup, hmmmm, carry the one)...more than Harmony Bay, I'll stick to the Harmony, but thanks anyway....time to make a pot of Coffee. I can't wait!

review/summary: A Great Bargain Hazlenut....But Weak
review/text: I admit I have been addicted to hazelnut coffee for years, especially for the first pot in the morning. Even when I find something I like I can't help but experiment.  I think I am like many coffee lovers, always looking for that perfect blend, no matter how much we may like what we already have.  I drank Harmony hazelnut for years.  It is a staple item at one of those warehouse markets here where I do my regular shopping.  There is no question that Harmony is a bargain for flavored coffee.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a better deal on a hazelnut blend anywhere, even here on Amazon.  And there is also no doubt that it is a decent coffee, I drank it for years as already stated.  However as also before mentioned, when it comes to the perfect cup of coffee, I just can't help but wonder if the grass over the next rise is really greener.  I one day picked up another Hazelnut and realized then that though the Harmony is a decent blend and great bargain, there is no doubt in mind that is it most definitely a weaker blend. Even compared to other regular supermarket brands. And I found it very "hollow" tasting in comparison to other fancier hazelnuts on Amazon that do not cost that much more, (like Melitta's Hazelnut Creme, much stronger).  I have since parted ways with Harmony and gone for the stronger brew in a variety of blends that cost a little bit more.  In conclusion, I recommend Harmony if you are a hazelnut junkie and have limited funds to support the habit.  However if you are someone that like me is on a never ending quest for the cup of java to die for, I suggest you skip this bargain and keep looking.  You may not settle on what I have, but it's my feeling you will come to the same conclusion that the Harmony is a good deal, but a weak competitor at best...<br /><br />PS:  A recent review of this blend has shown that it is no longer the great bargain it used to be.  Not only is Harmony not eligible for free shipping, but it is also not available for the subscription service where one gets a discount, and free shipping.  I have since lowered the rating of this coffee to 3 stars.  No longer the bargain it once was, but still just as weak...

If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of "softens" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!

I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

The leaves look in excellent shape and only a spoonful is needed in a teapot.  I made the mistake of using too much tea for my first pot but this is a tasty tea.

review/summary: Excellent breakfast tea!
review/text: I buy all my loose tea from Stash, and Kopili Assam is one of the best Assams I've tasted.  It's a bold, dark red, tea that tastes good any time of day.  If you only have a little left in the tin, it blends well with any other black tea.

review/summary: This is not premium quality tea
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

review/text: I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.  I definitely would not recommend buying this tea.

review/text: I have a wrapper from a single teabag of Nummi Tarry Lapsang Souchong, and the wrapper alone smells stronger after being opened for two months than a whole 3.5 oz bag of this smells fresh. This tea only has a light smoky scent and flavor, whereas the Nummi tea had a strong pine smoke scent and taste. I know that tarry lapsang souchong should be stronger, but I'm still a little disappointed at how weak this one is. Maybe I'll just use more tea for stronger batches.

review/text: Stash's gunpowder green has been a staple tea in our house for almost a year now. We prefer it iced, but it is decent hot. It is much more affordable than most other green teas and the quality is right up there with other good gunpwder greens we have had. Like most green teas, steep at 180 degrees for 3 minutes to get the best results. We go through a 3 pack of this stuff every single month.

review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Very smooth taste. Medium dark color. Great tea and brand. Economical. Assam can be a wonderful place to visit when calm. Off the well-beaten and ordinary tourist path. Beautiful people. Possible to take the train (or a flight) from Kolkata [Calcutta.] Large parts of Assam are blanketed with beautiful tea gardens. Stayed at a tea garden in Assam on one of my visits there. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E268">Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/summary: Great Green Tea
review/text: I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.

review/text: ****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx
