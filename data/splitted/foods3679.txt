I have not found anything really comparable in any stores here, even health food or specialty stores.  This is the most simlar - and is very good, but the box is really small.  I wish we could get the same thing here that they sell in Northern Ireland.

review/text: Over thirty years ago I could buy this in my little small town grocery, but, these past 8-10 years it's been very hard to find.  Kroger had it for a while, but, not in the original cereal that I used years ago.  Amazon is the only place I can get it now.  I just love it because it's not a granola cereal..it's soft and easy to chew.  Not hard and crunchy at all!  I love Alpen!

review/summary: A Low-Caffeine, Hand-Rolled Fine Green Tea
review/text: *****<br /><br />Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is a premium Numi tea. It is a low-caffeine green tea, is certified organic, and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Our whole leaf Temple of Heaven - Gunpowder Green Tea is gently steamed within hours of being plucked, then skillfully hand rolled into small tight pearls. This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas. Steeped in hot water, the leaves unfurl, releasing a well-rounded, full-bodied flavor. Rich in fluoride, calcium, and anti-oxidants - and with very little caffeine - this is a perfect choice to greet the evening."<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love green tea, or want a green tea that you can drink in the evening, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />*****

review/text: I became addicted to these while on vacation in Hawaii.  I haven't been able to locate any place that sells them locally (I can find the chocolate covered macadamias, but not the one's with toffee), so I have been forced to order them online.  Beware though, it is very easy to devour an entire bag before you even realize what you have done!  They are fairly expensive, but well worth it for an occasional treat.

review/summary: Pero, Inka, Cafix review...
review/text: I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest. I think I did like Cafix the best, but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee. There is little difference in all three, they look identical with only tiny coloration differences. All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker? Pass, because you will not be satisfied with the taste. It is very bland all by itself. BUT, if you like cream in your coffee? You won't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee. I am PERFECTLY happy with all three products and will continue to drink them;I will choose by PRICE due to the very similar make of them all. The cans all read the same ingredient wise.

review/summary: High Fiber, No Sugar
review/text: When I went on the South Beach diet, it was recommended that I look for breakfast cereals which had at least 6 grams of fiber and no more than 6 grams of sugar in a serving. This is by far the best thing I have found so far. A 1/2 cup serving has 14 grams of fiber with no sugar at all and only 60 calories. It's very low fat with no cholesterol and has lots of vitamins.<br /><br />When I chop some fresh fruit into it and add some 2% milk, it provides a healthy and agreeable breakfast with less than 300 calories. Be warned, however, that it is sweetened with aspartame, so if that is a concern to you, you'll have to look elsewhere.

review/summary: Excellent anchovies
review/text: When the Cetara anchovies we usually buy became temporarily available, we decided to try a couple of other brands. This is one of them, and -- though I still slightly prefer Cetara -- they're excellent: big fat juicy meaty fishy anchovies with loads of flavor.<br /><br />The price is excellent. At the time I'm writing, it's less than twelve bucks for a grand total of some 700g of anchovies, divided into six resealable glass jars, and the wee beasties are eligible for Amazon Prime. You can pay twice that much for an 800g tin and still owe for shipping.<br /><br />The other main advantage of this brand is that it does come in those jars. Each one is small enough to use up within days or weeks (if you eat as many anchovies as we do; we use them on pizza, on pasta with pesto, in sauces, and so forth). Anchovies will keep for a long time in salt, but once their container has been opened I'm not comfortable trusting them beyond six months or so even though they'd probably be safe well beyond a year.<br /><br />Just be aware that these are _real_ anchovies -- you need to rinse them, cut off their heads and tails, and finish the filleting job before you eat them. Optionally, you can soak them for a while in cold water (or, so I'm told, milk, but ewww) if you want to reduce their saltiness. (I have no such desire, so I don't bother -- but do at least make sure you rinse them thoroughly or they'll taste a bit too "oceany," if you know what I mean.) Yes, they have bones and everything, just like actual fish, and the larger bones in these are a sign that they're good and meaty.<br /><br />They're tasty enough right out of the jar, so be sure to take out a couple more than you need for whatever you're making and nibble them as you work.

review/text: At first I was disappointed with the product, especially since one (or more) jars leaked during shipment.  Amazon replaced the package that was affected.<br /><br />Not having used salted anchovies, we really had to learn how to soak them.  Too much soaking leaves little flavor.  Removing the spine is easy, and so much better than the spiny ones packed in oil.  We're beginning to like these little fishes quite a lot.

review/summary: great for dogs that love to chew!
review/text: My dogs just aren't into the plastic bones and other chew toys - but they love the cow hooves!  This pack of 10 contains hooves that are thicker than I have seen other places, which is important because they are less prone to splitting and chipping.  You do have to watch your dog when they are chewing, in case a piece breaks off, but this is the only product that I have found that my dogs love.  I have two labs, one is an agressive chewer, and if we have the hooves around I don't worry about her chewing something she shouldn't (my shoes!).  I do have to warn you that the smell isn't great when they chew it for a while, but its worth it for them to be happy.  I would absolutely reccommend this product to anyone with a dog!

review/summary: Durable but they smell TERRIBLE.
review/text: I bought these a few months ago for my Brittany Spaniel pup, who was about 10 months old at the time (he'll be a year next month). He's a little chew monster if ever I saw one, chewing through braided rawhides in a manner of minutes. Since I read that rawhide isn't healthy for dogs anyway, I looked for alternatives. The Busy Bones were a joke, and I'd been warned away from deer antlers because they splinter. So, I did a little more research and found out about cow hooves.<br /><br />Pros: These things last, and last, and last, even with a very enthusiastic chewer like my dog. One hoof lasts him at least 3 or 4 days.<br /><br />Cons: SWEET BABY JESUS, DO THESE THINGS STINK! When I first got them for my dog, I thought they were just giving him a really bad case of gas. But it was such a persistent and distinct stink (see what I did there?) that one day I wondered if maybe it wasn't the hooves themselves. I took one away from him that he'd been chewing on for a day or so and took a whiff. WHEW!!! I rue the day I did that. It smelled absolutely horrible. I guess I really shouldn't have been surprised at the scent when you consider that a cow hoof is nothing more than a giant toenail. In fact, that's actually the closest thing I can compare the smell to--a giant, stinking, toenail that's been inside of a funky, humid, leather sneaker for a very long time; take that scent and multiply it times 100. Ladies, maybe you've never experienced that scent, but I'd wager most of us guys have at some point or another, particularly the big toenail during summer months.<br /><br />Another huge con for me is that these aren't made in America, but Chile. From all the research I've done on my own, animal treats/food made in countries other than America should be avoided at all costs because of the chemicals they use in processing, particularly dog treats like rawhide and such.<br /><br />In conclusion, these things are very long lasting, but because of the God-awful stench and the fact that they're not processed in America, I haven't given one to my dog in nearly two months. Once the whole bag is gone, I doubt I'll ever buy another.

review/text: Its been hard to find something our German shepherd will enjoy while at the same time occupy her for more than two minutes.  Hooves have been the ticket, but sometimes they don't last long because of the way they are processed.  If the hooves are too brittle she goes through them too quickly.  This brand had that tendency.  I know we have to be careful of hooves that aren't "clean".  She digested them fine but a lttle too brittle.

review/text: I had started buying these 1 at a time from the local pet store, until I was buying 3 a week.  It definitely made more sense for me to purchase online in larger quantities.  I've always given my dog (1 y/o female pit) things to chew on, and this is the best to meet her need to chew. This is great for their teeth and it's really no calories.  The only downside is a funky smell.  The hooves do have an odor to them once they get moist.  I've tried all kinds of brands and the ones that smell the worst have a filling which is some type of mystery.  Also, do watch for small peices as they break off. I give it 5 stars inspite of the odor because I really encourage people who have chew driven dogs to consider this product. It will occupy their time and save your shoes!

review/text: I have been trying to find cow hooves for my dogs that have thicker walls, perhaps these were from calves rather than adult cattle.  They splinter and chip very easily and do not last long.  Plus, they are somewhat hazardous for the animal if they crack off pieces and swallow them.

review/summary: Not a PDQ Tray of 6
review/text: My dogs love all the Dingo products so when I saw what looked to be a surplus "pdq tray" of six bags per tray under the product features I thought what a great deal! Unfortunately, it was only one bag :( It's too much trouble to send it back for a few bucks...but now I know better. I think the product feature description is very misleading. Guess I should have been able to figure it out if i had looked at the the shipping weight.

review/summary: Misleadingly low reviews
review/text: I think these reviews have been misleadingly low. Look at the reviews under this same product, but for the pack of twelve, to see more helpful reviews.  Why even write a review saying you are too lazy to use the product as directed? How helpful is that to those who want to know if the product works when used as directed? And then a review about not receiving the product from a retailer that is different than the retailer that is selling this product? All that does is drag down the rating and cause people to overlook a good product.<br /><br />I have had, and have been continuously using, a bottle of this product for about two years now. We have a small family so one 16 ounce bottle has lasted us this long. We can't believe how much dirt it cleans off of our fruit.  Like our grapes, for example.  We take a large bowl, fill it with water and a few drops of the product, then swirl it around with our hand to get a few bubbles. Then we put the grapes in a colander and place that into the sudsy water. After about ten minutes, we pour out the water (so dirty!) and then spray the grapes down (while still in the colander) with clean water to rinse them, until the water runs clear.  The grapes get squeaky clean, even in between each grape, where usually you can't get without having them fall off the vine.<br /><br />You can do the same with apples or other types of fruit - you don't have to wash each one by hand, as was said.  You can if you are only eating one, of course.<br /><br />One alternate purpose I found for this product was when I was cleaning my stovetop.  A guest had used grease to fry something that had splattered up onto my knobs, and when I pulled them off later to do a more thorough cleaning, the grease had hardened into a sticky orange mess that was stuck like tar underneath. No product I had would cut that gunk. So on a whim I tried this Biokleen product because it listed orange and lemon oils in it. Sure enough, after sitting on the gunk for several minutes, it took it right off.  My stove was like new!<br /><br />I highly recommend Biokleen if you are looking for a good, safe and inexpensive produce wash that also has other uses.  Oh and it smells nice, too.

review/summary: Concentrated? Not so much...
review/text: How do you know if something like this really works, not sure but it seems to work based on look and feel and leaves no taste behind so I will assume it does work.<br />I have used 2 other brands and decided to give this a try. This is the 2nd biokleen product I have used that says 'concentrated' yet direct you to use it undiluted. The directions tell you to put it on fruit like apples directly (undiluted) and for soft things like brocoli I guess you could call this a dilution but they want you to put 1 Tbsp  in 2 cups of water and soak the veggies. 2 cups of water does not allow you to soak all that much and based on these instructions I can do this 32times with this bottle. I needed 1 1/2 Tbs to soak 3 pints of blue berries. If this were veggie wash I would need only 1/2 Tbsp in 2 cups if I wanted to soak but most things you can just spray. This is too thick to use on anything soft like grapes so for most things you need to soak them and that requires a container.<br />Other brands I have used are thinner and in a spray bottle and you can just spray and let it sit. I used to put stuff in a colander and spray it and let it sit for awhile and rinse. I think I am going to make up my own dilution (maybe 1Tbsp to 1cup) and use it in a spray bottle but since that is not the intended use and you have no real way of knowing if it worked I am not certain that it will work. I also feel I need to find a spray bottle that is safe for food use so I may just buy another pre-made bottle of another brand of produce wash and refill the bottle with diluted mix of this or just save it for things I do want to soak.<br />Maybe it is just me and others are used to using produce wash this way.  I think this is a good product that is just not all that convenient for me and likely to run out fast if you use it as directed... still I did not really smell or taste anything (veggie wash has a stronger smell) and I did feel the berries were cleaner!

review/summary: Great if used like soap
review/text: For solid fruits and vegetables, like apples and bell peppers, you put a drop or two on the fruit and rub it around. It creates some suds which stays on your hands, so you can continue to wash the next few pieces. Then you rinse them off. Pretty easy. It does a great job and leaves items squeaky clean, especially tomatoes which always tend to be sprayed with some kind of wax that feels greasy to me. And the product smells like licorice. For things that are not easy for rubbing, like berries, you need to make a soaking solution, which does use a lot more of the product. I'm usually too lazy to get out a separate container for this, so I tend not to use it for these types of produce. Of course it would be great if it was easier for these types. But if you only use it for solid produce, it does last a long time.

review/summary: Frustrated and feeling duped
review/text: Our original order (placed on amazon.com, from Vitamin Grocer) of two biokleen produce wash bottles came completely wrecked (sad, because it is a really great product) - since there was no protective packaging in the box, both bottles arrived cracked an spilled. My husband received an email at his agency from the staff at our APO post office to pick up the leaking box - the box itself was not damaged, only the contents, since I'm sure they tumbled around quite a bit without anything to protect them (which makes no sense to send bottles containing liquid). Since we have been using our APO, we have spent thousands of dollars and received many many dozen packages with absolutely no problems. After writing initial review, I was contacted by the seller, Vitamin Grocer. Promised if I deleted my review, they would send a replacement for our order (plus additional bottles - I declined the additional bottles, but agreed graciously to the replacements as long as they were better packaged, because what would be the point?), they wrote me back that replacements would be sent ASAP - that contact was originally November 4. I contacted them again around January 4 to follow up, received an email stating it was sent, and I then followed up requesting tracking and they have not responded. I am disappointed and frustrated and feel duped.

No wonder everyone is selling turmeric in pills since it has such a high nutritional value, manganese 26%, iron 16%, phytosterol 5.5 and most importantly inflammation factor of 1,523; all in one tablespoon. No need to consume pills since I put few spoons of this gold beauty turmeric into my dishes for its health benefits. Sun Brand curry powder has some 30 spices. If you are after a spice mix Sun Brand is the best but certainly with noticeable sodium. Bravo.

review/summary: Might just save my Tassimo from the scrapheap - for now
review/text: The demise of the relationship between Kraft and Starbucks was threatening to make my Tassimo redundant. I have tried many coffees from Gevalia and Maxwell House but none of them delivered that bold, full flavored hit that I got from my Starbucks favorites - Kitamu and Columbia. So I thought my Tassimo was on death row whilst I use up my stockpile of Starbucks, but the Carte Noir Kenya might just give it a stay of execution. This is a smooth, bold coffee/crema. It lacks the bite of Kitamu but is enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br />It brews a little on the cool side if you want to add creamer, and only delivers a (near)4oz serving. However, two of these t-discs works out about the same cost as the Starbucks discs at Amazon prices. The inconvenience is the additional brewing time and hassle of using two discs. Overall, I am happy to have found at least one coffee that might delay the almost inevitable purchase of a Keurig, but it alone is not enough - one of the joys of these one cup machines is the variety on offer and Kraft need to find some quality Starbucks replacements soon.

review/summary: Very good... but not the best
review/text: The Carte Noir Kenya is smooth and flavorful, but not really robust.  I'd call it a 'medium' roast.  Stronger and richer than any sort of breakfast blend, but not as deeply favored as a french roast.  And it lacks the bite of an espresso.  It is listed as having a 'fruity' flavor which I couldn't imagine until I tried it, but yes, it's a bit fruity, not smoky like an Italian roast. For a coffee novice, it's tasty and easy to drink and does not need a lot of syrup etc to smother it.  For a coffee fanatic it may feel too light.<br /><br />It brews 120 ml (4 oz) so it's perfect for a latte or cappucino, if you are looking for something with a touch less of a bite than a traditional espresso.  If I am out of my favorite t-discs (the Kenco Caffe Crema - which you currently have to buy from tassimo directly) for my morning cup, then this performs well as a second choice. I prefer to use two discs in the morning, with a little bit of soy milk (I'm vegan).  In the afternoon one disc gives a nice amount.<br /><br />Another reviewer compared this to the Maestro Lorenzo Crema.  I mostly agree, though I find the ML Crema to have a deeper, creamier, less fruity taste than this CN Kenya.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Smooth, flavorful, fairly rich... but not the darkest or richest out there.  Not robust.  Note it brews 4 oz of coffee.

review/text: First of all, due to Tassimo (Kraft) dropping the StarBucks contract ... the Coffee/Cappuccino options have been rather disappointing!<br />And now, it appears that I'm stuck with a Tassimo Bosch Coffee maker, that I have fallen in Love with, but, may not be able to sustain our new relationship, due to some poor contractual execution and so-so option offerings, by Tassimo.<br /><br />Tassimo is now attempting to Match & Exceed their Customers Expectations, by offering a multitude of different brands of coffee's, tea's and fake chocolate drinks.<br /><br />The Tassimo Brand of "Carte Noir Kenya", 16-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Brewers (Pack of 3), is a good example of Nice packaging + Fancy name + Lower Price Point, than StarBucks, but, in the "RESULTS" Department, is so far behind that I'm considering buying Powdered Folgers coffee, for my New Shiny Red Tassimo.<br /><br />* Taste - Frothy, dark, fruity taste, with an Old Shoe Overtones!<br />* Quality - Do not Know just What the 'Roasting' Process is that Tassimo uses, but, this was a bit "Over-Cooked".<br />* Buzz factor - this is the natural caffeine content in and extracted from the coffee, during the Brewing process ... NOT like a StarBucks Kick!<br />* Amount - Each T-Disc is ONLY 4 Ounces (120 ml), which I was able to make it passable by Adding 2 Milk Creamers!<br />* Price - Fairly Competitive, which is the reason I ordered a 3-Pack, hoping that I would discover a fair "replacement" for StarBucks ... well, No Can Do!<br />* Side Effect - I sustained a bad case of GI Reflux, about 20 twenty minutes later.<br /><br />Summary - Tassimo makes some Very Excellent Milk Creamer's ... they need more time to get together , or, Not, with their Coffee & Cappuccino offerings. I'm Returning this "Carte Noir Kenya" back.<br /><br />Nice try ... but No Cigar!

review/text: I purchased these when they were on special for 22 bucks or so for 2 lbs.  I had just purchased 1 lb at 18 bucks from a friend who had ordered a bulk order from a local health store so she could get that as a low price!  I was thrilled to be alerted to this deal.  Nuts came shrink wrapped but individually packaged in one pound packages and were delicious! Highly recommend if you are looking for raw macs!

review/text: I didn't have time to complain so this is what it is, but I got the chips as promised with good delivery time but they had melted and reformed into one large chunk in each bag.  They were completely unusable.  I had to pitch them.  No clue what the seller would have done but I didn't bother complaining... ran out to whole foods and bought what they had.  I would have much preferred the Guittard chips as they are delicious.  There was no ice in the box, just 2 bags of melted chips.  Bummer.  My 1 star is for the seller not the product.  If its winter or you live somewhere cold, order away as these are fantastic chips.  If its summer, don't do it.

review/summary: Best Grapefruit Ever
review/text: Many years ago canned grapefruit sections used to be available in grocery stroes; it has been years since I've found any.  It was a welcome treat to find these!<br /><br />This is the only way to eat grapefruit, as far as I'm concerned.  All the work is done for you.  Individual grapefruit sections packed in grapefruit juice are ready to go.  I like a very slight sprinkle of sugar on a small bowl of them.<br /><br />This is the perfect finish for a traditional eggs and sausage/bacon breakfast.  Good and good for you.<br /><br />Absolute top quality product - if you like grapefruit, you'll just love these!

review/summary: Gratefruit the Way I Loved It as a Kid...
review/text: As a 6th grader, there were only two things I looked forward to every week in the cafeteria: Poor Boy sandwiches and grapefruit sections. Thinking about this recently, I went on the internet in search of grapefruit sections and found that they were available from Roland through Amazon (whoda thunk it?). When they arrived, I popped a can into the refrigerator, and a couple of hours later, Voila! They were delicious chilled exactly as I had remembered. I was also pleased to find that the juice was sweet but not overly so. I plan to continue ordering and enjoying this "simple pleasure."

review/summary: Good Product - Bad Shipment Packaging
review/text: The 46-oz canned Roland Grapefruit Sections taste almost like fresh. Very good product! I would like to order more, but the packaging was absolutely horrible!!!! There were cans rolling around in a box much too large for the number of cans and there was virtually no packing material in the box.  The result was that out of 8 or so cans in the box 7 out of the 8 were so bent on both ends that you cannot use a can opener to completely remove the lid without a lot of stops and starts.  Where the item says the product is in a 4 pack, they are not in a box containing the 4 pack.  What they actually mean is that 4 46-oz cans are inserted into a light-weight plastic bag and then thrown into a large box that would easily hold 24 cans and is too light weight to support the weight of the cans, then throw in a little packing and put 1 piece of tape on the top. The tape was actually broken on a box with nothing to hold the cans in the box and because of the rolling around in the box, the cans were no longer in the plastic bag.  Very good product that you cannot find elsewhere, but beware of the packing.

review/summary: Great GF Cracker
review/text: I was looking for a great cracker to be able to make "lunchable" like meals for my children to take to school.  They are age 7 and 9 and both gluten free.  These have worked wonderful.  We have tried the regular (good but kind of plain in flavor), whole grain (very strong spice taste the kids didn't care for) and Cheddar Cheese.  I recommend the cheese.  The only issue I have with these crackers is that they are a little brittle and 1/2 the bag (there are two in a box) is always crumbled pieces and there aren't many whole crackers.  But when you are gluten free and looking for a replacement you put up with a lot.

review/summary: Nice taste and texture
review/text: It's hard to believe these are missing anything, but they have no gluten, and are really outrageously good.  They don't remind me of goldfish crackers, but of Ritz crackers - buttery, crunchy and good.  They aren't overtly cheesy, and have just a faint tang of cheese.  These are awesome with Cheez Whiz, meats, peanut butter, just about anything you care to put on them.  A superior product from a superior company.  I have many of their items on my pantry shelves.  They are my dependable go to company when I want a gluten free product.  The only downside is that they tend to be crumbly; I wish they were packaged differently, but generally not a lot of them arrive broken, and even those taste fantastic.

review/summary: Great tasting but many are broken
review/text: Am getting regular delivery of these gluten-free crackers.  They are great with sharp cheddar cheese.  The price through Amazon is much better than local stores, but either way, most crackers are not whole but in pieces.  So if you like whole crackers, forget it.  I have contacted Glutino about this issue and received a number of coupons in the mail for my efforts.  But I don't see any change in the ability to have whole crackers even though there are two air filled bags of crackers in each box.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend these crackers for taste and texture for those on gluten-free diets like I am.

review/summary: I like these a lot, but they are always broken
review/text: I like the taste of the Glutino cheddar crackers. The cheese taste is delicate, this is not full-on cheese taste.  But it's a very nice taste, a little bland, but that's what I was looking for, anyway.<br /><br />Each box comes with two foil packages of crackers. This is nice because it keeps the crackers crisper. Not that I have let an open box go uneaten long enough for them to really go soggy. These gluten free crackers are not as flaky or crispy as many crackers. They are more dense, sort of the way a graham cracker is dense (though they don't taste anything like a graham cracker).<br /><br />I do not have to avoid gluten in my diet, but I try to cut down, for me and my family, and these gluten free crackers help with that.<br /><br />That said, I do not know why every cracker is broken. I buy this set of six boxes, and every bag in every box will be full of broken crackers. This doesn't make a difference for snacking from the bag, but it makes it tough if you wanted to actually put something on top of the cracker to eat. And it's a given that you won't be able to use the Glutino Gluten Free crackers for any kind of appetizer that calls for whole crackers.<br /><br />I keep buying these, though, because I like the taste.

review/text: After recently discovering a gluten intolerance I have been struggling to find things that I can take for lunch that actually satisfy my hunger.  I have tried other gluten free products and have been disappointed with quite a few.  These crackers were a pleasant surprise.  Many in the package were broken when they arrived, but that does not make them inedible.  I think they break so easily due to the fact that they are "dry" in texture.  Keep this in mind when buying and make sure to top these crackers with cheese or some other type of spread.

review/text: I bought these for my son who is allergic to gluten - he and I both love them! The only downside is that most of the crackers were broken into pieces. However, I bought these in a grocery store, not here at Amazon, so the problem seems to be with the manufacturer, rather than Amazon's shipping. Regardless, they are worth the purchase. The crackers have a very good flavor and are crisp - they go well with cheese or just plain. We will definitely buy these again.

So for snacking, using in soup and any other use where they don't have to be intact, this is your product. If you need them to be whole you are going to have to look somewhere else.

review/summary: Tasty, filling, but only four servings per box.
review/text: I am not on a gluten free diet. However, I find gluten free foods more filling. And so, I gave these crackers a try, after coming across them in my grocery store. I like the original and cheddar flavours the best (the cheddar flavour is very delicate).<br /><br />1) I have not experienced the breakage problem some mention. Yes, there is a broken cracker here and there, but nothing out of norm. Quite frankly, I think they pack them as they do, in two pouches, two servings each, in order to pump up the volume, so to speak. Each of these boxes contains only four servings (32 crackers). That's not much for the price. This is the only reason for the four, rather then five star rating.<br />2) They are filling and tasty. I am addicted to these crackers with red pepper humus. Yum! They scoop well once you get a hang of it (they are flaky and will break more often then regular crackers would in the same situation).<br />3) The box is made of 100% recycled material, for those to whom this matters.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: There is a warning on the label that says they may contain traces of soy, milk, and sesame, in case anyone is alergic. Also, they do contain eggs.

review/summary: close to goldfish crackers for GF diets
review/text: These are the closest to a goldfish cracker I will get with my GF diet.  The texture is great and the flavor is good. I think they could taste a bit more cheddar cheese like. Overall, great GF crackers. Just like other Glutino crackers, two small packages in one box. Yes, some crackers are broken. Small price to pay for good GF crackers. I prefer the Glutino vegetable crackers over the cheddar flavored ones. I put a piece of cheddar cheese on these crackers and that made them better.

review/summary: THANK YOU!
review/text: Kudos to Glutino and to Amazon.  Not only are these crackers magnificent but Amazon's policy of carrying a multitude of products for celiacs has made our lives so much easier -virtually normal in my case.  Keep up the good work.

review/summary: Glutino gluten-free cheddar crackers
review/text: These Glutino glutin-free cheddar crackers are incredible.  My husbands says that he can not tell the difference between regular crackers and these gluten-free crackers and they give a kick to whatever he is putting on them.  Wonderful to be able to have normal tasting gluten-free products and Glutino is the best.

review/summary: closest thing to a goldfish cracker that's GF
review/text: These are the best GF crackers I've tasted.  My son is GF and used to eat Ritz and goldfish crackers before going off wheat and gluten. He likes thees a lot and I think they are pretty good too.  Great with a little peanut butter for a snack!

review/summary: Cheezy Cracker for Gluten Free Folks
review/text: We really enjoy these crackers.  They have a great texture and cheezy flavor.  They remind me of those little cheese fish crackers.  This is a great choice now for us gluten free folks who struggle to find a good cracker.  Here it is!

review/text: Good flavor and gluten-free, but note that the ingredients include palm oil, a not-so-good for you saturated fat...

review/summary: Great Ingrediants - old and dry
review/text: We must have received a fruitcake made a year ago - this was so dry, you could not slice it- it just crumbled.  You could tell the ingrediants were of high quality.<br /><br />Last year we purchased a Jane Parker fruitcake and it was great, unfortunately, the large ones are no longer available through amazon.com.  In addition, the tin ( which my wife wanted ) was damaged in 2-3 placed - fedex is rough on things

review/summary: Sorry no good
review/text: This fruit cake was just no good. It was even burnt on the top. I had to throw it away. The tTrappist Monk cake was better, and Collins Bakery is still the best.

Listen to me my Dears...please forget the American traditional sweets for a few days and enjoy this remarkably precious treasure. Give your taste buds a twist and see you guys in Paradise!! :)
