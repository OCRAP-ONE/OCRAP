review/summary: Too much vinegar in this variety. The "extra hot" version (look for a black background on the label) is much better
review/text: Warning: there is a significant differences between the regular Valentina reviewed here (a yellow background on the label) and the "extra hot" version (black background on the label).<br /><br />The regular variety of Valentina hot sauce is heavily laden with vinegar. Yet, if you like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce, you might really like this one. It tastes very much like Frank's hot sauce or even the original Tabasco hot sauce (once diluted). Unless you like a heavy dose of vinegar, this variety is Not Recommended. But keep in mind that a lot of vinegar is what many Americans are used to and may actually prefer.<br /><br />The "extra hot" version is much better balanced in my view.  The vinegar is in the background and while this variety is a tiny bit hotter - it is far from being "extra hot".<br /><br />To tell the two versions apart - keep in mind that the regular variety has a light yellow background on the label while the so-called "extra hot" version has a black background on the label. In very small type, on the "extra hot" variety, you will see the words "extra hot" but that is easy to miss. Use the label background to tell the two versions apart.<br /><br />Make no mistake, the two versions of this sauce are worlds apart. The regular version has a heavy vinegar taste and the hotter version, which is not much hotter, is far better balanced in my view. See my review of the "extra hot" variety for more comments.

review/summary: BEST CAT TREAT EVER
review/text: My cat adores pitr pats. My dad bought her some for christmas, and when the tin ran out, you would have thought the world ended for my little cat. I've since found them locally - they are the BEST cat treat I've found. She goes crazy for them!!!!! I mean CRAZY. She'll meow and yip and purr and stand on her back legs for them - seriously. Try them out. I wish I could write the company and tell them myself and thank them for such a great treat for my kitty - but their website is messed up. Goodluck!

review/text: If you buy one tin, buy ten because your cat will think these are wildly delicious. Strangely enough they are shaped like fish, but they contain ingredients like green tea extract and rosemary oil.<br /><br />We went through one tin in a week and my cats thought these were the best treats they had ever tasted.<br /><br />I had no idea cats would enjoy rosemary oil in a cat treat, nor did I think they would paw at the empty tin begging for me to buy more. Definitely a treat to hide in a safe place.<br /><br />Even after taking these out of the packaging and box, my cats were clawing at the box to get more. You have to hide the box<br />in a high place or in a drawer or they will find a way to get into the container. lol<br /><br />I'm not sure who enjoys these treats more. I love<br />seeing how much my two cats enjoy these treats. The<br />tin with two treats can also work as a training tool<br />because the cats will instantly respond when they<br />hear the treats being shaken in the tin.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: My favorite candy of all.
review/text: Every Halloween a bunch of neighbors bring over their kids and I take them all in one giant group around the area. The deal is that I get all the "Nerds" and the kids keep everything else. Yes, I love Nerds this much. The kids are more than happy with this arrangement since I will stay out with them for twice as long as their parents would. :-)<br /><br />Therefore, being my favorite candy of all, I simply HAD to search it out on Amazon's grocery section and spread the word.<br /><br />Most boxes contain two different flavors. One flavor is on each side. (There are boxes available that mix several different flavors in one. You can usually find these in movie theaters or a movie rental place.) You control how much you eat by simply pouring them into your hand or directly into your mouth. Be warned though that many flavors are sour or tart. The instant Nerds hit your taste buds you will be overflowing in flavor/taste.<br /><br />You can bite into them right away, but it is best to simply hold them in your mouth for a minute or two, sucking the flavor. Once you have done that, chew once or twice and then suck some more. You'll find even MORE flavor than even before. If you continue doing this, each mouthful will last quite awhile. Since your hands are not constantly busy, you can do other things. (Play or work on the computer, hold hands in the dark theater, read, yard/house work, etc. You get the idea.)<br /><br />So do yourself and your kids a favor and pick up some of these. Once you try them you will understand my love for them. Oh, and be sure to buy the bundles for Halloween! I just may be in that group at your door.<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.

review/summary: A Tiny Box of Memories
review/text: When I was around 8 years old my family took me and my younger brother on our first trip to Cape Cod Massachusetts, since then we went up once every summer for a week or so, those first few years we would take a pop up camper to a camp site by the beach. The campsite itself had two memorable things, the first was a play ground my brother and I would spend time at, and the second was a small candy shop down by the end of the road leading up to the camp site, it was in this candy store that I had my first box of Nerds.<br /><br />My brother and I looked all over the candy store with the wide eyed wonder of the literal kid in a candy shop. The one thing that caught my eye was the small pink and purple box of candy up by the register. Since our mother only let us buy one thing each this is what I chose, and my brother (always copying me) chose the same, which we enjoyed on our way back to the camper. Of all the tastes on that trip, the marshmellows we toasted over the campfire, the seafood we had in the local resturants, my first bite of buttered lobster, the wind and saltwater on the beach, it was that little box of candy that my brother and I shared on the way back to the camper that stands out to me the most.<br /><br />Many years later in high school I met one of my best friends working at thelocal FYE, his name was Andrew and we first started talking over one of the jumbo boxes of Nerds, striking up a conversation about how you got almost a pound of candy with the box of Nerds, and how other candy boxes skimped out and filled it with mostly empty space. For most of my high school years he and I would hang out at the store, exchange stories, shoot the breeze, ect, usualy over a box of Nerds.<br /><br />Ive now been out of high school for almost four years, Andrew and I have lost touch over the past few years, and my brother died almost 7 years ago. After all this time these tint little candies still bring back all th happy memories from my childhood and teen years. Bravo Wonka on this exellent product.

review/summary: Great price - unimpressive Earl Grey
review/text: We are a faithful Coffee Bean customer. We buy their French Roast by the bags for our hotel. So I am disappointed that the Earl Grey does not live up to its name. The Bergamot is present as aroma, but not in flavor - unless you like your Earl Grey gentle. (The meek shall inherit the earth.) To me, this is simply a strong black tea with wispy Bergamot notes. On the plus side: price is truly impressive when compared with Harney or Twinings loose leaf.

review/summary: Excellent, if . . .
review/text: As with all of my food reviews, I like to begin by acknowledging that tastes and processing differ from person to person and from batch to batch, respectively. Water is just . . . so water, if you know what I mean; most of my fluid intake is in the form of tea and coffee both of which I consume throughout the day and night. (And no, there is no such thing as too much coffee or tea. Furthermore, mindful of one of healthcare's biggest myths perpetuated by the uninformed, one does not need to drink n-number of glasses of pure water every day: the body will extract all of the water it needs from any source of liquid)<br /><br />I drink two kinds of tea: orange pekoe, primarily with meals, hot or iced, and Earl Grey. I am on my first bag of Coffee Bean Direct Earl Grey, which I found to be rather heavy on the bergamot when I compare it to Bigelow's Earl Grey, my usual choice. As Howard Wilson noted in his review here, "Just the aroma of opening the bag was enough to send us off on a memory jag." Indeed it does! But as I noted at the outset, tastes differ.<br /><br />To compensate for what I consider too much bergamot, I create a 50/50 mix of the Coffee Bean Direct Earl Grey ($15.95/2 lbs.) with Coffee Bean Direct Orange Pekoe ($12.43/ 2 lbs.) which yields the intensity of bergamot flavor which favorably compares with the Bigelow that I am used to - at a total cost of $28.38 for four pounds of tea (for Bigelow tea bags - 6-pack of 40 bags ber box on Amazon - four pounds would cost $98.48!)<br /><br />In a word, for those who really like bergamot, they will enjoy CBD Earl Grey. For others, like me, who find the intensity a bit much, cutting the Earl Grey with plain orange pekoe will yield an excellent cup of tea. Notwithstanding my "critique" of the intensity, I give the CBD Earl Grey a five-star rating because I find my "workaround" to be inexpensive (cost per pound of "my" Earl Grey is cheaper) and easy enough to create.

review/summary: A very nice cup of Old Stinky
review/text: Earl Grey, sometimes called Old Stinky, is a black tea that has had a small portion of oil derived from the rind of bergamot oranges added for flavour and aroma. A lot of less expensive Earl Grey's fall down by lacking both the flavour and aroma that makes Earl Grey tea into Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />The Coffee Bean Direct version of Earl Grey does not lack in either flavour or aroma. The leaves are whole and high quality. The aroma is wonderful the second you open the bag. And the flavor in the cup is outstanding, especially for the price.<br /><br />You can spend more money and you can probably get better tea. But this is very, very good in the opinion of a daily tea drinker who has sampled many versions from many vendors. For the price, I don't see where you can go wrong. Recommended.

It is flavorful without the bergamot being overpowering.  The leaves are large and high quality, far from the fannings and dust one might expect at this price range.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be for smaller package sizes.  Two pounds of tea is a lot, and takes a single person months to go through.  It kept well, but there's nothing like breaking the seal on a fresh package.

I was a little leery of getting this because the company is obviously a coffee company but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the tea leafs were of a very good quality, very little tea 'dust' you see in in alot of the bag and some of the loose teas. The aroma is amazing and fills the room when steeping this tea. Very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />Be careful though, the picture on amazon doesn't really call out that this is a 2lb bag. Thats ALOT of tea, makes this a good bargain but might wanna find someone to share it with.

review/summary: Poor quality
review/text: I carefully read all the reviews on this Item before ordering! I must say, there are not that many real Tea drinkers writing reviews for this particular Item. Sure, if you are a Lipton dipper, this is a great tea. But if you know what a quality tea should offer, you would not have given this product more than 2-Stars.<br />The Aroma when first open the bag, is quiet decent, but when the tea is Brewed, the flavor is a disaster. It is basically a lipton like flavor. The color, is also unlike a good quality Earl-gray! Which it should have an amber color, that can be anywhere from light, to deep end of the spectrum, depending if the tea is a Single Body, or need to be mixed with another tea for potentiation of Color.<br /><br />At last, the tea leaves are not uniformly sized, which basically means this tea is probably a mixture of low quality teas, just flavored as Earl-Gray!<br /><br />Coffee Bean direct should consider offering a better tea, for a few more $$$!!! At least 2Lb of tea would be worth Brewing!

review/text: The aroma of this tea is nice and I don't mind bergamot (which is nicely noted in this blend).  But overall, I find this tea to be not that interesting. Very flat and even with cream, it still just tastes like not much.  Some will like this tea, but for me, it doesn't warrant a repeat purchase.<br /><br />**update** I've learned to better brew this tea to suit my tastes.  (This can be a bit tricky with this blend.)  I like it with just a waving of honey and milk.  I would still try a different brand just to compare.  Will get back when that is done.

review/summary: Great Bargin - Good Tea
review/text: Like two other Coffee Bean Direct teas that I've ordered, the Earl Grey has a great bargain price for good quality tea. I brew and refrigerate a gallon at a time. The amount of tea that I need to make a gallon seems smallish - I'd estimate a little over a cubic inch. The bag measures to 200 cubic inches so I'm estimating 12 cents a gallon plus or minus some. Now that is a bargain! Since the tea tastes great, it's a real bargain.<br /><br />The unique ingredient in Earl Grey is called "oil of bergamot" and that is what gives the tea its unique aroma though it only has a small effect on the taste. The aroma in the bag is really kicky so take a sniff and enjoy.<br /><br />The only minus on this tea is the amount shipped, 2 lbs, and the large volume: where you going to store it? I'm keeping it in the bag but that might let the tea get stale after a while. I'd be willing to pay a dollar or two more if the tea shipped in a resealable bag, probably metal instead of paper, that was designed for long-term storage. This consideration does not knock off a star since it's a bargain even if I had to throw half of it away.

review/summary: Very Good Tea
review/text: I got this tea and it's so much tea I am sharing!  I love this tea.  It has an excellent flavor and it's strong enough to make more than one cup with the leaves.  (I use an infuser).  I make sure the water is boiling hot when I make it so I get all the flavor!  Strong Orange flavor as well, not overpowering but perfect with the black tea as Earl Grey should be.  I won't go back to tea bags again!!

review/summary: Best Earl Grey I've Ever Brewed
review/text: This tea is outstanding by any measure.  The sense of quality begins when one first opens the bag: The aroma of heavenly, citrus-y (expensive) bergamot oil fills the kitchen.  The brew smells delicious, even while the tea is just steeping.  Discarding the spent leaves, one can see that they are whole: Big, lush tea leaves instead of pieces, choppings, or dust.  But the real winner-take-all prize here is the flavor:  Traditionally, people who enjoy Earl Grey, do so with the beverage very hot.  For me, that was once true--but I find that this particular Earl Grey also brews my favorite, interesting, nuanced iced tea as well!  All of the Coffee Bean Direct teas I've tried have been excellent, but this is by far the best of them.

review/summary: This tea has changed
review/text: I recently received my third bag of this tea. The previous two orders had been great. This one smells like earl grey dry but brews up to taste like ordinary black tea. I also notice that the leaves don't expand as much. It seems to be a different product. I put this in the back of the cupboard and went back to the more expensive Davidson's organic earl grey with lavender that I was drinking before.

review/summary: Nothing like Earl Grey except  for the smell
review/text: I bought some bulk Earl Grey tea from another Amazon supplier in the past (Frontier) that was rather pleasant. But this one was pure disappointment! It smelt good when you opened the bag but performed really poorly when you brewed it. Dark in color and bitter in taste with an almost no existence bergamot flavor! If you really appreciate a good Earl Grey I will advice you to pass on this one...It was cheap, I guess too cheap to be true. Lesson learned.

review/summary: Not great, not bad
review/text: I purchased this tea because I was drinking 4 or more cups/day. It was not particularly smooth, or very flavorful. The bergamot flavor seems muted (at least in my bag). I would not say that it is a "bad" tea, but it is also not anything great. CBD does have some excellent values available, if you are okay with having an average product.

review/summary: Not very good, even for the price
review/text: This tea delivers on aroma but seriously fails in the taste department.  I'm not sure if the quality has gone down hill over time (lots of rave reviews), but I find this tea to almost be undrinkable.  I couldnt believe how bad it tasted so I had tried an endless amount of combinations on steeping time and amount used, to no avail.  The bergemont is there in smell, but all I taste is an overpowering bitter lemon.  Also, if steeped beyond 3:30, it becomes very bitter and gathers a really awful taste in my experience.  The only reason I am still drinking it is because I can't bring myself to throw away a pound of tea.  My advice would be to steep for 3 mins.  It'll be a little weak, but won't taste as undrinkable as 4 mins does (which is a typical steep time for blacks).  Or spend a little more money on something like Twinings.<br /><br />Easily a 2-star tea if it weren't for the extremely low price.

review/summary: **Agree that the tea has changed--4th purchase**
review/text: I have deleted my previous glowing review of this product and cancelled our subscribe and save for this item.  Our most recent purchase has left me highly disappointed.  The only way I can describe the flavor of the tea that is now being brewed is "cardboard-ish".  No flavor at all...  Just brown and disgusting.  Very unhappy.  They also changed the packaging to a very wide mouthed bag and when I poured it into the air-tight container we use it went everywhere--not practical at all.  I will not buy this again.  While I appreciate a savings, I do enjoy my morning cuppa quite a bit more and this has left me looking for another brand.

review/summary: Nice, but not Earl Grey
review/text: As others have said, this tea is very strongly oiled. I do not doubt that it is some oil of bergamont, but it seems to be from a source of different quality from the bergamont in Twinings Earl Grey. The scent of the tea reminds one of Twinings Earl Grey (more than, say, lemon scented teas), but it is not really the same in its complexity of flavor as the Twinings Earl Grey. This may be from some cause such as use of black teas from Sri Lanka or India tea in place of black Chinese tea in the base, but it might also be due to the bergamont used.<br />While the tea is tasty, and in that respect resembles Davidson's or Bigelow's Earl Grey, it just is lacking the muskiness and smoothness of the Twinings Earl Grey, which I believe is essential to the character of the blend. I think the tea base determines such qualities, and the Coffee Bean Direct product just does not have a complex enough tea base.<br />This is not the tea I was hoping for, but it is still nice.<br />If you like the bergamont scent of Earl Grey so much that you really don't notice the tea that it is wrapped around, you may really like this. On the other hand, if you find yourself gravitating to Twinings Earl Grey (officially endorsed by the Earl of Grey) over the others, then this will not be your cup of tea.

review/text: My two border collies can eat through 10-inch "rawhide rolls" in one evening (that's one bone per dog). That gets expensive! These 24-inch bones with knotted ends are a better deal. I give one to each of my two dogs and the bones last 3 weeks. I ordered these at the end of September. Noticed the Amazon price went up by $1.72 per bone in October. Not happy with the price jump, but it's still a better deal than the 10-inch bones.

review/summary: Doesn't last very long with a very aggressive chewer
review/text: I bought this 24" rawhide because several reviewers said their dogs worked on it for a very long time.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my 100 lb. Labrodane.  He was pulling off large shreds within 2 minutes, had it broken in half within 10 minutes and chewed one half down to the knot in less than an hour.  While I don't think this is a bad quality bone, the rawhide is not as thick as other bones I have purchased, which I am assuming is why he was able to tear it apart so fast.

At first it was so large that I think she was a bit intimidated by it, but after a few days of coming up with an attack strategy she went right to town.<br /><br />...and finished it in 3 days.<br /><br />Typically a large rawhide lasts about 4-5 hours for her, so it was definitely a value.  Also, it was hilarious to watch her run around the house holding onto it.<br /><br />Bought it for one of our friends pitbulls too, it's a great dog gift!

review/text: My 45 lb lab mix loves these 24" rawhide bones but they only last 48 hours at best. She's like a wood chipper when she gets going. So according to her it is a 5 star product based on how much she loves it. But in my judgement it is sort of expensive for 2 days of chewing. I will buy this product occasionally but will seek a more economical alternative. My guess is that most dogs will not chew it up as quickly.

In fact, these Dole tropical fruit cups are just like the Dole tropical fruit cups from the grocery store (slightly different packaging is the only difference that I noticed). The taste is the same, and the fruit looks the same. In terms of the price, I received 36 fruit cups for about $27 with free two-day shipping. That works out to seventy-five cents per fruit cup! Much better deal than in the store. All in all, I like these. Four stars because these fruit cups taste good, and are very reasonably priced. I'd give it the fifth star if it were made in the USA!

review/text: The PROS of this tea:<br />*ACTUAL RED TEA (and it does taste like the leaves from Thailand)...<br />*NO nasty food coloring<br />*NO gross paint taste/smell<br />*has anise (see cons) like Thai tea is supposed to<br />*adding whole spices to the water before steeping, boiling those a bit, then steeping them with the tea can be a decent alternative to handling messy loose leaves<br />*holds up to longer steep times--ie it's not the super cheap stem-filled tea most brands market as "Thai Tea"<br />*convenient<br /><br />The CONS of this tea:<br />*Weak. Very weak. 1 bag per 6oz yields tea half the strength of the very strong stuff in (authentic) restaurants, so instead of being about fifteen cents a bag from my Asian market, it's double that... so that makes it about a dollar JUST in the bags per 18oz serving? Not a great value anymore! There's no way I could justify paying the shipping costs--which are more than 2 boxes typically--on top of higher prices in online retailers (typically--if it was a buck and had free shipping, maybe? probably not, though)<br />*the anise flavor is too subtle--ended up brewing my own spices in<br />*anise isn't the only spice typically in Thai tea, though it is the dominant one<br />*not as red as top quality black/red teas from Thailand and Sri Lanka<br /><br />OVERALL?<br /><br />If I wanted something sweet at work, while there are dozens of tea options out there, this isn't the worst choice by a long shot (but really, so many better, more flavorful teas, authentic or not)--I mean, this is nothing like the gross Pantai stuff that's not only green, not red, tea but is full of chemical yuck... it's not, though, anything like the loose leaves I get that I add spices to and brew in a commercial coffee pot (brew super strong then run the hot water through a second time--it makes the pot in under two mins, so mine turns out like good restaurants but then... most coffee makers can't handle it--the drip drip things ruin it)...<br /><br />In other words, it's okay. It's nothing spectacular but nothing like the awful mess with food dyes and chemical byproducts, either. Wouldn't waste sweetened condensed milk on it--too expensive and this isn't strong enough to handle it--but a little sugar and (real, no thickener junk) cream and it's a basic, decent cup of tea. 3*s because it's quite literally alright, not bad, not great. Just use pure, not tap, water, whatever you drink--tap ruins tea regardless.

review/summary: Good for brewing at home
review/text: This has become my new favorite breakfast tea. The flavor is simultaneously rich and mild. As to be expected from Thai tea, it take milk and sugar very well. The problem with tea (and coffee too, for that matter) is two people can try the exact same tea but have very different opinions on its taste/quality. My opinion: if you're looking to make hot or cold Thai tea at home, you should at least give this brand a try. Also, you can significantly reduce the calories compared to restaurant-style Thai iced tea. Ever wonder why it tastes so good in restaurants? Because it's basically flavored syrup with cream on top!

review/summary: Bland; not the tea you get in Thai restaurants.
review/text: First, I picked this up at my local Asian supermarket because the price there was half what was the price here. Second, I noticed that unlike the other Thai teas, it does not have artificial coloring. All the other Thai teas I found on Amazon and in the Asian supermarket close by had FD&C Yellow No. 6 (Sunset Yellow) which is banned in a few countries due to its carcinogenic effects. I was hoping to avoid that by purchasing this alternative. Unfortunately, this tea is lacking more than just the artificial color.<br /><br />Since I always order tea at Thai restaurants due to the unique flavor and taste, but find the $3.00~4.00 price a bit expensive, I decided to get some so I could brew the same tea at home.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT THAT TEA. In fact, I wouldn't drink this tea at all. I've tried many different types of tea, and this tea is quite possibly of the same quality, if not worse, as "cheap Chinese restaurant tea" (watered-down jasmine). Not only does this tea fail to resemble the "real" Thai tea in any way, but it lacks any flavor, period. I found that I needed 2 tea bags for a typical, single 6-8oz serving of tea. Even so, it tasted more like generic black tea than the spicy, full-flavored Thai tea that you would expect. For a pot of tea, I needed 5-6 bags. Priced here at $7.99 per box, it is extremely overpriced. $8.00 for 20 bland, half-strength tea bags is a complete ripoff. You could literally get a box of 20 premium fair trade, organic tea bags from Trader Joe's for half the price that these bags are selling for.<br /><br />If you want authentic Thai tea, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005G0F8RY">Thai Tea Cha Thai</a>. It is a little more expensive, but you receive a large bag and it actually tastes like what you would expect from "Thai tea." Furthermore, with Cha Thai, a little goes a long way, so the bag should last a while. As I indicated above, it has Yellow No. 6, so I drink it in moderation until I can find a great-tasting, natural alternative that The Original Thai Tea fails to be.

review/summary: Not at all like Restaurant style Thai Tea!
review/text: Pros: All natural tea, tastes like a decent black tea, which is the only reason I gave it any stars at all.<br />Cons: If, like me, you were looking for an all-natural version of restaurant style Thai iced tea, THIS IS NOT IT! Makes a decent hot tea or iced tea, but not at all what I was expecting. I tried brewing a cup with 3 tea bags, as one tea bag is nowhere near strong enough to pass for what I am accustomed to, but it turned out a very strong ordinary black tea. Does not have the reddish orange colour, nor flavour. I used sweetened condensed milk and a bit of coconut palm sugar, following the instructions of the Thai waiters at my favourite Thai restaurant. I didn't want to buy the other Thai teas available on this site, as they are loaded with food colouring and chemical additives.<br /><br />If you are looking for a true Thai iced tea, don't buy this product, or you will be disappointed. If, however, you are looking for a decent black tea for regular hot or iced tea, not a bad choice, though, I personally preffer Scottish breakfast tea for ordinary black tea, as the flavour is very robust, earthy and rich. Rooibus tea is more similar to restaurant style Thai iced tea than this Thai tea. If you are looking for a true restaurant style Thai tea that is all natural, it might be worth your while to research a very good "from scratch" recipe that you can completely make yourself, using select teas/herbs. That's my plan, anyway.

review/text: This stuff isn't quite as good as what you get in a restaurant but what is?  I picked it up at 99 Ranch Market but I felt I should give the Amazon review for people who don't have a market by them.  I got brewing directions from the internet but the boxes directions would work well enough.  I used 6 bags in 6 cups (it seems crazy I know).  Once the water was boiling I put in 3/4 cup sugar and let it dissolve.  Then I poured the sugar water over the tea bags and let it sit for 5 or 6 minutes.  Chill until cold put ice in a glass and add some half and half.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought the tea was really great and I got to sit by the pool with a home brewed thai iced tea and a good book and have a lovely Friday afternoon.

review/text: I always get a hankering for gingerbread and pumpkin bread when Autumn rolls around, but I'm never up for baking from scratch.  This year was the first time I tried this particular mix.  It calls for one egg, some butter, and some milk to be added to the mix, so quite easy to throw together.<br /><br />The result is a bit of a mixed bag.  The texture and consistency is very lovely and moist; I'd grade it an A or A+ almost.  Unfortunately the sweetness is underplayed to the detriment of the whole project.  I have so far sampled it plain; I wonder if a scoop of whipped cream might mitigate the problem.  Anyway, I might buy it again, or I might not.

Although I haven't seen them in the store for awhile, I jumped at the chance to purchase them while browsing Amazon.com grocery section. When I received the Terra Golds Onion & Garlic Potato Chips and opened a bag, I was truly disappointed! Although the bags were labled Onion & Garlic, the contents were just plain potato chips with no hint of garlic or onion flavor. I was really anticipating the garlicky and oniony taste of the of the yukon gold chips. I was looking closely at the packaging and noticed that the plain chips were pictured. I remembered from the picture on Amazon.com & from past purchases that the chips had a speckled look to them. I had other people try various bags in the shipment and all were plain chips. I don't know if I would ever purchase these chips online again.

review/summary: The box would have tasted better
review/text: I bought the box because it looked good and the sugar and fiber content.  However, my first thought on tasting it was that the box would have tasted better.  I found the taste bland and they did smell like cardboard.  They never softened up to look like the ones on the back of the box.

review/summary: This is a TERRIBLE PRICE
review/text: Don't pay $12 for 8 pouches. You can get the same amount for four bucks at your local Target (or similar).<br /><br />This pricing is a complete rip off.

review/text: The ad for this product is very deceptive.<br />They make you think you are going to get more packets than you are actually going to receive.

review/summary: Nice easy mix
review/text: The packets seem super convenient.  They do smell strongly of whatever flavor they are before opening them, so if you want them to not smell until you open them, you're out of luck!  I was glad to find them online in individual serving sizes so I don't have to make several liters or measure out the mix.

review/summary: If you want a low calorie version of Gastorade this is it.
review/text: If you want a low calorie version of Gastorade this is it.  I got grape, I think I'll try a different flavor next time.  You get 8 packets of the powder, each packet cpnverts 20 ounces of water into Gatorade.<br /><br />I recommend it for anyone who wants a low calorie version of Gatorade and who doesn't mind mixing it themselves.<br /><br />Gunner  July, 2012

review/summary: Tender Pop Hulless Popcorn Kernels 2 Lbs
review/text: This product is good, but a bit pricey. It is as advertised though! I personally would not pay that much again. Other than that I liked it and have nothing bad to say about it.

review/summary: ALMOST hull-less!
review/text: this is almost like the popcorn we had as kids -- less husks than most popcorn, but not totally hulless.  Tastes pretty good, pops smaller than yellow corn, but has good flavor.  Didn't use anything but canola oil to pop, and regular table salt.  The instructions remind us to let the oil heat up before putting the kernals in.  Wish it didn't cost so much, but it's so hard to find, it's the best I've found.  "Enjoy" is my advice to others who are looking!

review/summary: Not hulless.
review/text: Sorry but hulless must not mean without hulls.  It was loaded with hulls and was very dry. Popped ok but will not reorder.
