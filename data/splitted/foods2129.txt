review/summary: Great winter pick-me-up
review/text: This is the second year I have grown the cascading petunias. Last winter they were spectacular for months. I really like planting all of one kind of flower; it makes for a dramatic display, right when you need some color in your life. This year they have sprouted just as easily and quickly. I can't wait for the blooms to start.

review/summary: Fresh Salad Greens
review/text: I started my salad pack approximately 3 weeks ago and have just started to harvest.  The kit includes 5 different kinds of greens.  I mixed it up so I have several of each kind. Everything is growing nicely except for the baby greens.  The one seed pod I planted hasn't grown as well the others.  The only thing that would make this better is to be able to grow the tomatoes and the greens together but according to the directions you're not supposed to do that.  Its so nice to have fresh salad greens in the middle of the winter!

review/text: I planted the first mixed set two weeks ago, and so far everything is coming up well except for the arugula which is kind of stunted. The salad greens, mesclun,and romaine are all doing great. I think that the arugula might still catch up. So far I would recommend the set.

review/summary: Happy with the herbs
review/text: We've been lucky with the herbs, so far. They grow well and we grow enough of them to have all the herbs we want, when we need them. We find it difficult to grow tomatoes and impossible to grow them in any significant quantities. Everything else is in-between. We never tried flowers but we might this coming summer because we have a real outdoors garden that produces everything we need during the summer months.<br /><br />So, go with the herbs, young or post-young woman or man :)<br /><br />The basils are fantastic and we got good oregano and arugula too.

review/summary: Overall AeroGrow
review/text: Purchased prod w/standard seed kit and regular basil was 2nd to sprout, but after 2 weeks it had a clear fungus...fury mold to all of it.  Out of remaining seeds in kit (my kit had cilantro which was replaced w/thyme)...thyme so far is producing the least.  Thyme was actually the 1st to sprout but is faltering in the long haul. The most aggresive growth is the mint.  Next it is neck & neck w/dill & chive.  I find myself cutting dill & chives to "clear the shade" in the hopes that the rest can catch up. I will say that I left a hydroponic tomatoe in the light of the machine...and in 2 weeks the fruit still looked fresh & the skin had visual bubbles or pimples in it.  When I opened the tomatoe nearly every seed had sprouted...yes SPROUTED within the tomatoe (so cool to see by the way - actual leaves inside a tomatoe!).  So I transplanted 4 seedlings into the empty basil "herb pod" and moved it to the back corner of the unit.  AeroGarden says the nutrients are different for herbs vs. vegetables...but if I can keep these sprots alive for another 4 weeks...I am in business with 4 REAL tomatoe plants.  No matter any results, it has been a blast watching the growth, especially the tomatoes which bursted as a seed inside a tomatoe that I had to cut out and now is an entitiy with leaves (and will soon need to be separated). And in the end I have a LOT of mint frozen for our summer Mojitos!!

review/summary: What???!!! One Sprout in a Month???
review/text: I started my first Aero Garden with great success; it gave me more herbs than I could keep up with. However, when I ordered this International Basil seed kit, despite following the re-plant instructions to the letter, after about a month, I have just one basil sprout, approximately 3 cm above the label. The package says they're "guaranteed to grow" but says nothing about how to redeem that guarantee if they don't grow. Now I've spent over $20 on something that didn't even work. What a waste!

He still loves the outdoor activity of his garden (at 92) but is having a good time with this as well.  He shows his great granddaughters how it works, shows them when the plants start growing, has them help harvest, and makes tasty treats for them.  Now, how much more fun could you want?

review/text: Bought both the aerogarden, and master gardener deluxe kit, for my sister with the brown thumb. Fit and finish seem good, ease of use can't be faulted, and she's already got plants growing in a remarkably short time, which given her success at converting seeds into little blobs of mold is nothing short of miraculous. OTOH, a quick review of what goes into it, from the perspective of a mechanical engineer, suggests  that it's vastly overpriced. I do hope they'll be bringing the price down in months to come. There could be a huge market for it at a  more reasonable price.

review/summary: Looking Forward to the New Kits
review/text: I have to agree with previous reviewwers comments about the selection of herbs in this kit.  I would have preferred parsley, thyme and rosemary to some of the herbs in the kit.  Two types of basil is just overkill when there is a separate basil kit.<br /><br />With that said, the green basil grows really fast.  It was ready to harvest within three weeks.  The purple basil is the next best, followed by the mint and the oregano.<br /><br />The chives are the most delicate -- they dislodge and curl back into the sponge.  After more than a month of growing, I have two thin sporuts, not even enough for one potato.  My biggest disappointment was the cilantro --mine never sprouted.  I called the company and they shipped me a replacement, which also never sprouted.<br /><br />I can't wait for the new herb varieties to arrive in September.  I will be experimenting by mixing herbs from the various kits to get the combination I want.<br /><br />If you've ever tried to grow herbs indoors and not been happy with the results, this is the product for you.  It's very easy to take care of and the instructions are detailed and easy to understand.  It's unfortunate that some herbs work really well and others don't.<br /><br />Revised 10/13/06:  I spoke with someone in cusotmer service last week.  Aerogarden determined that the problem with the cilantro was that the water pump was too strong.  I was sent a free replacement pump.  When my new kits come in, I will try cilantro again.  The basil in this kit was wonderful.  The dill was fine and the oregano and mint were just okay in terms of growth and yield.  The chives were too delicate and the cilantro never worked.  Hopefully the new pump will fix the problem.<br /><br />The new kits will arrive next week.  The new Gourmet Herb kit replaces the oregano with parsley.<br /><br />Revised 11/21/06:<br />The cilantro in the new kit works beautifully!  I now give this kit four stars.

review/summary: Tasty herbs, but why these?
review/text: Well, this is the kit I tried first, and the back row of plants & center front are doing the best.  Both basils shoot right out of their pods.  The Dill and Cilantro are growing tall, and there is lots of mint, but it is tiny.  The chives are looped back into the sponge & have yet to try to stand up straight, and the Oregano is sprouting within the sponge, but has yet to come out of hiding.  And this is at the beginning of week 2.  I believe I could probably harvest a little basil at the end of week 3.<br /><br />The big question is, where is the Parsley?  People have suggested they substitute Parsley for Oregano.  I'd rather they replace the Red Rubin basil.  I have recipes with oregano, but none specifically calling for purple basil.  However, I never tasted the stuff, so I may change my mind once I do.  Hopefully they included it becase of taste and not for looks.<br /><br />This is an easy, low maintenence kit.  You only have to refil the water bowl when the water gets low & add 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks.  It comes with 2 starter nutrients, 2 sprouting nutrients & 12 regular nutrient tablets  They ask you to place the pods in the order they came in the box.  Possibly because of slightly variable light levels.  The light is on 17 hours and it only waters when the light is on for this setting.<br /><br />Parsley will be part of both the Italian & French herb kits that will be available in September.

review/summary: Salsa Garden Seed Kit... More Work than the Herb Kit
review/text: I purchased the Aerogarden system and a few kits last year.  On Jan 1st 2009 I took out the remnants of the herb kit and planted the Salsa Garden kit.  This particular kit has several extra steps - plant selection, pruning, growth stabilization, and pollinating.  I will mention each in detail here to help others.  The herb gardens are the easiest - just cut off what you need as you go, once mastered you might find yourself wanting to try something else.  Salsa Garden and other kits like this - i.e. Chili Pepper, Cherry Tomato, Snow Peas, Green Beans, etc. - will require a few more steps.  These steps are the main changes for Salsa kit vs Herb kit.<br /><br />1. Plant Selection -  With the Salsa Garden, you must first make a selection of the plants themselves.  After several days of growth you will see the small sprouts.  There will most likely be more than one sprout in each pod - you must cut back to just one plant per pod.  There will be only 3 pods total in this kit - 1 pepper, 2 tomato.  There will be spacers to fill in the other pod slots, this will allow growth of these plants.  Plant selection is important, so make sure not to let those extra sprouts keep growing - doing so will eventually overrun your pod space.<br /><br />2. Pruning - This kit's instruction uses the 5th branch system.  Read that section carefully before your first pruning.  Then afterwards you will continue to prune throughout the life of the plant - to prevent growth to close to the lightbulbs and to trim wandering branches that are unable to reach the light.  Eventually those branches will die and you can cut them afterwards if you accidently forget to prune them earlier.  You will continually get dead leaves, especially near the base of the plant - do not fret, this will happen a lot as the outer edge of the plant gets more of the light.<br /><br />3. Growth Stabilization - This kit will eventually require a string or twine, etc.  After your plant grows big enough, the weight of the plant will eventually cause it to begin leaning over, especially after fruit / vegetables begin to appear.  Each plant will need a string to stabilize it to the light post at the back of the Aerogarden.  I personally used 3 nylon strings that I removed from a shopping mall bag's handle, similar to that of an athletic short's draw string.  You can also get twine or other thick strings, like yarn, from almost any hardware store, crafts store or supermarket.  Some other sets like Green Bean kits have their own support devices, but for the Salsa kit you must provide your own - so be prepared.<br /><br />4. Pollinating - This might be the easiest step... or possibly not.  As each plant begins to flower, pollination by bees or insects will not be likely.  As per the instructions, you must gently shake the plants to cause the pollen to move about and eventually end up on one of the other flowers.  Read this section carefully about how vigorously you should or should not shake the plants - in my oppinion, not very much if at all.  I tried this step and it worked fine for the tomatoes, but not the peppers.  After several waves of blooms appeared on the mini jalapeno plant still no amount of shaking worked.  Eventually I tried to shake a little harder, which didn't work and also caused many of the under leaves to fall off.  My advice - use a feather.  This isn't the most practical method, but it works.  When you see several blooms open at once, lightly brush the interior of the first flower - then the second, third, etc.  Do not forget to come back and brush the first flower again at the end of the cycle.  The pollen will stick to the feather then stick back onto a different flower - similar to the hairs on an insect's legs and body.  You may have trouble finding a feather - which I recommend using a very clean one at that.  DO NOT grab a feather from a your yard that came from a wild bird or from a farm animal.  You sure don't want lice or other problems in your house.  Try a crafts store or you can pull the feather out of a cheap household duster.<br /><br />My final opinion, the tomatoes grow easily and without much trouble except for the stabilization.  The peppers on the other hand stabilize well enough and keep themselves fairly self pruned at the base, but pollinating these bad boys can be a little bit of a trick at first.  Overall this was a fun kit and it produced all the way until the end, eventually I ran out of nutrients and decided to remove the plants.  If I hadn't, they'd be still going.  I got about 5 months of produce - which over time was a lot, but I only got 2 or 3 tomatoes at a time or 1 pepper at a time for lots of those weeks in between.  This was fun, but may not be for everyone.  If you mastered the herb kit, then this would be an interesting next step.  On the other hand if you had trouble with the herb kit, then you might want to pass on the Salsa Kit.

review/summary: Meh...
review/text: First of all let me state that I love my Aerogarden.  HOwever, there were some issues with the herb kit.  For one thing, I think it's sort of impossible to grow a reasonable amount of each herb in such a tiny space under fluorescent lighting.  IF I grew this again (which I won't) there are certainly some things I'd do differently.  The manual advised not to thin the plants when they sprouted--mistake #1, especially for the basil--one basil took off and shaded the others, which were never able to catch up.  My purple basil and chives grew pathetically.  In fact, the entire time I grew this kit the chives had maybe four sad little stems.  Flavor left a little to be desired as well, especially for the dill.  Barely three months after planting, my herb garden virtually self-destructed.  This I blame on the fact that the company advises you to just keep throwing nutrient tablets in every two weeks, never rinsing out the bowl to keep the salts from becoming too concentrated/imbalanced.  Flushing the system is just basic maintenance with hydroponics!  In my bigger hydroponic garden, I have lettuces that are still going strong after four+ months, so there's no reason this should've burnt itself out so soon.  I think it's a bit of a deception on the part of Aerogrow; properly maintaining the garden would extend it's life greatly and you wouldn't be coming back to buy a new seed kit so soon.  But I was willing to let my herb garden go so I could try the cherry tomatoes.  So far so good with that kit, they are just now getting ready to bloom and I have high hopes for what seem to be very healthy looking tomato plants.  Next time though, I'll probably just buy the master gardener's kit, which gives you everything you need for one year's growth, except seeds, for $40.00.  I have amassed quite the seed collection, so I really don't need any more overpriced seed kits.  Plus, isn't it a lot more fun to experiment on your own instead of following the instructions in a manual?  Like I said, I love my Aerogarden, but sometimes it's a little too "idiot proof."  EDIT:  Having grown the tomatoes to completion, I can't recommend that kit either.  I didn't get very many tomatoes.  The ones I got tasted pretty much just like grocery store cherry 'matoes, so okay, but this was more of a novelty than an actual productive tomato garden.  Also, even though I pruned the plants at 5 weeks to make them stronger, they were in need of support.  I tried to tie them to the lamp arm as suggested in the manual, but the angle is all wrong; it doesn't help at all!  One of my plants fell over and died anyway, still loaded with it's meager crop of 8-10 underripe tomatoes.  I think you need more vertical space, a stronger light source, and some sort of growing medium to give tomatoes the support they need.  That said, I STILL LOVE THE AEROGARDEN!  It's cool, and I'm not giving up on it yet.  I just know it's perfect for something, but I haven't found the right plant yet.

review/summary: Doesn't produce with 2 foot aerogarden
review/text: Don't buy the cherry tomato seed kit unless you own the newer, higher aerogarden!<br /><br />I own the "standard" Aerogarden.  This version has a maximum distance of about two feet from pods to lights.  I had previously had a great experience growing the herbs.  The tomatoes just needed a lot more headroom that my aerogarden provided.  My harvest was a meager eight (if great-tasting) cherry tomatoes.  I've noticed that since my experience, Aerogarden has introduced a new version with a four foot headroom.  I think the tomato seed kit should be clearly labelled as requiring the four foot version!<br /><br />Also, make certain to read the directions--you'll need to pollinate the tomato flowers by hand, which is a straightforward process that is clearly described.<br /><br />I'm now planting another round of herbs.

review/text: There is a lot of detailed information in some of the reviews below, so I won't repeat what they have to say.  However, my experience overall is excellent and while it's true different plants grow at different rates, the output of this thing is prolific.  I cut the herbs every few days and give away a lot.  It grows right back and the taste is delicious.  The lettuce from the lettuce kit is also very good and I have found the company to have excellent customer service, documentation on their products, etc.  While this unit isn't prefect, I can't imagine it being much better.  I am seriously considering getting a second one because I am so happy with the results.

review/summary: Common sense
review/text: I have owned my Aerogarden since last Christmas. The first thing I planted were the herbs. The dill grew the best. The others did very well except the chives, which only sprouted about a dozen. Next, I planted the romaine, I had one that didn't sprout, but it grew for well over four months, and every time I pruned it, I extended the life a little longer. Now, I have the chili peppers, and they are huge!<br /><br />I have a very brown thumb, and was dubious as to whether I could make this work. It has far exceeded my expectations. A few things to note from the other reviews...... A good dose of common sense serves well here. Some seeds don't sprout. This is true in EVERY type of garden no matter what you do. While annoying, the yield is still so bountiful, that it is well worth the money. Growing the chili peppers, I now understand why you only get three tomato plants. This probably should have been the case for the peppers as well. The large plants are overshadowing the super hots, and the root systems are incredible. I have found that I need to add water every few days now since the plants have gotten so big they are drinking a lot more.<br /><br />Finally, one of the biggest keys I have found is diligent pruning. Every time I pruned my herbs, they got even fuller. The same is true of the romaine, and one of the most important things to remember with the peppers is shake the plants daily to pollenate them.<br /><br />For those who expect this product to "work perfectly" and require no effort whatsoever, you may be a bit disappointed. With a little effort, and some good old fashioned TLC this system works beyond my greatest expectations. When I think of how much money I have spent on fresh herbs through the years, even a plant that doesn't sprout now and then is tolerable when the yield of all the others is so good.<br /><br />I would recommend this system to anyone. I am very very pleased!

review/summary: Not the right plants for the AeroGarden!
review/text: Ok, I love the Aerogarden and it worked great with my last batch of herbs. But the tomatos grow very fast and even with tons of trimming, I can't seem to keep them away from the lights. But that is not the biggest problem. Since the roots are not attached to anything, the tomato plants fall over in all directions. You can TRY to follow the instructions to tie them up somehow but the reality with the garden is that it is not easy to do so. There is only the one hood support to use. So even using garden ties, velcro, etc, the plants are always flopping around. If Aerogrow is reading this - I have a suggestion for you: Use the four "unused" holes in the tray to hold some sort of support towers for plants that get that big or need to climb. There could be some sort of snap in cone or something to help hold plants up.

review/summary: Looks like 70% of Cherry Tomato Reviews are NEGATIVE
review/text: I am working on my second Cherry Tomato seed kit. After about three months, the first crop provided about eight Cherry tomatoes. Hardly a bumper crop. During the growth I had to clean out the pump which got clogged with roots (more on that latter). So I figured, ok, I had to disturb the root system when I had to clean out the pump, so perhaps that was the problem.<br /><br />I started a second crop of Cherry Tomatoes about three months ago. So far, I have had one marble sized yellow tomato. I also have an additional two, marble sized, yellow tomatoes ripening. I have not even seen any flowers on the two red tomato plants. The red tomato plants grow, but no tomato production.<br /><br />I am running out of plant nutrients. I checked AeroGrows site, and they want a ridiculous price for an additional package of plant nutrients. Corporate greed at its worse.<br /><br />I have read all of the reviews, and I see that about one-third of the Cherry tomato reviews are positive. That leaves two-thirds of Cherry Tomato reviews as negative. Adding my negative Cherry Tomato review drops the positive Cherry tomato reviews to 30% positive, 70% negative.<br /><br />Given that we are all growing these things under pretty well controlled conditions, I suggest that the Cherry tomato seed kits might have a limited shelf life, and AeroGrow could be selling their old kits.<br /><br />My negative review of AeroGrow's cherry Tomato seed kit on their site was NOT PUBLISHED. So I published my review on Amazon.<br /><br />With respect to the AeroGrow garden, in my opinion, the location of the pump is flawed. It should not be located at the bottom of the tank because that is where the roots want to go. The pump should be located higher up on the tank, and it should be located in a position where it can be easily maintained, without damaging your crops. I hope someone else comes out with a competitive product. Frankly, I don't like the way AeroGrow does business.

review/summary: The herbs were great...but the cherry tomatoes...not so great
review/text: The herb kit that came with my Aerogarden was superb and I enjoyed caring for my little garden. Once it was time to replace it, I purchased the cherry tomato seed kit. These also grew rapidly, but one day I noticed that they had completely fallen over...how would I stake these on an Aerogarden? And yes, the lights were as close to the plants as possible. I kind of leaned them against each other to keep them upright. But they still fell over several times. So they grew and grew but I never got any tomatoes. :( I also did follow the directions to ensure that they had complete darkness for proper flowering. Fortunately we have several tomato and cherry tomato plants in our outdoor vegetable garden. Unfortunately, I spent $20 on 3 cherry tomato Aerogarden plants and got zero yield.

review/summary: Mixed Results
review/text: I have followed the instructions religiously, but am having problems with this kit.  One of the plants is about a third of the size as the others.  It hasn't grown at all in weeks.  I am at 10 weeks with my garden and two plants have a ton of tomatos.  Customer service suggested trimming back my good plants so the smaller would be closer to the light.  I can't see cutting off all my flowers and tomatos to take a chance on a plant that seems defective.<br /><br />Added May 6th, 2007: I woke up this week to discover the two plants that actually grew were tipped over and falling out of the garden.  They were fine the night before.  They have been cared for exactly as the book suggests.  I tried "staking" them, but the only option is to tie them to the grow light arm, and doing so just does not keep the plants upright.  The just tip the side instead.  On a positive note, I finally harvested my first tomato (yellow variety) after about 95 days.  It tasted okay.  I am hoping the reds taste more like a real garden tomato.<br /><br />Added May 14th, 2007: So far, all of the tomatos that have been harvested are quite sour.  I had such high hopes, but now I am sorry to say I can not recommend this kit to anyone.

However in my first kit chives never came up. I spoke to customer support and they made me wait a few weeks before they have sent the chives replacement, but by the time it was too late, as all the other plants were huge, so the new seeds didn't really have a chance. I have planted my second kit a few weeks ago, and this time sage didn't sprout. Chives are also looking weak, dominated by huge basil and sorrel. Obviously, I am quite annoyed with dead seeds in both kits.

review/summary: More fun than cost effective
review/text: Having gone through two herb seed kits, I have had mixed results.  For my first kit, the basil really thrived and provided me with far more leaves than I could possibly use, and the dill also did well.  Unfortunately, the cilantro never sprouted, the mint provided enough harvest for maybe a few mojitos before it died, and the chives were just barely alive.  I had better luck with the second herb kit: both types of basil and dill did very well again, and the mint was at least respectable.  The cilantro sprouted this time and provided enough leaves for a bit of salsa, but results were still underwhelming. Once again, the chives again were disappointing and barely did anything beyond surviving. I do enjoy watching the plants grow, but the operating costs alone ($20 that seed kits costs plus a few dollars per month on electricity that the bulbs use) are probably far more than it would have cost me to buy these herbs from the grocery store. Still, I'm just not inclined to go and build my own hydroponics garden, and I do plan on using the aerogarden in one way or another until it falls apart.  It only kind of works as advertised, but it is an interesting introduction to hydroponics, and I can't imagine making this product any easier to use.<br /><br />Update:  I tried the salad greens kit and would not recommend it.  The lettuce plants grow quite well, but I find the leaves to be limp and flavorless.

review/summary: Best kit from Aerogarden I've tried to date
review/text: So far, I've grown lettuce and gourmet herbs in the Aerogarden. The herbs had one failure (the cilantro) and the lettuce grew like gangbusters but didn't seem worth the trouble. Then I planted the French herb garden, wanting to have chervil and savory, among other herbs not commonly available at the grocery.<br /><br />The kit has chervil, sorrel, savory, parsley, Marseilles basil, sage and chives. All of these are quite useful. I might have substituted thyme for the parsley--parsley grows pretty slowly and I think it is a waste in the Aerogarden as it's commonly available in huge bunches at the market. But it is convenient to have this essential herb at your fingertips. Sad to say, one can't have rosemary or tarragon in the Aerogarden. Both of these are woody herbs and don't really grow from seeds. But one can often find pots in the garden center. Maybe with an additional grow-light, I can add them to the kitchen garden. I wonder if the Aerogarden pods could someday be adapted to grow slips of plants like tarragon (shipped live.)<br /><br />All the pods germinated before the estimated time, including chervil which has the longest (3 week) germination. The herbs are growing healthily and quickly. So far, this looks to be the most versatile of the sets I've grown. My previous herb garden resides in a flower pot and is more or less humming along--the basils and mint and chives are doing quite well in soil rather than hydroponics, though they were sulky when transplanted. I may keep this French garden growing indefinitely unless something more interesting crops up.

In addition, the only two pods that are really growing are the globe basil and epozate.  The thyme, parsley and oregano are a pathetic bunch of sprouts that are beginning to turn brown after four weeks.  I'm following the directions and just finished a successful garden, so it's not like I'm doing anything wrong.  These gardens are supposed to be idiot-proof, at any rate.  I would not bother purchasing this seed kit in the future.

On top of that, over the last few weeks, it has gotten very loud.  Sounds like the pump is loosing a bearing or something.  We have cleaned it, but still loud.  Very disappointed.  My wife wants to toss the whole thing in the trash.

review/text: I started this seed kit in February. All three plants grew well but one of the Red Heirloom did not get any flowers. The other I was able to harvest around 6 tomatoes and the Golden variety around 10 tomatoes total. After that I didn't get any more flowers due to having to keep the plants trimmed so they weren't growing into the lights. I would probably not purchase this seed kit again. I love the herb kits and have had nothing but success with them. The tomatoes I found too pricey for the actual yield I got.

review/summary: Not as bad as others say
review/text: I have to agree with one of the other reviews that the kit does become "Bushy" and large for an aerogarden.  I actually thought this might happen since I have grown String beans in an outdoor garden and have seen how big these plants can get.  The size of the "crawl" and the overall size of the plants is much smaller than what you would see in an outdoor garden so don't let the reviews put you off.  The plant will hang over and spread, but so does my lettuce garden.<br /><br />As far as output goes my review is somewhat tainted with the fact that my pump gave out 3 months into growing and I did not figure this out until it was too late to recover.  I harvested a decent sized bowl not too long into growing and the plant was covered with flowers (which obviously was going to produce more beans, much more actually)<br /><br />I don't know what happened to the other reviewers but I got a decent harvest (and in hindsight I think I would have had much more) until my pump went out and killed the plant.  Do I think I was going get $20 worth of beans?  Do you really think you get that from any of these kits?  I don't.  I like the fresh food and the fun of growing them.  Then again with food prices, maybe you can get your money's worth out of these kits, the healthy fair is a nice bonus too.<br /><br />I do recommend getting the trellis to help hold the plant up, the little wires that come with the kit are pretty much worthless.<br /><br />I hope my review helps others.

review/text: I am now on my second round of herb kits and for this batch, I purchased three kits and mixed the pods to make my fall/winter mix:  cilantro, basil, parsely, thyme, savory, sage and oregano.  The parsely and sage are from the new French Herbs kit.<br /><br />Everything I've planted either sprouted a day early or right on time.  The savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch, but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since I started.  The sage grows very quickly and is more robust than even the basil.  The parsely seems to be slow but steady.<br /><br />Your herbs will be good for at least six months.  With proper care, I'm sure you could extend their life.  These are very easy to care for and it's great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal.<br /><br />I recommed this product to anyone who loves fresh herbs and/or anyone who has had problems growing herbs in the past.

review/text: It took forever for fruit to flower - two of the three plants fruited, grew nice-sized tomatoes, but the weight caused them to topple.  Next, the leaves all rotted off but the remaining fruit ripened...bland, ugh, no taste.  The remaining plant finally grew fruit and they ripened red with tons of tape, etc. to support it (that's where all the extra work came in - trying to keep the plant upright).  Taste on these was a little better but far from worth the effort.  Back to herbs!!!  (I do love the aerogarden for the herbs!)

review/summary: Still haven't mastered the Aerogarden art...
review/text: I tried to post this on the Aerogarden official website, but I doubt it will be approved. It seems they only approve the reviews in which consumers rave on and on about the wonderful qualities of the Aerogarden. My review is meant to reflect my personal experience, which is neither all good or all bad. I just want to be realistic...<br /><br />"Though I do enjoy my Aerogarden, someone needs to come out and say that it's not quite as simple as just sitting back and watching your herbs grow. It requires a lot of careful pruning and there is a certain art to getting everything to grow properly.<br /><br />This is my second Aerogarden, and compared to the first, it was far more successful. In my first garden (the gourmet herbs kit), I was able to keep only the two Basils and Mint alive. This time, I was able to harvest herbs from four out of seven pods. The problem (for me) is that the basil, mint, and parsley grow so much faster than the other herbs that you have to prune them half to death in order to allow slower-growing herbs a chance to get a foothold before there just isn't enough light or room for them to grow. The savory and oregano seedlings got so leggy right away that they just flopped over and never really grew properly. Eventually, it became clear that they'd never grow enough to be worth anything, so I stopped my aggressive pruning and decided to just enjoy the basil, mint, and parsley. Don't know if I'm doing something wrong. I am an avid (outdoor) gardener and I consider myself pretty plant-savvy. I'm going to try again and hope for better results.<br /><br />I'd also like to say that the Aerogarden company does excel in the customer service department. When a couple of my pods failed to sprout, they sent replacements -- no questions asked. They also were willing to impart very good advice and didn't even keep me on hold for very long. I'll keep aero-gardening for some time, even if my yields aren't quite what I feel they should be."

review/summary: A Must Have!!
review/text: Aerogardens are amazing. With very little effort you can grow fresh herbs and produce right in your own kitchen, or anywhere else in your house for that matter. Overall Aerogarden offers a great line of seed pods however with that being said, most Aerogarden owners are at some point going to be tempted to plant something that isn't available and that is where the Master Gardener Kit come into play. It really opens up the world of indoor gardening by allowing you to plant your own seeds. We wanted to plant catnip as not only do we have multiple cats, so does everyone else in my family. I also am a big Bonsai tree aficionado and this kit allows me to use my Aerogarden to start my Bonsai seedlings. This kit gives you a year's worth of seed pods and nutrients.<br /><br />The bottom line - Aerogardens are great but they would be severely limited if it wasn't for the Master Gardener Kit. This kit really opens up the world of indoor gardening. A must have for every Aerogarden owner!!

review/summary: Second try and the tomatoes still died
review/text: My first batch died after a couple weeks of growing to about 1.5 inches; the company was very quick in replacing all three plants, however the next batch did the same thing.  I don't know what is wrong with the tomatoes, my herb garden in my other aerogarden is growing so much that I'm throwing away basil to keep it under control.  Also have tried on another set to grow cilantro with no success even after trying to transplant from a very small potted plant, similar failure with trying strawberries.  I'm getting the impression that aerogrow is really good for growing their standard herb package and nothing else.

review/text: I was so pleased with the herbs I grew in my standard Aerogarden I bought a second one so I could grow both herbs and cherry tomatoes. Wrong! The herbs did fine again, but what they fail to tell you is that the tomatoes require 8 hours of absolute darkness. If you want to have the two gardens in the same room, or even in your living area, forget about the tomatoes. Lovely greenery, no blossoms = no tomatoes. I finally just threw them out. I'll grow herbs again, and maybe try another kit, but I can't recommend the cherry tomato kit.

review/summary: Basil explosion
review/text: My gourmet herb kit came with basil, mint, chives, dill, thyme, and parsley, but I refer to it simply as my basil garden.  The dill sprouted late, grew one anemic stalk, and then keeled over dead.  The mint likewise made a meager appearance before turning brown.  The thyme and chives were small but enjoyable, and I had given up on the parsley before it finally flourished and seasoned a few meals.<br /><br />But OH MY GOD DO I HAVE BASIL!  I've trimmed it aggressively many times, only to have it return bigger and bushier and beating out the other herbs for light.  I celebrated the fresh basil for a while, but now I stuff it unceremoniously into ziplocs and store it in the freezer until one day when it will all become pesto.<br /><br />Judging from mine and other reviewers' experiences, the aerogarden produces imperfect and unpredictable results -- but it has been fun to have fresh, growing herbs within my lightless apartment even if the outcome was not as planned.  I look forward to trying other seed kits.

review/summary: A fan of the cilantro and basil!!
review/text: I did the starter kit (parsley, dill, basil, purple basil, cilantro, chives).  It takes a while for everything to emerge, but worth the wait.<br /><br />The cilantro grew like crazy - it practically had a tree trunk coming out of its pod and stole the light from poor little parsley.  I think the dominant plant effect depends on 1) the position of the plants in relation to each other, and 2) where the nutrients land when you throw them in.  It's a good thing that the cilantro took over since it goes well it lots of different types of dishes (Thai, salsas, etc.).<br /><br />Both the green and purple basil are full of flavor and make a kickin' pesto sauce.  Don't harvest the basil too early or it gives up.<br /><br />The mint is a great garnish for mint chocolate chip milkshakes and is perfect for mojitos.

review/text: This is an out-of-date kit (the ad on the back of the box says, "New for 2007!") so I wasn't surprised that the Romaine lettuces did not sprout. The others are doing fine and sprouted quickly. This is my first time growing salad greens in my AeroGarden, so I was pleased with how quickly everything sprouted and how early I was able to remove the growing domes. With that said, the leaves on the plants are very thin. It has been 3 weeks since I "planted" and I already need to make a small harvest - but early nibbles were disappointingly bitter. I love my AeroGarden, but the company's excessively expensive shipping to Alaska has forced me to go elsewhere (at THEIR suggestion!!) to buy their products. Unfortunately this means I don't have access to fresh kits.

At a price of $19.95 (and I'm not that price sensitive), I thought this was seriously over priced. Worse, while two of the plants are well on their way, the third never sprouted. Did some investigation, and there were no seeds in the third. So, I basically paid $10 a tomato seed. As much as I love cherry tomatoes, and have loved other aero garden kits very much, I would not recommend this one.

I was just sorry to see it end so soon, made the salad greens quite expensive.  We eat a big salad just about every day with dinner.  The greens available at any given time was never enough for us both.  I'd rather see them do away with the mixture and offer the best leafy one for the whole seven holes in the Aerogarden.  The "spring mix" and another one (I forget it's name at the moment) did not produce quickly or enough.  I will look for those generic refills so I can make up my own salad greens garden the next time around.  This was just too expensive for what it produced.

review/summary: One Small Crop Not Worth It
review/text: The green beans were my third or fourth seed crop from the Aerogarden folks. Had great success with the herbs, and have been trying other crops to gauge my success and interest. Sadly, the green beans I considered a bust. I got one meager handful of beans from this; no more. I'm going back to the herbs after this.<br />One thing that is a challenge with the beans - once they flower, you have to be your own "bee" to get them pollinated.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Would not recommend this seed kit.

review/summary: Yummy Fresh Salad Greens
review/text: There's nothing like home grown and without having the mess of dirt and bugs these salad greens are wonderful.  I harvest them months at a time and we are spoiled by the wonderful flavors.  If you don't own an Aero Graden I say buy one now and start your garden.  They grow so fast, too!

review/summary: Romaine Seed Kit for AeroGarden
review/text: I started this seed kit four weeks ago. It started a little slower than the salad greens that I've previously grown. It took three weeks before I could harvest a small amount, but now it's growing fast. I think it's doing better than the salad greens which I tried four times, always grew very leggy and didn't last two months. I'm hoping the romaine will last longer. Although it's fun and easy to grow, it's way more expensive than buying organic from the store.

review/summary: Don't waste your money
review/text: Only 2 of the 7 pods sprouted. When I filed a claim, they sent me a form email stating that I had to call them to confirm that my aerogarden was actually working.  The phone number they provided was disconnected and there was no way to reply to the email.  Very disappointing.

review/summary: The Company With NO customer service skills!
review/text: I am unsure of the plant quality yet. However ... there are only 3 seed pods in this pack and 4 spacers. The first gal at the company told me to contact Amazon. No, I said this is your product they are simply acting as a middle man. I told her I would like to speak to someone above her. She says her supervisor is "tied up" but will call me in a few minutes. 45 mins later I call back only to reach a sarcastic supervisor on the other end. Watch out doing business with this company. Too bad really.

review/summary: Intl Basil Doesn't Work In All Aero Gardens
review/text: The International Basil kit only works in the 7 pod gardens, which is not specified anywhere in the product description. After realizing that the basil was not sprouting, I discovered the reason why - this kit is not compatible with the 6 pod garden - the pods are shorter and do not reach the water! Very disappointed - my rating is due to the product description.

review/summary: not the right size for my Aero Garden
review/text: I was disappointed in this kit.  It says the seed pods and plastic holders will work with my Aero Garden but they are in fact too short to reach the water.  I ended up removing the seed pods and putting them in the old, longer plastic holders and that worked.  After I purchased this kit I bought the Master Gardeners deluxe kit which does not contain seeds.  Just plastic holders, growing "sponges", and nutrient tabs.  A much better choice as the parts actually work with my unit though I later found it would have been cheaper to buy it through the Aero Garden website (I purchased the Master Gardeners Deluxe kit directly from Amazon).

review/summary: Chili Peppers Seed Kit not very fruitful
review/text: Today is June 29th and I began this adventure on March 1st, 4 months ago and the production expectancy for this set.  The sprouting was slow, but the CS Rep from AeroGrow suggested I be patient.  He said they would really take off once they sprouted.  Well, they did and we were off to the races.  So far, 1 mini jalapeno and 1 purple super hot have bit the dust completely.  The second mini jalapeno grew huge but never produced a single pepper.  Two of the purple super hots are still alive, but have never even produced a flower either.  Both of the red fires are lush and have produced a total of 10 peppers so far.  Considering the cost of electricity, the kit, the extra nutrients which needed to be purchased because there are not enough included, the replacement light kit, and the hours upon hours of talking to, touching, fertilizing by movement and a tiny hand held fan (CSR's suggestion) These are the most expensive peppers I've ever consumed.  I'm thinking of transplanting these into my garden plot to see if they ever produce.  I have one more seed kit (herbs) which I'm going to give a try and then I'm going to give up on this, and I'm not going to buy another set of bulbs even though it's advised.  If you want alot of leaves which you do not consume, then this is the seed kit for you.  I, on the other hand, wanted something to use in the kitchen.

review/summary: Did not sprout
review/text: Bought this for my daughter-in-law, who is from Japan. She was excited to be able to grow fresh Japanese herbs indoors. Unfortunately, a couple of the pods never sprouted, and the others that did took such a long time and ultimately ended up dying shortly after coming up. I have purchased other seed kits from Aerogrow and have had great success. This one was a dud. After the fact, I did some research and found that others had marginal success, so not sure if it was something we did, or just a bad batch of seeds. Amazon was great about refunding the full purchase price, and I thought about purchasing another to see if we would have better luck, but decided against it based on the few reviews I read. Maybe others will have better luck.

review/summary: greens are not growing
review/text: My package arrived quickly, but was not packaged well.  (Squished)  The salad greens, which I started 4 weeks ago, began to grow and then whithered and are now dying.  This is the 4th kit I have done and I have checked everything on my end.  I know I did everything right and I never had a problem with any others.  (2 bought at stores and 1 bought on line/different vender) Not sure what the problem is, but I'm guessing the kit was old.  I guess that is my fault for not checking the date and have since thrown the box away.  Will be more careful in the future buying kits.

review/summary: Joray Apricot Fruit Rolls & Amazon.com are the BEST.
review/text: I've been eating, actually devouring & loving, Joray Apricot fruit rolls since the late 1960's. I'm presently 46 and I love them as much today as I did when I unfurled my first roll nearly 40 year's ago. In my humble opinion, they're the best fruit snack I've ever had the arrant pleasure of savoring. One further note of interest; the Joray Apricot fruit rolls have been difficult to locate of late. I've searched my local super-markets, as well as continuously perused the Web, and occasionally have been fortunate enough to locate a box. Amazon.com, thus far, remains the only trustworthy website I'd buy from. Other sites I've ordered from failed to deliver my orders which ranged from one box to five boxes. If you're like me and you're addicted to these fine fruit snacks, do yourself a huge favor and purchase them from Amazon.com. And it's not like I'm being paid for rendering Amazon.com kudos for a job well done, as well as for their professionalism, with regard to dealing with the public at large and for offering, actually gauranteeing, swift delivery. Amazon deserves to be commended for providing a fantastic product, as does Joray, and I thank them both..!!!<br /><br />[...]

review/text: Joray Fruit Rolls are the best fruit rolls out on the market. Junk-food roll-ups don't compare. I've been eating these my entire life; my favorites being watermelon and cherry. I eat one and then I cant stop, I eat 10 more without thinking twice. I love the great candy taste and I know it is healthy for me because it is made out of real fruit. This is a legit fruit snack that is great for everyone. Joraycandy dot com is their new website, check em out.
