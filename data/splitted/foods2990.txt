review/summary: Worked wonders for silent acid reflux baby
review/text: Our son developed acid reflux when he was 2 months old.  We put him on Zantac.  No improvement.  Mylicon drops.  No improvement.  Tried other formulas - we've now gone through Good Start, Enfamil AR, Similac RS, Allimentum and finally now Nutramigen which was given to me by a mother of 4 who heard about my son's acid reflux problem and immediately sent over her last two cans to me.  At first he didn't like the taste, so we mixed 1/2 Similac RS with Nutramigen.  He started eating and no screaming or arching his back.  He reverted back to the happy, eating baby he used to be.  It's been almost 4 days now and hopefully this will last.  He went from eating 22 ozs a day to 34oz a day!

review/summary: Great Formula
review/text: My baby had problems with other formulas until we started with this one.  He has done very well with this.  I think it's important to know that babies with allergies can do well on this formula.  Make sure you consult your doctor before you switch.  Yes this is expensive, but I've found that it's well worth the price in the comfort of my baby.

review/summary: Awesome for Allergies!
review/text: Definitely don't use reviews as your basis to switch your baby to a different formula. I have 4 children, 2 of which were on Nutramigen/Alimentum and One was on Neocate. All for severe allergies. It only helps with Colic if it comes from allergies to foods. If your child has trouble, definitely try different bottles and nipples and different consistancies of the formula you are on first and then talk to baby's doctor as well when you think you may want to switch to a different type of formula. They will eventually get older and it will get easier. This product helps settle their little bellies if they need it.

review/summary: Best formula for babies with alergies
review/text: This is the only formula that our twins can take for last six months. They are allergic to protein in cow milk, so we tried everything and this formula worked great. We do buy this from babies r us because for every 12 cases, you get one free if you have rewards account with them.We use about 3 cans a day..... It is very expensive but worth it!!!

review/summary: Wasted Money
review/text: I purchased this product from a craft store because it seemed to be exactly what I needed, according to the package description. I have used luster dust before, and this is totally different. Luster dust is fine in texture, and can be mixed with liquid to make a 'paint' for your projects. Of course, it can be used dry as well.<br />This stuff is more coarse in texture, and does NOT mix with liquids. It stays gritty in texture, and makes a clumpy mess. Used dry, it did not dust my fondant or gumpaste decorations at all; just fell right off (I attempted to use it on fresh decorations AND dry - same results).<br />I will definitely stick with luster dusts from now on. Maybe, at some point, I will try to find a use for the package of shimmer that I already have. (Maybe sprinkle/dust it on freshly iced cupcakes?) I hate to waste the money.<br />If anyone has any ideas for this stuff, I'd be happy to hear them.

review/text: I bought a couple dozen of these organic tomato pastes in a jar.  I do not know if the variety of tomato is different, but these are different from the darker red pastes from regular and organic cans that I have tried.  Bionaturae jars have brighter red tomato pastes with a fresher, somewhat sweeter taste.  Since these are the only BPA-free jars, I will continue to buy these to make my own ketchup, pasta sauce, pizza sauce, etc.  I hope that they can transition to food-safe plastic lids instead of the metal ones.  Plastic lids would allow the jars to be reused, too.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/summary: WOW its edible.
review/text: You heard me right; this stuff is made to be eaten. We own a Siberian Husky and he can down a bowl of this in less time than it takes to slap a mongoose (That saying sounds prettier in Mandarin Chinese). But honestly I put the food in he eats it and within 24 hours I have a mound of puppy dung in the backyard. It's almost like clockwork, you could set your watch to it if you needed, like say if there was an electromagnetic pulse that took out all your digital clocks (heck I guess it would take out all your electronics as well), or the sun didn't come up. Both of which are worse case scenarios.<br /><br />Speaking of worse case scenarios, if you ever run out of food, and it has happened, I mean really Lucky Lady was supposed to win in the fourth my guy swore it up and down, last time I get advice on Horse racing from a guy living in a box but I digress, just take a cup of Beneful put some Ketchup or Catsup (either will work its a personal taste issue at this point) on it and go to town, I also found that you can boil it and fry it, and wow does it taste good, You can also cook it Paula Deen Style but it requires a pound of butter. However I think the best way it to just pop it in your mouth straight from the bag.<br /><br />If you are looking for good food for your dog, or just a snack in between meals, or heck even as a meal, Purina Beneful Puppy food may be just what you are looking for.

review/summary: This crap made my puppy sick, don't buy!!!!
review/text: I recently purchased this food for my 5 month old black lab mix. When I first adopted him several months ago, I started him on Wellness puppy food. The two issues I had with the Wellness was that, you could only buy it from Petco and of course the price, I was paying $51 for a 30 pound bag. I felt that I could do better. So, I did some research and it seemed that the beneful was the way to go, I bought a bag of the beneful and fed it to my puppy, well, within a few days he was crapping all over the house. Being concerned for his health, but also getting tired of picking up puppy poop, I contacted my local pecto for help and spoke to the trainer, she urged me to immediately stop feeding the puppy the beneful and go back to the Wellness dog food. She even called the beneful "The Worst Dog food out there". So I took her advice and immediately saw results in my puppy, he was back to being his healthy, happy, and playful self. I have learned a lesson, not to cut corners on dog food. If buying more expensive food is going to mean a happy puppy, I will spend the money.<br /><br />Update: 1\20\2011<br /><br />I read other review on similar beneful products, other people seemed to have similar problems. Many complained about their dogs losing fur, getting rashes, and problems with "gas". It appears that this product uses a dye to color the bits of food, I remember when my puppy was sick, I noticed his stool was a red color, I was first scared that it was blood, but apparently it was the dye, and Im guessing he was allergic to the food. Definately BE AWARE of this product!!!!

review/summary: PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT LIKE PIZZA CRUST
review/text: BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are expecting a rising pizza crust, such as what you might get from standard pizza dough, then you'll need to look elsewhere.  That being said, these are pretty good in their own right.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I rather like the way these pizza crusts taste after being toasted up.  They soak in flavor from sauce or cheese well, without becoming soggy or wilted.  They have a good bread flavor on their own, also, and make a good base for a BBQ chicken or BBQ pulled pork pizza.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />I think the texture is the only thing I can complain about with these - the Schar Crusts are a little more dense than I would like.  However, this is a usual complaint about all gluten-free items.<br /><br />SIZE<br />These are definitely personal pizza sized.  With sauce, cheese, and toppings on this crust, I can usually eat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pizza on my own.<br /><br />USES/ VERSATILITY<br />If you can expand your mind beyond making just pizza with red sauce and mozzarella, then these crusts are quite useful.  I personally love them with some BBQ sauce and chicken.  They make a nice bread/ carb base for anything I might otherwise eat on flatbread.  As a gluten-free option, these crusts are a wonderful thing to have at your disposal.

review/text: This is a very tasty sauce for chicken, as should be expected. But the more amazing use of it is for ribs!! First score the ribs with a knife all over. Drench with some red or white COOKING wine. Let sit. Lightly coat with Canola oil, and dust with herbs. Then slather-on the the whole bottle of the Butter Chicken Sauce on the top of the ribs covering them completely. Put in a cooking dish in the oven at 360, and cook for two hours. The ribs are falling-off-the-bone amazing. With the perfect taste and texture, so moist and not fatty. Better than most ribs I have had "out".

So when I was looking for a quick and easy dinner at the grocery store and found a jar of this stuff, I was pretty excited to take it home. Man, was I let down. This tasted more like barbecue sauce than butter chicken! I even added peppers, onions, curry powder, and cayenne in attempts to make it better. Nope. Just spicy barbecue sauce.

review/text: When I think of butter chicken, I think of a smooth, creamy, almost sweet sauce with complex but subtle flavors.  This sauce, while it tastes pretty good and is easy to use on chicken, tastes nothing like any butter chicken I've ever had.  It tastes more like a red enchilada sauce (yes, as in Mexican food!) with a little bit of Indian spices added in.  The flavors are too strong, the texture is thicker and not as creamy, and the mild sweetness is missing.

Takes less than<br />15 minutes start to finish. This is an extremely mild starter sauce and by itself needs<br />salt and pepper to get going, but the finished product is up to you. A kitchen staple for<br />quick and tasty meals.<br /><br />The best thing I've found you can do with this, is combine it with the Patak's Hot Curry<br />Sauce to simmer chicken in, its amazing. "Smart shoppers" can find this locally for around<br />$3.

review/summary: Excellent drink for runners
review/text: I am a serious runner (1200 miles per year). Running in warm weather puts extra demands on runners, including the need to replenish electrolytes and hydrate more frequently. Gatorade G2 is an excellent way to do this. Unlike regular Gatorade, which is filled with sugar, a 20oz bottle of G2 has only 12g of sugar, which is more than sweet enough for me. It also has enough electrolytes to supplement the electrolyte tablets by Hammer Nutrition (which I have reviewed on Amazon) that I take before I head out in warmer weather.<br /><br />At the beginning of my run I pour a 20 oz.chilled bottle of G2 into my Smart Source stainless steel water bottle (which I have reviewed on Amazon), and then place that in a Nathan Quickdraw (which I have reviewed on Amazon) to carry the bottle. A 20 oz bottle usually lasts me about an hour in really hot weather, after which I buy another 20 oz bottle at a convenience store on my route for my second hour of running.<br /><br />Drinking G2 is far superior to drinking plain water to hydrate because besides electrolytes, you get carbohydrates and potassium.<br /><br />I have tried different flavors and the Orange is one of my favorites. I buy a pack of 8 at my local supermarket on sale for six dollars.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a great drink for runners in warm weather. Shop for price.

review/summary: A great low calorie way to replenish your body after a hard workout!
review/text: I do a lot of work in the yard and you can really burn off the energy and also get hot.  This Gatorade G2 low calorie drink replenishes what your body has lost after hours of  hard work.  I like it as I am a diabetic and this lower sugar version is helpful after a long workout in the yard or in my gym.<br /><br />Each 32 ounce bottle contains 4 servings of 8 ounces each.  That is 5 grams of sugar at a total of 20 calories per serving.  It is a great way to stay rehydrated and keep you going strong.  It recharges your energy without going overboard on the sugar.<br /><br />There are several flavors available and this is one of my favorites.  It helps me recover faster than drinking just water or drinking a carbonated beverage. The lemon-lime flavor is also good!<br /><br />This is a good product and I recommend it to you!

review/summary: Rich Even When Made With Water
review/text: I first stumbled onto Land O'Lakes Cocoa Variety Packs at my local branch of a national warehouse store.  As some other reviewers have noted, in retail stores this product is treated as a seasonal item, so by the time the winter holidays have passed, you may not be able to just run out and purchase it.  It's a pity that it sells for so much more online because it is a really delicious hot cocoa.<br /><br />All the included varieties are made with real powdered milk, which makes such a difference in your final cup.  There aren't many instant cocoas that can compete with homemade, but this is one that might.  The varieties included in your pack do seem somewhat inconsistent, since different sellers claim the same "7 Variety Pack" but have different pictures and item descriptions.  The sampler I had contained Supreme, Arctic White, White Chocolate with Peppermint, Caramel, Raspberry, Dark Chocolate and Vanilla.  The other flavors that appear (either in product descriptions or photos) are Tiramisu, Graham, Cinnamon and Mint.  Generally speaking, all of the mixes are quite good.  I found the Dark to be a bit too dark for my tastes, and the Arctic White a bit too sweet; I solved the problem by mixing the two powders together, half a packet of each per cup, and loved the result.<br /><br />Another nice thing about these Land O'Lakes Cocoa Packs is that the individual pouches are all tin, not just paper, so they stay fresh a long time.  In my house, they didn't last a terribly long time regardless, but the last cups were just as creamy and warming as the first ones. I highly recommend trying out the Variety Packs.  They're perfect for large gatherings (just add hot water!) and there really aren't any bad flavors.

review/text: I bought this multi pack to bring home to Europe in Christmas, and we are loving them all! We have good chocolate here but this is a lot of fun with the different flavors. The chocolate flavor is rich in all of them, and then they have a twist of the specific flavor that makes it really special. I like these cocoas more than any other brand I've tried in this kind of sachets. I totally recommend it, even if it is a bit pricey, it makes a great gift or something to have at home to treat yourself in this (not so cold) winter.

review/summary: Good cocoa, not my favorite flavors
review/text: I'm a big fan of Land O' Lakes Cocoa--it usually makes a richer cup than your average grocery-store hot chocolate.  I like the individual packets, especially for mixing with coffee to make a poor-girl's (or poor-man's) mocha.  I have previously purchased a different variety pack from amazon that I was a big fan of, but it is no longer offered.  With this order, my variety pack came with Chocolate Supreme, French Vanilla, Tiramisu, Chocolate Graham, Arctic White, Double Fudge, and Chocolate and Raspberry.  I've always found the Arctic White and French Vanilla to be a little bland, but they're nice for mixing into flavored coffee.  I haven't had the Double Fudge yet, and I am hoping that it will be as rich as the Dark Chocolate, which is my favorite and sadly missing from this collection.  All in all, I would give five stars if the flavors offered were more to my taste, but for the Arctic White and French Vanilla lovers out there, this is probably a 5 star variety pack.

With Shan spice mixes though, you can use what you like, so if you're leery of the heat, I would suggest just using 1/4-1/2 a packet first. If you want it hotter next time, increase the amount.  I'm surprised at the price for this - we get these mixes locally for 99 cents a box.

review/summary: UNSALTED and 240 mg. of sodium per serving?
review/text: I'm only giving one star because I believe there's some funny business going on with their listed ingredients. As I am always on the lookout for a decent tasting vegetable stock or bouillion that isn't loaded with sodium or additives, I snatched a box of this "unsalted" veg. stock off the shelf in my local supermarket when I saw it. Then I noticed that the sodium content was 240 mg. per cup. I know that vegetables contain a certain amount of natural sodium--some more than others--but there's no way that THAT much sodium can be attributed to just the vegetables. A lot of companies lately have been sneaking salt into their products under the guise of "Natural Flavor" because technically, that's what salt is so they can get away with it. And since this product does contain "Natural Flavor" as one of it's ingredients, I'd bet the farm that's EXACTLY what they did.

He also has food allergies, so we're careful about what kinds of food we give him.  When we had to travel out of town for several days, we needed a solution, and happened upon Spot's Stew (both canned and dry).  He loves it!  We still cook for our spoiled boy, but we can now supplement his diet with a quality dry food that has the nutrients he needs.  I wish it were less expensive, but our fur-baby is worth it even at double the price.

review/summary: Does not dry overnight; thick gel hard to apply evenly
review/text: Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make "ladybug spots and antennae," which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug "heads") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.

Regarding the consistency, the squash is not quite a solid mass like solid packed pumpkin, but is much thicker than the kind of squash you can buy frozen.  It requires a knife or spoon to get it out of the can because of the thickness.  After reading the review that said the squash was liquid, I expected something runny, that would pour out of the can; not so at all.  The flavor is very good and mild.

review/summary: fine in a pinch, but can get cheaper locally
review/text: i wanted to find a quick alternative to fresh butternut squash to use for making soup, so i picked up a box of these cans. as others have mentioned, a lot of the cans showed up dented, but since they weren't pierced, it wasn't a deal breaker. the flavor wasn't as good as a fresh squash, which i also kind of expected, but it had a bit of a weird bitterness to it. maybe it was a metallic taste from the can, but it was noticeable in the finished soup.<br /><br />i don't think i'd buy these again, and will just stick to making the soup with fresh squash from my local farmer's market.<br /><br />also, found out later that my local target sells these for $1.99 a can instead of the 2.36/can i paid from amazon.

review/text: Our Thanksgiving 2009 menu included a repeat of a butternut squash topped with gingersnaps casserole from 2008 but our local grocery had discontinued the item. Thanks to Amazon we were able to get a 12-pack case in time for Thanksgiving dinner. The product is excellent, the price was right, the recipe was easy and the casserole was delicious .... and we have enough left for Christmas dinner!

review/summary: Expected something else
review/text: I purchased this product for two reasons.  First, that the product is organic.  Second, that butternut squash is labor intensive to puree due to the thick skin.  So, for those reasons, this is a great product.  However, I felt the puree was really liquidy.  I assumed it would be more like pumpkin puree.  Having a soft solid texture.  Also, it has a little twang after-taste.  I felt the sweet potato puree had a similar after-taste.  I was not familar with this type of puree product.  I had always used Libby's canned pumpkin puree or homemade puree.  Therefore, it is possible that my disappointment came from product comparison.

review/summary: Tasted Metallic
review/text: I bought this butternut squash to make pies and squash soup for the Holidays. Sadly, out of the case of 12, only 2 cans were useable. The others were dented beyond belief, and the two that I used had "puree" as thick as playdough. It did not mix well with the half & half, sugar & spices, although I was using the soup recipe provided on the side of the can, omitting the onion. So, I made 1 pie & 1 batch of soup. Both tasted very metallic and left a bad, twangy aftertaste in your mouth. No one could finish their slice of pie because of the metallic taste. What a waste of money this was. This is a shame, too, because canned squash is so hard to find. Next time, I'll read the reviews before purchasing a food product. I will not buy this product again and I cannot recommend it to others.

The espresso is strong yet smooth, sweet without bitterness, and had nice thick crema. I haven't enjoyed an espresso this good in a long time, but this was a pleasure to sip.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Green Mountain Coffee Extra Bold Espresso Blend, but I have to admit that the Dolce Gusto Espresso wins this battle.<br /><br />This would also make a nice base for homemade coffee beverages. At 44 cents per serving, this is not only inexpensive but makes a nice afternoon pick-me-up drink.

review/text: While I loved my Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee maker, I really didn't care much for the milk capsules so I'd substitute real milk and added in a little flavored syrup. I ended up with a great cup of coffee but was annoyed that I had to pay for the milk capsule that I never used. I was so excited when I found these individual espresso capsules. The espresso is a little weak when made as directed, but a smaller cup of coffee tastes as good as from the coffee shop.

I don't have a fancy machine and don't know how to make it anyway. This Nescafe machine makes a pretty nice cup for a home machine. Simple enough that you can overlook some slight flavor preferences in exchange for such ease.

review/summary: Not bitter at all and plenty delicious!
review/text: I have been making Cappuccinos for about a year with my Dolce Gusto Piccolo, and decided to see if I could save money by ordering the "Espresso" capsules and frothing my own milk in my Capresso frothPro, which I already had from trying to make Cappuccinos in another espresso maker that didn't do foam well, so I bought this milk foamer to do the trick and it is wonderful. After brewing my Dolce Gusto Espresso, I finish it off with the milk I foamed and then I sprinkle a little cinnamon/sugar mixture that I keep in a shaker on top of the foam. Everyone thinks it looks very professional and the taste is fabulous! There is no bitterness with this espresso capsule, which I was surprised to find. The crema is lovely and the aroma is heavenly, so I was so happy to find that it tastes as good as it looks! I like a mug-sized cup of coffee, so I usually use two capsules, which is why I decided to try using the Espresso capsules instead of the Latte or Cappuccino ones, where I would need 4 capsules (2 coffee & 2 milk). What would cost me $4 at Starbucks is now costing me 88 cents for the double, and when I only want a single, it only costs me 44 cents!

I love it, it is delicious, and sometimes I add it to the Caramel Macchiatto for an extra kick.<br /><br />My only complaint of using pods is that the used pods leak in my trash can.  I have to squeeze out the excess water from the pods so my trash bag doesn't leak all over my kitchen floor when taking it outside.

review/text: I tried this at a tasting as I'm currently in the market for a machine that makes more variety than just drip coffee. However, I was a bit disappointed with this espresso. It was a decent cup of coffee, don't get me wrong, but it was just on par with a strong brew made via drip brewing. It did not really taste like a real espresso even though it looked authentic with the crema top. Also the taste certainly did not make it stand out from any other "premium" coffee brew. I guess I was expecting more from a  brewing system that only offers one choice of espresso.

review/summary: Smooth shot of espresso; lacks some flavor.
review/text: I have to say that Nescafe Dolce Gusto left me pleasantly surprised again, this time with their espresso. Your espresso is ready in seconds, with a nice crema layer. If you draw just a shot-sized amount, it is a good-flavor (a little weak) shot of espresso. If you fill a cup, it is an Americano. I was nervous that passing more volume would cause a bitter drink as this is what happens if I pull too big of a shot on my espresso maker, and surprisingly enough, no bitterness. Just a good-tasting Americano. The flavor of the espresso/americano however is just a bit lacking. They went safe on the blend and ended up with a drink that's a little boring. Nevertheless, it is so easy to use and so inexpensive (50 cents per drink) that I bet my espresso machine (and coffee pot) will be getting less and less use. Overall, I didn't expect much from pod-based espresso and was pleasantly surprised though not blown away.<br /><br />This has, nevertheless, grown to become my most-often-used dolce gusto pod.

review/summary: Speedy, Adequate Espresso
review/text: I own and use regularly an espresso machine. The Nescafe Dolce Gusto machine isn't that. It is a single-cup brewer. What it is, however, is a solution when time is in the way.<br /><br />My home is open, and friends know they are welcome to stop by without much notice. The beauty of this is I can enjoy the company of wonderful people. The challenge is that my time to prepare is minimal. Using a single cup system, I meet their needs, while focusing on hosting duties. Given time, I can grind beans, whip cream, and more. Without time, guests can still enjoy a better than average espresso.<br /><br />The term 'espresso' is used here loosely, but accurately. Unlike some single cup systems, high pressure is used to make the espresso. Is it the same as a standard espresso machine? No. It is not that sophisticated. Still, for what is asked of this machine, the espresso flavor is very good. There is a nice crema, and the roast is medium to slightly dark. Those looking for a stronger flavor ought look elsewhere, but, for the average chain coffee house customer, this will be more than adequate.<br /><br />A better solution for those looking for speed with a more authentic espresso should invest in a standard espresso machine and ESE pods. The pods are single-serve, ready-made. However, if you own the Nescafe Dolce Gusto machine, and love its convenience (great for other flavors), give these a shot. Keep them handy when friends honor your home with an unexpected visit.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: I'm not one for the nuances of coffee flavors.  I drink coffee and I drink espresso, and unless it has some kind of "flavor" in it (like hazelnut coffee) then I don't notice a difference between, say, Starbucks espresso and Nespresso.  I don't notice a difference between all the various Nespresso varieties.<br /><br />So, in our ongoing Dolce Gusto tests, on Friday I had a 'hot drink' made with the coffee capsule for Latte Macchiato, but without the milk capsule for it.  I just wanted to see how it was as a standalone.  It was all right, no big deal, and I came to Amazon to write my review.<br /><br />Later in the day I decided to have my Espresso capsule and see how it was.  This was about 3 hours after the first drink.  I brewed it for my standard 23 seconds and drank it at a reasonable pace.  Wow.  It was not any different in FLAVOR than the others (Nespresso, the Latte Macchiato coffee capsule, or even the Caffe Lungo capsule) - at least not to me - but I got the jitters about half an hour later and they continued for about four hours!  I didn't change anything else in my daily routine so I'm guessing it was the Espresso.<br /><br />Now, on the first day the machine got here I had an Espresso and it was great, and I didn't get jittery.  So perhaps it was simply the combo of the two drinks.  Tomorrow I am going to test it again and see what happens.  But I think the Espresso capsules are off my list.

review/summary: Just like the gas stations serve
review/text: My husband, who is not a coffee gourmet, was excited to try this.  His response after the first cup was "it tastes just like at the gas stations".  Not impressive, but fast and easy, so it gets 3 stars for convience without the convenience store.

review/summary: Does not work with Nespresso
review/text: I purchased this product after entering Nespresso in the search field.  Unfortunately this product has nothing to do with Nespresso except it is made by Nestle.  It does not work with Nespresso.  It might be a good product. But beware that it is not compatible with Nespresso.

review/summary: I have an espresso habit of about 7 shots a day.
review/text: I bought the Circolo because I like the way it looks. The taste, however, is never quite up to snuff.  The flavors are just a bit off<br />They do pack quite a kick. So that's nice.

review/summary: Terrible...  -|-  ...elbirreT
review/text: I found this flavor to be undrinkable.  I even tried brewing a green mountain coffee in my Keurig K-cup machine and adding a shot of espresso as you would get at a coffee shop.  This made my normally enjoyable Green Mountain coffee undrinkable as well.  I will continue to try to find a way to enjoy the remaining cups of espresso.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: Let me start by saying I'm not an espresso guy.  I like cream and sugar in my coffee so espresso always seemed to strong to me.  That said, I'm obligated to review this product but it's not for me.  I wound up making coffee out of it by simply filling the cup with more than 2oz.  It's fair coffee, but making plain  coffee in a 150 machine is kind of a waste.
