review/summary: Not for POWERFUL chewers
review/text: Ordered this item because it was advertised for POWERFUL chewers. Received it yesterday. Within an hour our 60 pound, 1.5 year old pit bull has the center green portion more than half eaten. She also managed to get off a few of the nylon nubs on the end. I would not recommend this item for powerful or extreme chewers.

review/summary: To each, his own
review/text: To each, his own!  That phrase basically says that each one of us is different and as such, our preferences also tend to differ.  This idea applies not only to humans, but to our canine friends as well.  And when buying toys for your dog, that is an important consideration to keep in mind.  Some dogs will love this toy, while some will simply ignore it.  That is a frustrating part of trying to keep your dog entertained.  Because you see, buying toys for your dog can be just as much of a hit-or-miss proposition as buying a gift for a blind date.<br /><br />So what can you do, to avoid spending money on a pricey item that your dog might not like?  There are no guarantees, but you can take the time to watch your dog carefully.  After some time, you will notice what types of toys captivate his attention.  Based on my observations over the years and owning different breeds, I have come to believe that the more impulsive individuals might not find entertainment with this toy.  However, those obsessive, focused types like you see in Rottweilers, German Shepherds, and Labradors would be delighted to chew on this for days.<br /><br />Impulsive dogs tend to be the types who do not like to play fetch.  They may chase the ball once, but pretty soon, their attention span is very quickly diverted elsewhere.  My current dog is like that.  He just does not like to spend a lot of time chewing on an item that does not break apart easily.  The only way to engage him for a prolonged period of time is to give him something that breaks apart easily (pressed rawhide) or something that dispenses food (Kong and Starmark treat dispensers).  He is just not the obsessive type who would spend a lot of time gnawing on a durable object.  He needs constant and frequent reinforcement to keep his attention from wandering away from the toy.  Your dog may like it, depending on his personality and his breed.<br /><br />Nylabone is a maker of high quality dog toys.  This is a quality item.  It is just unfortunate that my dog's attention span is too short to be entertained by these types of toys.  Ofcourse, I found out the hard (or the expensive) way.  I bought the toy and my dog ignored it!

review/summary: Dogs enjoy it, but no more than their other bones
review/text: We got this Nylabone because of the bacon flavor figuring our dogs would love it. They definitely like the bone and chew on it, but no more than their other bones (beef femur). I guess that's pretty good since a plastic bone holds its own against a real bone.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of -- this thing is kinda heavy. Might not be a big deal for your dog, but I have 2 dogs that like to wrestle for toys and also like to chew their bone while laying on the couch. When this thing gets dropped, especially on my hardwood floors, it is loud.

review/text: Our dog is a 80lb german shepherd mix. He is just over 2 years old and is a pretty aggressive chewer. We bought almost all of the "durachew" nylabones and this product is by far the best option, at least for our dog. He loves chewing on the edible ends and has been working on it for over an hour now without any damage to the toy. Just ordered 3 more while this 8 dollars off over 40$.

review/summary: Tough, Vegetarian, & dog loves it!
review/text: We have a 70lb German Shepherd / Akita mix.  When we first got her from the foster we tried all sorts of toys to keep her from chewing on furniture, but she only like the soft squeaky toys which she managed to destroy in minutes.  We finally found the Tuffy's Mega Ring (available on amazon) and she loves it.  The only problem was without something hard to chew on, she was developing plaque / tartar on her teeth.  A vet cleaning was $150+ so we look for alternative chew toys.  The dog came to us eating only vegetarian food, so we have maintained that (we tried giving her a rawhide, but she just left it alone).  I emailed Nylabone and they confirmed that this chew is 100% vegetarian; the "bacon flavor" is an aromatic that is not derived from animal products:<br /><br />Double Action� Chews ("DuraChew� Double Action� Chew", "DuraChew� Double Action� Chew - Round Ball", and "DuraChew� Double Action� Chew - Football"), "bended bone" and "stick" brand Nylabone products are unflavored, but contain a bacon aromatic in the ends to make them more attractive.<br />These products are flavored with a vegetarian (plant-derived) natural flavoring that does not contain any meat protein. Similar to "tofurkey" and "veggie-burgers," they have the meat flavor without the meat.<br /><br />Our dog has had the bone for about a month now and the plaque / tartar is nearly gone from her teeth thanks to this chew!

review/summary: Will not be buying this again!
review/text: I know that my 1 year old bulldog is an extreme chewer, so I bought him this toy.  I had read the reviews about the middle part being chewed off, but I didn't think that my dog would or could chew off the middle part, especially since he had different nylabones before and he loved chewing the part he was SUPPOSED to chew.  I WAS SO WRONG.  The first thing he did was chew up the middle part and had chewed pieces off in less than an hour.

review/summary: Best chew toy I've found!
review/text: When we got our dog, Sydney 3 years ago... I could not find a single thing that she would chew on that would last more than 10 minutes.<br /><br />I tried everything, until I found this!  It's definitely her favorite and every once in a while, I toss it in the dishwasher with her Kong and bowls to keep everything fresh.  I just bought another one for the first time because she's finally chewed through both sides.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who only wants to buy a chew toy every few years.

review/summary: Depends on the Dog
review/text: I originally purchased this for our black lab puppy because she could chew through everything and I needed the toughest toys I could find. This toy was one of the only toys she had that actually held up, so that is a huge plus for strong chewers! However, I purchased a smaller version for my 3 year old shih tzu and my chihuahua puppy and it pretty much got ignored. I think it is difficult for them to chew on. Also, these two dogs are not as strong chewers, so they have more stuffed animals and other toys around to choose from, where as our lab was not allowed to have stuffed animals because she shredded them. Overall, all three dogs preferred just a regular-looking nylabone to this one. The black lab had her regular nylabone chewed down to a tip, but it took her awhile to do that. I would only purchase this bone if your dog is a very strong chewer and you are having trouble keeping toys around for it, otherwise it may get ignored.

review/summary: Great for heavy chewer
review/text: MY GSD loves this bone.  Like most GSDs she absolutely destroys any normal non "K9" type of chew toy.  However these last a long time (9 mo at least) and don't form sharp edges until the chew has finally given it's all.  If you have a heavy chewer this is a great toy / chewer.  Be aware, it's heavy and when your dog drops it on your toe you'll know it.

review/summary: Yay!  Passed the pit chew test
review/text: I am so grateful for this chew.  My medium sized pit has gone through everything in minutes and he gets crazy OCD about chewing.  He tore the green nubs off in minutes and thought for sure this thing was dead meat, but after that he settled into going after the ends of the bone.  I am concerned with how sharp it gets but I keep checking it for blood and don't see any.. yet.  He's probably had an hour a day with it for a week and it's not much worse for wear.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: In 15 years, this has been the only bone / chew toy that my dogs could not destroy.  We dogsit and can have up to ten dogs in our home at any time.  Even the Rots and the Puppies can't destroy this chew toy.  They seem to enjoy carrying it around too.  The one downside is that we have nicknamed these bones "Bleeder Bones" because after a few years of chewing, they get very rough on the ends and when kicked in the middle of the night, can result in bloody toes.  Well worth the risk though, truly a great product for dogs!!

review/text: For whatever reason I have always been hesitant to buy nylabones for my German shepherd. With the introduction of a new German shepherd puppy into the household, I remembered what a hard time I had the first go round with chewing. We bought this toy from a local store since it was last minute before going to pick up the puppy, but I'll sure purchase many more (from Amazon, of course) now that I see how well it holds up and how much both my dogs like it! I'm sorry now that I waited so long to buy one in the first place!

review/text: Probably her favorite toy.  It is heavy yet she manages to walk around with it in her mouth like her prize.  She (57 lb. aggressive chewing golden retriever) works on it daily and it lasts a long time before it starts looking kind of nasty and unappetizing.  Not one single instance of even a small to medium size piece coming off, nothing ever bigger than a piece of uncooked rice.  I think it does help with scraping the teeth too.<br /><br />Her oral care routine is a little obsessive compulsive but it works.  Nylabones, CET rawhide chews, and Petz Life citrus spray.  Brushing isn't an option because of lack of patience by all involved parties.<br /><br />Great price on amazon as well.

review/text: I just got a little dog-a terrier cross who weighs fourteen pounds soaking wet. He is the most aggressive chewer I have ever owned. He goes through toys labeled "Battle Tested" and "For Large Dogs" in less than a day. Even worse, he swallows everything he bites off his toys. I didn't think a Nylabone would work for him because the really durable ones are so big but I was at my wit's end so I got him this toy. He loves it-he will lay there chewing on it for half an hour at a time and so far all he's managed to do is scuff up the ends a little. He also carries it around, despite its size, and sometimes even tosses it. He has a lot of fun with it and I finally have a toy he can play with.

review/text: This toy has held up tremendously well, but it does have a problem in design. Once your dog chews on it for a little bit, it seems to make some very sharp edges on the ends. The last time I saw my dog chewing on it, it left the bone covered in blood on both ends. Once I picked it up I quickly realized why. If it was made a bit softer I think the sharp edges created by chewing would not become a problem

review/text: We've searched for and tried just about every chew toy for our four year old Golden Retriever and he has torn through everything with ease...until this bone. He's had this toy longer than any other and it's quickly become his favorite. The other good news is that it has not developed any kind of nasty odor like many of the other toys we've tried but has kept a pretty fresh scent to this day (and I know this because he drops it on my lap ten times a day...). As hard as he's worked at it, he has not even been able to rip a tiny piece of the the thin green section off the center of the bone. I highly recommend this bone and just bought two more that should literally last us for the next year or more.

He destroys tennis balls in a matter of minutes, rips large Kong Wubbas apart as though they were paper, and murders stuffed animals with ease.  This bone, however, has lasted since I got him in February.  It was one of our first purchases and the look of happiness on his face while he chews on it is priceless! Since his brothers can never get it away from him, I've gotten 2 more.  They are heavy and make a lot of noise when dropped on the floor, but that is a small price to pay for a chew toy which can actually be chewed on!

review/text: I have been a fan of Nylabones ever since we got our Lab in 2008.  I heard questionable facts about raw hides, and didn't want to try them.  Nylabones are typically expensive, but always long lasting, and EXCELLENT quality.  This particular bone (Dura Chew Double Action Combo, Souper) is so awesome, and the price was excellent!  I seen this exact bone at PetSmart for double the price.  My Lab loves this bone.  It is a bit bigger than what we are used to, but she loves it and it is not too big at all.  Also recommend the "Big Chew" by Nylabone.

Of course, after we used it, we couldn't find it in the store anymore. A few months went by and we kept searching, then we thought, let's try Amazon! Glad we could find this here!! We'll be enjoying some nachos as soon as we get it!!

review/text: I would first like to thank all of the reviewers who mentioned the fishy smell. Knowing that it was an offputting smell did help me take the plunge in actually tasting the noodle. It really is tasteless, as I tasted the noodle before eatting it with sauce.  It's a wonderful canvas for the flavor of the sauce and absorbed the taste beautifully.  So cool that something like this exists for a diabetic that needs to lose weight!

review/text: I love these, but they do have a chewy texture and are better in Asian dishes then with regular pasta sauce.  There is a strange fishy smell when you open the package, but when rinsing and parboiling as directed the finished product does not taste fishy at all -even with just tomato sauce.  I will be eating these regularly.  Even my kids liked them.  My husband thought they were OK.  He is not thrilled with the texture but will eat them for the low calories.  I like the chewy texture.

There is something about the fluid these noodles are packed in, they have an EXTREMELY strong fish odor...even when i rinsed the noodles and boiled them for nearly 10 minutes, the smell was still there (even with some tomato sauce on them).  Seriously, the smell was horrid.  The consistency was strange too, but that i could get used too...the smell...no way.  :-(

If I remember correctly, I don't even think I risked giving it to my dog.  Despite the cost, I threw these in the trash.  In hind sight I probably should have found somewhere to donate them.  But I just wanted to get rid of those darn things!  Yuk! YuK! YUK!

review/text: I love pasta and am a pretty adventurous eater so I was eager to try these. What could be better, right?  Zero calorie pasta. Sounded to be good to be true.  Well, let me tell you, these "noodles" are perfectly awful.  I could get past the smell (which can be covered up) but not the texture.  These noodles had a seriously plastic-like consistency.  It's as if you cooked up a bunch strings from a tennis racket. Really.  They are hard and rubbery and so "un-food like" I couldn't eat them at all and I truly don't understand how anyone else could either.  Try them if you like, but they're definitely not for me.

review/text: I use these frequently.  Calorie and carbohydrate free, but just as filling as spaghetti.  Although they don't taste like standard pasta, they're a wonderful substitute for when you have carb cravings.  The fishy smell rinses right away and they absorb the flavor of the sauce.  A little on the strange side with texture - 'rubbery' sounds worse than it is, but I can't figure out another description.  Still really enjoy them.  I use udon seasoning packets or boullion usually, but pasta sauce works well. I find that if you rinse and prepare them, then allow to sit an hour or so to absorb the flavor, it works really well.  Toss them in the microwave and voila!  Great product.

The noodles are put in a solution that does smell 'fishy', BUT it says that and it also says to rinse in warm water for 3-5 minutes, not 15 seconds. Then it says to DRY them in paper towel or other. When you add to your meal or sauce, the noodles absorb that flavor.  The Miracle Noodle website is great for explaining the whole concept of the noodle. Is the texture different? YES, but to me it is worth the acquired feel.  You eat these noodles, you will not be hunger for the rest of the day, seriously!  And...let your imagination make recipes for you.  I do wish there were more recipes out there to find, but I just get creative.  Try a bag and see for yourself...BUT follow the directions and if any questions the Miracle Noodle website has an online chat... (No, I do not work for them, I just like the products).

review/text: I want to preface this review and say that if you want a really healthy alternative to pasta then you may want to try these. My husband really likes using these for a zero calorie option. I, on the other hand, will not eat them. They still have a fishy type taste and the texture is very different. No matter how we prepare them I can still taste the weirdness and would rather have the calories from real pasta. My husband has an easier time getting over the taste and taking them for what they are. For health nuts who can't or won't eat real pasta this would be a good product to try and see if its something that you enjoy.

review/summary: Great for weight loss
review/text: Let me start by saying that these are not like regular pasta noodles. There is a specific texture to these that is hard to describe. When you first open the package, there is a fishy smell. The easiest way to deal with this is to dump the bag into a strainer over the sink (hold your nose if fishy smells bother you) and rinse with water for about 30 seconds. Then put the noodles in a bowl of water with vinegar in it (about 3 or 4 cups of water and 1 or 2 tablespoons of vinegar) and let it soak for about 10 minutes. This gets rid of the fishy smell. After I do this I like to split the package in half, put one half in a paper towel-lined container in the fridge, and "saute" the other half with a small amount of olive oil. This will replace the "drying" that is recommended. Then I add a sauce like spaghetti or curry sauce and eat.<br />I can't say that I really enjoy eating them all that much, BUT replacing my lunchtime meal with these noodles has helped me to lose about 3 pounds already. They really fill you up quickly, and the fiber is very good for you. I did a lot of research before I tried them, because I had heard a lot of bad things about the smell and texture, and after trying them I can say that the benefits outweigh all that. They're really not that bad if you prepare them as above. I would recommend them if you are trying to cut your calories.

review/text: I am so Thankful that there are companies out there trying to make products for those of us, who need Low-Carb, Soy, Wheat, & Gluten Free.  These noodles really take on the taste of whatever you make.  But you must wash in warm water first for 3-5 minutes to get rid of fishy smell.  And it does go completely away.  If it dosn't you should call the company and let them know, because you may have gotten a bad batch or something.<br /><br />Now, the texture is more like Top Ramen noodles, which makes it perfect for soup. But I have also used it for other types of sauces. You just have to get use to the interesting texture like for Spegetti Sauce.<br /><br />These Noodles are a winner for me, and I will continues to use them, although, they are a bit expensive for a big family.  I hope as they become popular for, Low-Carb, Soy, Wheat, & Gluten Free Eaters, that the price will go down, and be more reasonable to buy.  Keep up the good work Miracle Noodles Company, and may other companies pick up on the idea of making more prodcuts that are Low-Carb, Soy, Wheat, & Gluten Free too.

review/text: I am a fanatic of authentic Asian cuisines. No American-Asian foods...I want the real thing and have been cooking and eating authentic Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai cooking for many years.  These noodles are very comparable to bean thread (mung bean noodles) aka glass noodles, vermicelli noodles, etc. They are virtually calorie-less and carb-less. Great for dieting.  If you are looking for a western/Italian style noodle, you'll probably be disappointed.  However, if you enjoy authentic Asian soups, stir-fry's, etc, you will be delighted with these noodles.  For those 'steak and potatoes' eaters, you may not enjoy this product.  I think they're great! But I also like, squid, sushi, sashimi, and all sorts of Asian dishes that might turn off many western palates.

review/summary: Nobody reads 3-star reviews, but I'll try to be helpful anyway.
review/text: When the five packs arrived they were much smaller than I expected, so I made one large spaghetti casserole with meatballs. Like others mentioned it had a fishy smell at first, but after cooking it there was no trace of the smell. The casserole was pretty good, although the texture was somewhat chewier than you would expect from normal spaghetti, and you could tell you weren't eating the usual processed carbohydrates. Given the high price for a small amount of noodles I don't see this as a viable diet alternative -- I would have to spend way too much to replace my normal noodle intake. Fine then, I'll eat less and exercise more.<br /><br />A note about making a large casserole - YOU CAN NOT FREEZE THESE NOODLES!  I froze the leftovers, and when I thawed some out a couple of weeks later the noodles had turned into a desiccated rat's nest. It was like eating a knotted ball of butcher's twine. Blech.

review/summary: These are not normal noodles
review/text: This is not normal pasta. This a flavorless, odorless, spongy-textured dietary fiber in noodle form. It's a US-branded Shiritaki noodle, made of glucomannan.<br /><br />Why do people say it smells? Because it's a japanese product, and the packing fluid that smells neutral to the japanese smells fishy to us. However, rinse the noodles in a strainer thoroughly, parboil them for a minute, and the smell is gone. There is absolutely no fishy odor or flavor (or ANY odor or flavor, for that matter) to properly rinsed and parboiled Shiritaki noodles.<br /><br />These noodles just add texture and filling to your meal. Add them to soup or stir fry, serve them with grilled meat... they're an excellent complement to a carb-free or low-calorie diet. Just don't expect them to taste like spaghetti. They make you feel full, and the fiber is good for you.<br /><br />The noodles are totally fine stored at room temperature for a month or two. They last even longer in the fridge.<br /><br />Some Shiritaki noodles have tofu in addition to the glucomannan, and therefore have calories. This particular brand, however, does not.<br /><br />Shiritaki noodles will not substitute in your favorite Italian dish. They're much better paired with various Asian recipes and spices.

review/text: I too made the mistake of buying a bunch of these horrible "noodles" and threw away almost all of them.  I am not a picker eater, I like most any food, but I could not stomach the texture of these noodles!  No matter how much you chew them, they just bounce around on your teeth like rubber. I tried them in soup, with stir fry, and with pasta sauce - all disgusting.  Don't commit to buying a whole box of these, look for them at Central Market or an Asian store and just buy one bag.

review/summary: Added this to our culinary arsenal
review/text: My spouse and I were expecting something like a dried noodle that would need to be boiled to absorb water, but these things come already hydrated, soaking in a bag of fluid.  This seems inefficient in terms of transporting the product, and I wonder if it is necessary to pack this way, but that isn't really what this review should be about.<br /><br />We used these noodles with stir-fried veggies (onions, red peppers, mushrooms, and green beans) and a thai-style peanut sauce.  We went with this sauce because other reviewers suggested the product seemed a little fishy, and thai cuising makes use of fish sauce, so it felt like it could be complementary.  It was excellent.<br /><br />Do not expect the noodles to be a pasta, despite their appearance.  They have a different consistency.  Someone else suggested chewy like squid tentacles and that doesn't seem too far from the mark.  We also were reminded of the consistency of spaghetti squash, if you are familiar with that plant. As for flavor, there isn't much, though maybe there is something subtly fishy (or was that the power of suggestion?).  In addition to adding texture, its functions in your meal revlove around its ability to act as vehicle which other flavors (sauces) can cling.<br /><br />Nutritionally, it contributes soluble fiber and little else, as far as I can tell.  We are calorie concious in our meal prep and decided that there is a place for this product in our cooking arsenal.  Its value may be more enhanced for you if you restrict gluten in-take.  Even if we were not calorie concious, we appreciate the unique texture the product has, as eating is a multi-sensory experience.  Vive la difference.

review/summary: MIRACLE NOODLE STOMACH ISSUES
review/text: after you get used to the texture and smell, conceptually the product is great but- FOR ME- the burdens outweigh any benefits when you can't move because digestion (bathroom, bloating, gas, and paiiinnnn in the stomach all over) is such an issue. 300Lb gorilla sitting a top your chest and stomach....It seemed to be this brand in particular for me but all of them seem to have the same ingredients except the Tofu Shirataki which has tofu in it and I seemed to be able to stomach better.<br /><br />It may just be me, but boy- I just cannot eat these

review/text: I have never written a review for any product, but I always read reviews of products I'm not sure about.  I had to throw these noodles away.  I followed the directions on the package as written.  The smell was terrible.  I cooked them and then added them to pasta sauce.  I ate several bites trying to like them.  Finally, I gave up and threw the rest of my dinner away.  My stomach was upset for the rest of the evening.  I threw the rest of my order away as well.  Just thinking about the way they looked and smelled makes me nauseous.  Don't waste your money.  If you're wanting real pasta just eat skinny for a few days then enjoy the real thing.

review/text: I first learned of the noodles through a health publication and I've had them in sukiaki at an oriental restaurant.  The noodles are just as described.  A great low calorie alternative. The smell of the noodles bagged in fluid was a concern at first but just follow the directions and all is well.  I would have liked a few recipes included with their typed instructions.  I recommend the product and the merchant.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: As others have mentioned, the texture of these noodles is something unlike anything I have ever put in my mouth. Also, others have mentioned that the horrifying smell can be washed away but that was not so for me. Once I caught a whiff of these fishy noodles, it was as if it was emblazoned into my olfactory senses. It was as if nothing could erase that odor, and it came back to me as I tried to choke these down, following a variety of recommendations I had seen here. I had ordered a large quantity of these noodles thinking it sounded wonderful and lived to regret it. I felt terrible about throwing the remaining packages out but what was I to do? I felt that if I donated it to a local food bank, there would be many needy people out there scarred by the horrible memory of those noodles. So in the trash they went.

review/text: Yes, when you open them they have a little fishy smell to them but once you wash them you no longer smell it. Do not try to eat them plain...they have no taste and have a strange texture. BUT if you cook them in some broth they are yummy! I have done all kinds of things with them...mostly adding them to a stir fry. Try them if you are trying to eat a low cal diet...you don't have to starve...they fill you up!! I'm happy with them just don't expect them to be like a reg noodle...the have more of the texture of seaweed...but hey, I love seaweed salad:)

review/summary: I like them
review/text: I first heard about these noodles when Nigella Lawson was raving about them and as she's lost so much weight my "miracle weight loss" antennae immediately pricked up!  I'm currently on the Acai Berry capsules and thought I'd speed up the process with whatever else I could lay my hands on.  I initially ordered 5 packs thinking they'd last me ages when in actual fact it's more like 5 servings - one serving per pack.  I have a really strong sense of smell and after hearing how awful they smelt was prepared for the worst.  However I don't think they smell that bad and certainly after rinsing them thoroughly with cold water unless you get up close and personal with them, they don't smell at all.  So far I've stirred them into soup and a stir fry and I really like them.  I quite like the al dente texture too and they're very filling.  The only mistake I made was microwaving them for a minute in water and they went all dry and brittle and didn't taste good at all so stirring them into hot food and gently heating through seems to be the best way to cook them.  They are quite expensive however and certainly not a cheap alternative to your normal pasta or noodles.  I've just ordered another 10 packs which with delivery has cost me �31.  However if I lose weight (I have a stone to lose) then as far as I'm concerned it's worth it.

review/summary: how to remove fishy smell -- easy and effective
review/text: You are not supposed to eat them with a fishy smell. Just follow this simple pre-cooking method; that's how they're prepared in a Japanese cuisine.<br /><br />1. Put the noodles in a small pan. Rinse briefly with water.<br />2. Leave water enough to soak all the noodles in the pan.<br />3. Bring them to boil.<br />4. Keep them boiling for ~3 minutes.<br />5. Pour the noodles onto a strainer. They are ready for cooking.<br /><br />The point is to boil the noodles in water. Don't put them in hot water from the beginning -- it's not as effective.

review/summary: Try this no slime recipe,  It really is good.
review/text: I understand how some may find these slimy, they are, but I found a way to eliminate that. I cannot have gluten but I love my noodles like most of you. I tried these in soup and I truly found them a bit lacking. I remembered a recipe that I used to love, if you can have eggs this is the recipe to try.<br />Wash the noodles really really good and drain on paper towel. I cut them up a bit.<br /><br />Dice one small potato and fry it is a not stick pan with about 1 tablespoon oil. When the potatoes are cooked spread them out evenly, add the noodles spreading them also, let them cook for a a few minutes to allow for some drying. Scramble 4 eggs and pour them over the noodles, do not disturb them, if you can have parmesan cheese sprinkle some on top now, but it will be good without them, I eat them without cheese. Sprinkle about 1 tsp. oregano on top, salt and pepper to taste. Cover and allow the eggs to cook through. If you like, place the skillet under a broiler to brown the top, but it is not necessary. This may serve 4 if you are on a diet and two if not.<br />Slide them onto a plate a slice and serve plain, with ketchup or tomato sauce.<br /><br />I will track this review so if you have any questions don't hesitate, the noodles in this recipe are nice and dry and when combined with the eggs and potatoes you can hardly taste them. You can also make this with other vegetates like asparagus, onions, chives, even sausage, chicken and other meats. Enjoy!

review/summary: The texture and smell - HORRIBLE
review/text: Only if you can stomach a raw smelly fish smell when you open the package and the rubbery noodle texture that doesn't go away with chewing should you order these.  I made the mistake of ordering 10 and threw most away after trying to do something with them twice.  These noodles were like eating rubber bands -- NASTY and look like clear tapeworms.  I tried cutting them, only could stomach them if I cut them in tiny pieces and didn't chew after smothering them in Ragu.  NOT GOOD - I threw that meal out.  I'd steer clear, goes to show if something looks to good to be true - a no calorie no carb noodle  it is too good to be true.... These are also not worth the price.  If you do decide to order the noodle, there are also much less versions than the "Miracle Noodle" on amazon.com.  Order one package for trying - not a lot.

review/summary: Vegan, Gluten&Guilt-Free? Sign me up!!
review/text: I almost cannot believe that these noodles have next to no calories or carbohydrates. As a pasta-lover who is attempting to eliminate gluten from my diet as well as lose weight, I am in pasta heaven after discovering shirataki "noodles." I have made great use of this product with vegetable sauces and in soups. The noodles themselves don't have a lot of flavor on their own, but then, neither do semolina noodles. I was very surprised that the texture of shirataki noodles is so similar to traditional pastas; so many gluten-free noodles just don't satisfy my cravings for pasta, but this product does. I need a truckload of this stuff! Highly recommended for anyone seeking a low-carb, low-calorie, satisfying pasta meal. Even better that they are gluten-free! Shirataki noodles are now a must-have staple in my kitchen.<br />Did I mention that shirataki noodles are also vegan and GMO-free? They are. Get some and enjoy!!!<br />P.S.---<br />After reading several reviews from others, I wanted to add my two cents on the fishy smell and preparation of shirataki noodles:<br />Yes, this product does have a fishy smell when first opened. RINSE the noodles. Duh. Rinse them well in cold water and then drain before using.<br />Several reviewers mentioned a "rubber-band" texture to the noodles. Personally, I don't find their texture unpleasant; if I had to compare their texture to anything, it would be to semolina spaghetti noodles that are very slightly overcooked. They are a bit more tender than al dente pasta, yet firm in a different way as a result of from what they are made.<br />Some reviewers mentioned that they boiled or roasted the noodles; I like to simply rinse them in cold water and then heat them in the microwave with my favorite sauce (marinara). I know that microwaving is anathema to foodies and gourmets, but it allows a girl on the go to make a satisfying meal pretty quickly nonetheless.<br />If using the noodles in soups, wait until the soup is done to add the noodles; don't boil them, they really don't need to be cooked. Add them just before you are going to serve the soup; they only need to be in the broth long enough to get hot. (Or, you can heat the noodles in the microwave for 30 seconds or so and then add them to your soup!)<br />If using the noodles in a cold salad, simply rinse them well in cold water and drain.<br />Of course, not everyone will like shirataki noodles. Not everybody likes mushrooms...or meat...or strawberries. I like them. Maybe you will, too.

review/summary: A little skeptical but. . . . .
review/text: I bought the tofu shirataki noodles for my son (21 yrs. old )who has autism.  He is obsessed with pasta, and I was looking for a healthier alternative for him.  I was a little skeptical given his sensory/texture issues, but I bought a bag.  I rinsed them thoroughly (3 minutes), cooked them in a bowl of water in the microwave for 1 minute, dried them thoroughly, threw them in a bowl with some leftover spaghetti meat sauce, let them sit about an hour to absorb the flavor of the sauce, then heated them in the microwave for 2 mintues.  I served it to him with some trepidation.  He added butter and parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.  He took one bite, then another, then another, and kept going until they were gone.  He prounounced them "A-OK"!  A small miracle given his sensory/texture issues.  Needless to say, I made sure he was nowhere around when I first opened the bag b/c they did indeed have that fishy smell I had read so much about, and since he has a hairtrigger gag reflex (has to brush his teeth BEFORE breakfast or breakfast may and has come back up), I wasn't taken any chances.  Next step--I have to try them.  Yikes!!!

review/summary: I LOVE THIS NEWLY DISCOVERED PRODUCT!
review/text: I am on the HCG Diet program that is very distinct and precise--500 calories per day.  After a few weeks of my menus, the Medical Center featured the Miracle Noodles products.  Being very cautious because of the smell, looks, and that it had "no nutritional ingredients"--like calories, carbs, sodium etc., yet good fiber-- I decided to try the Angel Hair and the Rice noodles.  The Angel Hair was ok, but I have loved the Rice from my first recipe!  I was really afraid that I could not stand the fishy smell.  So here is how I became to love them.<br /><br />I bought a new strainer--not colander--poured the entire package in it and run COLD water over it for 3-5 minutes--then drizzle lemon juice on it, stir around--then rinse another 2 minutes--I have NO smell at all.  I make up a vegetable broth with good spices--and use this for blanching instead of plain water--and I boil them abour 2 minutes in the broth.  Then dry on the paper towels.  I usually do 2-3 packages at a time--put them in 1 cup containers with a little of the broth, and store in the refrigerator until ready to use--saves time.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat them is to saute' meat or seafood with a little oil.  Set aside, and in the drippings add a little onion, chopped spinach or asparagus--add a litte broth, stir to mix flavors--add the little rice "pearls"--then the protein (chicken, meat or fish), put the lid on and steam for a few minutes!  The flavors of everything get in the rice, and it is delicious!!!  On the HGC Diet, I can have it every day--I divide it, and add it to both meals.  That is how much I love it!  I am so glad for this Miracle product!!!

review/text: I was skeptical about purchasing the shirataki noodles after reading some of the reviews, but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I made a lighter version of chicken alfredo and it is yummy. I have suffered no side effects thus far and my belly is full. Please have an open mind when trying these because the texture is not like regular pasta. The shirataki noodles sort of remind me of cooked squid... but in a good way. In conclusion, try them for yourself. The noodles are packaged in a fishy smelling liquid, but the smell goes away after rinsing.<br /><br />Go to your local grocer if you don't want to invest in bulk packaging online for your first purchase. That's what I did.

review/summary: Don't forget to "roast" the noodles to remove moisture
review/text: These are a miracle noodle for me, because  they take care of my cravings for  pasta and can used  in all casserole type dishes as well as just adding sauces.  I used the linguine  for my Mom's best Mac and cheese recipe and It was just as good, if not better.  It is hard to believe I am now able to enjoy such a treat as this with almost zero carbs and very few calories.<br /><br />The key to getting rid of the extra moisture associated with these noodles is to "Roast" them in a dry pan before using for a recipe or adding sauce.  I discovered this by trial and error, before I actually saw this posted as the standard practice for preparing these noodles for use.  I wish they  had this posted on the package, I think more people would enjoy them if they take the time to do this very important step.<br /><br />I roast the noodles by placing in a dry hot frying pan and "stir fry" them until all the steam evaporates from the noodles.  Then you can add your sauce or use in a  pasta recipe.<br /><br />Give them a try again if you have had a bad experience, and  try "roasting" them this time.<br /><br />For a pasta craver like me, they are the best inventions  since slice bread!!

review/text: The initial putrid scent is much abated by rinsing the noodles before use.  However, that is not the cause of this low rating.  The noodles are a nice attempt to bring low or no calorie foods into a restricted calorie or restricted carb diet.  The taste is quite plain and it takes to a sauce well.  However, within a few bites, I had to throw them all away, as I felt like I was eating rubber and it became increasingly thusly disgusting in texture.  I don't mean a good rubbery texture like chewing gum, I mean like something you wouldn't want to ingest or even chew on. I am a fan of many popular diet foods and don't like to waste food, but I couldn't swallow this and ended up wasting it, dumping into the trash.

review/summary: Didn't work for me...
review/text: I'm very open to new flavors and tastes, but I had a rough time with these.  I put a small amount in a miso soup and the "bouncy" texture was less than appetizing.  Worse, they were TOO filling, meaning they sat like rubber bands in my stomach for quite a while after the bowl of soup was finished.  Love the concept, but I couldn't stomach them----literally.

review/text: i was so excited to try this, as it was recommended by Hungrygirl.com....i'd rather starve than eat this again. This goes down as one of the most disgusting "foods" i've ever had in my life.

review/text: Great idea, noodles without calories! I've tried this in noodle soup and wok, and it is OK. It doesn't taste quite as good as regular noodles, but it works fine for me! I will buy it again.

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: I ordered this as a result of a colleague's recommendation.  Needless to say, I was pleased.  Yes, the noodles do smell a bit fishy - just rinse them in water.  I put them in my soup (chicken stock) for filler; and I use them in my spaghetti.  Hey, for the price and no calories, you can not go wrong!

review/summary: Worth the cost and satisfies the craving!!!
review/text: I was skeptical because other reviewers stated that it was fishy and not what they expected, but if you have ever had rice noodles or Asian cuisine with stir fry noodles, these are very much like that. I didn't even use them in an Asian dish either. I made a homemade Alfredo sauce (butter, cream, Parmesan) for my husband who is on the Adkins diet and it turned out excellent. He was craving macaroni and cheese and these noodles with that Alfredo sauce did the trick. I, of course, tasted the results and was pleasantly surprised myself. What a great discovery!!!

review/summary: Great sub for glass noodles
review/text: The reviews for this product are all over the map. I have tried 4 of the 6 bags<br />and am going to reorder soon. They are not pasta, but more like glass noodles as<br />is used in sukiyaki. They take on the flavor of what you cook them in, such as<br />broth, and the consistency is very soft. I can see how they don't appeal to everyone<br />but I rather enjoy them, and they are very low carb. If you are on a low carb diet,<br />these are a great substitute. If you cook with something like broth with soy sauce<br />and add veggies, they are a great meal.

review/summary: Great Shipment
review/text: Now...the shipment was great.  I am not sure if I like the product or not.<br />I am still trying to find a way to fix them where they will taste good.<br />it will take a lot of seasoning.  Chili seasoning so far is the best Ive<br />found.  The noodles do have a slight Fish smell and taste that I cannot<br />get past :(

review/summary: Great for what it is!!
review/text: This isn't "real" pasta. Don't expect it to be!!! You won't fool your family!! And, yes, they smell fishy when opened.<br />Remember no calories, no carbs.....<br /><br />I rinsed for several minutes (longer than instructions say) and the smell fades out. I did have to wash my hands a couple of times (I have a very acute sense of smell).<br />Package says to then blanch one minute. I put then into my saute pan with a little water and cooked the water off, added a little more water and cooked it off, etc. I have added different spice combos and I've been very happy with the results.<br /><br />I am on the HCG diet which is very restrictive. These are allowed.<br />This will be a great alternative to pasta in the future as well.

review/summary: Great for HCG Dieters...
review/text: Am so pleased with all the Miracle Noodles, so much so I have signed up with their 60-day auto shipment.  They are carb-free, calorie-free and just the perfect amount to fill you up on those 'lean' days that you need an extra filler for.  Just rinse for a couple of minutes, blanch in boiling water for a minute more, and then either dry with towels or just add to your meal.  They pick up the flavors of whatever spice you are using, and are great especially with the Braggs Liquid Amino marinade.  Can be on the spendy side but these days of obesity problems, this product is a great substitute and worth the money.

review/summary: Love `em!
review/text: I LOVE these noodles. I heard about this miracle food while watching Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try because I was so amazed that there was a pasta with no carbs and low/no calories. I use a generous amount of seasoning because it is very bland without it. I even have put salsa on the noodles and loved it. I will definitely be ordering more but will try asianfoodgrocer.com for a cheaper alternative. We need more foods like this in theoworld! =]

review/summary: Miracle Noodles
review/text: come on people. Are u expecting it to be the same as eating regular pasta?? If you want the "real" thing, eat the real thing. And deal with the carbs and calories. ZERO guilt makes these an awsome choice...I can deal with the chewy texture and everything I am reading everyone complain about because THIS IS GUILT FREE. I used my pasta sauce on top of the noodles after I prepared them and it was fine! No complaints from me---filled me up, no calories or carbs, and I didnt feel deprived while my kids ate thier pasta. Great product!

review/summary: Excellent product but did not receive entire shipment
review/text: I have been using Miracle Noodles as part of an HCG diet program.  They are useful for any low-carb, low calorie diet.  The second time I ordered them I ordered a pack of five and received only one, along with the other merchandise I ordered.  I called Amazon and they credited my credit card in a pro-rated amount for the missing four packages.

review/text: I haven't try the Miracle Noodles and assuming Shiritaki are the same but I love it.  Especially when I'm on the HCG diet, phase 2, I ate the noodle like a crazy mad woman.  I wish in the future they would create more other food with 0 calories, 0 fat, 0 carbs.  So far I like the stevia sugar and the Shiritaki noodles

review/summary: Not as bad as naysayers make them sound
review/text: These are NOT replacement noodles, let me just say that first and foremost. Not that great as an Italian pasta substitute. However, if you like thai food and are used to the texture of rice noodles, for example, these won't be a disappointment. Just follow the instructions already listed here - rinse them THOROUGHLY (3-5 minutes) before you cook them. They really do absorb the flavor of whatever you cook, so if you're making a cold teriyaki sort of salad for example, leave them in the fridge overnight. I find they're better the 2nd day!

review/summary: These are Great
review/text: I can't understand why some people don't like these.  I can only think that they either didn't check the expiration date or they didn't carefully read the instructions.  I rinsed them in cold water, then in hot water and set them on a paper towel to dry.  Then, they tasted like what ever sauce I put on them.  You really can't ask for more in something that is zero calories.  I am so happy to have and eat these noodles!  They help me look forward to a meal.  I would recommend them to anyone who is on a special diet like me.

review/summary: Shiritaki Noodles Texture Too Challenging
review/text: The concept of a filling pasta with virtually no calories was the most tempting thing about this product, but alas...<br /><br />But for someone raised in a Euro-American culture with pastas and noodles made from carbohydrates -- even if you like those pastas served al dente, which I do -- the texture of these noodles is really overwhelmingly hard to get accustomed to.<br /><br />It is as if the noodles were made of rubber band material or a kind of somewhat sinewy raw meat.  Really unpleasant.<br /><br />And I have found since trying the straight shirataki noodles that the ones which combine the shirataki with tofu are better?  But I still would rate them low on my list of food choices.<br /><br />If only they could find a way to improve the texture, then I might go for it, because the taste is not all that bad -- a little bland maybe, but the taste is not too bad.<br /><br />I just can't get past the texture of these noodles.<br /><br />There are no "miracles" when it comes to weigh loss.<br /><br />You just have to eat wisely and move a bit.

review/summary: Dont Recommend
review/text: I started on the hcg diet recently and thought miracle noodles would be my favorite thing. I can eat pasta by itself and really like ramen noodles as well. These noodles have a fishy smell and are slimy. I bought 8 packs and had to throw 7 away. I tried them with grilled chicken but they arent very good at absorbing other flavors. I wouldnt recommend buying them.
