review/summary: a couple of issues with this product
review/text: There are two main problems I see with this product... number one, squeeze bottles of any kind are just terrible for mayo and salad dressing. Number two, miracle whip's formula has changed over the years to remove most of the fat from it. I've stopped buying miracle whip and buy the off brand 'salad dressing' for this reason, they still have full fat formulas. Just a heads up. Full fat stuff works much better for stuff like pea salads and the like. Much richer flavor.

review/summary: price?
review/text: Nothing is wrong with the product but the price is stupid for a condament. It's not a meal just something you add to a meal. It shouldn't be almost $7 a jar. I will only buy it when it's on sale. I use mayo, which by the way has no flavor.  But it's very rare for me to use mayo, just don't like the taste.

review/summary: Less waste, no knives needed for sandwiches! Great!
review/text: We love no waste! The squeeze bottle package allows all the product in the package to be expelled without the need to potentially contaminate the contents of the bottle with a knife or spreader. To get the same price per ounce we once bought "giant" containers of Miracle Whip at Costco and were always modestly concerned about repeated contamination of the large volume with spoons or knives. As long as one pledges to either reuse the container or recycle it, this packing of a product we were both hooked on in our youth for sandwiches and making egg or tuna salad is the best. For parents with litle kids who make Miracle Whip and peanut butter sandwiches (Ugh! -- but I don't eat them!) there is no fear of dirty knives that have been in mouths or on the counter being put into the Miracle Whip Jar. Just remember to reuse or recycle the small containers!<br />Buy this product on Subscribe and Save for the same price as gaint containers!

review/summary: What, what?
review/text: Miracle Whip, 18-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12) is one sweet, obnoxious product I have ever encountered. From what I hear people either loves it or hates it. I am in the latter category. Even if I was on a deserted island and this product was the only one available to accompany be that a fish freshly caught, a salad made of the abundant vegetation this island would offer, a loaf of bread that unexpectedly drifted towards the shore in a waterproof container, Miracle Whip is a resounding NO. And now the commercials try to make it look like the rebel of mayos, the one who did not played by the rules. Way too sweet to be anything other than a disastrous addition to any course served in my table. 1 Star since 0 is not available.

review/text: Now, I really really like mayonaise--there's almost nothing better--but sometimes I feel like something a liitle more whimsical.  At first I used to add corn syrup and lemon juice to regular mayonaise but it really didn't do the trick.  Then I discovered Miracle Whip!  I couldn't believe it.  Since then, I always make sure to keep a bottle on hand.  Thank you Kraft Foods, you guys are my hero!

review/summary: Wrong Stuff and it wasn't my fault!!
review/text: I ordered a product called Kraft Hot & Spicy Mayo.  A product I have been using for almost 5 years.  I am very familiar with the title of the product and its labeling.  They screen image I was showed during the order process was of the correct product.  What I was sent was plain mayonnaise, and was incorrect.  When I complained about it, I was told "sorry YOU ordered the wrong item."  No other venue to correct this was offered, and I am stuck with a case of a perishable food item which I cannot use in my business.  I am obviously unhappy with Amazon and the seller.

review/summary: Doesn't last long for agressive chewers
review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

Tried these bones in all flavors and she loves them.  They help with her teeth and breath.  She gets one bone for her lunch (she's a 3 meals a day gal).  Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/summary: Has Ghiradelli changed their formula?
review/text: We have enjoyed the 60% as an after dinner snack too for several years.  And I think they do well in baking.  BUT - as of a month ago,they started to taste different!  More like the cheaper store brands made with chocolate liqueur.  I noticed a different packaging in some of the stores as well.  The look is the same but the packaging material is slightly different.  Has Ghiradelli changed its formula?  Yuck.  Anyone have any insight?

review/summary: Taste is a very personal matter
review/text: I quite buying any chocolate which doesn't state the cacao percentage on the label some time ago--and have been lobbying the FDA to make such labeling a requirement.<br /><br />I settled on the Ghirardelli 72% chips a couple years ago as my optimal balance between quality, flavor and cost--chips are always considerably less expensive than bar candy.<br /><br />I sit with a bag of the 60% cacao bittersweet on my desk as I write. I was forced to switch to this from the 72% when it became impossible to find the 72% locally (on my income, price is always important!)<br /><br />These are smooth, melt evenly and have a nice chocolate flavor without any significant other notes I can detect (your tastes may vary!)<br /><br />Americans have a problem with 'bitter' flavors--few US dishes use the bitter taste at all, and most Americans seem to feel that bitter equates to bad. Well, unsweetened cocoa is bitter, and it stays that way until you get to a fairly high level of added sweet.<br /><br />This means that high cocoa content chocolate is a taste that must be cultivated to some extent--how many coffee drinkers out there truly enjoyed their first cup? (Regular drinkers are addicted...enjoyment may come second to getting their fix.)<br /><br />My cookie recipe is based upon the Joy Of Cooking recipe, which I double everything EXCEPT the chocolate ships, and add 1/8 tsp red pepper (ground) and 1/4 tsp orange or lemon extract. These chips work quite well (though short of burning them, it's pretty hard to make a chocolate based dessert which I'd not eat...I even carried the infamous 'desert bars' for a few months in my car--slightly chocolate flavored wax is better than no chocolate at all....)<br /><br />For several months I went through 4-5 bags of these a week as snacks.<br /><br />The best chocolate is the one you personally like best. After that, it comes down to the recipe it is being used to make.<br /><br />These are better than average bittersweet chips which can be found in grocery stores at a considerable savings compared with any online vendor I've managed to find.

But only during "baking season" (Nov through early January). (Must we adhere to "baking season"?)<br /><br />The food faddists are saying chocolate is good for you.

review/text: These are the best grocery store chocolate chips out there.  If you are a true chocoholic, I have no doubt that you'll love Ghiradelli's chocolate chips, in all their flavors, especially if you like to nibble on them straight from the bag.  Someone mentioned that they had trouble with their baking when using these.  All I have to say is this, I've used them and won county fair baking competitions.  I don't think they negatively influence my baking; they enhance it!  If you think of the difference between milk chocolate chips and semisweet, it's about the same difference between semisweet and bittersweet.  (To me, anyway.)  :)  Enjoy!

review/text: I am in love with these chocolate chips.  Hands down the best chocolate chip on the market.  I eat them out of bag, in oatmeal chocolate ships, as a dipping chocolate, in brownies...  The list goes on and on.  They are not too sweet, are creamy and smooth, and have an AMAZING chocolate taste.  I used to buy them from the grocery store, but they recently stopped carrying them.  I am so thankful that Amazon carries them so I won't have to go through withdrawals.  ;)<br /><br />Oh, and they arrive in PERFECT condition.  Ghirardelli obviously knows chocolate.  I ordered 5 bags and they came expertly packaged in a lined box, with frozen gel packs.  The packs were still frozen and the chocolate was cool.  Absolutely amazing.  I stood there in awe for a minute before calling my boyfriend over to check out the packaging.  We are both very impressed and will reuse the gel packs to keep our food cool when we hike.

review/summary: The new best after 51 years
review/text: I grew up on Nestl&eacute; Toll House Chocolate Chip cookies - my mother's recipe, a slight variation on the Nestl&eacute; Toll House recipe, and I thought nothing could ever beat them. But I made ATK's best chocolate chip cookie recipe with these Ghirardeli bittersweet chips and after the first cookie, I thought, what's so special about these? After the second, they WERE suddenly the best. I've made variations to the recipe since then; I make double batches and freeze them and am able to have them every day. It's the chip that makes the cookie and I'll never go back to Nestl&eacute; chips for baking chocolate chip cookies. I do prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate and the bad reviews are comparing semi-sweet to bittersweet so that could be a reason for not liking them.

review/text: As others have already stated, Ghirardelli is incredibly substandard. I have used it on more than a couple of occasions and each time had disaster results. Besides the fact that the baked goods do not rise with this garbage the same as they do with regular chocolate the taste is just plain lousy. It is also grossly overpriced. And I don't know about you but I do not have any discretionary money set up to buy garbage.

It's so much better than any other Trident gum and the flavor lasts and lasts!  Another reviewer said she was disappointed because the package didn't look like the picture here.  Don't know what that's about - I recently ordered it from Amazon and it came just as shown...and was like all the other packages I'd ever bought. Why focus on the package anyway???  Giving a two-star rating because the package didn't look like what you expected is very misleading...and unfair to the product.  I think reviews exist to let people know whether you liked the product - not the packaging.

review/summary: Beautiful Bread
review/text: This bread mix is really great.  It is such an improvement over buying some petrified loaf at the store.<br />I've made a few loaves and learned a few things that are important.<br />I followed the instructions to the letter.  It is easy to make.  I used honey for the sweetener and I did carefully measure the temperature of the water before adding the yeast. The first time, I just greased a glass loaf pan and baked the bread.  When I took it out and removed the loaf (possibly too soon) it broke in half.  It stuck to the pan.<br /><br />So next time, I lined the loaf pan with parchment paper.  I sprayed the glass pan with nonstick spray and then put the parchment over it - helps to make it stick. My loaf came out beautiful.  I do recommended taking it out of the loaf pan right away if you use the parchment paper.  I think I left it in the pan too long which isn't optimal for letting it cool.<br /><br />Now my next mistake,  I sliced it and left it in a plastic container on my counter for two days.  The slices were beautiful and the bread delicious.  I went back into the container to freeze the bread and it had gotten all moldy.  Big fuzzy mold!  Boo hoo my beautiful bread had to go in the trash.  This is all natural bread with no preservatives so in hindsight I should have put it in the refrigerator.  This was my fault for sure.<br /><br />So now I just made another loaf using the parchment, took it right out of the pan and it's cooling on a rack.  I think the key is to slice it as soon as it is cool and freeze what you don't intend to use right away.  The loaf is so pretty.  This bread makes great sandwiches.  I love it toasted.  I also saved my broken loaf and froze it.  Later I made breadcrumbs out of it.  They were great.  A good idea for end pieces if no one will eat them.<br /><br />This mix feels like it is made with great attention to detail and love - I really like the Bella Gluten Free products.

review/summary: My 4 cats go crazy for these!
review/text: I have four cats -- two kittens and two old cats -- and a friend brought me a bottle of these treats during a Christmas visit.  I accepted them graciously but knew that my cats never seem to like these "treat" things.  At least not the ones from the supermarket or pet stores.<br /><br />I wanted something to help train the kittens, so I tried them and the kittens (8 months old now) went nuts for them, AND so did the older cats (14 & 12).  I feed them Fancy Feast and fresh meat and fish, so it's not like they're starving for something tasty.  They like them so much I tried one myself -- they taste like fish cookies. (I prefer chocolate chip.)  No wonder the kitties love them.<br /><br />I give the old kitties treats when I do something that makes them unhappy (like leave all day or take them to the vet), and the treats are helping me teach my kittens not to misbehave.  They ARE expensive, however, so I ration them carefully.<br />I will certainly buy more.

review/summary: Cat loves treats or at least half of them
review/text: My cat, Hobie, is 16 y.o. and a year ago was diagnosed with early renal failure. He was put on a renal prescription diet, which seems bland, so I looked for a healthy treat and found these at a Trader Joe's. Hobie loves them or at least half; He can discriminate the differences in fish shaped treats that look and smell the same to me. I give the left-overs to a feral cat that adopted us.<br />By the way I did show the bottle to Hobie's vet and he approved of them as a vitamin supplement which makes them very worth purchasing even though the Cat eats just over half.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PMCDK2">Bench & Field Holistic Natural Feline Treats, 3-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: My cat was diagnosed with Renal Lymphoma this week, and along with her other treatments I was advised to give her multivitamins, unfortunately all the cat multivitamins I've been able to find contain phosphates, which is bad for cats with kidney problems.  This one doesn't have phosphates and was just what I needed.  To be fair, two out of my three cats aren't much interested in the treats on their own (the other cat loved them right off the bat), but I soaked one in salmon juice and everyone liked them just fine after that.

review/summary: HAS THIS PRODUCT CHANGED RECENTLY?  Question answered - Yes and No!
review/text: A week ago, I would have given this product 5 stars with no hesitation.<br /><br />I've been giving these treats to my cat (and my dog who insists on being included) for a number of years.  Both pets have loved them and have always begged for more, with no problems.  This week, I bought a new supply at Trader Joe's and anticipated the customary excited response.  Instead, the cat sniffed at several, but refused to eat them.  The dog, a canine garbage disposal who will eat anything except the very expensive dog food her delicate digestive system functions well on, also refused them.  I tried again later that day when both animals were hungrier.  The cat literally spit them out, one after another.  The dog, ever on the alert for a dropped crumb, also turned her little nose up at them.<br /><br />The ingredient list looks the same, although I thought the treats themselves looked a bit darker.  I don't have an old bottle to compare to, but I think the design of the label is a bit different.  Has anyone else had the same recent experience?  I'm really disappointed because this seemed like such a good product and one my pets liked.  I hope my feral cat visitors will benefit from the rejects.<br /><br />Any suggestions for a substitute would be very welcome.  Thanks!<br /><br />June 20, 2010 FOLLOW-UP REVIEW.  I spoke with the company and was told that mine was the first (only?) question they had had regarding the possibility of an off-tasting batch.  I decided to give the treats another try and checked the use-by date to be sure the next ones were from a different batch.  They were.  They were greeted with the same excitement as with the earlier ones.  I've since purchased several more and all have been fine.  Must have been a rotten fish in there somewhere!

review/text: My cat likes these treats as much or maybe more than the major brands. It's good to know that they are natural with no by-products and have more omega 6 oils... they have a potent fish smell. She has never got sick from them like previous reviewer's cat. My only complaint is that the container contains full-size treats, and particles of them. You can't just scoop a few treats into your hand, because there are tiny morsels mixed in. Kitty won't eat those tiny pieces, and they need to be cleaned up or first picked out from the larger pieces. Still, a good product.

review/text: A friend gave me these cat treats as a little gift for our cat. He is such a picky eater always changing in what he likes and dislikes. He went crazy over these treats. When the container was empty I knew I had to find more for him. They are his favorite!

review/summary: A Special Treat for the Little Dears.
review/text: Our two cats are on a restricted diet because one of them came down with a urinary blockage problem. (The vet bill was about $700. Groan.) Now they dine almost exclusively on expensive prescription food, and they don't particularly care for it. Day after day. Also, their new diet has cut down their variety quite a bit. Well, the cats will probably do all right and, most certainly, they aren't starving.<br /><br />My wife feels sorry for the little dears and picks up special snacks or treats for them, which we give them in small quantities now and then. They seem to enjoy these special items as a break from their dull regimen. They like Bench & Field Holistic Natural Feline Treats as well as any, and these treats have a long list of supposedly helpful additives. I tend to be somewhat skeptical about such things and think they're much too expensive, but I seem to be a minority voice.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Bad Reaction from my cats
review/text: I like natural products...gave some of this to my 3 cats.  They all liked the taste.  One threw it up (and continued to throw up) and the other had diarrhea (horrific smell) from it.  The third might of had diarrhea as well but I'm not sure.  It happened twice but I hadn't linked it to the treat yet.  I stopped giving it to them and then started again.  It happened again...both the vomit from one cat and diarrhea from the other.  It was a definitive smell and I know for sure it was the product.  In defense, my cats have sensitive systems and the one that vomits also tends to vomit greenies...she does keep down straight meat like canned tuna...cats are carnivores (more so than dogs) and do best strictly on meat.  However, the smell and level of reaction from my cats from this product was not like anything else they have tried.

I forgot to purchase them before leaving Asheville and was thrilled to see that Amazon had them for purchase at a reasonable price.

And I ordered them in July and they expire in November, so be aware you have to eat them quickly!  Have fun munching!

I was tempted to use a recipe I found online to make my own, but am so glad I didn't take the time, as I'm sure they couldn't top these tasty crackers! Don't think I'll have to worry about using them all by July, 2013!!!

review/text: I was first served these crackers at Grandfather Vineyards Wine Tasting Room near Boone, NC during a vacation trip this year. However, couldn't find them to buy locally when I returned home.  Thought I would try Amazon...and sure enough they had them!!!  You have to buy a case of 12 but they are dated to be good for almost a year.  The price for buying them by the case is $1.25 per box cheaper that what retail would cost and they will be a perfect compliment for my Christmas Gifts of Wine.  Also, if you are going to host a wine tasting party, these are perfect to clear your palate between tastings....

review/summary: Good tasting, long storage life, good for camping or emergencies
review/text: The reconstituted product is a pretty convincing substitute for fresh scrambled eggs, especially if you use it recipes such as pancakes.  I used it with Panni Bavarian potato pancake mix and it worked fine.  If you are taking it camping you might also bring along some dried onion for flavor.  If you need eggs without refrigeration, this is the way to go.  Much better than other powdered egg products I've tried.  My only complaint is that while every recipe uses numbers measured in whole eggs, the scoop provided using a 3:2 egg to water ratio ends up giving you 1 and 1/2 eggs equivalent.  It makes it a little difficult to measure, but that is a minor complaint.  If you are stocking for emergency supplies, this (claims) a very long shelf life, which I have little reason to doubt, since freeze drying is a very reliable method of preservation.  They specifically remove glucose from the eggs to avoid retardation of flavor, but I doubt most people could taste the difference.  There are individual bags in the can if you don't need the full 6 dozen eggs.  Once opened they still can be resealed for a few months (but I would use them quickly in any case).

review/summary: Tastes like fresh eggs
review/text: I've been using the OvaEasy powdered eggs to prepare bakery goods and the like. Purchased them for "just in case" as we live in earthquake country. I thought I ought to give them a try in daily cooking and so I've used these eggs to make scrambled eggs, omelets and this morning egg and biscuits sandwiches. Hubby didn't notice the difference in the taste between fresh or powdered eggs in his breakfast sandwich. In fact, he really liked the egg sandwiches the way they were prepared.<br /><br />I made up the eggs as directed then used the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B2MRSE">Nordic Ware Microwave Eggs 'n Muffin Breakfast Pan</a> to prepare the eggs for the sandwiches. This was really fast and easy as I used the microwave oven to cook the eggs. I then slipped the eggs between hot biscuits with bacon and cheese. Turned out yummy!<br /><br />Highly recommend.

I must say, these are the best I've had so far. The taste is comparable to fresh eggs.<br /><br />The cans do not contain loose powdered eggs as other brands seem to do. OvaEasy cans contain 6 sealed packets. That means no refrigeration for the rest and each stays fresh until you open them.<br /><br />This is truly a 5-star product.

review/text: This bonsai came very well packed I must say. However, almost immediately the leaves turned yellow and all started to fall off. We finally went to Google to read up on this particular type of bonsai and the maintenance on these is atrocious. There should be some kind of statement about the Gardenia bonsai and the care to put into it. The sheet of paper is basically general care instructions. Anyway, the good news is that it's still alive. If you order one of these and are not in a warm year-round climate, my suggestion is to place it under a grow light with a humidity tray beneath it. Water it daily and only move it and only to the side when you need to clean the humidity tray.

review/text: Though Kirkland's is not as good as some other Vietnamese cinnamon I've had, it's by far the best compared to anything from McCormick or any other spice company that sells cinnamon from other countries in terms of price.  And I totally disagree with the review that it's not good for baking, it's superlative.  The best you can use.<br /><br />Vietnamese cinnamon is literally dreamy.  I use it for my homemade home grown apple chutney and it's absolutely the best cinnamon ever for pies, cinnamon rolls, etc.  Kirkland has a great price on a very pricey spice.  For the money, it's totally worth it.  There are a few companies that have even better Vietnamese cinnamon, but they are a lot pricier.  For the price, Kirkland is the best.

review/text: The "real" cinnamon is Ceylon cinnamon. This stuff is the same, cheap knockoff that the USDA allows them to call cinnamon. In fact, this is Cassia, not even the same plant! This stuff is not what you want to use for health benefits because it has up to 1000x more Coumarin than Ceylon cinnamon. Coumarin has been linked to several health problems, even taken in very small amounts. Granted, when used in baking or cooking, this is not a problem, but if used for health benefits, where you take a tsp. or more at a time, it can be dangerous!

review/text: I like the taste of cinnamon and if I only bought it for taste I'd get the cheap stuff from the grocery store. The reason I get cinnamon in the first place isn't for taste but because it helps to increase insulin sensitivity. Research is showing that cinnamon is an effective way to combat or reduce your chances of getting diabetes. To me that's worth spending a little extra. I sprinkle it two times a day on my meals. If you're wondering, no, it doesn't taste weird on foods such as meats, eggs, or other foods. There is only a hint of cinnamon and you get used to it.

review/summary: comparison winner
review/text: I did a side by side comparison between this and a store brand cinnamon.  Kirkland's was a clear winner.  Its aroma was what I would call a 'true' cinnamon odor as compared to the store brand which smelled like tree bark. It also had more of the real cinnamon flavor.  This is a very large container of cinnamon that I don't think I will use up within a year so I'm sharing with family and friends.

review/summary: Excellent and SPICY
review/text: I was really looking forward to trying this product based on the description and reviews. I was NOT disappointed! Intense flavor, with just a hint of hotness. Works well in recipes; tends to kick them up a notch. I liked this so much, I had an order sent to my daughter, who's a chef. She was quite happy with the product, also.
