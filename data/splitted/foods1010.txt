review/summary: Some and good, others are not
review/text: As a general rule, in my opinion, if you stay away from the creamy-type dressings, you should be ok. For example, I love the balsamic one and the honey dijon is pretty good, but ranch and bleu cheese are just inedible; I would rather just eat my salad plain.  I'm on a very low cal and almost zero carb diet, so these (especially the balsamic) have been a life saver.  I'm going to try the cocktail sauce next.

review/summary: Great alternative!
review/text: These salad dressings are a great alternative to other popular fat free dressings.  I hate those sprays that are on the market now because there isn't enough dressing for a serving for pete's sake.  I like Thousand Island Waldens Dressing the best -- made a salad with veggie steak strips, spinach, black olives and mushrooms and this dressing was perfect! I've tried Ranch, Balsamic, Caesar and Blue Cheese.  The bleu cheese is bland, but the rest I've tried have been tasty and very satisfying.  I'm glad that I don't have to waste a 60-80 calories on dressing for my salads.

review/summary: Terrible: Walden Farms Ranch Dressing
review/text: This review is specifically on the Ranch dressing, it may not apply to other flavors.  I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the zero calorie description.  I don't know what people who eat zero calorie dressing are used to, but I was expecting a tasty gluten free Ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as Ranch(or dressing for that matter).  I can't believe there are reviewers saying this stuff has flavor.  Well, it does but the flavor is something like what you might get if you took a dirty dish rag, dipped it in latex paint and wrung it out on your salad: This is vile and nasty stuff! Don't waste your money on this one.

review/summary: Adds flavor for HCG Dieters
review/text: This dressing is the best! For those who don't know about Walden Farms, their products are gluten free, calorie free, fat free and sugar free. It is the only dressing you can use when on the HCG diet. I use this on my spinach and salads ... and also on my chicken, as a marinade! It is awesome. Sure makes the hcg diet a lot more bearable. Walden Farms has a whole line of products so fellow HCGers should check them out.

review/summary: Diabetic's Dream
review/text: For type 2 diabetics trying to control blood sugar by diet alone or with minimal medication the Walden Farms brand is heaven sent.  I have been using their dressings for several years.  Not all of their dressings are as good, in my opinion, as the Thousand Island but all will help control blood sugars.  What I like about the Thousand Island particularly is the creamy texture of the dressing and the taste.  You can use it on salads, burger melts or in a low carb rueben wrap. (I use the Santa Fe Tortilla 6 carb wrap)<br /><br />People who complain that Walden Farms products don't taste the same as 'normal' dressings have a valid point and it shows how much we have come to equate 'good taste' with sugar.  One way to check out your favorite dressing or catsup is to look at the ingredients and see how high sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn sugar, is on the list. It is no surprise that sugar is often up there near the top and often listed multiple times. Some dressings produced by major brands, however, have only two carbs per serving.  For many people, myself included, this is a tossup.  In some cases taste and cost may swing toward buying the major brand.  For more selections check at the Walden Farms website and don't forget to check at your local grocery or health food store to compare prices on this brand.<br /><br />Clearly, if you are looking to control your families intake of carbs, the Walden Farms brand is a good choice.  If you know of other brands with zero carbs that taste as good or better please add your comments to this review.  There is nothing I like better than hearing about something that tastes great with zero or low carbs.  Your comments may assist myself and others who are living with diabetes and want to live a better and longer life.

review/text: If Ranch is your dressing of choice and you are looking for a dressing to fit a special diet need, or simply willing to try something new, try this.<br /><br />I expected this to taste like I was sacrificing something.  I could not have been more happy.  I love the flavor and the zing it has.  I'm not sure if the zing is from an acid, spice, or a personal reaction on the part of my tastebuds.<br /><br />For me, I prefer this to any brand, and any type, of Ranch Dressing.<br /><br />Thank you to Walden Farms for all the products you make available to us!<br /><br />This is something that you have to try and judge for yourself.

review/summary: Dressing good, but beware vendor shipping prices
review/text: Got this dressing and others from DAB Nutrition last year, price for shipping was $6.95 total for up to 16 or 17 bottles - a great deal! Now the shipping is still the same for this flavor of dressing only. But if you try to order their other flavors you'll find that they are charging $6.95 PER BOTTLE. Quite a surprise when you see hundreds of dollars show up in your shopping cart. I spoke with Amazon and they told me to get in touch directly with the vendor because the vendor sets the pricing. I spoke with someone at the vendor who told me to get in touch with Amazon. Then she finally told me to email her manager, be brief, and explain the difficulty. I did this and got no response. Caveat emptor, buyer beware.

review/summary: Worth a try
review/text: As other reviewers have said elsewhere, these Walden Farms salad dressings, and other Walden Farms products, can be hit or miss. But everybody's taste is different, so I would say they are definitely worth a try. When they hit it's excellent, with no calories, fat, or carbs, and few if any artificial ingredients. When they miss... well, you move on.<br /><br />Pay close attention to the pricing on these items. They are all over the chart, ranging from reasonable to highway robbery. Some have shipping charges of $4.95 PER BOTTLE! It would seem to be a mistake, but they refused to acknowledge it and actually defended the charge. Others are over $8 per bottle w/free shipping; no bargain there either. Some, with shipping, are over $10 a bottle. It's not difficult to find much better deals on the web-try allstarhealth.com for starters, and there are probably even better ones out there.

review/summary: Cheaper at Fred Meyer!
review/text: I almost didn't try this because I bought the Walden Farms chocolate sauce and marshmallow sauce several years ago and they were awful.  But thanks to Amazon reviews, I decided enough people liked the salad dressings that I should give them a chance.<br /><br />I found this at my local Fred Meyer (Kroger family) for a few pennies over $5.  The FM stores in Boise have a little diet food section, and that's where I found it.  I bought the Bacon Ranch, and I must say it's pretty good.  I had a full bowl of salad with plenty of dressing (I like lots!) for just 20 calories.  Very cool!<br /><br />I wonder how this would taste on shiritaki (yam) noodles?  I think I'll try that tomorrow.

review/summary: The best
review/text: I love this dressing. I use it pretty much with everything. This year I decided to get serious about my weight (and lost 23 lbs by the way)and with some pokes from my friends I went to HCG diet (along with those friends). In my doc office I was introduced to Walden Farms products, although I've never heard of them before. Being an on and off dieter since I can remember, that would be shame on me. I am in love with their products now. Well, most of them. This Russian dressing is one of my favorites along with Chocolate dip. I use it with everything. Cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach. It goes well with everything. It tastes good, it's light and calorie free. And I might get addicted to low calorie eating after all. Dieting becomes fun when it tastes good.

review/summary: If you're serious about calories...
review/text: I've tasted the best of the "real things," and they were wonderful and dreadfully high in fat, carbs, and calories; that includes dressings, dips, and sauces.  Yes, I've added up what goes into a salad, and those oil and fat content calories soar!  If you expect a fat-free substitute for most anything to be a close equivalent, forget it; you'll have to do with eating the tiniest bits of food to lose weight.  If you expect a zero-calorie substitute to taste the same, ditto.  However, the key here is to find the best of the WF products for you.  I can't do the Peanut Spread (and I'm addicted to Peanut Butter), but most of the other products I can manage.  Some of the dressings are really good, especially the Balsamic.  Loving sweets, I keep handy an assortment of chocolate sauce and dip, caramel sauce, pancake syrup, and I've recently "discovered" the blueberry pancake syrup.  The trick is not to use too much because, yes, there is an aftertaste, but if you use the right amount, it's a darn good substitute.  AND...the calories...the carbs...the fat...don't add up!!

review/text: I would certainly compliment Walden Farms for their line of zero-calorie salad dressings.  It's really quite amazing how they can do this.<br /><br />The Thousand Island dressing is fair.  The major flavor that comes across is vinegar.  In small amounts, mixed into a salad, it does the trick.  It gives a kick to "boring" field greens.  In larger amounts, it's no better than tolerable, but you may feel good that you can have a huge greens salad and dressing for under 50 calories.  One thing is clear:  It does not taste much like full fat or low fat Thousand Island dressing.

I am on a strict low carb diet so this seems to be good enough.

review/text: I have to give it 1 star because they wont allow for any less... this ranch dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet, the chemical taste of the Splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself...I could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing, this is one of the five Walden's Calorie Free product I have tried and been VERY disappointed with... I was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with Splenda instead of Stevia but for God's sake why make it soo unpalatable?!  there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner?  My other reviews for these products may be around the same... but darn... I best just make my own dressing, might not be 100% calorie free but at least it will be consumable.  Why does RANCH need sugar?! WTF?  I have made ranch from scratch and never once did I add any sugar to it!  Also there is a dry chemical flavor that comes with this...  I am sooo lucky my healthfood store has a nice return policy because after tasting all these dressing products I could NOT use them and felt jipped because these aren't that cheap..

review/text: We are on the Ideal Protein diet and need dressings that have no calories. These fit the bill but are not edible. What a disappointment! Perhaps the other flavors are better but I thought that just about anyone could get Blu Cheese and Ranch dressing flavored right. Not so! They are awful.

review/summary: From a HUGE fan of Walden Farms
review/text: We've been ordering these dressings directly from Walden Farms for many years and haven't yet had a flavor we didn't like.  Our favorites are the Caesar, the Bleu, and the Ranch, but we also regularly enjoy the Creamy Italian, Russian, and Thousand Island.  You can buy them directly from Walden Farms, up to 10 bottles in an order, for a flat shipping fee of $7.95. Make the salads as rich as you want with tasty ingredients -- we like avocadoes in ours, providing healthy monosaturated fat, or a dollop of virgin olive oil -- and save calories BIG TIME with these delicious dressings. Any of them will also make a wonderful dressing for cole slaw and broccoli slaw, although WF also has a very good Cole Slaw flavor.  And the kids love them as dips for fresh veggies.

Good rich, and tasty salad dressing will almost never be totally healthy. Our mistake.<br /><br />Do you have any REAL russian dressing?

review/text: This is the only K-Cup my mother will drink. Her actual home brewer preference is Folgers 100% Columbian medium-dark roast from the can. They don't use that actual blend in K-Cups. My mother has Neuropathy, her fingers are becoming numb and nerves have a stinging sensation. Keurig is her easiest way to make a cup of coffee without going through all the stages to make a home brewed batch.<br /><br />SamsClub.com pricing as of this review...<br />Newman's Special Blend EXTRA BOLD Keurig K-Cups 80 ct.<br />$36.88 box<br />$5.94 shipping (Go to the club to save on shipping)<br /><br />I bought three boxes.<br /><br />If you don't have a Sam's Club account, you can still buy but add 10% premium to cost of product.

review/summary: Real good cup of medium to bold coffee
review/text: I like the Newman's Special Blend, and would give it a 4.5 on the 1 to 5 star review range.  It is a little bitter as most stronger coffees are, but not too too bitter.  I would say it leans towards strong on the medium to strong scale, but it's not overwhelming.  If you like a nice normal blend with some kick, and are an advocate of organic initiatives, this is a great pick.<br /><br />I also like to say that I always look to buy the good Newman's Own brands when I can based on the fact that the Newman's Own Foundation continues Paul Newman's commitment to donate all profits to charity.  A fantastic American non-profit company.  You are not forgotten Mr. Paul Newman - RIP.

review/summary: A Newbie Speaks
review/text: I got this as a sample with my new Mr. Coffee keurig machine.  I usually only drink one cup here and there fairly inconsistently and I am absolutely loving how k-cups work.  That being said, this k-cup made the best coffee I have ever had, hands down.  It isn't bitter at all and has a nice bold flavor that sends a warmth of delight radiating out from your taste buds. It seems a bit bold for a medium roast, so keep that in mind. It does say "extra bold/very intense" on the cup after all.  However, it is perfect for someone who enjoys a strong and fairly intense cup. I will continue to try other k-cups but I have a feeling this will become my staple, go-to brand for some time to come.  I always liked coffee but would not consider myself a "coffee lover".  Between this cup and my new machine to brew it with, I'm definitely heading in that direction.  Try some!

review/text: Typically, I like a lighter roast first thing in the morning such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TC7WN4">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Breakfast in Bed (Medium Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewer</a> then switch to Newman's Special Blend for the last cup of the morning.  Newman's Special Blend is my hands down favorite in the evening or when I have guests and is consistently my guest's favorite as well.<br /><br />This is the one coffee I have purchased regularly after buying my Keurig.  I almost always buy one box of this, one box of a medium to lighter roast, and one other that I haven't tried.  This coffee has never disappointed, it is smooth, rich, and never bitter; the closest I've found to the "perfect cup of coffee".<br /><br />This is a coffee so well balanced and blended that everyone can enjoy it.

Newman's special blend Arabica coffee for me leaves nothing to be desired;  taste, aroma, boldness and ease of preparation make this a daily morning must have.

review/summary: A Rich Cup
review/text: This coffee is good quality. It is a strong medium roast with slight acidity but not overwhelming acidity. The extra bold means that the K cup has more ground coffee in it. It does not refer to the type of roast but rather the amount of coffee in the k cup. The cups are almost completely full of coffee. It's a good wake up cup of coffee for the morning and it is organic too! I find that the 8 oz. setting on my brewer makes just the right cup. Those who like their coffee weaker might like a 10 oz. setting. I would recommend this coffee if you can get it at a reasonable price.

review/summary: Nice flavor - consistent with the regular one
review/text: I've settled on "Newman's Own" as my regular cup of coffee every morning.  However, sometimes late in the day I want a decaf cup.  I've tried LOTS of different decaf K cups, but was never as satisfied as I wanted.  Then I thought, why not just get Newman's decaf?  So I gave it a try and sure enough - great flavor.  It's tastes very similar to the regular blend.  So - if you like the original Newman's, then you will also like the decaf.

review/summary: The best of the bunch.
review/text: I will continue to order Newman's Own Extra-bold again and again.  It's strong yet has no bitter taste.  I've tried so many other coffee...and like many of the Coffee People blends, but this is organic along with having such a wonderful flavor. Plus.... everyone in the family kept using up the Newman's K-cups and leaving all the other brands. So I gave up on having a variety and just order the Newman's.

review/summary: Coffee Connoisseur Alert, This is The Best.
review/text: Recently purchased the Keurig Single Cup Brewer. Love the convenience and no filter or pot to wash. Tried the sample K-cups included. All were good but the Newman's extra-bold was outstanding. I had been buying an organic blend that I thought was good until I tried this. I was hooked but this was almost like buying printer ink, very expensive. The 80 pk is about two pounds of coffee. Amazon pricing is $48 dollars which equals $24 dollars a pound. This is pricey, you are paying for the convenience. Other retailers mark this up even more making Amazon look cheap. I found this at BJ's wholesale club for $37 dollars. Not that much cheaper but it is a savings. Bottom Line: The Keurig Brewer is a fantastic coffee machine that works best with the K-cups. Newman's extra-bold is an organic coffee that is superlative to other brands and worth the money. My advise is to shop around for the best price.

review/text: When I first got my K-cup machine a couple years ago I ordered virtually every coffee/tea cup brand except for the inane.  The Newman extra bold is the best "every day" coffee IMO.  There are others of course!  So order the Newman extra bold,  the Emeril big easy bold, and the sleepy time tea and you have the bases covered.  At least for my family, yer mileage will surely vary.

review/summary: Great cup of coffe; 5 cents more per cup that at Store
review/text: I really like this particular flavor -- always enjoyed the coffee grounds back when I had that kind of coffee maker.  This one is good too.  It tastes good either hot or iced.  The only downside is it's about 5 cents more per cup than if you buy at Walmart of Target where you can get 18 K-cups for $9.95 on sale sometimes.  Not too big a deal because it costs money in gas to get there so the price is on par and maybe better.<br /><br />The organic coffees just taste better and Newman's products are well made -- as if they really care about taste.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />With amazon prime, it's good because you only wait 2 days.

review/summary: Bold, strong, delicious
review/text: Since we've had a keurig, we've gone through many varieties of kcup coffees including flavored and non flavored.  Every kcup seemed to be either weak, bitter, or just ordinary.  I feel like I found MY FAVORITE with this one. It's strong, flavorful, and smooth. The most popular coffee among keurig users seems to be the donut shop coffee. I tried this one and was among the few that thought it tasted bitter and burnt. I thought if so many like this and I don't, I will never find that coffee shop house blend.  I'm so glad I found "my donut shop coffee" :) Give Newmans Special Blend a chance, this will be my staple from now on. (Get it at Costco or SAMs for $33).

review/summary: The (Second) Best K-Cup?
review/text: I used to think it was the best. Bought it when Amazon was having a one-day sale, which made its price pretty much the same as Coffee People Donut Shop (our regular brew). If we could get this Newman coffee at a matching price always, we would switch to it. It's dark and strong, without being bitter. Love it. (Edit 5/5/2011: I have now decided the Van Houtte Eclipse blend is my #1 favorite.)

review/text: After buying my Keurig, I've done a bit of experimenting with different varieties of coffees available.  I've enjoyed other Newman's Own products, so this one caught my eye.  I was disappointed.  I'm not sure how they came up with "Extra Bold" in the name, but I found it relatively weak.  I ended up drinking a couple, saving one or two for potential guests that might like weaker, smoother blends and gave the rest away.

review/text: I bought this coffee because of Mr. Newman's charity. Boy, was that a misguided decision. The coffee is bitter, but the worst attribute is its muddy, sludgy mouth feel--which is the hallmark of poor quality beans. I just threw away about $35 worth...words to the wise.

review/text: I know this is a weird review, but the fact that I noticed it enough to write about it means I'm not making it up. I just went through a Costco sized box of Tully's bold, and that was great. So I decided to try this box. The main thing I noticed is that I have to scrub the hell out of my mouth and tongue after drinking it, because the flavor really, really stays around. I never noticed having to do this with Tully's. It's a gross, smoky taste. It's like having smoker's breath without smoking.<br /><br />Can't wait to finish this box...

review/text: My standard for a good cup would be Green Mountains Extra Bold Expresso which has been hard to find for around sixty cents or less a serving so I tried this brand after my friend gave me a cup at the office. My batch was a lot weaker. Not sure if the coffee content was less than my friends batch, but I ended up packing my own Expresso coffee in the K-cup which filled the bill.<br /><br />George S.<br />Oceanside NY

review/summary: Terrible, Simply Terrible.
review/text: I recently ran out of GMCR's "Our Blend' and was forced to try Newman's Own.  It took my colleagues 20 minutes to convince me that I wasn't drinking urine.  It truly offended my taste buds.<br /><br />You can taste the lack of passion and pride in this blend.  Newman could take a lesson from "Our Blend" - show a little pride for your work.  Don't be afraid to think outside the box to create a coffee that doesn't taste like cow sweat. That's what makes "Our Blend" great - you can taste the uniqueness and creativity in the brew.<br /><br />My advice to Newman's Own: Step aside and let the artists behind "Our Blend" restore America's faith in coffee.
