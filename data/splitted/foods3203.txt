review/summary: Wholesome Ingredients
review/text: I made my soup with four cups of low sodium chicken broth, one cup of the mix, some chopped onion and carrots, and a sprinkle of salt-free garlic-herb seasoning.  It was delicious, and VERY filling -a meal all by itself!  Next time I make it I won't add anything extra, just to see how it tastes that way.*  As it was, I kept adding water and ate on one pot of soup for four days ... ("Pease porrige hot, Pease porrige cold...") Another reviewer mentioned that the soup was very thick when mixed four to one as recommended, and that is very true.  It could be eight to one and still make a nice soup...  I highly recommend it however you cook it!<br /><br />*I returned to lower the rating from five stars to three.  When I tried making the soup with just water and chopped onions, carrots and celery (no spices or broth), there was no rich flavor whatsoever.  This mix does have a wholesome mix of beans, peas and lentils, but it does not contain any spices or flavorings to make it a true soup mix.  It should be called "Bob's Red Mill Veggie Mix to Add to Your Own Soup."

review/summary: Easy to make and delicious!
review/text: I usually cook soup from scratch and rarely use canned or dry soup. However, sometimes in the dead winter or cool spring, I long for a bowl of hot soup but too lazy to drive out and shop for fresh ingridients. After reading great reviews about the Bob's Red Mill soup mix, I decided to try it for those special occasions.<br /><br />The reviews were all true. The soup mix is easy to use, delicious, fullfilling, and nutritious. I sautee some onions and garlic which are constant stables in my pantry. When I have leftover baked ham, I would freeze them and use the in this soup. Then I add water and the soup mix, bring to a boil, cover and turn off the stove. After a while or overnight, turn on the stove and stir the pot once in a while to prevent sticking. Cook until desired consistency. I only add pepper, but some people may prefer to salt the soup.<br /><br />One reviewer online suggested making a larger portion and freeze leftover to save cooking time. I tried it and found the leftover as good as a new pot once reheated on stove. Try this soup with bread or any meal. Delicious!

review/summary: Ok but not what I thought
review/text: This is basically split peas, lentils and small soup pasta.  I guess I expected to find more dried vegetables, perhaps seasoning of some sort but this is a VERY simple base which you will build your soup from.  I think a better names for this would be 'split pea soup base' or 'split pea and pasta'. With a more accurate name I would give it a higher rating because the quality was good but I felt a little misguided by the name and description proveded when I received my order.

review/summary: Wow! Delicious!
review/text: I made this soup last night and it was divine!  I was just going to use water and chicken stock (cubes) with some seasoning.  Then I decided to add some tomato paste and crushed some whole tomatoes (canned).  The flavors in the soup surprised me so much.  So tasty and it was no work at all.  Not to mention the entire thing is so healthy, even the alphabet pasta is whole wheat.  So thrilled to have to this on hand as the possibilities are endless.  I'll be able to add meat and all kinds of spices and seasonings to change up the flavor; not like it needs much help.  I also LOVE that there is hardly any sodium!!! 1% of your daily value!  That's wonderful!!! So many soups, even dry soups, are loaded with salt.  Not one bad thing to say about this soup.  I also paired it with some homemade caraway rye bread bowls.....HEAVENLY AND HEALTHY!

review/summary: A delicious way to eat healthy!
review/text: As someone who has become more health conscious in recent years, I began using Bob's Red Mill products, including the Veggie Soup Mix.  I've been really pleased with all of the BRM products, especially the convenience of this soup mix, which can be altered from the delicious recipe on the back of the package to suit individual tastes.  For someone who wants to add meat protein, I'd suggest cutting up a turkey or chicken sausage for individual portions (a friend uses Asiago/spinach chicken sausage).  With all of the excellent vegetarian recipes available, the possibilities for this soup mix are endless.<br /><br />This Veggie Soup Mix is another Bob's Red Mill product that's convenient, versatile and delicious.  The great price through Amazon's Subscribe and Save option make it an easy way to eat healthy!

review/text: I really didn't want to order the 4 pack without trying it first. I went to iherb and got a 1 pack to try first for $3.91. Even got $5 off my order by using a coupon code  POB861.  It is just great soup. We add some chicken broth and small chicken pieces and some other spices to jazz up the soup. Everything we try just improves the soup mix. After we tried this first and really liked it, we then bought the Amazon 4-pack and will be re-ordering.

review/text: Bob's Red Mill Soup Mix, Veggie, They have provided us lentils not the soup mix that I was expecting ( When it says that it is a Ready mix, I took it to mean that we just add water and boil.  We always keep all kinds of lentils at home and this was just a duplication of what we have.  Now I am stuck with this whole lot of the soup mix, or we have to go through the process of boiling the mix, and blending it in the mixer to make the soup.  I have to say that it is not a time saving process.  My wife is very disappointed with my decision to get this soup mix.

review/text: Love this mix.  I just add a little salt during preparation.  Sure you can add more ingrediants but when I don't feel like fussing all day in the kitchen this is excellent as packaged.  The leftovers are excellent for a quick meal the next day.  The only thing I had to get over was its appearance after preparing it straight from the package.  I wasn't expecting it to look so green (foolish thinking when it has green peas).  Once I tasted it though, it was FANTASTIC!  Will continue to purchase this excellent mix!!

review/summary: Tasty soup, good value
review/text: I just got this from Amazon today and decided to make it for dinner. This mix makes delicious soup. It is unflavored, so you should start up a soup base of some sort - I used 3 strips of bacon, a carrot and a celery stock. 2 cups of the mix made a lot of soup - we had 2 generous portions tonight and there are at least 4 more portions leftover. Way cheaper than any kind of takeout, and much healthier. Also minimal effort - it takes literally 10 minutes to put everything together, then it just simmers and is ready a couple of hours later.

review/text: Yeah...this was a really tasty soup blend that was as easy as throwing in the crock pot for an hour or two with the 4 to 1 water to mix ratio. I dont really think the pasta is evident in the soup, in that, i didnt really notice it, and the alphabet shapes were indistinct, lol. Otherwise, it was just a good hearty soup. A little goes a long way, so a 4 pack should last quite a while.<br />Enjoy!

review/text: I used a 32ounce low sodium beef broth as the liquid, you could use vegetable, chicken or your own broth for added flavor. I added 2 tablespoons dehydrated celery flakes, 1 tablespoon minced onion flakes and dehydrated garlic flakes, with a pinch of salt after cooking. Simmered for an hour and it was wonderful!! I bought mine at Job Lot and it was cheaper at $3.50 per package. I ate half + put the rest in the refrigerator for tomorrow.

review/summary: Excellent Soup Base, Great Added to Rice & Other Meals.....
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect, but this is a simple mixture of split peas, lentils, and pasta.  There are no spices, no dried vegetables, or anything else, so you will need to add a number of things to it to make soup, or a decent-tasting meal. That being said, it's great. I didn't expect that I would keep using it but it's become a staple in my kitchen. My housekeeper /cleaner buys it, boils it and prepares it as a side dish (bean salad). I prefer to add it to my rice pilaf, to make it a complete source of protein.<br />If you do make soup with it, I would definitely add lots of veggies, potatoes, and chicken if you're not vegetarian.<br />This is not just for vegetarians. It's actually great for people who are cooking meals for mixed vegetarian/non-vegetarian families.<br /><br />Hope you try it and like it.

review/summary: Simply delicious
review/text: This is a great base for making vegetable dishes as simple or intricate as you want. A little goes a long way, and as other reviewers have demonstrated, there are ample recipes across the spectrum of vegetarian and meat-loving tastes that use this mix. The product contains a variety of deliciously complementary ingredients, and when heated solely with water, has a pleasing natural aroma... but there's really no need to stop there!<br /><br />I like it as a quick and easy meal; add about 1-1.25 cups of the mix to 32 ounces of plain water or a box of this stuff: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FYG2N8">Pacific Natural Foods Organic Low Sodium Chicken Broth, 32-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> and then let it simmer on medium-low heat for a couple hours. This makes enough for about three meals. For flavor, I add a little of this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CWCQIE">S&B Oriental Curry Powder</a> and and a little of this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5YXY">Drogheria & Alimentari All Natural Spice Grinder Four Seasons Peppercorns , 1.23 Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> to taste.  Not much to it, but it's a hearty, warming meal.

review/summary: Goes a long way
review/text: I bought a couple bags of this at a local health food store & was surprised at how far this soup mix goes. I've had to add extra water while cooking & a little bit is filling. The package I have reads 19g of fiber & 63g of carbs for those who are carb counting & also trying to add more fiber into your diet. Fiber is the main reason I picked this up at the health food store, & that it's all natural. I wasn't expecting it to taste good or anything. My version I add a little spices, some beans & extra veggies with a little garlic powder. Like I said a little goes a long way. Rinse first though before you cook, that's what I've been told, so I try to do that with everything I buy.

To the pot, I added one jar full of the mix, two jar fulls of chicken stock, two jar fulls of water, and one sliced  green onion and let it simmer covered for an hour.  It was really  thick, so I added  4 more jar fulls  of water, and it was perfect.  I added a touch of salt and a gob of pepper (I love  pepper), and it ended up very tasty and extremely filling.  I think I will add some tomatoes and mushrooms next time I make it.

review/summary: Great soup base!
review/text: We've enjoyed Bob's Red Mill products for a long time, and I was delighted with this soup mix too.  Like some other reviewers said, it is plain and mostly unseasoned, but that is the beauty of it.  It's a good mix of vegetable pasta, barley, dried peas and lentils.  It's quick-cooking and rich and filling, but it needs seasoning and either meat or veggies added to it.  We like adding ham chunks, chopped spinach, onion, cracked pepper and canned crushed tomatoes, but we also like it with chorizo sausage (pre-cooked!), and mixed frozen vegetables.  I added some chopped cabbage once and it was great.  It thickens as the peas and lentils cook, so you can add more or less water as you wish.<br /><br />One of the best things about this soup base is that you add your own salt.  So many products come heavily and unhealthily salted but not this one. It's much better to add your own as desired!<br /><br />This soup is a little expensive - about $4 per bag - but it makes a big pot of soup, and with free SuperSaver shipping it's a good deal and something that I'll order again.

review/summary: really a good blend of flavors
review/text: The mix is excellent for contents and flavor blending as well as having it sized to all get done cooking at the same time.  It can be flavored any way you want as it has a 'general' vegetable flavor.  I used onion and celery with a bit of garlic.  That is what came through the generalized vegetable flavor.  I used a 'boat motor' on it right in the pot and blended it to about half of it's original size.  I had the creaminess and yet the 'feel' of vegetable pieces on the palate.  This blend could be used for about anything.  It is sealed very well and for someone stocking up an emergency food shelter, it would work perfectly.  I would bet it will be good indefinitely.  All of their products are of this quality.

review/text: I LOVE this soup mix. I am most definitely NOT a good cook --but this makes the easiest best soup ever. I measure out a cup and put it in the soup pan. Then I rinse and drain the mix about four or five times until the water is clear. After draining the mix the last time, I pour a 48 ounce can of Swanson's All Natural, Low sodium, no MSG chicken broth into the soup pan with the mix. Finally just simmer, covered, on medium heat for an hour or so. The longer you let it simmer, the thicker it gets. It's really simple, good, and healthy.

review/text: These chips look like the real thing and they taste alright but there is simply too much maltitol in them, especially for a single serving. The other drawback is that if you are sensitive to maltitol or have blood sugar issues, these are going to upset your system. I do get a craving for chocolate chips now and then (rarely since I'm low-carbing it) so I'm going to try and "dilute" these with Wondercocoa powder or sugar-free dark chocolate in a recipe and see how it turns out.

review/text: I didn't realize when I bought these that they were made in China.  In fact, I fed them to my dogs until someone looking at the package pointed it out to me.  I'm a little leery of buying dogs treats from China and other developing countries since the melamime incident.  Who knows what oversight there is on the production.  So, now I order *only* Snook's sweet potatoe dog chews from Healthy Happy Pet (through Amazon).  These are organic dried sweet potato chunks made in the US and my dogs **love them**.  I also get Sam's Yams but the Snook's are nice and crunchy.  I got a small bag for my sister's Shih Tzus and they loved them as well.  If Dogswell would find a place in the US to make their products, I'd be willing to buy.  But as long as they are made in China-- won't do it anymore.

review/summary: Stay away
review/text: I will admit at this moment I have no hard data to back up my suspicion, but we have been feeding these to our two dogs, one of whom is diabetic. Due to the fact that the chicken and apple treats boasted such bona fides as "no hormones" and "no antibiotics", we felt good about serving these up.<br /><br />The other day, the diabetic dog began throwing up, and I took her to the vet yesterday. The vet called with the results of the blood work and said the dog's liver enzymes had spiked. She asked me if we were feeding her chicken jerky treats which might be made in China. I knew about the Dogswell treats, but I was certain they weren't of Chinese origin. When I was at the store later, I picked up a package and found to my amazement that they are, in fact, Chinese.<br /><br />The vet will run tests on the remaining treats in the package to see if there is any melamine in the meat, but the change in her liver coincides with her getting these treats. I wouldn't advise anyone feeding these to their dogs without first checking the health of their dog's liver and the chemical composition of the treats.<br /><br />Rated One Star, only because Zero Stars is not an option.

review/text: I like the simplicity of this treat--an ingredient list I can understand.<br /><br />Our puppy, a 1 yr. old Coton de Tulear, has loved these for months now.  He is normally a somewhat finicky eater, but he will perform his whole arsenal of tricks when he knows you have one of these in your hand.  He loves them so much, we buy this on the "Subscribe and Save" option with Amazon.

review/summary: Dogs Love These!!
review/text: I have a little Jack Russell and a Chihuahua/Daschund mix, and they both go crazy for these.  I feel good giving these treats to my dogs because they're all natural and it's good stuff they're eating.  They don't last long though....they chew them up in about a minute.  They also love the banana/chicken and apple/chicken.  The banana ones are probably their favorite.

review/text: "Sweet potatoes?! My dog will eat sweet potatoes????"<br /><br />Yes, you may be surprised!!  I've fed my English Bulldog pup more treats than I care to mention and these are his favorite.  An especially a good choice for dogs with allergies!  From a taste standpoint, if he had his way he would eat the whole bag.  This is the closest thing to "scraps" that I've intentionally fed my dog.  From a health standpoint, bullies are know for their skin problems.  Kingston's coat is very shiny and his eyes and nails look great, too.  Due to his breed's susceptibility to hip dysplasia I also plan to try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F9AHN0">Dogswell Veggie Life Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews Dog Treats (15 oz.)</a>.  But with 6 bags, each holding 10- 15 treats, this has lasted me a while.  RECOMMENDED!!!

review/summary: Smells like people food (sort of)
review/text: I have two 13-20 pound dogs (Yorkie-Poodle and Chihuahua-Doxie mixes) and these treats are perfect for their size.  The look and smell like dehydrated apricot with banana.  If I didn't know they were dog food, I could be fooled.<br /><br />The only thing that wasn't mentioned in the description is the place of manufacturing.  I would feel more comfortable with their claim of "natural" and "healthy" if I knew where they were made.<br /><br />Edit:  Once you open the package, you should put them in the refrigerator, as a previous reviewer stated.  I found that one of the pieces had gone bad (which, in turn, shows that they have very few preservatives).

review/summary: Made in China but A GREAT PRODUCT!!!
review/text: I have done so much research on foods/treats for dog consumption, I am obsessed with giving my pomeranian only the BEST food possible. Halo and Dogswell are the only brands I trust. My dog has had the biggest variety of treats but the only ones she will jump and whine for are these Dogswell chicken treats. She gets the chicken breast strips during her daily brushing, and then the chicken/sweet potato or chicken/banana ones whenever she is being left at home by herself. She loves them all. The sweet potato doesn't need to be refrigerated but the banana does. All retail stores sell these packages for at least $16.99-$19.99; Amazon.com offers a truly unbeatable price!

They are hard, but they are meant to be a rawhide alternative, meaning, the dogs are supposed to gnaw on them!  We started with these because I read the oldest dog in the the world (who has since passed) ate Dogswell treats.  We started with the Chicken Vitality Treats, but have since found out that one of our Poms has allergies to chicken.  These are amazing and my dogs cannot get enough.  I love the price on amazon and the delivery is SUPER quick.

review/text: I bought the sweet potato snacks on a whim at Target.  Our beagle LOVED them.  To the person who commented that the potato gets tough, they are supposed to be that way.  Raw hide bones, pig's ears, etc. are much tougher and dogs don't choke on those either.  Your dog won't choke unless it is a toy breed in which case you should consult with your vet about what treats they should not have.  The toughness of the snacks is actually great since they take a while to eat and our beagle doesn't scarf one down in two seconds.  Also, it's nice that they don't have artificial coloring or preservatives.  I'm buying them in bulk now that I see Amazon carries all the flavors!

review/summary: She Eats 'Em
review/text: A picky 14# Westie likes 'em so much she ripped open a bag by herself and ate it all!<br /><br />I like to cut up a piece and stuff it in her Kong... make her work a little bit if she wants it.  (Keeps her occupied and away from me too especially when she is being her attention hogging self.)<br /><br />I like the ingredients, all natural, although I am not expecting this product to give her much of "vitality" or "healthy hips" (Vitamin and supplements are just way to low a dosage to do any good really.)<br /><br />It does feel pretty moist, and if she didn't rip open the last bag and ate it all, it probably would go rancid pretty quickly.  I also recommend refridgerating after opening.

review/text: All 3 of my dogs really enjoy these sweet potato chews. It doesn't take them very long to chew them up, though.  Still a better alternative to rawhides, and certainly better for them.  There are different sizes in each bag, from about 2" x 1" to 1/2" x 1/2".  There are about 9 to 12 pieces in each bag.  Some pieces can be broken in half, to accommodate smaller dogs. I do recommend these treats.

review/summary: Doggie Loves These!
review/text: These sweet potato chews are perfect for my dog. She has extreme food allergies and they are one of only 3 treats she can eat that I've ever found. They're very expensive in stores, so I was overjoyed to find them available on Amazon. Not only are they mega-cheaper here, BUT if you order them on the auto-delivery program, they're even less! Plus, it's been so hard to find them where I live, that it's great to have them delivered to my door. The only problem is, my doggie loves them so much that I had to increase the frequency of my order, LOL. I like it that they're really good for her too with no chemicals or weird ingredients, and they're made right here in the USA.

When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as "MADE IN CHINA". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!<br />I had to throw out all the Dogswell products I purchased, Shame on Amazon for selling without disclosing the source!

review/summary: Great for Dogs with Allergies!
review/text: We have a bichon frise, who is allergic to corn, soy, wheat, oats, chicken, beef, and lamb.  We got her when she was six months old, and she already had horrible breath and excessive tartar on her teeth.  We had her teeth cleaned by the vet, who told us her teeth would probably be a lifelong problem.  We were told to brush her teeth daily, but we couldn't even find a canine toothpaste that did not contain ingredients from the above list (beef liver being most common).  We also tried various "hypo-allergenic" treats for her, but most are very expensive, and she didn't even like them.  About three years ago, we started giving her one of these every day, alternating between the Vitality and Happy Hips varieties.  She liked them immediately and still goes crazy every evening at treat time.  She had her annual dental cleaning last month, and the vet told us that her teeth are in great shape.  We consider her improved dental health to be a result of giving her these treats each day.  I would definitely recommend this to families with dogs who have allergies!

review/summary: Made in China but my dogs love them!
review/text: I am looking for other sweet potato treats that are made in USA. I would feel more comfortable.  Having said that, my many little toy dogs do love these, even two older ones who have lost their teeth.  They just suck on them until they are real soft then swallow the soft parts. The treats themselves are rigid, some are bendable. I add a little water to a bag to  soften them first and it works. I worry about my little guys choking on them but they haven't.  Sure beats those awful rawhide treats I use to give them. I quit when one of my dogs almost choked to death on one.You have to be careful, if you do add water to refrigerate these so they don't get bacteria build up. Sweet Potato chews are just the best idea ever. Why did it take so long? Too bad we can't depend on things from China, but that is just the way it is.

review/text: Having purchased this dog treat (my dog's absolute favorite treat) in the store, I was surprised to find the mail-order version was different--the chicken wrapped around the sweet potato is much browner than any I have seen in a store. My dog still will eat it, but isn't as interested as he was with the less-cooked chicken version. I will say, though, that buying in quantity makes this treat a lot more affordable.

review/text: This is the second "vanilla Rooibos" tea I've tried.<br />(The first being "Tazo"- served at Starbucks- which has a bit of an overpowering licorice *root* taste, that tends to mask the other ingredients flavors.)<br /><br />Dragonfly brand obviously took the "less is more" approach; their ingredients list is as follows: "Organically grown rooibos tea, Natural Bourbon Vanilla Extract, natural flavoring" (the website states the bags are "chlorine-free").<br /><br />The intoxicating vanilla scent permeates the whole box, and the outside of the individually wrapped sachets.  The taste is smooth and delicious!  (I added a bit of honey, and a touch of cream.)<br /><br />If you love vanilla, or Rooibos tea- don't hesitate to give this a try!<br /><br />My interest is definitely piqued in this brand, and I hope to try another product in the near future.
