review/summary: The Dogs Really, Really Like It
review/text: Having two resident dogs of wildly different sizes and needs, they are united on liking Beneful - which is a good thing, from our vantage of having to purchase mid-priced dog chow now and again. The chicken bits, scraps and by-products obviously afford enough flavor to satisfy a large Boxer-mix and a small Malti-poo, and they get sufficient other chewy treats and bones to keep their teeth in good working order. The high corn content, though - is a worrisome thing. Generally, we prefer to mix the Beneful with a bag of higher-protein food, when we can afford it.<br />On the unreservedly approving side, the bag containing the food is a very satisfactory bit of packaging, with the zip-lock arrangement. I wish that more pet-food providers did this.

review/summary: My dog likes it
review/text: My dog is a very picky eater.  She refuses to eat certain dry foods, but she really likes Purina Beneful. I have given her Pedigree for years and she will eat it sometimes, but she doesn't seem to enjoy it.  I was actually shocked by the way she went at Beneful the first time I gave it to her. The bag is more than halfway gone and she still seems to really enjoy it. I guess she has chosen to switch to Purina Beneful.

review/summary: Hey Mikey, he likes it! (Sorta)
review/text: First off, I just have to say that this was a large bag of dog food, so if you've got a smaller dog or a canine friend with a smaller appetite, this bag will go a long way. Also, be careful when carrying this, as the top of this is resealable (yay!) with a ziplock top and this could scratch your neck if you're not a little wary. (Just saying this because I ended up with a long scratch down my neck from carrying this on my shoulder and wanted others to avoid the same fate.)<br /><br />My friend's canine is a little picky about what he eats, with dry dog food being his "last resort". I figured that if I could get this dog to eat and even remotely enjoy this food, then it would be a pretty good recommendation. Now while he didn't take to the Beneful like a fish to water or a cat to milk, he did eat it, which says quite a bit considering how he can be about food.<br /><br />I don't think that Beneful will become a regular addition to the dog's diet but that he eats this means that my friend will have another brand of dogfood that he can guarantee that his dog will nom on. This dog food is a little on the expensive side in the stores in my area and while I can't guarantee what the prices will be in your neck of the woods (Amazon price not withstanding since that can change rapidly sometimes), you might want to do a little pricechecking on various different dogfoods. Beneful is definitely healthier than store brand dog food, but if you're going to spend the money then there's some better stuff out there that's a little more organic and natural.  Castor & Pollux has a slightly higher protein value, for example.

review/summary: Good as a treat.
review/text: My 13-year-old Aussie mix has gotten to be a rather finicky eater. She is still very active and runs the beach most days, but finding non-human foods she really likes has become a problem. We resorted to bribing her with dog cookies/biscuits as appetizers, but discovered that she'll eat this Beneful Dry Dog Food even before her treats and canned food. I love that she is enthusiastically eating it, but am disturbed  that the ingredients are less than wonderful. I have to admit that I assumed the meats and veggies shown on the bag were the actual ingredients - and there are dried peas and carrots listed - but reading the list of ingredients on the bag is a bit disheartening. I doubt that I'll buy it again.

review/summary: Nice variety - dog likes it
review/text: Food comes in different colored pellets, which makes it more interesting?  At least our dog likes it.  We put this in the same bowl with 'natural balance' and our dog chooses to finish the Purina Beneful first before eating the other brand.  It may be that she got tired of eating the other brand, which we were feeding her before getting the Purina, or maybe she just likes Purina better!<br /><br />As mentioned, we do like the different colored pellets for different food elements, which makes it more exciting.  Definitely recommend this dog food.

review/summary: If my Dog Could Talk . . .
review/text: . . . I'd have her write the review!  But since she can't speak, I can only speculate on the quality of this dog food.  Considering how quickly she empties her dish (compared to other brands), I'd say BENEFUL is her favorite type of dog food.  I find our dog happy and satisfied after feedings.  No obvious problems or disruptions of her digestive track, as all "movements" appear normal and regular.  Overall, she's a very happy and healthy dog.  I've purchased other brands that, when I feed her, sit in her dish for hours (sometimes even all day), but not BENEFUL.  She empties her dish rather quickly, and even sometimes begs for more!

Neither dog had any problems with it and both do tend to sensitive stomachs so that is a real plus. The packaging was very good easy open and easy to carry. Price seems a bit high for our budget but we will probably buy it from time to time as a treat and for a change.

review/summary: Love the Extra-strong Zipper
review/text: Purina has always been the brand of choice for my dogs. They use good ingredients.  Beneful is no different: it is made from quality ingredients and is high in protien which is good for dogs.  The adult formula also has added nutrients to help keep your furry friend healthy.<br /><br />My dog, a rather picky Bassett Hound, always enjoys his Purina dog food.  Jeff (the Bassett) has never had any digestive issues from this food. So as a dog owner, I am happy with a food that Jeff likes and is good for him.<br /><br />The Beneful I received from Amazon had added bonus that I REALLY loved: a heavy duty ziplock zipper on the top of the bag.  Even with only a few cups taken out of the bag, it was sealed tight. Super convenient.<br /><br />Purina is a 5-star dog food for my dog.  I would add a 6th star for the super-useful sliding zipper if I could. I am very happy to recommend this food to other dog owners.

review/summary: Dog wouldn't eat it
review/text: My 65 pound lab mix is not a picky eater. In fact she eats just about anything we give her. I was skeptical of this because Beneful is not known for quality dog food but figured the dog probably wouldn't care and she may even like it. Unfortunately not the case. My dog routinely leaves her bowl full and won't touch the food until she gets desperate towards the end of the night. We feed her twice a day but with this food, she will barely eat a bowl a day. She just doesn't like it.<br /><br />While the packaging is very nice with a sturdy plastic, re-zipable bag, the contents are underwhelming. The dog food is shaped in nice big chunks but the ingredients (as other reviewers have noted) are chicken by-product and corn filler. I prefer to give my dog a protein and she responds well to higher quality lamb mixes.<br /><br />I don't think we'll even finish this bag and instead go back to Trader Joe's lamb meal.

review/summary: My dog was not a fan.
review/text: My dog is spoiled. She was a rescue, but I think she forgets this. When I buy her food with crunchy dog food and soft pieces mixed up, she typically only eats the the soft pieces. And when there are both red and yellow soft dog pieces, she picks out the yellow pieces first. So, due to my dog's finicky eating habits, I did not have much hope that this dog food would impress here. Still, I try to expose her to different crunchy dog foods in hopes she will like one. True to prediction, my dog was not interested in this particular dog food.  My dog is about 15 lbs and the food, if she likes it, would a type that she could easily consumed as the pieces are not overly large. When I provided her with a bowl of the food, she licked it and picked out a couple of pieces, rolled over the pieces, and then proceeded to look at me like I was a bad owner.  While this food was not a hit with my dog, I'm sure it would work for a less spoiled dog.

review/summary: I Couldn't Get My Dogs To Like This Food, and They're Usually Not Picky.
review/text: For some reason my dogs just didn't like this food.  I began by mixing it with their regular food (similar ingredients but much cheaper), and they actually picked the pieces of it out.  I have a Golden Retriever, A Golden Retriever/Lab mix, and a Chihuahua/Whippet puppy.  The only one that actually liked the food was the puppy, but she still eats puppy chow, so I didn't give her a lot.<br /><br />The only way I could get my dogs to eat this food was to add something to it, like a little bit of canned food, which they don't normally get.  I found it unusual because they usually aren't picky eaters, but they just didn't like this food.  Since I had a large bag, I had to add something to it every night in order to get through the bag.  They would still leave some food in their bowls, which the chihuahua would eat.<br /><br />I see by the other reviews that most of the dogs loved the food, but for some reason mine were the exception.

When I opened the package of Beneful, I thought "uh oh, these are big bites," but soon discovered that all three dogs love this food, and unlike some of the cheaper kibble on the market with lots of by-products, this doesn't contribute to giving my dogs bad gas.  Even my ten pound Yorkie devours this up!

The name "Beneful" makes you think that it is healthy for your dog, but it really is made up of all the same filler that other inexpensive pet foods are.<br /><br />I'm going to stick with the Purina Healthy Morsels that we were buying before. It is cheaper and it doesn't make my dog stink.

review/summary: Good dog food, but a bit pricey
review/text: Beneful is a well made, healthy food, that meets all of an adult dog's nutritional needs. (Look for the AAFCO statement on any bag of dog food.)  My dog loves the taste, although to be fair she's not a particularly picky eater.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is a bit higher in calories than my normal dog food (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M16UG0">Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition Small Crunchy Bites Original Beef Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound</a>). For dogs that have trouble keeping weight on, Beneful Original is a great food. However, my dog has a tendency to gain weight, and she is much more satisfied with a lower calorie food of which she can have a slightly larger amount.  I have considered trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ3HAY">PURINA Beneful Healthy Weight Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>, and may try it if I can find it on sale, but with a happy and healthy dog on Pedigree, for a much lower price, I'm unlikely to switch any time soon.

review/text: Dogs will eat most anything reasonably edible, the ingredients in this dog food mimic the typical grocery store fare for dogs.  A lot of grit and not much substance.  Still my dog likes the taste as long as he doesn't have something to compare it to he'll eat it.  Before this I get him EVO a healthy blend of ingredients very short on the fillers and artificial colors.  Unfortunately for Beneful, I think it's marketed to owners by looks on the bag and as long as the dog lives and doesn't get appreciably sick people think it's OK.  If you read the ingredients and thought would I eat that, the answer would be a resounding no.  I was hoping this would be as good and wholesome as the last dog food I got on the vine, but no such luck, but the dog likes it, so go figure, I still wouldn't buy more.

He loves this food and when its gone we're going back to his cheaper brand. This is quite a bit more expensive than the Old Roy stuff he gets now.<br /><br />Right on the front it says with wholesome grains and real beef...accented with vitamin rich vegetables.  The first 10 things on the ingredients on the package are this:  ground yellow corn, chicken by product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with a form of vitamin e, rice, flour, beef, soy flour, and sugar.  Sounds wonderful, right?<br /><br />I guess they need all of that to hold the some soft chewy and mostly hard pieces together.  He does love the food but the dog eats cat poo as dessert, how picky can he be?<br /><br />Would I get it again?  No, a little too expensive for my 100 pound dog.  He gets the cheaper stuff that makes gravy when water is added.

He has been picky with dog food in the past so it was a relief to find something he would love eat. However, he gorged until the bowl was empty, he became overweight and her dental health suffered.

review/summary: Most Importantly, the Dogs Love It ...
review/text: I have two healthy male yellow labs ... and they will eat anything (and I do mean ANYTHING).  So, the issue of dog food is a little less, for lack of a better word, "serious" to me.  While I have generally steered away from low-cost brands of dog food for my two furry disposal systems based on  the uninformed belief that cheap=bad; I am not convinced these pricey, ridiculously named superfood brands are anything more than a gimmick.  So, I have traditionally chosen the tried-and-true brand of Purina and although PurinaONE is the staple for our dogs, BENEFUL proved to be a nice change of pace for them.  Another plus is the "zip-loc" type bag the food comes in.<br /><br />The biggest issue that some may have with BENEFUL is that its main protein source is "chicken by-product" (#2 on the ingredient list) while the more substantial protein source of beef is #7 on the ingredient list.  Animal by-products used in animal feed open the possibility of dead or diseased animals being incorporated into the mix, as well as animal parts not fit for human consumption.  The AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) is the monitoring entity for such issues and while they have green-lighted BENEFUL, there is no sure-fire way to determine what comprises chicken by-product in each and every bag of food ... this may be a deal-breaker to some.  On the other hand, most dog owners have probably seen worse things being digested by their beloved pets on a fairly regular basis.<br /><br />Another point that might be a problem for some is the use of grain fillers as the primary ingredients (#1, 3 and 4 on the ingredients list) in BENEFUL ... a likely sticking point for those who prefer "natural" or "organic" diets for their dogs.  Again, this is a personal preference issue for the pet owner.<br /><br />Both my dogs love BENEFUL, which is important to me.  For 40 years, Purina products have been a main source of food for my pets.  I have never encountered any issues with their products and believe the rational point-of-view is that pet food standards have only improved over the years.  I am also a little skeptical of the detrimental claims that generally guide people to purchase more expensive products that emphasize buzzwords like "natural" and "organic" ... as the terms can be very loosely defined and too new to earn government interference regarding their veracity.  There have been too many instances where false or unfounded claims have scared people away from a myriad of consumer products ... so I tend to take grain and by-product issues less seriously.  Obviously, dog food choice is a personal issue between owner and pet and I have no problem incorporating BENEFUL as a change of pace from the PurinaONE on occasion.

review/summary: This is why I don't buy dogfood at the supermarket.
review/text: My dog has been on a healthy dogfood regimen since I got her as a rescue several years ago. I do give her table scraps in moderation, so it's not like she's being tortured by healthy kibble.<br /><br />I figured to mix in the Beneful with her regular food. Not a good idea. She loves it (but then she'll pretty much scarf down anything that doesn't outrun her.) She's been having gas problems ever since I started mixing the foods together.<br /><br />She also seems uncomfortable, like she's got a tummy ache. Corn is the biggest ingredient, so maybe that's the problem; her kibble has meat as the first.<br /><br />I packed up the Beneful (comes in a great resealable bag, which I wish the healthy kibble company would emulate) and sent it off to the dog shelter. I hope some of the pups there can appreciate it more than my dog.

review/summary: Our Dog Can't Eat It
review/text: We have fed our dog Purina Dog Chow and many of the Purina dog treats for years and have come to trust the Purina label. When we decided to try feeding Beneful to our dog, we started gradually, adding a little bit to his regular feeding and then increasing it gradually. We only increased to 1/4 of our dog's regular feeding when he started having problems with upset stomach and eating grass all the time and seemed to lose his appetite. We stopped feeding the Beneful and within a couple of days he was back to his old self. We decided to try again, and had the same results. I don't have a clue what makes this food intolerable to our pet, but I am truly surprised that a Purina product is causing this problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with these results, I cannot recommend Beneful as the healthy and nutritious food that is portrayed on the packaging.

review/text: It's kind of hard for a person to review dog food, especially if you have a dog who likes almost any kind of food.  Given that constraint, my dog really likes this dog food.  Also, it's a trusted brand and the ingredients seem well chosen.  Not sure how much more I can do to evaluate this product.  If your dog is a picky eater, you may get a different experience, but, my dog would like seconds.

review/summary: Murphy loves it!!
review/text: First and foremost, Amazon shipped fast, arrived undamaged, great job amazon. So I have been feeding my dog Costco brand dog food, which Murphy (my english Black lag) woofs down in seconds. I decided to treat him to some Purina and mix it in with his costco brand food, and he really woofed it down. I could tell he was happy. Yes, Its dog food, and my dog would probably eat cabbage if I threw it in the bowl, so their is no telling the quality or taste of this Purina Beneful food. If Murphy is happy, then all is good. Lets just hope he doesn't get doggie gas after a few servings. Overall, I recommend this product.

review/summary: Dogs Liked it, but First Ingredient is Corn
review/text: The dogs were all over this bag and considering my two dogs weigh over 100 lbs each, that's a lot of dog. Opening the bag was easy with a quick snip of the scissors and closing the bag was especially nice as it had a zip lock zipper type closing. The kind with a little plastic tab that lets you slide it close. Nice. The bag was plastic, so the dog food stayed nice and fresh for my pooches while in the bag. Another nice point.<br /><br />I poured out a cup for each of them, both dogs gobbled it down and looked at me for more. Hmm. With their usual dog food they give me a pained look and shuffle over to the bowl with a "I suppose" attitude. So, I checked the bag and no wonder they were all gung-ho. The main ingredient was corn. Thrown in there was a bunch of other stuff that basically made it doggy junk food. I mean, they can live off the stuff, but it's not going to keep them as healthy as something with say MEAT as the first ingredient.<br /><br />I usually feed them the Costco brand of dog food, which by the way is highly rated among those into rating dog food. Don't laugh, they're out there. So, to keep the family canines from giving me the hairy eyeball, I mixed the Beneful in with their usual kibble. They of course picked out the Beneful bits, leaving the rest behind. But you know fur kids. They never know what's good for them. Heck, they'd eat the cat poop out of the litter box if I'd let them. I think we'll be sticking to the usual healthy, yet not as tasty, Costco dog food. But I might throw in some<br />Beneful as a little treat, like on movie night or something.

review/text: If you are looking for something that does not have any corm or corn by products this is not what you want.  While this is not one of the best brands of food out for our canine family, it is far from the worse.  If you were to compare it to our food, it is fast food for dogs, tasty but not nutritious.  I mix it with the food that she should eat all the time, but will in the bowl until she is starving if I don't mix something that is "tastier" to her.

review/summary: Great food, convenient to get from Amazon
review/text: Our dogs have only ever eaten Beneful and they love it. What I wanted to mention in this review is the idea of ordering a large bag of dog food from Amazon. There was no extraneous packaging, just the box for the food, which was sized correctly. Having recently had shoulder surgery, I can't lift a bag of dog food in, out, in, and back out of a shopping cart, then a car. People who use public transportation probably don't consider buying pet food in large quantities, even though it saves money per portion. I liked the convenience of having this delivered to my doorstep. The food was fresh and, as usual, the dogs loved it.

But this one they gobbled up like there was no tomorrow and they even chased the cats away from their bowls.<br /><br />The first night I fed them with this I heard a rustling from under my bed and found that my miniture beagle had dragged the whole bag under the bed and was in the process of mouwing down on the food.<br /><br />The zipper closure really worked well until it was chewed open.  I went out and bought another bag and they are still happy with their food.

This size bag will be gone in no time, so I have to order more now.

review/summary: My dogs love it!
review/text: I have 2 Dachshunds; one is just under 2 years old and the other is around 11 years old. I have, over the years, fed them all kinds of dog food. Some of the most expensive high quality foods and some of the cheapest low quality food. Generally they react pretty much the same to either. So when it comes to Beneful (which I'd consider to be in the middle), I was quite happy to see them greatly enjoy it. They love the flavor of it, and they stay energetic & healthy while on the Beneful diet. There are no adverse reactions or problems associated with them eating this. In fact, I'd say they seem to do better with it and enjoy it better than many of the more expensive dog foods I've given them, so I plan to keep them on Beneful for quite a while. It's a good quality food. I'd recommend it!

review/text: This is my Bichon's favorite food that we have tried.  It does have soy in it.  Usually soy gives him very smelly gas.  I don't know if there is less in Beneful or if it is just processed differently but he doesn't have a problem with this food.  With Beneful, his stools have been small solid and uniform.  His digestive tract is pretty finicky so several foods we have tried have given him loose stools.<br /><br />This is also the only dog food he doesn't root through to pick out all his favorite pieces first.  He eats it all with enthusiasm.  My cat also likes it and will happily steal it if we don't watch her.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a fair price for a product that my dog really likes.

review/summary: My Terrier loves it.
review/text: My 25-pound Wheaton Terrier mix was hooked on the Beneful the first time she had it.  Previously I was using the Nature's Variety Prairie Chicken food and while she would eat it eventually she wasn't as enthusiastic about it as she is the Beneful.  My bet is she likes the Beneful better since the food pieces are not hard and crunchy, but rather are ever so slightly mushy and moist.  The food pieces are a few different shapes and colors and are about the size of large blueberries.<br /><br />If I have one reservation about the Beneful it is this - my dog's stools are much smaller and harder since the switch.  Now most people would find this a bonus, and indeed I'm really glad the Beneful didn't give her diarrhea, but the healthiest type of stool is that which is slightly soft.<br /><br />The bag is sturdy and has a nice zipper seal to keep the food fresh.<br /><br />Lastly, if you're switching your dog's food make sure to transition them over the course of a week, so the new food doesn't shock their system and give them diarrhea.<br /><br />All in all...the dog loves it, but I'm not fond of the tiny stools.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I first started using Purina Beneful for my dog about 3 years ago when she put on extra weight and the vet recommended it to us. They actually recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ3HAY">PURINA Beneful Healthy Weight Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>, but now that she is doing better I thought I'd give this one a try. I found that over the last couple weeks she enjoyed her meals just the same and we haven't noticed any weight gain (she is a small dog and it's easy to see when her weight fluctuates.)<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and feel comfident that I can swap this one out when it's cheaper - I've seen this one go on sale more frequently than the Healthy Weight - with no negative response from my dog (or complaints from my vet.) Beneful has been my family's dog food of choice for years and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: She ate it...that's a plus!
review/text: Dog food is a somewhat tough thing to give a review on, but I'll give it a try.  We have a English Mastiff who is 10 � years old and weighs about 165 pounds.  She started out eating Iams dog food for about the first 5 years when we switched her over to Purina Dog Chow.  Since that time we have been given/bought two other brands of dog food and our dog wouldn't touch either brand.  One was Kibbles and Bits and one was Science Diet-we attempted the "mixing in" of the dog food but she would pick out her normal food and leave the rest.  Purina Beneful was an Amazon Vine choice this month and I thought I would give it a try.  Our dog didn't notice a bit of difference between her Dog Chow and Beneful.  I did not notice any changes in her stool during this change or any "other" side affects.  Our healthy "picky eater" Mastiff had no problems with this food and I would buy it again....hey, she likes it and at her age, she might as well enjoy what she can with the time she has left!

review/text: We have a rat terrier who normally eats can food (more often than not she raids the cat food dishes).  She loved this!  It's the first time in years that she preferred her own food over the cat's food. It is a little pricey, but the resealable bag was very convenient and kept the bag fresh and ant free even stored in the garage until it was empty (which we've had trouble with in the past since we only have one small dog).

review/summary: My dogs don't care for it
review/text: I tried this product long ago, and couldn't remember how well my three dachshunds liked it. I've been feeding them this for several days, gradually introducing it. I typically mix canned food with their meal at night, give a little more dry in the mornings if they cleaned their bowls the night before. Well, there's lots of Beneful left every morning. I generally feed my dogs Purina Little Bites or Pedigree small breed. This isn't the best dog food or the worst, but I give the what I can afford and I do read the labels. They've all lived to be very old dogs; my oldest is 17, so I must be doing something right. However, they just don't like Beneful, with or without canned food. I think it's a bit pricier than what I usually get also, but not sure about that. I do know my dogs gave this food a bad review.

review/text: When I was given the opportunity to review this product, I was wondering how can I as a "human" review it in relation to what a dog would think of it. I decided to start with what the ingredients are and end with what my 2 year old dog Bo's reaction was when I poured the Purina Beneful into his bowl.<br />I read the ingredients and it contains chicken and beef as well as vegetables and some other ingredients that to be honest I am not too sure what they are ( a little concerning, but I did some research on the internet for some of the ingredients and they are all safe). I then checked the nutrition label and found that it contains protein, calcium, vitamins and minerals, carbohydrates, and iron. All these ingredients are an essential part of any dogs diet.<br />Now came the most important part, would my dog Bo like to eat it? I cleaned out his bowl which contained his regular dog food and filled it up with the Purina Beneful. Most days when I feed Bo he leisurely eats his food, but when he walked over to the bowl filled with Purina Beneful he started quickly eating it! I have not seen him enjoy a bowl of food so much before. He was wagging his tail, eating, and then after he ate the whole bowl he looked at me as if asking for more. I am definitely switching to Purina Beneful for Bo's meals. I want to make sure he enjoys his food and gets the nutrition he needs.

review/summary: Dogs Love The Taste
review/text: I have three little dogs. We generally handle feeding them by leaving out some dry food for them all day and then giving them a small meal of meat and rice in the evening. Sometimes they're fairly picky about the dog food that they get and refused to eat certain brands. My general position was that we leave it out until they get hungry enough to eat it, but my wife usually override that and just tossed it. Then we started getting the Beneful a few years ago and we haven't had that issue since.<br /><br />They definitely enjoy the meaty chunks (or whatever the chunks are) very much. As some other reviewer mentioned, the dog will go for that first. Mine will often dump the food out onto the floor and then find the chunks they want and eat those. I could see this being a problem if they only ate the chunks, because that wouldn't be good for their dental health; they're far too soft brush their teeth. Since we don't usually put very much out of the time, the dogs are forced to eat the crunchier bits as well to be full.  They nearly always clean up the mess they made by late afternoon.<br /><br />Our dogs have been eating this stuff for years and have been very healthy. Other than routine shots, only one of them has had to go to the vet for anything else. When they have been in the office, the vet has said that they appeared healthy. I'm not sure how much of that is the food and how much of that is just luck or genetics, but either way this brand seems to work well for us.  I'm not sure if we'll start getting this delivered routinely by Amazon or not, but well likely stick to this brand until they get tired of it.

review/text: As at least one other reviewer has noted this product is a bit difficult to review given the fact I have not eaten any. Thus, I dont know for sure about the taste, etc. However, I have three dogs and will give my impression of their take on Benful plus some comments on the labeling and ingredients as listed.<br /><br />My three dogs have eaten this food without any real complaints but they do not wait with much anticipation when I am preparing it. They sometimes pick out various shapes and sizes and over time will finish their meal but it definately is not their favorite. They have not had any apparent digestion problems.<br /><br />The label gives one the impression that their is a healthy amount of beef in the bag but if you read the label closely beef is down the list and the list of ingredients is lengthy. It contains some items such as chicken by-products that should give your imigination a real work out.<br />That said, in all fairness the list of ingredients is no longer or questionable than many other brands in the same class. That is, this is an OK dog food that will not win any awards for wholesomeness, etc. but will work for those looking for a relatively inexpensive food. I would urge the reader to compare the list of ingredients with other more expensive foods to get an idea of the real differences.

review/summary: Superior Dog Food
review/text: Reading the ingredients of the Beneful dog food product reveals that there is a solid basis for nutrition for your dog.  The main ingredient is corn and then chicken.  To be honest, the meat products should be the number one ingredient for any pet food, and Beneful falls down on this score.  But it's a matter of small percentages, really, and the rest of the product is fine.<br /><br />But the real test is how your dog likes the product.  And my dog really liked it, better than Purina Dog Chow, her main food these days.  So I'd rate the dog food to be superior to Dog Chow in the all important 'taste test'.<br /><br />It's a good idea to review your dog food choice with your vet, and I haven't had a chance to do that yet.  However, based on his previous 'OK' for Dog Chow, I'm sure he'll approve of Beneful.<br /><br />And most importantly, our German Shepherd likes the food.  (I do add canned food to the dry food for extra protein and nutrition.  This was also a recommendation of the vet.)

review/summary: It does have veggies and meat but how much?
review/text: The Beneful bag is quite striking showing lots of fresh veggies leading a person to think that it would be chock full of veggies and vitamins which would be good for a dog.  Unlike another reviewer who claimed it had neither meat or veggies I did read farther down the ingredients list.  The very first ingredient is ground yellow corn.  Well, ok corn is a veggie but it is not what I want to see as the first ingredient in my dog's food.  Chicken by-product meal is the next item which I suppose could qualify as "meat" but is it ground beaks, bones, feathers, or what?  The fourth item is whole wheat flour so that covers the wheat shown on the bag.  Where's the beef you may ask?  Beef is listed as the 7th ingredient but I'll give you dollars to donuts that it isn't ground sirloin.  To get to the carrots and peas you'll find them listed as ingredients 19 and 20.<br /><br />Now that we have that sorted out, did my dogs like it?  I have four dogs in my house and we have an open-feeding system.  The dogs include an Australian Kelpie, a Kelpie/Heeler mix, a older Yellow Lab and a beautiful and very active 75 lb. Heinz 57.  Over the years I've fed them  everything from Ol' Roy Complete to some very expensive premium dog foods.  The only food they seemed to universally dislike was the Science Diet brand.  When feeding them the Purina Beneful I saw some interesting behaviors.  The Lab is picky about her food and I found her taking small bites and spitting out the pieces she didn't like.  The Kelpie/Heeler mix starting taking a mouthful of food from the bowl, taking it to the living room, dropping it then sniffing each piece eating what he liked the smell of and leaving the rest.  Only the Kelpie and the Heinz 57 seemed to eat normally and the Kelpie would go over and clean up whatever the Kelpie/Heeler had left behind.<br /><br />Because of the behavior of my dogs I don't believe the Beneful is something I'm going to continue to feed them.  When 2 of them pick at their food and only eat what they like there is a possibility they won't be getting all of the nutritional benefits of the food.  As a side note, I also have 3 cats.  Two of them loved picking through the Beneful picking out the softer pieces.  I don't promote cats eating dog food since it can actually be harmful to their systems, but thought it was curious that 2 of them investigated this dog food.<br /><br />In conclusion.  I don't plan to buy this to feed my dogs for several reasons and for each reason deducted a star from the possible 5-star rating.  Corn (probably in meal form) is the first ingredient.  Two dogs obviously found pieces they didn't like and wouldn't eat them.  Thus the deduction of another star.  Finally, the cost/benefit ratio just isn't there.  If I chose to I could buy Ol' Roy Complete for them at Walmart which actually lists more vitamins and has a somewhat similar list of ingredients.  Also the Ol' Roy is a 44 lb. bag which sells for about 25% less than the 15.5 lb. Beneful.  As is, I'll stick with the Premium brand I currently buy for them.<br /><br />Sorry Purina, this one just didn't cut it in my house.

review/summary: Not the nutrition it claims
review/text: I received this product to review via the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />My Siberian Husky likes this food, but he's not overeager to eat it. However, I won't be buying it for him, even if he thought it were the best thing on the planet. Corn as its first and main ingredient tells me a lot about the nutrition. Sure, dogs are omnivores, but they're not meant to eat diets THAT high in grains!<br /><br />I also find the "Beneful" name and its description of the product to be misleading. The name of the product suggests that it's healthier than other dog foods, but anyone feeding this to their dog would have about the same health benefits (or lack thereof) as any other non-premium dog food<br /><br />It passed my dog's taste test in that he eats it, and it doesn't make him sick, hence the rating of more than one star. My response is after reading the ingredient list was to start mixing it with his regular, premium dog foods, which are healthier... like his grain free products. That eliminates the other stars.<br /><br />The health of my pets is paramount. My last dog, an 85 lbs pound pup (we THINK a Shiloh shepherd or a Malamute / Belgian Tervuren mix), lived to 18 years on the premium dog foods I fed him and his home-made jerky treats where I use extra lean ground meat (usually turkey), jerky seasonings, and Dog Bloom VM Supreme dog vitamins (powdered, with real cheddar cheese powder to give it added flavor).

review/summary: Beneful Doggie Food
review/text: Our dog loves this brand of dog food, but normally eats a different variation of Purina.  She does have trouble with food sometimes because her stomach is sensitive, but I still wanted to give this brand a shot.  So we got this bag and mixed a little of the old version in with this one when we gave it to her.  It has been about two weeks now and she is doing just fine and loves the food.  We are happy that we have found another version of Purina that she can eat so we can mix it up a little for her.

review/text: Actually, my dog loved the food.  The food looks and smells good! The bag is very strong and I do love the handy zipper top. Most concerns are with the corn, wheat, and chicken by products.  Some say you should not feed a dog corn.  However, whenever we eat corn-on-the-cob in the summer, we always give our dog the cobs.  He seems to enjoy getting the corn soaked in butter bits off the cob.<br /><br />Other dry dog foods, he has not been too happy with.  He has a rather sensitive digestive system, but did not seem to be effected switching directly over to this new food.

review/summary: My puppy-person ate like a pig.
review/text: I did notice that even though the main ingredient is corn, my puppy-person did not have gas problems and I did not see her eating grass.  I will assume it did not upset her stomach.<br /><br />I liked the zip lock on the top of the bag.  Granted, if the bag was full and spilled over, the zip lock wouldn't help and it probably doesn't keep the food fresh because there is still a ton of air in the bag.  But, I feel the zip lock keeps out bugs.<br /><br />Some of the cons of the food are food coloring.  Really?  My puppy-person is color blind. Another problem was the second ingredient is "chicken by-product meal".  I guess that means guts.  While I have a problem eating guts, my girl does not.  (She'd roll in it if you let her.)  I just don't see that as being nutritious, which the front of the bag depicts a healthy dog with whole foods around it.

review/text: The first ingredient is corn.  Not that that's unusual for dog food.  I'm a Purina Pro Plan fan myself.  I gave the Beneful food a try with my dog and didn't care at all for the moist (food dyed) pieces.  Its obviously made, packaged and marketed to attract humans -- certainly not dogs!  Few dogs, if turned loose to fend for themselves, would head for the vegetable garden.  It's not cheap, so spend your money on a meat based food.

review/summary: Dogs Liked It
review/text: I was wondering how my dogs would like Purina Beneful after they had feasted on the 'elite' dog food of the day before. I thought would they think they are having a hamburger now and be upset because yesterday they had steak. Well, let's see.  My dogs are nosey and always come running when they hear you opening a bag, somehow they know it has something in it for them.  The food looked good and didn't have a bad smell. Some dog food will knock you out with the ugly smell they  produce.  I made up their bowls and also did some bowls with their normal food and set them down.  They sniffed at first and gave me the look. I suppose they were wondering where that steak tasting food was that they had had the day before.  However, one of them finally took a few bites, than another and than another. The other dogs looked at them and ran over to their bowls and began to eat as well.  They finished all the bowls and left their usual food sitting there. Hum.....they seemed to like it, not love it but like it. I'm not sure if I would change from the food I give them now to this one. It usually takes about a month to see if they will continue to eat a dog food, so we'll have to see. I'd say they liked it but better than their usual - well we'll have to wait and see.

review/summary: My picky dog loves it!
review/text: I have a Shih Tzu who is a very picky eater.  And I mean picky.  He will only eat certain treats, certain dog food and even certain table foods (I know, technically you are not suppose to feed table foods, but we do).  He LOVES Beneful dog food!!  It is, by far his preferred food - even over the more expensive brands.  We also have two large outside dogs - a Newfoundland and a mix breed who both gobble this stuff up like no tomorrow.  The soft chewy chunks add a nice combination for the dogs to enjoy, I think, and the flavor seems to appeal to them greatly.  The bag does state that it is made with real beef, however beef is like the 8th ingredient listed, so I am not sure exactly how much real beef is in the food.  Otherwise it does seem to be very healthy as all our dogs are very active, vital and healthy with shiny coats.<br /><br />As a pet owner, I feel confident feeding this to my dogs as well. The ingredients are good - though,granted, not the best - ground yellow corn and chicken by-product meal being the first two in the ingredient list, but with table scraps they get enough real meat.  The price is reasonable and (I know, this should technically hold no bearing, but is something that I love) the zip close bag is wonderful.  Beneful is a dog food that we will be using for years and one that I highly recommend dog owners to try, if they haven't already!

I think the quality is very good and the product is priced well.  I've never been convinced that the expensive "premium" brands are really that much better. I'm not aware of any studies that demonstrate that they are better. Our dog really likes this brand.

Overall I am very pleased and can recommend this product.

review/text: My dog, a big Lab/Chow mix has a very sensitive stomach and this food was one of the ones that set right with him.  The wrapping on this package keeps it fresh, I wish more brands would do that instead of the cheap paper you rip off.  I do often by a more expensive brand for him, but this is a great fallback and much cheaper.  Even the more expensive ones often reaped havoc on his stomach and I had to find ones that worked well with him.  I think he likes the taste and texture of the Beneful so my happy dog rates this well!  I drop it a star because the ingredients are that of a 2nd tier food instead of solid nutrition.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves It; Resealable Bag
review/text: The most important thing to me when choosing a dog food is: Will my dog eat it or will he ignore it and work hard to people food. The last brand of dog food resulted in the latter. Purinal beneful: The former. He seems to really like it. The bowl gets emptied quickly.<br /><br />I have a Chihuahua so it is important that the kibbles be manageable size. He has absolutely no problem with these kibbles and isn't picky about which one he gets although he does seem to eat the green ones first.<br /><br />And finally, storage is always a problem. Our dog (5 pounds) will take forever to go through a bag like this. So the built-in ziplock on the bag top makes it so that we no longer have to transfer our dog food out of the container and into a plastic sealable tub.<br /><br />After reading the other reviewers concerns about the ingredients and comparing the ingredients to some higher end brands, this does seem to be inferior (a lot heavier on fillers) to the more expensive brands but in line with the others of this price range. We generally pick the best bargain among dog foods. If you are looking for the best nutrition regardless of price, you may want to look elsewhere.

review/summary: My dogs were begging for it!
review/text: My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. Whenever I try new dog food I risk having my dogs sick all over the floor. I have been feeding them food from the vet, but it just costs so much and we couldn't afford to keep buying food from the vet so I had to try something new. Enter, Purina Beneful Original Dog Food. I opened the bag and was immediately pleased with the zipper seal opening and that the food didn't have any strange smell. I gave it to my dogs and stood back, wondering if they would like it, and fearful of what was to come later once they digested it! They immediately got to eat and LOVED it! I still wasn't convinced because I didn't know if we would pay later with stinky gas or upset stomachs. I am happy to say that this didn't bother their stomach one bit! Their poops were solid, they had no gas and got excited every time they say the bag of food. One day the bag of food was on the counter and one of my dogs tried to jump up to get it, he loves it so much! I am so happy to have found Purina Beneful because not only are my dogs happy with the taste, I don't have to suffer from the side effects of bad dog food on their stomach!

review/text: One of my dogs is pretty weird, she will try to eat any treat I give to her and try to snatch my food out of my hands, but she can be extremely picky when it comes to her dog food.  But after a few sniffs, she started eating the Purina Beneful Dog Food right up.  My other dog is less picky but he is old and just had a couple more teeth pulled a couple months ago so if the pieces are too big he will have to quit after a few bite.  But he had no problems eating the pieces of Beneful.  The package does zip close which is probably the best way to keep it fresh and with 15.5 pounds it has taken my dogs about two months to finish off, so I need to keep it fresh as possible for a while.

I do try different brands but when I need something that will work for every day use, I usually buy this. I picked this because it has soft morsels, which I thought my smaller dog would be able to chew better. I know the main ingredient is corn, but I have to believe that the formulation isn't going to kill him. Sure, there may be higher quality foods out there, at a higher price, and I've tried a few, but my dog looks and acts the same and eats them just like he eats Beneful.

review/text: This is one of the few brands I buy for my puggle. She loves it but never overeats which is a plus for us. She normally eats and eats and eats. I have to carefully monitor her consumption or she gets pudgy like a pug. So it's good to fill her bowl w Beneful and watch her eat till full....and then stop! She will go back to it throughout the day and knowing exactly how much she eats in a day makes monitoring her diet that much easier. She's not too picky and we're not too fancy so she usually gets whichever of the major brands happens to be cheapest when we buy. Im not concerned w the tendons and such since dogs do eat such things, but I am concerned w the sugar, and the corn, which produces more sugar. Sugar is killing us all so I will monitor if there are any changes in her weight or health. The package is large and was shipped well. Very convenient, but slightly higher price than in stores, but that just might be worth it for the convenience.

review/summary: The dogs love it
review/text: It's very hard to comment on dog food honestly without having tasted it. While this does indeed look suspiciously like breakfast cereal when you open it up (next time I eat Trix I'm probably going to have to fight the urge to hike my leg at the nearest tree), the smell will immediately kill any desire to pour some in a bowl with milk and have at it. We have two easy-going dogs who will eat practically anything you put in front of them and they didn't hesitate to tear into this either. I asked their opinion but I can't repeat what they said since my knowledge of doglish is very limited, but their tails were wagging which I considered a good sign. The only thing I can comment on safely is the price. Compared to other bags of dog food (20 lb bags from their competitors, while this is only a 15 lb bag) the price is a little steep. I'm not sure how this truly does affect their standard of living and if it does indeed create healthy bones but I guess time will tell. I will update this in twenty years and if the dogs are still living I will sing the praises of Beneful to the masses.

review/text: First of all, the dogs love Purina Beneful. I've got three, and with the exception of Iams, this is their favorite food. I also have a problem with stomach upset with the dogs. Fortunately, they never have an issue with Beneful.<br /><br />The nutrition isn't top-tier as far as dog food goes. There are a few ingredients that give me pause (for example, corn meal and sugar, and I'm not a fan of chicken filler, either). But it isn't all-out terrible, either, and again--the dogs love it, and it doesn't hurt their stomachs.<br /><br />Another reviewer recommended going with this dog food if the dogs prefer it, but to supplement their diet with table scraps and the like. I agree. My dogs will even eat vegetables (we've got tomato and pumpkin plants in our yard, and they eat more of the veggies than the people do.) If nutrition is a concern, supplement it as best you can.<br /><br />Overall, I like Beneful. It makes my dogs happy, and again--it doesn't hurt them the way some other big-brand dog foods do. I recommend it.

review/text: We used to use Pedigree, but then we switched to Purina Dog Chow.  This Beneful must taste just like the Purina Dog chow food, because my beagle ate every bit of it.  He's a finicky dog.  I love the bag, it has a zip top, so there's no cutting and pouring into a nother container. It stays fresh in this bag. My two dogs had no bad stomach reaction to it like they had when we tried other dry foods.  I would recommend it!

review/summary: PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food
review/text: This has great health benefits for your dog and the flavors must be great because I gave her some after she just got done eating her regular Purina dog chow and she still ate 2 handfulls of this. I'm going to give her a handful a day because it just cost too much for me to give her just this. She's an outside dog on the farm and gets lot of exercise and she would go through this 15.5 lb. bag in 5 days if I let her. I think the benefits will be especially good for her as she is 15 years old.

review/summary: Great quality dog food
review/text: I've bought the beneful "wet" food and my dog loves it.  The same goes with their dry food.<br /><br />I like mixing both dry and wet food together for my dog's meals.<br /><br />The dry food are in decent bite size morsels (my dog is small/medium size--an 11 lb. maltese) and looks like quality stuff!<br /><br />My dog never leaves a morsel behind in his bowl when he eats it, so, I would say "thumbs up" for Beneful!

review/summary: Great Deal for this Size
review/text: I own a purebred Chow Chow and he is very particular about what he eats. Most of the time he will only eat cat food, so when he decides to eat solid foods it makes my life a lot easier. I was surprised that he ate this as it's not any special type or flavor. But he is fond of the Beneful and I'd say his coat looks nicer when we feed him Purina stuff. It doesn't have a strong smell like some other foods, so it won't make you sick when you open it. The price is just really good for how much food you're getting. I've paid this much for a 7 lb bag at a pet store. And there is a good balance of ingredients.

review/text: My two dogs, a chiweiner and rot/chow, love this food. I put in down and it's gone. They've eaten it all their lives and have excellent health. It is more expensive than other dry dog foods but I think it's worth it to keep them healthy, happy and fit. I read other people's concerns about it's nutruitional value but I'm happy it's not horse meat or made in China. Most importantly, my dogs are thriving.

review/summary: Like most items, results vary
review/text: We have an older (13 year old) border collie mix who needs the balance of some grain for her teeth.  While she prefers canned dog food, her vet recommended a mix of the two.  She was rather neutral on this particular mix, but our son's two larger, younger mixed breed dogs found it delightful immediately.<br /><br />I believe one might have a concern relating to the contents of the grain, as it does have a certain percentage of filler and non-meat items.  On the other hand, one must address the needs of each dog individually and not all dogs need or want a heavy meat diet.  This is competitively priced at a bit more than $1 per pound, and deserves consideration.  Overall, I rate this a 4 star recommendation<br /><br />Dr. John Hogan<br />HospitalityEducators<br />Hogan Hospitality

review/summary: Use to supplement my regular dogfood!
review/text: First of all, I have 8 dogs..all are rescued and loved!  I can't afford to just feed them Beneful on it's own.  I buy it to add to their store brand and they love it!  The original formula is best.  They like the crunchy moister bits and I've even seen a couple of my "kids" take a mouthful out, drop on the floor..then pick out those pieces first!  This costs over a dollar a pound where I live, but, as I said, as a supplement it's just something great and healthy that I am able to do for my dogs.  I also followed my vet's advice several years ago and started using carrots for the dogs treats..5 lb bag every week and way better for them than rawhide chews!  Great product, wish was cheaper :)

review/summary: Good balance and she likes it
review/text: Tender vittles, as colorful as a box of kids' cereal, this really enticing food.  The dog really likes it.  She eats a full bowl and leaves just a little.  True, she's more excited about eating the long-dead fish down at the lake, but I'm definitely more excited about this food.  I haven't served this to her for very long to say whether it affects her health positively or negatively, but I did have a dog whose hair would fall out if he ate corn.  I like that this food has alot of different food groups, not just meat... dogs are omnivorous like humans.  Some dogs don't handle grains well, but if she can handle it well in the long-term, this is probably the food I would choose to keep buying for her.  Except for the food coloring--please--if they love stinky fish, do they care what color the food is?

review/text: When I really want to give my dogs a treat, I buy Beneful and they do a dance. They eat it like it's dessert, and it certainly seems to do everything that a dog food should. Their health stays good, their eyes bright and their coats dense and shiny. It even smells like something nice and not some kind of old dog-foody smell. I know they say that there are all kinds of good things in there, but mostly, I look at my dogs.

review/summary: Yorkie Somewhat Less Than Enthusiastic
review/text: Fifteen pounds of dog food -- and a Yorkie who suggests I keep it in the bag where it obviously belongs.  In her defense, I should add that this is a dog who has been raised on dry dog food (and the occasional bit of cat chow and hamburger when she can snag a morsel), so her opinion is not based on the difference between kibble and canned food.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, I am not surprised at her lack of enthusiasm.  The first ingredient is yellow corn meal, with corn gluten meal coming in at third place.  Chicken byproduct meal is also in the top ingredients.  And I'm still looking for real meat -- the kind that dogs go for.  Certainly, this product has lots of vitamins and minerals, plus fish oil, so there are ingredients to be pleased about, but, on the whole, those vitamins and minerals won't do much good if the dog goes on a hunger strike.  So it's back to the expensive stuff for this Yorkie.  Glad she doesn't eat like a Great Dane!

review/text: This came in the mail the other day and my dog (Miniature Pinscher) was jumping all over it while I was unwrapping it. He can be picky with food and dog treats, but he's been eating this the past few days, so I'd say it's a hit.<br /><br />But I looked up info online today about best and worst dog foods, and sadly Beneful is on all of the "worst" lists I saw. But then again, so is Iams, and that is one I always used to see being sold and endorsed at the veterinarian's and humane societies, and always heard it was a good brand. So I really have no idea what or why one food is considered better than another. Pedigree and Purina are also on some of the lists. Many of the brand names I see in the stores are. But I can't afford organic foods for my family and can't afford them for my pets either. Guess I'll have to look more into it. It's up to your discretion on what you feel about it.<br /><br />I take off one star just because I did not see this food on any of the "best" lists. But most of the foods on the bests lists were ones I had never heard of or seen before.

This purina beneful was no exception.<br />So if you have a picky dog like mine, be warned. but all dogs are different, so i recommend you try a smaller size of this first; maybe your dog will like it and eat it consistently.

review/text: I have to say that this is the only dry dog food that my dog has consistently wolfed down at one sitting!  Normally she'll leave half a bowl for later if she's hungry and in between, she'll beg for treats or other goodies as may be available.  I'm very impressed with the packaging (it has a zip lock at the top and was very easy to open) and the freshness and quality of this food.  Seeing as it comes from PURINA, a HUGE name in the dog food industry, I'm not really shocked at the quality as this company usually comes through with great tasting food and treats.<br /><br />If you have a fussy dog, this is the food for you.  It's fresh and obviously pleased my fussy eater!  One other idea, is sometimes I will mix the Beneful dog food (the moist food) with this dry food as an added incentive and that always does the trick!  It adds a nice texture that seems to please.

He had been eating "reluctantly" the last few weeks as compared to his normal gobbling.<br /><br />So far, so good, and I trust any pet foods from Purina.<br /><br />One problem....it's not sold at Costco in our area, but Walmart does carry it.

review/summary: Depends on the Dog
review/text: I am the owner of two large mixed breed dogs.  Both are good eaters and neither has health problems.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The Purina Beneful Original Dog Food bag is easy to open and has a great slide lock once open to keep the food fresh.  Visually, the food looks appealing (not that this matters much to the dogs) and it is bite size, so if you have a dog that eats quickly, as some dogs will, it is easier for them to digest.<br /><br />The directions indicate you should transition the change-over of food over 7-10 days, adding a little more of the Beneful each day.<br />On day one, my larger dog (around 85 pounds) picked out a few pieces of the new food from the old food, but ate most of what had been added in.  By day two, he was picking out more pieces and waited a bit to eat, clearly not as delighted with the larger portion of the new food mixed in; though he did eventually eat his nightly meal.<br /><br />My smaller dog (around 65 pounds) had no trouble with the smaller portion mixed in the first day, or the larger portion added the second day.  She cleaned her bowl both days.<br /><br />Neither of my dogs is a particularly picky eater but clearly, the Beneful doesn't appeal as much to one of them.  He'll eat it but clearly prefers his other food.<br /><br />I gave the product 4 stars because if I only had my second dog, who loves it, it would be a 5 star rating.  Since it seems to not appeal equally to all dogs, I've given it 4 stars.  If I only had my first dog and he continued to show resistance to it, I'd probably stop using it after the first bag was gone.  But to be fair, any time you change a dog's food you take the risk of how they will react to it. Overall, it seems worth trying the Beneful to see if your dog will take to it.

review/text: I must begin by saying my dogs are very picky.  They would not eat this food.  I am disappointed to take a look at the ingredients list, because this is pitched as one of the "healthy" dog foods, with the packaging showing meat and vegetables, yet it is chock full of corn meal and chicken by products.<br /><br />Also, this food is not the right size kibble for smaller dogs like mine.  I will stick with the small dog formula of a food where the first ingredient listed is meat.

review/summary: Tastes Great!
review/text: I was very pleased when this arrived at the door - opened it immediately & dug in - wasn't till later when my wife got home & told me it was for the dog, not me.<br /><br />Just kidding - our dog does like this Beneful, we get many compliments on her smooth coat, she's fit, full of fun & energy & very healthy. Dry dog food has added advantage if you have to curb your pet. Dogs do like variety too, Beneful has several different flavors, you may want to change it up every other bag or so. This 15.5 lb bag lasts about a month for our 50 lb Lab.<br /><br />Sounds funny for a dog to be eating corn, tomatoes & other veggies, the reality is these ingredients are fillers to keep the cost down. Other brands may be 'healthier' but are going to be more expensive. We selected this brand because that is what the rescue center fed her and our vet said this was fine.

review/summary: My picky dog loves it
review/text: My picky dog loves this stuff.  He will only eat a few types of dog food and this is one.  He prefers the taste of Beneful to any other brand we've tried.  He has a flea allergy so I had put him on a raw diet, but he wouldn't hardly eat it either and kept breaking out so we knew it wasn't gluten - but he was leaving raw meat in his bowl, so we had to stop that too.  He is REALLY picky.<br />I wish the nutritional content of Beneful and the ingredients were better, but my dog won't eat the 'better' dog foods anyway.  With Beneful, he at leasts eats good and acts happy, and with his allergy problems, at least he can be happy with his food.<br />I do have a problem that the cats like Beneful too, and steal it from his bowl.  Dog food is not good for cats and the dog catching them is not good for cats, but I figure it must be pretty tasty for the cats to want it too.  I read it was sprayed with 'animal digest' which is hydrolized unspecified animal parts.  It sounds really gross but it must make it taste better.<br />I wish they would not put artificial colors in it.  Dogs can't see color anyway from what I understand.

review/text: I have two dogs, a Shih Tzu and a Lhasa Apso.  I have tried a lot of brands and they seem to eat this one and prefer it to others.  My dog once suffered from back problems until after researching I saw that he needed vitamin C.  This dog food includes vegetables, not just meat and protien.  He has had no more back problems.  Dogs need vitamin c and I read about a vet who raises dogs and she has never had a dog with a back problems because she gives them supplements, but this is a good source of both for your dogs.

review/text: After reading the description about the healthy ingredients, I was disappointed to find that the protein items were still at the bottom of the list. While the corn may not be corn meal, as many other brands have, it is still the primary ingredient.<br /><br />My dogs did eat it without fuss. However, I noticed them returning to their food bin (we free feed) more often during the day. It was as though the food didn't quite satisfy. It could be they are used to food that has higher levels of protein. Eating more doesn't always mean liking it better. If I were to continue using this brand, I'm afraid my dogs would become overweight.<br /><br />I've seen the cute commercials with the happy, playful dogs. I wonder if they are really eating this product.

review/summary: Beneful is another Great Purina product!
review/text: We are "dog people" and have had dogs for over 40 years. Purina always makes good products for animal food and this one is a winner.  This particular food, Beneful, is the favorite of our English Bull Terrier female dog, and it keeps her in good shape. We add a bit of boiled chicken to the dry Beneful kibble and the dogs love this food.  Some people are upset that the food contains corn or chicken and I am not sure what their problem is.  Wild foxes eat vegetable matter including berries, as well as other vegetables, as well as chicken, crayfish, lizards and so forth.  This is a highly beneficial and tasty dog food for your canine friends, and I highly recommend it to all other dog people.

The ingredients do not seem very healthy but not terrible, I just know there are dog food products out there will all natural ingredients.  I thought this was a more healthy type of dog food based on the pictures on the front of their bag, with the vegetables and the name Beneful - meaning full of benefits?  My dog loved it, me - not so much.

review/summary: Gross by-products, sugar, and food colorings--but my dog likes it
review/text: I completely agree that the ingredients for this dog food look revolting, and the pictures on the package don't seem to represent what's actually in the product.  For example, there are clearly pictures of steak on the package, but when I examine the ingredients list, I don't see steak listed.  I also was surprised to see sugar and food colorings in the ingredients list.  Dogs have no nutritional need for sugar, and if they needed sugar to make this yummy for the dog, it must be really low on delicious meat.  Also, I don't see the need for food colorings.  My dog doesn't care what color it is, and if I'm willing to feed him "by-product meal," I'm not sure how it's improved by adding a chemical dye to make it green or whatever.  Also, the chewy bits are not good for their teeth.<br /><br />That said, my dog did act like it was Christmas when I gave him some.  So, two stars.  I won't be switching from my healthier brand to this one, though.

review/summary: The Only Dog food My Shepherd Mix Will Eat!
review/text: We adopted a German Shepherd mix puppy from the Humane Society last summer, and started him on Blue Buffalo dog food because he was immediately in poor health and ran up hundreds of dollars in vet bills due to parasites and dehydration.  We thought he would love that dog food, but he didn't.  He begrudgingly ate that brand of food for the first 6 months of his life with us.<br /><br />But one Sunday we realized we were low on dog food and since we live in the country, only the big box store was within a few miles drive from us, and we had few choices of dog food to choose from.  Nothing was "high-end."  We bought the best we could find - which was Purina Beneful dog food.  Our dog actually ate it!  And he has been eating Purina Beneful ever since last fall.  Sure, he would rather have table scraps or cat food, but he will eat this dog food when his other favorites aren't available.<br /><br />As far as nutrition goes, most dog foods are pretty much the same.  Compare the most expensive brands ingredients, and just like Beneful from Purina, the first ingredient is corn.  Dogs are carnivores with omnivore tendencies, meaning they will eat a varied diet.  They need a well-balanced diet that includes proteins, whole grains, fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />I highly recommend this dog food, and can honestly say it's the only kind of dog food our dog will eat when it's in his bowl.

review/text: Max is a 24lb Corgi/Terrier mix who gives Beneful an enthusiastic recommendation.  He's a picky eater who prefers people food to regular dog food any day of the week, so I didn't hold out much hope when I poured the recommended amount into his bowl. Much to my surprise, it was gone in a flash!  He acted like this was the best thing he'd seen in his bowl in a long time.  We'll continue to supplement Max's diet with a bit of canned food, but as long as he's so excited about Beneful, we'll keep giving it to him.  He did not experience any gastric problems with the change in food, and despite others concerns about the high vegetable content (junk food?), I feel that this is a nice, healthier change for Max. The size and ratio of crunchy to soft pieces was very appealing to him, as he has resisted crunchy food in the past.  The packaging is great, with a zip top closure that will keep this large bag of Beneful fresh for quite a while.  A solid recommend from Max.

review/summary: Pretty dog gone good
review/text: I had been feeding my rescued greyhound a quality dog food which was top grade and expensive. However, the dog picked at her food and didn't eat much. I decided to try Beneful and what a difference it has made. The dog eagerly eats every single piece and stands waiting for more if I will give it. She has gained a few pounds, has a healthy coat and abundant energy for running around our large fenced yard no doubt remembering her days at the track. The label says it is filled with healthy ingredients and beneficial additives. Whatever that contributes I cannot vouch, but i can say the dog really likes this product and eats heartily. I can certainly recommend Beneful.

review/summary: The best choice for Molly
review/text: Since we added Molly, a West Highland terrier, to our family nine years ago, we have tried several different kibble brands suitable for her age and over time her weight. I requested a Vine trial of Purina's Beneful, curious to know what Molly's reaction would be. It was high favorable as was the reaction of her older cousin, Boomer, a frequent guest. Then one of our sons came by with his dogs (a miniature Dachshund and a Shih Tzu) and took some of the kibble home with him for them to try. Our large family offers an excellent quasi focus group for product trials. Bottom line: We will continue with Beneful, based on a unanimous vote by all the canine members.

review/summary: Our dog's dinner of choice
review/text: We've tried several different brands of dry dog food for our girl (a 50lb mutt, if that matters), but the one that stood out time after time is Purina's Beneful line. It has ingredients we can be comfortable with, and more importantly our dog loves it and is quick to finish the bowl. We've tried a few different kinds of Beneful just for variety, and she eagerly devours them all. I'm well aware that it's not going to have the same nutrition content as the pricier, all-natural/organic/etc. brands, but it's kept our dog healthy and her coat shiny for seven years now, so we're sticking with it.

review/summary: Excellent "Step-Up" Product
review/text: Our dog is a large Great Dane and Sharpei breed, about 80 pounds or so. We usually feed him inexpensive generic dry dog food, and he does quite well with it, although he sometimes shows something akin to boredom if he thinks there might be something better available.<br /><br />Purina Beneful represents a step up from his usual fare. We first tried giving him a handful of Beneful as a treat, which he eagerly consumed. After this pattern was established, we started mixing Beneful in with his regular dog food. We ended up with a half and half mix that he never disdains. We haven't tried feeding him a full diet of just Beneful, although we have given him a few meals of pure Beneful.<br /><br />We can't yet speak to the long-term effects of Beneful on his nutrition, but we certainly don't foresee any problems. Beneful isn't really that much more expensive than his regular dog food, it seems to have a good nutrient mix, it has some moist pieces mixed in with the dry, and the dog loves it, probably because it contains beef. The package opens and reseals easily with a plastic slider.<br /><br />This is obviously a good "step-up" product that comes at a reasonable price. You might want to give it a try; I don't hesitate to recommend it.

review/summary: The Only Dry Food My Dog Likes
review/text: I've tried a wide variety of dog food brands including some of the more pricier popular picks such as Nutro and Taste of the Wild as well as several of the Purina-made foods - Dog Chow, Chef Michael. All this to find what my picky pooch will eat. Beneful is the ONLY dry food he doesn't look like he's being tortured with by being made to eat it. Everything else I have to bribe him to take bites of with gravy poured on top or spike it with a piece of bacon, etc. He actually will eat the Beneful by itself without any coaxing.. and he knows the difference between Beneful and anything else. When I try to introduce "healthier/gourmet" food by mixing in other kibble, he takes a bite of the mix, spits it all back out on the floor so he can see the individual pieces, and picks out only the Beneful pieces to eat (leaving the rest for me to clean up later). I've noticed Beneful seems to be moister than other dry foods, so that may have something to do with why my dog likes it more. The kibble stays relatively moist, but it doesn't get moldy or anything in its bag before I use it. I guess I'm lucky my dog doesn't care for the more expensive stuff and only wants this which is a great price compared to all that's available. Oh, and there is a taste difference between the Healthy Weight variety of Beneful vs Original according to my dog as well. He prefers Original, but Healthy Weight will do if he's determined to lose a few pounds.

review/summary: All 4 of my dogs love it!
review/text: I have 4 dogs and 3 of them are very picky eaters when it comes to dry dog food. Rocky our 75lb black and tan coonhound, Buddy our 70lb blue heeler, Nellie our 50 lb treeing walker and Pooper our new mixed breed puppy they all loved this dog food.<br /><br />I love the resealable bag, it keeps the dog food from drying out and going stale.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this dog food even for picky eaters.

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite!
review/text: We have two dogs in our home and they could not be more different. One is a pug, who is spoiled and bratty and picky. The other is a Giant Airedale who is pretty much happy with anything. She would eat cardboard if you gave it to her with a smile. So, I wasn't exactly worried about her opinion of the dog food, she'd eat anything. The Pug however, devours this food! He loved it! In fact, he would go stand by the bag at feeding time! Sometimes if we change their diet in the slightest way, even just changing the brand of food, both dogs have digestive issues for a day, but not with Beneful! Both dogs switched effortlessly! No gastro issues at all. Both seem satisfied and happy. I will definitley be buying Beneful in the future!

review/summary: The pack agrees...
review/text: Our dogs love this food and I like that it is healthy for them because they are family.  The zip top seal is great to open and close the bag (makes you wonder why someone didn't do that sooner.)<br /><br />**I had to come back and edit this review because our dogs got tired of this food very quickly.  "The thrill is gone..."
