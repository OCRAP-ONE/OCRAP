review/text: Like many, I have cycled through many different brands and k-cups, searching for the perfect blend to satisfy my taste buds.  I prefer a medium roast, but slightly bold.  Tullys House blend fits that bill perfectly for me and my fiance.  The flavor is mild but not flavorless like some other medium blends, and bold enough to wake me up.

review/summary: Tully's Coffee House Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)
review/text: I've always appreciated my Keurig brewer but didn't realize how much until I was away from home, no brewer and NO K-cups! I hadn't anticipated the level of 'separation anxiety' I suddenly experienced. Undaunted, I purchased a package of Tully's freshly ground coffee and returned to a conventional coffee maker.  The result was ok - :} but not really the usual great.  Then came reality.  THE GROUNDs.  What a mess! Not only totally inconvenient to measure, but annoyingly difficult to confine to the basket since they always seem to prefer the counter, the sink, the floor, anywhere but where they're supposed to be.  Then, the challenge of disposal-what a mess. Next,the mixing. TOO weak(like "stump-water" I over-heard,) TOO strong...ugh!!!! It was back to that awful trial and error period  which had been so quickly forgotten.  Oh, and don't even ask about the bottled water.  Fortunately the trip was abbreviated and I was soon re-united with my Keurig brewer and my treasured Tully's K-cups.  Lesson learned.

review/text: As many others have stated, the taste of this coffee is fantastic.  Flavor wise, it is by far my favorite.<br /><br />My concern is that these K-cups keep jamming up my coffee maker.  Every time I make this brand of coffee, I have to use a paper clip the next morning to un-jam the Keurig.  I've noticed that these K-cups have a unique behavior about them.  After making a cup of coffee, I go to eject the empty cup.  The empty cup has a large amount of coffee grains on the top of it.  I have never seen this before in my 4 years of using a Keurig.  I am guessing this behavior is directly affecting the coffee maker by jamming it up.

I don't like feeling cheated probably won't order again.  The coffee was strong.  I would compare it to Starbucks.  The order information says they have three different strengths and I didn't see where you can choose the strength so they shipped me Extra Bold.  I usually drink coffee black but with this, I make a 10 oz and 4 oz with one k-cup and then add some cream so I guess that knocks down the per cup price.  Still with feeling cheated, I will look for something better.

I did not quite enjoy the fact that the calamari was sliced rather than packed in chunks. nevertheless the portion of ink made up for that. It's quite right to cook the mediterranean "black rice" with onions, tomatoe paste, olives, garlic powder and a hint of hot sauce (and capers if you are into). Overall I am pleased with this product.

review/summary: Soaked in a pool of soybean oil; High in calories; Product of Spain
review/text: ADVANTAGES:  (1)Although Vigo sells its squid in tiny 4-ounce cans, these cans are fully packed with squid meat so the quantity of squid meat per can is actually not as inadequate as it might seem at first.  (2)The chunks of squid are of high quality and taste very good.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)Some people would classify the easy-open lid as an advantage but I feel that it is a slight disadvantage because of the risk of splattering the contents all over the floor, table, or countertop.  (2)The biggest disadvantage is that soybean oil is added to make it taste better.  This increases the calories and decreases the healthfulness.  Walmart sells Flower brand A1 Seasoned Cuttle Fish in large 6.5-ounce cans for only $2.03 each.  Sugar, salt, and soy sauce are added but no vegetable oil is added and the taste of the soft, A1 squid meat is adequately good and the calories are substantially lower.

Cheese was great, packing wonderful, delivery very quick. Chives add a bit of nice texture. I will order again and have shared experience and cheese with many friends.

I ordered this because he was paying almost a dollar per roll at the convenience store for the same item. This is a real bargain from Amazon.

review/text: There's no doubt that dealing with skinny and boney sardines is not for the faint of heart. Vertebral columns, spinal cords, various and sundry entrails, they're all right there...<br /><br />So here's the alternative - skinless and boneless, promising a civilized, politically correct and appropriate eating experience.<br /><br />Not.<br /><br />These pale pretenders are like throwing out the baby with the bathwater. They're dry and tasteless. Sure they're easy to eat but why would anyone care?<br /><br />And to make matters worse, notwithstanding the fact that the Amazon product description says "Product of Spain", these bad boys seemingly slipped across the border by the cover of darkness. Clearly marked on the box is "Producto de Marruecos" - Product of Morocco.<br /><br />So don't waste your time with these. Go for the gusto. Vigo skinny and boney sardines come from Spanish territorial waters, and are plump, rich, and flavorful. If you can't handle the gore stick with tuna fish, or perhaps give Pablum a try...

I have tried many other different name brands and I can honestly say that the VIGO brand is the very best. It is true that many other brands come from either Mexico or Morroco, but VIGO gets their sardines from Spain and the quality and taste is far above the rest.  I would give this product 10 STARS.  If you are a sardine lover, don't settle for lesser price or quality just because you know a well known name.  VIGO brand is the best.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Exquisite Jasmine Tea, Not To Be Missed
review/text: *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip." It sounds quite romantic, and it tastes wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: the best tea
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker; I drink a LOT of green tea every day and this is great tasting green tea.  I have been extremely spoiled because I have been drinking this tea for many years and recently I've tried other less expensive, more available and not-as-good-teas that are very grassy or just not as flavorful as Numi teas.  Numi Tea is very high quality, but also expensive, so I also drink <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7D1J8">Choice Organic Premium Japanese Green Tea, 16-Count Box (Pack of 6)</a>, but this Numi tea is my favorite. One reason why I feel Numi Tea is always fresh tasting is each tea bag is individually wrapped in foil.<br /><br />I recently also tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUCKF4">TAZO China Green Tips Green Tea, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> - and it is GRASSY! I don't like grassy green tea ...<br /><br />Below is a cut and paste of the Harvard Health Letters Green Tea advice.<br /><br />Benefit of drinking green tea: The proof is in -- drinking tea is healthy, says Harvard Women's Health Watch<br /><br />Although tea drinking has been associated with health benefits for centuries, only in recent years have its medicinal properties been investigated scientifically. The October issue of Harvard Women's Health Watch recognizes the healthy power of tea while helping readers get the most out of their cups.<br /><br />Tea's health benefits are largely due to its high content of flavonoids -- plant-derived compounds that are antioxidants. Green tea is the best food source of a group called catechins. In test tubes, catechins are more powerful than vitamins C and E in halting oxidative damage to cells and appear to have other disease-fighting properties. Studies have found an association between consuming green tea and a reduced risk for several cancers, including, skin, breast, lung, colon, esophageal, and bladder.<br /><br />Additional benefits for regular consumers of green and black teas include a reduced risk for heart disease. The antioxidants in green, black, and oolong teas can help block the oxidation of LDL (bad) cholesterol, increase HDL (good) cholesterol and improve artery function. A Chinese study published recently in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed a 46%-65% reduction in hypertension risk in regular consumers of oolong or green tea, compared to non-consumers of tea.<br /><br />The October issue provides a few tips to get the most out of tea-drinking:<br /><br />Drinking a cup of tea a few times a day to absorb antioxidants and other healthful plant compounds. In green-tea drinking cultures, the usual amount is three cups per day. Allow tea to steep for three to five minutes to bring out its catechins. The best way to get the catechins and other flavonoids in tea is to drink it freshly brewed. Decaffeinated, bottled ready-to-drink tea preparations, and instant teas have less of these compounds. Tea can impede the absorption of iron from fruits and vegetables. Adding lemon or milk or drinking tea between meals will counteract this problem.

review/text: With all due respect to the amazing tea makers of the world, this is the most delicious tea I have ever tasted in my many years of tea drinking.  The smell of it alone is enough to melt away any anxieties I've built up through the day!  It's like meditation in a cup - it gently coaxes you close your eyes, luxuriating the delicate balance of smell and taste, and you're able to block out the world for awhile.  It doesn't overwhelm your taste buds, and there's no bitter aftertaste (as long as you brew it correctly - steep for 2-3 minutes in nearly-boiling water).  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the taste of green tea!

review/summary: Best green tea in a bag
review/text: I usually buy my green tea from a dealer in Japan who has some of the most flavorful and varied teas I have tasted anywhere. I know about green tea, as well as black. I have never liked green tea that has been ground up and placed in a bag. They have always been too bitter, and better tossed in the trash. So on a whim, I tried a box of these teas because I know the Monkey King from one I buy in Japan, and I have to admit, it was the best green tea I have tasted that came in a bag. Not quite as good as the whole leaf tea I get, but pretty good. One thing, I usually steep my tea for 5 minutes, sometimes longer, but this tea does get bitter after about 4, so don't steep it too long, unless you like it like that. That said, I decided to buy a case of 6 boxes, I liked it that much, plus it was cheaper in the long run. I like these in a bag for the convenience at work, and when traveling.

review/summary: Husband Wouldn't Drink Desert Lime Numi So I Added Jasmine Green
review/text: My husband found Numi's Desert Lime tea "too weird" so I had to find a Numi variety he would also drink.  I still get Desert Lime but keep it to myself.  Since he already liked green tea, I figured this Jasmine Green was already partially in the ballpark so I bought it.  He loved it.  This tea also has a wonderful aroma (that is Jasmine obviously).  If I am going to serve Numi tea to someone, this is the one I take out to brew.  I've had other people comment on the Desert Lime's being weird so I don't chance it anymore.  The Jasmine Green seems to please everyone.  I think it is because they have drunk so much similar tea in Japanese and Chinese restaurants plus Starbucks and Caribou.  We like this tea iced or hot. I also enjoy it at room temperature.  Like all Numi teas, this has beautiful art on the front done by the woman partner in the Numi tea business.

Thank you Amazon, for not only supplying this at the best price, but for helping me score some brownie points =D I will definitely be back for reorders, and will use your site for other net purchases also.

review/summary: fabulous tea
review/text: This is a truly excellent jasmine green tea.  Tired of having trouble finding it at the store, or fighting with other customers to get the last box when it was on sale (that did happen to me once), I was thrilled to find the product on Amazon - and better yet, to get it shipped to me periodically with no additional effort on my part.  Great product, great way to get it.

review/summary: Jasmine flavor too subtle
review/text: As a green tea, this is a fine tea.  As a jasimine green tea, I find the jasmine to be much too subtle.  I had my first jasmine tea in a nearby chinese restaurant and absolutely fell in love with it.  It made me feel like I was relaxing in a spa.  This tea, however, tastes mostly like your typical green tea.  If I concentrate I can almost detect the jasmine.  Not quite what I was  hoping for.

review/text: This was a delightful blend of herbs and spices. Not only did I use it for the usual vinegar and oil type dressing, but also tried a honey mustard dressing. The herbs also made a delicious marinade. It also was a hit with the family when it served with the pasta. Besides using it as a dressing and a marinade, I used it as a natural seasoning for fish,or chicken. It was nice finding one blend of seasonings that I could use so many ways.

review/summary: Not enough better than bottled dressings to be worth the extra bother
review/text: I normally use a zesty Italian bottled dressing (store brand) to which I have added extra garlic and olive oil, although I sometimes make a dressing from scratch using olive oil and lemon juice with herbs.<br /><br />I followed the directions on the package for 'classic vinagrette' using extra virgin olive oil and wine vinegar. When I put my normal amount of dressing on my salad (barely moist), it tasted about about the same as unaltered bottled dressing; increasing the amount of dressing on the salad until it was very wet with dressing standing in the bottom of the dish improved the flavor and it was slightly better than the altered bottled dressing.<br /><br />My conclusion was that although the Napa Valley dressing mix made a good dressing, it was not enough better than the store brand bottled dressing to justify the extra work and higher cost.

review/summary: Delcious dressing and fun culinary experimentation!
review/text: Homemade Dressings has developed a neat concept that allows you to make your own dressings at home and tweak the combinations until you find the one that works best for your taste.  There are presently three different flavors that blend dried herbs and spices,  to which you add oil and vinegar to make fresh dressing on demand.  The Napa Valley blend contains garlic, citric acid, tomato powder and, I believe I taste, oregano and thyme in there as well.  The total effect is similar to an Italian herb dressing.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the blend and experimented with several oil and vinegar combinations.  With the oils I tried canola, vegetable and extra virgin olive.  I teamed those oils variously with red wine, white wine, balsamic and cider vinegars.  In my opinion, the strong flavors of EVOO, red wine vinegar, and balsamic vinegar overwhelmed the spices.  My least favorite dressing base was the EVOO with red wine vinegar; the resulting dressing had an overwhelming olive oil taste, and the strong red wine vinegar seemed sharp and harsh with the herb/spice mix.  My favorite was the Napa Valley blend with cider vinegar and vegetable oil.  That combination seemed to best showcase the herbs and spices; just a nice smooth dressing.<br /><br />In addition to making the dressing, I tried using the blend on some boneless skinless chicken breasts.  One piece of chicken was put in a baggie with the Napa Valley prepared dressing for a few hours before grilling.  It turned out all right - what you would expect from an Italian dressing marinade.  However, using the mix straight from the jar as a dry rub seemed to give the chicken a much more intense flavor.  I just sprinkled it over the chicken and let it rest for 20 minutes before grilling.  The mix was also very nice tossed with some pasta and a drizzle of olive oil.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Very versatile
review/text: The combination of herbs for this dressing mix is a traditional blend. A good, solid, nice mix of flavors that's nothing fancy, nothing unusual, very homey and pleasing.<br /><br />What I like best is that because it's in a dry mix state, it allows me to control the dressing mix when I add oil and vinegar. I can use more or less vinegar, more or less dry mix, etc. And it's not limited to dressings.<br /><br />I've shaken it over sauteed vegetables for nice Italian flavor, I've also used it to flavor chicken. I've added it to some bread I've made in the bread machine and also sprinkled it on pizza dough before I bake it in the oven.<br /><br />I've used it sparingly because that's the amount of intensity of flavor that I like, but people can use as little or as much as they like.<br /><br />The versatility of this mix is what I enjoy the most about it--even more than the salad dressings I've made with it.

review/summary: Not as good as Italian Garden
review/text: I really liked Homemade Dressings Italian Garden Dressing Mix and its versatility that continues with their Napa Garden spice blend. I was happy to try another variety by the same company. However, I have to say the Napa Garden is simply not as flavorful in salad dressing and the dried tomato powder clumps up in the container, makes measuring out enough spices difficult. I would suggest trying the Italian Garden before the Napa Garden.

Put in 1/2 tsp of the homemade dressings... I think I will double it next time, but wow, this was a good salad dressing. My wife and I both gobbled it up. Nice to make salad dressing from home, nice flavor, simple to make, and can make what you need and control oil amount, etc. Strange that the ingredients do not list the actual herbs/spices included...

review/summary: Good, considering the dried herbs
review/text: Fair warning:  if you're willing to go buy the fresh herbs and chop everything up, you'll like it better.  But that said, this isn't bad at all as a salad dressing.  Use a good quality oil and make it a bit in advance to give the flavor time to infuse through the oil.<br /><br />I've used this to make a couple of dips, too, with great success.  With plain yogurt, it makes a great, low cal veggie dip that everyone liked.  I also put it in hummus and got good results - again, plan to make at least half an hour in advance.  It takes a while for the flavor of the dried herbs to really work into your dip.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy this again.  It's a great shortcut, and good quality.

review/summary: Another Winner from Homemade Dressings
review/text: I was introduced to this company via the Amazon Vine program, in which I had the opportunity to sample their Italian blend.  I liked it so much I ordered the other two flavors, the Napa (this one) and the French.  These other two do not disappoint.<br /><br />The Napa blend has a very nice, savory tomato aroma.  I like just unscrewing the top and smelling it because it smells so good! It's also very versatile - you can use it as is to sprinkle on things or use as a rub or in a marinade, or you can make a salad dressing with it. Whatever you do, the spices and herbs within the container complement each other very well and make for a very tasty combination.<br /><br />Unlike many other seasonings, this one doesn't overwhelm you with salt.  Yes, there is salt in it, but it doesn't shout at you as do other combinations that I have tried.  All three flavors in this line get two thumbs up from me.

review/summary: For Everything There Is a Seasoning
review/text: What we're dealing with here is a container of mixed seasonings with a very helpful label. They don't reveal exactly which herbs are included, but it's a good mix that works well with the "straight-up" test: take a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar, sprinkle the seasoning on top, and then dip a chunk of Italian bread in it and ciao down.<br /><br />The label is much more helpful than most mixed-seasoning labels. It provides you with simple recipes for mixing with olive or other light oil and a variety of other ingredients to produce salad dressings, marinades, dry rubs, etc.<br /><br />In the "straight-up" test, the taste was full and herbanescent (if that's not a real word, tough--I made it up and I like it!). The sea salt and lemon juice added just the right tang, and the tomato worked well with all the spices and salt to add just a tiny hint of fruity freshness.

review/text: Well, maybe it's not as versatile as Saturday Night Live's "Shimmer" (It's a floor wax! It's a dessert topping!) but this has food uses beyond what the bottle says. We started out mixing a nice vinaigrette dressing, but we ended up sprinkling it on grilled tomatoes, over roast chicken and in scrambled eggs with cheese. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was when we tried mixing it in with the chicken salad -- combined with mayo, it was a little too sweet.<br /><br />I like subtle flavorings and often what is passed off as "Italian" is anything but. This particular product is a very simple and unobtrusive blend that we enjoyed very much.

It compares favorably with Good Seasons salad dressing mix flavor wise, but to its benefit, this is sugar free, a nice plus.

They make a great meat and chicken rub too.<br /><br />In response to the "thornhillatthemove.com" review I had to try his secret recipe.

Having this instead of the idividual jars would certainly open up some cupboard space.<br />I highly recommend this to all kinds of cooks. Definitely worth having.

review/text: I can't really say anything bad about this product.  I like fresh herbs, but this is the next best thing.  It is a great natural spice seasoning that works well with a variety of food.  It is made mainly to be a mixed in salad dressing (which was very tastey by the way) but has a plethora of other uses.<br /><br />Here are several that I tried:<br /><br />- Sprinkled on steak fries<br />- As a coating for baked chicken<br />- Directly on a salad of field greens (sans the rest of the dressing ingredients)<br />- Mixed with plain yogurt for a yummy and healthy chip-dip<br /><br />I plan to try out further variations as well.  I like the fact that it is salt free and all natural. The "Napa Garden" flavor is quite good, adapting to whatever food it is paired with.  I would say it has a slightly Mediterranian flavor, but it is really more versatile than that.  The price point is also attractive -- you get a lot for your money.  If you really want a gourmet experience, I recommend DeLallo Dipping Seasoning Spices, but really, you can't go wrong with Napa Garden.

review/text: I tried the Napa Garden flavor of this salad dressing mix, and found it easy to prepare as a dressing with olive oil. The result was a savory, fresh tasting dressing. The predominant flavor for me was the tomato/garlic component, and I was pleased that the finished dressing wasn't too salty.<br /><br />Another way I found to use the product was to combine a couple tablespoons of the leftover dressing with (cooked) egg yolks for a new version of deviled eggs. (Trust me, they were very tasty!)<br /><br />I also mixed a scant amount (dry) into pasta sauce, and found it gave the store-bought sauce an extra "kick."<br /><br />I plan to use it in the future as a dry rub on meat, and possibly a marinade (these two recipes are on the jar).<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed using the product (it's simple to use), and found the taste delicious.

review/summary: Not worth it!
review/text: It's pretty easy to make a simple, tasty vinaigrette. I'm going to give you my secret recipe.<br /><br />Chop two cloves of garlic fine. Put in a bottle or jar, add a pinch of kosher salt and a half cup of good balsamic vinegar. Cover and shake. Then let sit ten minutes. Then add one cup of good olive oil and some fresh ground pepper. Cover and shake again. Store in your refrigerator as long as you need it.<br /><br />This Napa Garden salad dressing mix isn't that much easier and doesn't taste as fresh. The key problem is that the mix uses dried herbs. And too many of them. The result is a taste very much like a bottled italian dressing. Great. You can make your own Italian bottled dressing, just like you would buy in the store.<br /><br />And because there are so many herbs, the taste gets muddled and over done. The addition of dried tomato doesn't help and simply makes it seem all the more like a bottled dressing.<br /><br />I followed the instructions on the bottle, adding the mix to two different kinds of vinegar and then oil, all of which I had to measure. I never measure my vinaigrette. So this preparation didn't really save any time.<br /><br />And it didn't taste that good.<br /><br />Why would I bother? Why should you bother?
