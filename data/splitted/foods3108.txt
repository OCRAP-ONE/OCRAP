review/summary: My little not-so-guilty pleasure
review/text: I have been on the SCD diet for a couple of months now and we aren't supposed to have any grains or sugar (only honey is allowed)or potatoes among other things, in order to heal our damaged intestines. I had been really sticking to the diet but then one day in the store I looked longingly at the dark chocolate with no intentions of stopping and picking a bar up, but out of curiosity I wondered just how much sugar the 90% had in it. I picked the Lindt because I love the chocolate balls, and mainly because the sugar content in 2 squares is about 1.5 grams. I decided 2 squares a night can't hurt, and I am happy to report eating 2 squares a night has not caused any intestinal upset. The other day I thought about eating a square with a dab of peanut butter on it. I am going to try this next. I may even melt some into some nut milk, add some honey and have some cocoa, or toss a few squares in with some dates into my kefir for a chocolate smoothie! I am also going to try making a healthy iced mocha. I am planning to premelt the chocolate with some honey, bring my own almond milk, and hit Starbucks for an espresso on ice, and fix my own mocha. No more looking longingly at others enjoying theirs. My body is saying ok to this low sugar, deliciously rich chocolate and my taste buds are saying YES!!! Warning though, this is not very sweet tasting at all. It is highly cocoa-buttery which means it melts in your fingertips fairly quickly. Another reason I wanted to eat a couple squares a day is for weight gain since it's pretty high in fat and I was losing too much weight on this diet. I will be a regular consumer of this chocolate from now on.<br /><br />Edited to add: I just discovered a dark chocolate I love even more. It's Alter Ego 85% Cocoa Blackout chocolate. It's fantastic. Kinda blows this Lindt one away.

review/summary: This stuff is really good
review/text: Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find this item to be bitter at all - and that's coming from someone who was used to much sweeter chocolates. Instead, this product is all about chocolaty goodness. I do agree that it is far less sweet than many other offerings - and that is part of the appeal to me. Only 3g sugars per serving, I think. The saturated fat content of this product is very high, and because of that, I'm careful to enjoy it in small doses. Maybe that's a good thing - because if the saturated fat were lower, I'd feel less guilt, and I'd be liable to gobble up the entire bar in one setting. That's how good this stuff is.

review/summary: Lindt's most "intense" chocolate - for conoisseurs
review/text: For those seeking more bitterness than the 85% Excellence bars, the 90% is ideal. That was my exact situation a few years back, so I was delighted when Lindt came out with this option, in between their 85% and 99% offerings. If you are looking for a flavor almost devoid of sugariness, this bar is ideal. It's obviously not going to be to the liking of those who view chocolate as "candy."<br /><br />As you make the transition from a lower percentage of cacao, don't be surprised if this chocolate tastes faintly like dirt (or the earthy flavor I suppose dirt to have). As your taste buds adjust, the "dirt" notes will disappear to be replaced by more subtle (and pleasing) overtones.<br /><br />I personally am not a fan of the "cocoaness" described by an earlier reviewer, and prefer a strong presence of cocoa butter instead. Unfortunately, the 90% Excellence is not as good as the 85% in this respect, most likely due to the constraints imposed by incorporating such a high cocoa content. However, the difference is quite subtle, and the greater level of bitterness more than makes up for it. The 90% Excellence bar undoubtedly provides the most intense chocolate experience available.

review/text: I don't know about the business practices of this company, but I can tell you that the taste of the chocolate is excellent. The people who don't like it or claim it is bitter are sugar addicts, unfortunately. They will have to wean themselves off sweeteners in order to enjoy this wonderful chocolate with only 3g of sugar in 4 pieces.

review/summary: Chocolate good, Amazon price good, other price outrageous!
review/text: This chocolate is great although it is an acquired taste.  I worked my way up to chocolate this dark and pure because I was trying to cut down on my sugar intake.  And now this is the chocolate I prefer.  If you are new to chocolate this dark, you don't chew and swallow like you would with Hershey's.  Just bite off a small amount and let it melt in you mouth... amazing!  My kids say it tastes like dirt which is great because they don't touch it!<br />These same 3.5 ounce bars are available at Target and other places for under [...] bucks each.  Also, I have bought them on Amazon in the past by the case for roughly the same price as Target.  It is a joke that this private seller thinks he can get more than double what everyone else charges!?<br /><br />Enjoy this fine dark chocolate, just buy it somewhere else.<br />---<br />I have updated my review since Amazon now has these back in stock for half of what the other guy was charging.  Go Amazon!!!

review/summary: Very different from Lindt 85%
review/text: I've been eating Lindt 85% dark chocolate as a healthy treat for a while now and have a pretty good feel for what that chocolate is like.  I expected the 90% to be somewhat similar to that, only stronger, but I was very wrong.<br /><br />Lindt 90% has a drier, more chalky composition than the 85%.  It also has hints of what tastes like marshmallow (though I'm sure it's something else).  The 85% by contrast, is creamier with a strong, organic woody flavor.  The 85% comes across as a more traditional dark chocolate while the 90% seems like a different product all together.  I will say thought that the 90% seems to lack the "bite" of bitterness that the 85% did.<br /><br />So overall this is a nice product, though you do see some eccentricities start to creep into the product as you get close to 100% pure cocoa.  I would very strongly advise working your way up to this dark of a chocolate to acclaimate your taste to it.  Try the 72% and the 85% first.  Most people will want to stop at the 85%, though this gives you an option if you want a little something more.

review/summary: maybe good for baking?
review/text: I love Lindt and was really hoping for great things with this 90% bar; alas, it is just too bitter and chalky to eat straight.<br /><br />I consider myself a hardcore chocoholic and can handle intensity on the choco scale. But this is more or less like baking chocolate. There is almost no sugar in it, and while that may be good for flavor, it's almost inedible on its own.<br /><br />I'm confused by those who rated it so highly but I guess taste is totally subjective. I'm usually the one of my friends who likes the darkest, least sweet chocolate, but this is just not working for me at all.

I prefer the 70% to the 80% cocoa content, anything above that I just think I am going to use for baking in cookies or something else.

It does not have a strong taste, but goes down very easily. There is a richness to the taste as well.<br /><br />Bottom line?

review/text: I am a coffee snob. Yes, I admit it. I prefer fresh roasted Kenyan coffee, but also like Sumatran, Jamacan, Guatamalan, even Etheopian. I generally say that I don't drink Columbian. Most K-Cups are weak and less than stellar, though I have found several I enjoy. I was surprised by Caribou's Mahogany! It is excellent. Strong enough with an earthy, winey taste and smoothe finish (my description).  I eagerly tried their Daybreak, to my disappointment. Just ordinary. I don't often write reviews, but if this can get someone else to enjoy Mahogany it is well worth the time. If you have similar taste in coffee give it a try!! (and no, I don't work for them.)

review/text: Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPLI">Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.<br /><br />I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try.

If you like strong, bold coffee, you will be disappointed. For a mild coffee, I found this good, but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brands.<br /><br />I will not be re-ordering Caribou Mahogany. My wife prefers Donut Shop brand over this. Again, not strong enough for me, but still makes a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Best K-Cup to Date
review/text: If you're a fan of full-bodied coffees, give this one a shot.<br /><br />For my taste, the vast majority of k-cups are too watery and weak (even on the small cup setting), so I gravitate towards the extra-bold varieties.  I had previously been enjoying Newman's Own Extra Bold and GM Dark Magic.  After reading some favorable comparisons between those and Mahogany, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />I find that it's slightly less bitter (not that bitter is bad) than Newman's EB or Dark Magic, and a little smoother.  I also think it's more full bodied without any burned bean flavor.  I've tried the Mahogany on the larger cup setting and actually still liked it -- something I've never said before.

review/summary: I was pleasantly surprised...
review/text: I bought a package of these as an impulse/add-on purchase, and was not familiar with the brand, or the cookie. There's not a whole lot to say about them, they're essentially a blondie Oreo, but they have a nice vanilla-y kind of buttery flavor, and a pleasantly crisp texture to the cookie part when I first opened them, but were somewhat softer by the next day. (I live in a humid area, though, and I didn't repackage them in a more air tight container, so that's probably not the cookies' fault; and they still taste good.) The flavor is subtle, but rich for what it is; a perfect answer to a sweets craving.<br /><br />These are just an old-fashioned, plain little sandwich cookie, perhaps much the same as some of us used to have with a glass of milk after school, or a few with a cup of hot tea now. I have enjoyed them so far, and would buy them again.

review/text: These onions are HUGE -- 23 to 25mm diameter -- almost an INCH. They are delicious and crack like a fresh vegetable when you chew into them. The vinegar is a bit too sweet for me, so I poured out half of it from the jar and filled the jar back up with plain white vinegar. This made the onions perfect. I haven't met a pickled onion that I didn't like but even so I'd put these close to the top of my list. I noticed that they came from Israel so I assume that everyone in Israel drinks martini's or gimlets and puts these onions into them. My only problem with these onions is that they cause me to drink too many martini's. But is that a bad thing?

review/summary: Best Onions for Martinis
review/text: I was hooked on the Smith and Woolensky cocktail onions. They would really make a martini something special. I was not always able to find them though. Also the price was very high. But these onions are identical in quality and taste but cost one third the price. What else could you say.

review/summary: Fantastic, at a great price!
review/text: I love these pasta sauces - just about every flavor this company makes is amazing!  The Arrabbiata is pretty spicy, so watch out!  The Tuscan Vodka is creamy and flavorful, the Puttanesca is tangy and chunky with lots of olives and capers, and the Marinara is a great base for just about any dish calling for a good tomato sauce.  These are great with simple pasta, with ravioli, or just plain out of the jar!  Yes, I do sometimes sit and eat these out of the jar with a spoon - they are THAT good.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the jars these come packed in are top-notch.  I have never had the seeping-sauce problem others mention; perhaps it's because I use Prime and have these shipped via two-day instead of ground.<br /><br />This product is an excellent example of why I'm addicted to Amazon - it is a fantastic product that is very rarely available in stores, especially in smaller towns, and this price is unbelievable!  Look elsewhere on the web at what these sauces are selling for, and then remember that you can get free shipping with Amazon.  Unbelievable deal for a very high-quality product.  These sauces would be worth it at the "eight bucks a jar" charged by most other online stores; five bucks a jar is ridiculously cheap for the quality of ingredients you'll get in these.<br /><br />As others have also noted, the company is very nice too - I e-mailed them with a question once and the owner wrote back to me personally.

review/summary: Scrum-a-lum for Scarpetta!
review/text: We found this on a shelf in Whole Foods, Palo Alto, CA.  Made in Somerville, MA, we wanted to support my home state and purchased this.  Needing to fill 4 gift bags for our single friends, we wanted something scrummy and nutritious - and this fit the bill.  We have not looked back.  We constantly add it to gift baskets and care packages.  Our personal favorite is the Arrabbiata Sauce. The product is good; the love story behind the company is fun; the containers are fabulous for re-use!  Good people with a good product deserve to be supported and praised.  Buon appetito!

review/text: I like the taste of this sauce. It is much better than the cheap supermarket brands. I am not quite sure that it is as much better as the price is higher. I usually use a bought sauce as a base for a semi-homemade sauce or soup. I did use this sauce as it came on pasta for a quick supper. It was pretty good. I am not sure if I will continue to order this. I will decide after trying all 4 flavors.

review/text: Scarpetta Pasta Sauces are the best.  What else can I say?  This gift box contains one jar of each of these sauces...Marinara, Puttanesca, Arrabbiata, and Tuscan Vodka.  It is a nice variety pack to try the sauces before ordering a box of your favorite flavor.  It is packaged in a box for giving and then Amazon packs it for sending.  Unfortunately, two of the four jars were seeping sauce.  I have confidence Amazon will make it right.

review/summary: Very good - and a good deal too!
review/text: Very excellent coffee candy. And you get a nice set of 12 bags which contain 42 candies each.  Each bag is 5.3 ounces.  I am attaching two photos of a box with all the candy bags - I was pleasantly surprised by the amount and the weight of the package.<br /><br />I decided to try Bali's Best Coffee Candy after trying Kopiko coffee Candy. I really liked the candy but thought the price was too much ($5.49 for 32 candies, 4.23 oz).  So I decided to try this Bali's Best Coffee Candy. Bali's has stronger coffee taste and slightly sweeter.  Both are excellent candy, but Bali's is a much better deal.<br /><br />I noticed that the price on the Coffee candy fluctuates. I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool to be very helpful.

review/text: The Bali's Best Coffee Candy is still the best on the market!!!<br /><br />I just received the Bali's Best Coffee Candy from Amazon yesterday and was concerned that it might taste different based on someone's review on Amazon (I have been buying this product for almost 2 years).<br /><br />Thankfully the product tasted just as wonderful as it always has.  It is the best coffee candy on the market - smooth coffee flavor with the right amount of sweetness.  In fact, I also called the company to confirm that nothing has changed with the candy.  The customer service person confirmed that there has not been any changes - thankfully.

review/summary: One of the two or three best-in-flavor coffee candies
review/text: These are a hard candy--hard like a Lifesaver, not like a hard toffee such as the Rio coffee candy, which will soften somewhat in your mouth. The flavor is about as strong as the Rio but noticeably more piquant and a bit richer and more complex than the Kopiko brand but as sweet. The flavor is also more consistent from lot to lot than Rio (Rio can be great and it can be awful). The pieces about the size of a lifesaver so I doubt anyone would find them uncomfortable.<br /><br />They not twist wrapped but in sealed bags and are more difficult to unwrap than the Rios but not as difficult as the Kopikos.

Each candy is about half the thickness of the Bali's with the espresso.  This candy is good, but the Bali's with the espresso inside each candy is better.

review/text: Addictive, if you like the flavor of coffee. I actually use these as a lure to get people to visit my office cube more often, and it works. The pieces are smaller than your average hard candy, which I think actually makes it more attractive to adults, who aren't looking for a big mouthful of sugar. The coffee flavor is very intense and, um, like coffee -- like *good* coffee, I should say, gourmet coffee that you'd pay for, not office breakroom coffee. Mmmn, coffee!

review/text: These candies have a very pleasant coffee taste, neither weak nor overpowering. They do leave a bit of a sour aftertaste, though, not dissimilar to what you might get after drinking coffee with milk and sugar. After two months in a 6-person apartment with frequent visitors (and borderline aggressive candy-pushing), we still have a bit over half the package, you certainly get a lot of candies for what you pay.

review/summary: The best there is!
review/text: This is simply the best coffee candy on the market. I tried a variety of other products before finding Bali's best and was amazed what those products considered "coffee" candy, many were mixed with caramel, which is not what a coffee candy should taste like at all. However they have done it, Bali's Best is a perfect combination of true mellow coffee flavor sweetened with a perfect amount of cane sugar. I love good, high quality, traditionally roasted coffee, not the flame thrower, dark roasted stuff that passes for coffee at some popular franchises these days. The Sumatran coffee in Bali's Best is a perfect choice, rich and mellow, not bitter in the least. One of my favorite things to do with this candy is to bring them with me while hiking and pass them out to my hiking buddies after many hard hours of hitting the trail. Bali's best has gone with me to a few 14K summits in the Sierra's this year, and its wonderful to see and hear the expressions of gratitude and pleasure this candy gives my friends as we take in the sights on the top of the world.
