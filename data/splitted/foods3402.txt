review/text: We used to have drive down to the specialty pet food store for this product.  So glad we discovered Amazon.  As far as I can tell it is no more expensive & in some cases less - Prime membership is awesome.  Loving Pets treats are some of the best according to my dog.  They do not develop that nasty smell like some dog treats do.

review/summary: Very tasty!
review/text: I've always been a little curious about barley tea, as I see it often mentioned in manga and Japanese stories. I finally got a chance to try it the other day with the Sokenbicha brand.<br /><br />This tea is not sweetened, which is part of the reason I purchased it. I'm on a diet, so I prefer to sweeten my beverages with stuff like Splenda or Equal. I didn't really need it with this drink. There's a slight bitter tea taste, but it's definitely not overwhelming and I didn't really think that it deterred from the drink. To be honest, I didn't add any sweetener to it at all. It didn't need it and I think it would have killed the taste.<br /><br />There's a great nutty-ish type of flavor that I'm going to assume is the barley. I adore it and while I don't think I'd be able to drink it constantly, I really want to drink this again, to the point where I'd be willing to drive to the organic grocery store that's about a half hour out of my way. I do have to warn you, if you are a fan of the more traditional teas (black tea, iced tea, etc) then this will take some getting used to. It's tasty, but I can see where it wouldn't be to all tastes. Still very much worth trying and I'm definitely going to be looking for barley tea in general. (But stuff like this is good for me to take to work, where I can't brew up big batches of tea.)

review/summary: Really Refreshing. Nice Aftertaste. Zero Calories.
review/text: I discovered the Sokenbicha line of Japanese teas at my local Fresh and Easy store. They're excellent, but rather expensive. The latest one I've tried is a bold Barley Tea Blend. Man, this stuff is really good and unlike any other tea I've ever had. I'm at a loss to describe the flavor. It's fairly strong for a tea and has a wonderful aftertaste. It must be the barley. The green tea or pu'er tea might help too. In any case, it's a really refreshing tea served ice cold. It's unsweetened and has zero calories. My oh my!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I find the flavor of most energy shots to be intolerable, but I can drink the grape 6 hour power.<br /><br />I can get sleepy on long drives, so I keep a few of these in the glovebox of my car. They can be a bear to open since they are wrapped up so tight, but, getting off the freeway to drink one is much easier and faster than trying to find a place to buy a coffee. The mental energy is almost immediate and lasts. I feel safe and don't have the anxiety of worrying about finding a place to caffeine up. The shots are good for more than a year, so I can put them in the glovebox and forget them until I need one.<br /><br />If you're going to do energy shots, these are the best.

review/text: If you are like me and just want a cornbread muffin or two and don't want to make a whole pan this is the perfect mix. It makes six large muffins and I put the extra in the freezer and just pop them in the micro wave when I want one. The reason I like these is they are not sweet so if you like sweet bread these are not for you. I found this mix at a bread store but could not find it in the grocery stores, so I went where I always find every thing I want, Amazon and sure enought there they were and at a better price than the bread store.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/text: Chilli Man chili is the best tasting vegetarian chili I've tried.  A lot of vegetarian chili tastes like tomato paste with beans.  This has beans, texturized vegetable protein in a great tasting sauce.  Love it!

review/summary: Chili Man Vegetarian Chili with Beans
review/text: Although, I am not a vegetarian I love this chili.  It is delicious even eaten right out of the can with a spoon.  I have enjoyed it, having found it many years ago, but have not been able to find it very often.  Until I did a 'google' search for it and found it from 'Amazon'.  Now I can order a case of it whenever I run out.  PTL  &lt;>&lt;

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: This chili really hits the spot. I have tried other vegan chilis over the years and even attempted to make my own, but this is the best I have tasted so far. It is really thick and cooked and spiced perfectly. The texturized protein is there but doesn't overpower the flavor. Will buy again.

review/summary: The best vegetarian chilli I've ever tried
review/text: It's a great tasting product, just the right amount of spice. The pack of 12 cans is a great value too.<br />Even my husband who has no interest in becoming a vegetarian like me, simply loved it. Has a lot a red beans and a delicious  smokey flavor.<br />Don't be affraid to try it if you are not a vegetarian. It's so well done anyone can enjoy it without having to eat the loads of fat and dodgy meat chilli can be made of.<br />It's just a bit over 200 calories per serving and goes great with white rice or fries.

review/summary: Chili heaven
review/text: Vegetarian or not, for canned chili this stuff is incredible.  Thick, rich texture, unlike a lot of other brands that tend to be a bit runny.  Very flavorful, and even better with a dash of cayenne pepper if you like your chili spicy, as I do.  Great as a stand-alone dish, on veggie dogs, with cornbread...you name it.  Excellent nutritional value, too -- high in protein and fiber, low in fat.  (Some take issue with the sodium content, but let's face it, most canned chilis and soups -- and prepared foods in general -- are loaded with it.)  I've had Hormel and Amy's; Chilli Man is far better.  To this vegetarian, it's chili heaven!

review/summary: Better than my wife
review/text: Chilli Man chili provides unparalleled heartburn along with a great, satisfying taste which effortlessly surpasses that of more expensive chilis such as Amy's. You can never have too much Chilli Man chili on hand as it is lodged within 15 ounce cans whose expiration dates are generously located years inside the future. While I love Chilli Man chili with every fiber of my being and sometimes marry it with fake hot dogs, Chilli Man chili is not better than my wife and I apologize if the title of my review indicated otherwise. Buy a 12 pack of Chilli Man chili today because they will reveal their recipe to no man and it's just that good.

review/text: Not a big fan of this canned Chili, way too salty (70% USDA daily allowance of sodium per can) yet still tastes stale and bland.  Price was good (under $2.00 a can) but would not recommend, kind of generic, flavorless taste.  Don't understand all the great reviews, maybe I got a bad batch.  Campbell's firehouse Chili (my favorite, spicy, good chili flavor) or Amy's Vegetarian Chili (much less salt, yet still decent flavor) much better options.

review/text: Please be aware that one of the cans that I purchased in late August 2011 exploded in my cupboard. This indicates a potential health risk to consuming the contents. Information printed on the can bottom identifies the batch, as follows:"1219BestBy05Dec2012, 1035 C3 340 10." If your can is deformed, consider discarding orreturning it, rather than eating it. Also, aside from the problem of exploding, 1/2 cup of this product contains 860 mg  of Sodium. The amount that I ate in another can was way too salty for my taste and amounts to more than half of my personal limit of 1500 mg Sodium per day.

review/summary: Two great tastes that don't quite go together,
review/text: I'm a big fan of Wheat Thins. I'm also a big fan of buffalo wings. So when I saw these for sale at a local store earlier today, I bought a box.<br /><br />I won't buying another. There isn't anything notably wrong with this combination, but it's a mis-match in flavor types: wheat thins are a mix of sweet and salty, and are much sweeter than most crackers. Buffalo sauce (and I have to admit, the buffalo powder recipe on these crackers is pretty good) is spicy, with a slight sour flavor from the vinegar. When you eat one of these, you get the buffalo flavor, and then you get the normal, sweet flavor of a Wheat Thin. It's a peculiar sensation, sort of like you were eating Wheat Thins and then accidentally stuck one in the buffalo dip. You like the buffalo, you like the Wheat Thin, but when you grab another cracker you don't dip it in the sauce again because the cracker is better without it.<br /><br />If you want a good flavored Wheat Thin, try the cinnamon Wheat Thins that are sold around the Christmas holiday. They're wonderful. Or, if you don't want sweet, a small slice of extra sharp cheddar makes a great topping.

review/summary: Spicy? Really?
review/text: I'm into eating healthy snacks and I've decided to choose wheat thins this time. I usually read nutrition labels before I make a purchase. 140 Calories and 45 fat per serving (14 pieces) seemed alright as well as the ingredients. First off, I grew up eating spicy stuff as a child, so I have enough tolerance and that's the kind of food that I've enjoyed eating til this day. Those of you who are spicy food freaks like me might be aware of SHU which is Scoville Heat Unit invented by Wilbur Scoville to measure spicyness of pepper. Well, I guess I was expecting too much for this. It's not spicy at all. To express how it exactly tastes it's the taste of tomato, spice sauce (Texas Pete or Louisiana sauce that you can easily locate from groceries) and some sweetness to it. I don't think they don't go along together. I find them weird. It's not really of an OMG taste either. I think I'll try their jalapeno one later instead.

review/summary: Finally Nabisco made Wheat Thins palatable. Now I'm addicted to them.
review/text: Bought all three Zesty Salsa, Smoky BBQ and this one, Spicy Buffalo, at Walmart. All three are unbelievably tasty and healthy eating for you compared to most snacks. Check the ingredients and nutritional facts on these crackers.<br /><br />The Spicy Buffalo flavored variety tastes very close to actual Frank's Hot Sauce which was the main ingredient in the original Buffalo Wings recipe. I used to work at a pizza/buffalo wings mom & pop shop who used that sauce on their wings and Wheat Thins pretty much nailed the flavor at the same time not have it so darn salty tasting as other snacks. The slight sweetness of the original cracker flavor rounds off the slight salty edge of the flavoring.<br /><br />I love all three of them. I just hope Nabisco doesn't discontinue these as most snack companies do with something as flavorful and unique as these.

review/summary: Best Wheat thins
review/text: These wheat thins are not your standard garden vegetable flavor. They are slightly spicy, but not so much that you burn your mouth. They have a really nice tangy flavor that goes surprisingly well with the flavor of the cracker. These are my favorite wheat thins. If you are looking for wheat thins that have a little zip to them but still taste great, give these a try.

review/text: I'll admit that I was never a fan of the original Wheat Thins, to the point where I basically wouldn't eat them at all. It wasn't until they started coming out with flavored varieties that I started to take some interest, and this is the best one yet. I like other varieties too, but if I was going to buy a 3-pack of any of them, this would be the one. At first my son thought I was serious when I told him I was just going to lick off the powdered flavoring and throw the cracker away; I wouldn't do that, of course, but clearly the thought crossed my mind!

review/summary: Cheese?
review/text: Cheese?  I received a cheese of the month package from my son as an unexpected gift just before Thanksgiving.  Surprising!  He knows I like IPA's and Cab's, but cheese?  Doesn't that mean sipping Chardonnay and wearing turtlenecks?  But on opening the package, we found three generous pieces of cheese with interesting names my wife knew, but I could not pronounce. When we opened them on Thanksgiving, everyone enjoyed tasting them and were impressed with the quality -- uh, including me.  So I learned that fancy cheese really does add to the enjoyment of a gathering and enhances the taste of my other favorites -- those IPA's and Cab's.  I don't know if it was just an accident, but it arrived the night before Thanksgiving -- perfect timing.  And there was a chill-pack in the box which kept the cheese in perfect condition.<br /><br />What a nice gift!  Thanks, Son!

review/text: This is a yummy scrumptious option if you are going for a sugar free syrup.  I've tried a few brands and was almost set to never try any more.  I tried this at a cafeteria in a sealed single serving like I saw advertised somewhere also on this site.  I just wanted to get on and tell you that this syrup is like a carmel maple syrup. It is so good, it reminds me of the syrup they serve at Kneaders restaurants for their french toast and pancakes.  The bad is I can't find it at the grocery stores.  I think that is why there are not more reviews for this syrup. Because it is more of a specialty item for ordering or to be found at restaurants or cafeterias.  This is a hidden gem.

Banana-coconut, for example, would make a good wheat thin. Maple would as well. or Vanilla. Salsa and Buffalo flavours belong on salty corn chips.

If you've never tried Chai tea, it has a spicy holiday flavor, along the lines of pumpkin pie.

review/summary: If you really like Stash Chai, stay away
review/text: This is a high quality tea, but if you really like the original and double spice Stash Chai you might want to avoid this one.  I drink about 3 cups of the original chai a day, and thought this would be a nice change for the holidays.  It is really different.  The flavor is totally different and I didn't like it at all.  I threw out most of the box unused.  I gave it 3 stars since it is a high quality tea with good ingredients, I just didn't like it at all (personal taste).

review/text: I love Stash Chai tea, so when I saw this one I was excited by the description but the reality was a disappointment.  I also bought the Chocolate Hazelnut tea which was also a disappointment, and it also contains peanuts, so persons with peanut allergies have to be careful.  The Chai, and Double spice Chai are really the best.

review/text: I can't believe how much I dislike this tea. I don't understand it. I love gingerbread, rum, chai tea, and all the other ingredients listed. And the packaging is so beautiful. But just the smell of this tea is enough to turn my stomach. I drank three cups, trying to "acquire" a taste for it, since I now have six boxes of the stuff (minimum order)! But it just didn't happen. My husband thought I was exaggerating, so I made a cup for him. Same reaction. I even tried not inhaling in order to bypass the smell before tasting it. It's just awful!!! I'm going to take a box of it to the local library ... first one to say they like it gets the other five boxes!!! Hope I don't get banned from the library!

Even using two teabags at once produced only bitter flavor. There's really nothing good about this tea.

review/summary: Amazing aroma, but flavor is very subtle
review/text: I purchased Stash Holiday Chai after it was recommended in a discussion thread about favorite teas.  It certainly sounded delicious--I like chai, and the blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger Root, allspice, clove, gingerbread, and nutmeg spices sounded absolutely scrumptious, especially for the holidays!  And granted, while steeping, this tea does smell absolutely wonderful; it truly brings to mind all of the goodness and richness of the holidays.  When I tasted the tea, however, I was a bit disappointed:  I was expecting something pretty exotic, especially with the splash of rum flavor, but instead, all I could detect was a very subtly seasoned black tea (I couldn't even taste the chai).  I have experimented with this tea and tried steeping it for longer periods, but that has not seemed to make a difference.  I gave the product 4 stars because it is not a bad-tasting tea; it just was not nearly as flavorful as I had anticipated and hoped for.

review/text: All of Manischewitz's "tube" soup mixes, (so called because they coem in celephane tubes), are a good value for the money.  They taste great, and are truly THE most condensed of soups -- ONLY the dry ingredients are given, you add your own liquid, and thus save money, (not paying for water, as in other "condensed" soups), saving room in your pantry, and NOT having to put unopened packages in the refrigerator or freezer, thus saving valuable space there.<br /><br />I chose the Manischewitz Vegetable Cello Soup with Mushrooms, 6 ounce tubs, (Pack of 24), because I happen to LIKE mushrooms -- a lot.  But the interesting thing with all the tube soups offered by Manischewitz, is that they DO NOT contain an undue amount of salt!  One would think that an uncanned soup WOULD contain a LOT of salt, but this is not the case here.  Manischewitz obviously puts great faith in the protective power of cellophane, plastic wrappers -- and, thus, so should the customer!<br /><br />This is very tasty soup, which can be used as a complete soup, or as a soup base.<br />It is very inexpensive, because, as mentioned, you are NOT paying for water.<br />Make this -- and all other Manischewitz "tube" soups -- according to the directions, add your own ingredients if desired, and enjoy!  The money, pantry space, and refrigerator space,you will be saving, will make this delicious soup taste even better!  Enjoy - and I hope to see this, and other Manischewitz "tube" soups return to Amazon, very, very soon!

After six hours of cooking they were finally soft enough to be edible (but we had to go to bed or else would have cooked it another hour).<br /><br />That being said, I doctored it up a bit with Italian Seasonings and replaced two of the cups of water with 2 cups of stewed tomatoes. And of course the six hours of simmering time blended the flavors wonderfully.<br /><br />I would buy it again, but take the peas, beans and lentils out to put in a pot of water overnigh to soak and soften.

It is overpoweringly hot--with a searing heat--and has an odd, unenjoyable flavor.  Although not a terrible hot sauce--I consumed the entire bottle--El Yucateco is a hot sauce that I am glad that I tried, but it just is not my thing.

review/text: Maybe you've been on a low calorie diet like I have, and you've tried the zero calorie shirataki noodle swaps in your pasta. It just really isn't the same, is it? I was adding so much parmesean cheese to compensate for the taste, and truthfully, the fiber payoff of those noodles wasn't great. I was desperate for REAL pasta, but when I measured it out and cooked it, I felt like I was getting too little. This was SO revolutionary. You can cook the entire box (and I do) for 520 calories. Yeah, that's not shockingly low, and that's without sauce, and most of my other meals average 200-300 calories. But you know what? It was so much more worth it to make space in my calorie budget for this pasta. When I finish it, I sigh in relaxed contentment, "aaaaaaah, now that, THAT my good sir, was pasta." And truthfully, this is the lowest calorie product you will ever be able to make that statement with. And I always need fiber, especially in a low calorie diet where I've cut out a good chunk of my carbs and things aren't so... regular and timely the way they used to be. Anyway, I can't recommend this product enough. Until they find some magic way to take the calories out of starch, this should be your go to pasta for the calorie conscious. It tastes great. I don't want to say "it tastes just like pasta" because it IS pasta and tastes like it.
