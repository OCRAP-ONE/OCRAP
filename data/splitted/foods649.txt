review/summary: Perfect for the evening...
review/text: Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams.<br /><br />This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect.<br /><br />Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great food, but...
review/text: Long wait! I suppose it's my fault for ordering from the webstore as I am in CA and I think this comes from the east coast so it took forever to get here. My dog and I are loving this food so far. TMI but seriously, her poos are so small and barely smell. She liked it dry, which is kind of funny, but I do wet it sometimes. The feeding guidelines are a little ambiguous, so I plan to call Addiction directly. As for the store (Whole Health Pet, I believe), they are great! As I mentioned the wait was long, but I ordered from them twice and both times received a couple of samples and goodies for my dog; a sample packet of another grain-free Addiction flavor and a freeze dried meat treat - great attention to detail!

review/text: This is a great cereal.  My kids, grandkids, and I have been hooked on this since it came out.  We really like it in a big bowl with white...OR chocolate milk.  Kids don't usually like to drink the milk left after the cereal is gone?  No problem. The milk is delicious, also.  There are more marshmallow pieces than Lucky Charms and they are larger in size.  We usually get the big bag and it lasts...oh, maybe a week.  Try 'em.

review/summary: Puppy has diarrhea after eating HS canned puppy food
review/text: I had a German Shepherd puppy who had frequent diarrhea. Giardia and fecal tests at the Vet's always come up negative. I noticed that she had diarrhea whenever I fed her canned food. Since HS is a good brand and there are no recalls, I didn't think it would be the food. I recently adopted another puppy. She did not have diarrhea when I fed her HS Large breed puppy dry food. However, after I gave her some of the canned puppy food, she had bad diarrhea and started vomiting. I'm certain now that this canned food caused diarrhea in both my puppies.

review/summary: Fan of all Greenies products- except this one.
review/text: Though my cat is a huge a fan of all of the Dental Chews produced by greenies, my experience with this product was less than pleasant.<br />This product did the opposite of what it set out to do.  My cat violently vomited hairballs the same evening I fed him these.  In fact, he couldn't digest them at all and has never thrown up so much at one time.  This was unusual and still has me shocked, especially for an animal that regurgitates seldom and mildly.  Be careful, as I wish I had.

review/summary: Tasty and works!
review/text: First off, my cat HATES regular Greenies (the big crunchy ones) and won't even try to lick them. Any flavor. But my big fluffy Himalayan was hacking up stinky furballs in unreachable places, so when I saw these at the pet store I bought them on a whim.<br /><br />She loves them! I don't think she even chews the things, she inhales them so fast. Tuna treats are ok but chicken were more popular around here. She likes these better than the Temptations treats she had before, and I am convinced that these are somewhat healthier.<br /><br />The pouch recommends 12 treats a day, all at once, or even more for my big-boned cat. I usually do more like 5-6, because that many treats seems excessive (she would love it though). Either way, she hasn't had any hairballs since. I am not positive about the causal relationship, but I suspect these did the trick. They're great!

review/text: My husband stumbled across the old version of these (2009?), and I adored them. Perfect, melt-in-your mouth peppermint stick. NOthing better. And then they changed the formula. He's gotten them for me the last two Christmas. And every year, I dare to hope they've gone back to the earlier formula, but alas, I've been sorely disappointed the last two years. They currently are not melt-in-your mouth, more of a suck and crunch, and then kinda gooey. I'll probably get them again, optimist that I am, in hopes they change the formula back to the grandeur it was.

review/summary: Dog loves the food, but the cans were badly dented
review/text: My dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food.  After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).  I guess it looks and tastes more like "people food" than the other varieties.  My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out - the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, I'm not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.  A couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when I opened them.  So, I guess I'll go back to buying at the grocery store.  Just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store.  Oh well.....

I was on this quest because I had never tasted another honey as good as that which was with the Fage yogurt, but I wanted to be able to buy plain Fage and add my own honey. When I tried adding the usual honey, it just didn't taste the same. So, I found out that this Attiki is the kind Fage uses, and I ordered it. It is truly heavenly.  It's expensive, but if you use it just for special treats, it's well worth it.

review/text: I'd previously reviewed another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D3LUMU">Extra flavor</a> that was so rubbery to chew, it was like trying to masticate a tire. Luckily this one is plenty soft & remains soft, so perhaps it is just that flavor that is such a hard chew.<br /><br />The flavor of this gum (sweet watermelon) isn't a bad flavor & lasts a long time, but there's just something about the flavor that tastes a little strange. It's got this definite chemical-ish aftertaste to it & a bit of a mint-esque taste. It isn't a nasty flavor, but it is something that I've noticed each time I've chewed a piece.<br /><br />I don't know that I prefer this over my normal chewing gum (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZCL8U">Orbit Bubblemint</a>), but it is something that I will probably buy again at some point in the future & is definitely better than some of the other sugar-laden watermelon gum out there.

review/summary: good straws - terrible service
review/text: I will say the cheese straws are the best I have ever tasted. The negative? Customer service is non existent. An internet order  was lost, even though I received a confirmation via email. I was offered no discount or upgraded shipping, no additional product with my order, no discount on my next order, not even an apology for the 7 day delay. Just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her IT guy would be on the problem tomorrow. This is not the first problem I have had with an order. They do not give a tracking number. When asked for one the odds of getting one are 50-50. I have had so many problems with my orders I will go without my Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. I will miss them greatly however I need the hassle associated with ordering them less than I need the cheese straws. Ann, I wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future. FOLLOW UP: I just received an email notifying me that my order shipped on the Aug 9th. I have not placed an order! What more can they do?

review/summary: The Cat's Meow
review/text: My cat loves this food.  Admittedly I've never given him anything else for dinner but he's finicky about treats.  He will eat as much of this stuff as I've put in front of him (he's only 6 lbs. so never fed him more than 1 can at a time).  I feel good about feeding Grain Free.  But your local cat store might be able to give you a better price than Amazon can.

review/summary: I'm addidcted to these!
review/text: I was looking for a night time snack for myself that would satisfy my sugar cravings but not have a ton of calories.  Well this certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />These are so good and the small bags are just the right size.  Yes I could eat a whole box of these in one sitting but that kind of defeats the purpose.  But because these are low in calorie I don't feel guilty if I eat two packs.<br /><br />I didn't even look at expiration dates since I don't care and they're not going to last the month.<br /><br />I do wish they had this in all chocolate but the cinnamon is really good also.<br /><br />I'm really glad I got in on the subscribe and save before they closed it but the price went up.  I saw K-mart has these for $5.99/box which is better but it's worth it to have them delivered.  I don't know why the price hike.<br /><br />All I can say is Yum Yum!

review/text: Chocolate Teddy Grahams are so yummy!  As an adult, I love them.  I'd imagine kids would too.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No high fructose corn syrup.<br />- Crunchy little bite-sized cookies.<br />- Nice chocolate taste that's not fake.<br />- Great to eat in the car, at your desk, or wherever.  It's a portable snack.<br />- Sweet but not sickeningly so.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I really have no cons other than they will get stale if you don't wrap the bag up tightly.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I enjoy Chocolate Teddy Grahams as either dessert, or a snack with a cup of coffee.  It's a sweet pick-me up that doesn't leave me feeling too guilty.  Cures the need for chocolate, and has a nice crunch that sometimes I really want.  Oh yeah, and they're cute little bears!

They're the perfect size for a 4 or 5 year old's snack.  They're also easy enough to open that my 4 and 5 year olds can open the package themselves.  Our favorite variety is of course chocolate.  Love having these around for trips to the zoo, on the way to the store, or to throw in the lunchbox.  Will be buying these again!

review/text: The first time I saw these wonderful little morsels was in a outfitters shop in the North Corolina Mountains. First glance, they looked like something to put in the bottom of a fish tank, not something to munch on, but I quickly changed my tune. they have a great crunchy shell and quality chocolate taste that I would compare to any major brand. Eat them one at a time or by by the handful, I'm sure you will enjoy them. Try them on Ice cream too, as Tony would say The're Grrrreat!

review/summary: My weekly indulgence
review/text: I like some flavored coffees and teas but must watch my caffiene intake. I have to infuse myself (inserting needles in 4 sites) once a week. I first was introduced to the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte at my hair stylist's. I have a Keurig and never realized this was a tea and that Keurig also carried them until I was on its website. I find they are often out of stock. I found these a bit cheaper here at Amazon and stocked up. Now when I get my hair done once/month and on the morning before I infuse, this is my little indulgence. The flavors and aroma are so calming and relaxing. I even insisted that my sister-in-law who gifted us with a Keurig coffee maker two years ago, try this. I know she likes certain teas and her coffee black. She could not believe it was tea. I sent her home with a box. The only reason I don't drink it more often is due to the empty calories/sugar. I probably should take a star off for that. I am one who does not like a really strong tea or bold coffee so this really pleases my palate. The Cafe Escapes Chai Latte is hands down my favorite.

review/text: I am not a big coffee fan but I wanted a Keurig maker. I absolutely love Chai Latte. I make two cups of it. I found that mixing it on the middle setting and one on the smallest cup setting mixed together makes it a perfect combination! It tastes just like when I used to buy it for 3x the price. It is creamy and the right amount of flavor. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice kick of flavor in the morning but ins't looking for the caffeine of coffee! I also enjoy this as a little treat since I am watching my weight and this doesn't make a big dent into the amount of calories I consume a day. I did wish I could find i for less expensive on Amazon as my local store has it for a better price but it is not always in stock.

review/summary: Best Chai Tea for Keurig
review/text: I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker, but have always been a fan of chai tea. I am used to drinking Panera Bread's version, which is very good. However, chai tea is a spiced milk-based tea to me and most Americans. My Keurig adds water to its drinks so I was ready to be disappointed with this chai tea.<br /><br />As it brews and after taking a smell from the cup, you are hit with warm spices pretty hard. Cinnamon and ginger are ones that I made out but I knew right away it was going to be good.<br /><br />Taking a sip, it is obvious that this isn't a normal K-cup. Further analysis of the nutritional facts reveals that Cafe Escapes uses a creamer based formula and the result is a silky smooth chai tea latte. This is easily my favorite flavor for my Keurig coffee maker. I drink this one later in the day and it just makes you feel great. One of the best chai teas I have ever tried and WAY better than trying to brew it yourself and WAY cheaper than buying it from a cafe.<br /><br />If you don't know about Cafe Escapes and are maybe unsure of their quality, give this a shot, you will thank me (and them). They are known to use a milk-based formula in their K-cups and only make 4 flavors (Chai Tea, 2 different Hot chocolates, and a cafe mocha). I have personally tried all of their flavors and all are very good. However, the chai tea is the only one that I was absolutely blown away by. Two important notes about their brews is 1) their caffeine content is low at less than 10mg per cup (normal cup of coffee is around 100mg) and 2) they don't require you to add creamer or sugar as I am used to with other coffees.<br /><br />I felt that this review was best suited for the 96 count because if you have ever enjoyed chai tea and own a keurig coffee maker, you will be purchasing the 96-count of these at some point!

review/text: I love coffee. I love chai lattes. I love my Keurig. But this combination was disgusting. The taste when first prepared was STRONG. OK, I get that and could even even like it... if the aftertaste didn't kick in. I have never tasted so much artificial sweetener in any product. This is not listed as lo-cal or diet.. so it was not at all what I was expecting. I would rather have an aspirin dissolve in my mouth. I am returning this to the store. Absolutely terrible.

review/summary: one of the worlds best olive oil
review/text: I have visited the olive oil symposium in florence for the past 10 years to write a blog, (i'm a foodie), for my friends<br />and fellow goumets to read and advance a product that is superior in the u.s.<br />I think some of the best unfiltered oils were represented at this event, some very pricey, but i thought i had tasted<br />them all till my trip to provence proved me wrong . the french oil sold here proved to be much better, although tasteing<br />more grasser and lavender, it is a must for cooks and foodie's to have this in your pantry.<br />This over beefsteak tomatoes and french feta provided my total unraveling about italian oil versus french.<br />You can taste "MISTRAIL", terrior in every taste.<br /><br />David<br />vindepays99@yahoo.com

review/summary: java podz
review/text: We own the Senseo coffee maker and were using the Senseo coffee pods. I was so excited to find the Javapodz flavored coffee. However, they tell you that you only need to use one pod for an 8oz cup, unlike the Senseo coffee where you use 2 pods for an 8 oz cup. After drinking the Senseo, I found the Javapods to be a bit weaker coffee flavor, especially after I add half and half.<br /><br />My remedy to this was to use one Senseo mild pod and one flavored javapod and make a 12 oz cup, by using the 2 cup button and then directly after without changing pods I used the 1 cup button. This works wonderfully for me as I get the stronger coffee taste with the wonderful flavor that Javapodz offers. It makes a super iced coffee as well!<br /><br />The packaging is great. Each pod is foil wrapped so they stay fresh for a long time

I was looking for a light roast coffee, when I found this medium roast, and to my surprise it isn't overpowering at all.<br /><br />I don't understand the negative review posted because, it is NOT acidic or bitter at all, maybe they reviewed the wrong product, because this one is super smooth.<br /><br />This coffee is hard to find, I have found 3 places that carry small canisters, but Amazon is the only place I have found the 34.5 Oz.

review/summary: Simply smooth tastes great and is less acidic!
review/text: I can barely drink most coffee (even though I love the taste) due to the acidity. Simply Smooth is the only coffee we drink in my house these days. (Starbucks is like lighter fluid to my stomach!) After searching all over, I found Simply Smooth at Target last year but lately it's been tough to find. It seems they only carry the smaller size jars in stores. It's so easy to order the 34.5 ounce size via Amazon and I don't have to worry if the store has it in stock or not. Simply Smooth tastes like good "hotel" coffee (remember when people use to actually percolate coffee in big urns) but doesn't have a bitter or acidic effect like most other coffee. I'd change the name though because Simply Smooth sounds like a laxative versus a coffee with smooth taste.  Simply Tasty?

review/text: I'm not what you would call a snob when it comes to coffee. If it's fresh, hot, and not made overly strong, I'm usually quite happy. This coffee tastes the way coffee tastes when you use old grounds. It tastes like the coffee left in the cabinets in your camper.

I never in my born days thought I would ever find a milder yet richer tasting Dijon mustard like this.  It is the best I have ever eaten and I suggest this to anyone.  I made a vinegrette with this mustard right after I got it and it was soooo delish that my whole family wants my mustard.  Of course, I tell them where to find it.  I will be ordering more!!

review/summary: Great Taste, Good Value, Not Organic!
review/text: I was hoping for a less expensive organic variety of honey. This is a great product, but not organic! There is nothing on the label to indicate that it might be, even though this company also specializes in true organic honey. I have some severe reactions to environmental toxins, which most honeys contain. This product is no exception, but that's just me.  If you are concerned about pesticides, agricultural chemicals and pollutants I'd go the more expensiveroute and get certified organic honey.  If not, I highly recommend this one for taste and value.

review/summary: An Excellent Organic Honey from a Producer who Cares
review/text: My order was turned over to USPS Priority Mail for delivery to me and, unfortunately, was apparently lost in mail-handling.  I was initially upset with the delay in receiving the product but, when the vendor was appraised of the contretemps, I was notified that a replacement shipment had be sent which I could expect to receive within two days.<br />The replacment shipment arrived promptly and I was pleased with the quality of the honey and its convenient packaging.  I cannot hold the vendor responsible for the mis-handling by the United States Postal Service and as far as the product itself, it was as good, or better, than any honey I have ever purchased anywhere, including honey purchased in the comb.  I unhesitatingly recommend YS Organic Bee Farms Clover Honey to anyone interested in an excellent organic product.  I will order it again.

review/summary: neat and cheap alterantive to Nespresso capsules
review/text: Guys: Although I was a bit skeptical at first, I got to say these are pretty neat because you can fill it with your own coffee and it's also a one time use cartridge for about .20 a pop if you go to coffee cap shop (one word) and select the cheapest shipping (100 capsules at $18.00 plus $2.39 shipping).  Nespresso has a very tight grip on the distribution of their capsules, but a slight design change in these allows them to work with the Nespresso machines while still not infringing on their copyright.  Note: There are alternatives to this product which are re-usable called Nex-pod, and another referred to only as "3 Brown or 3 Black"  or coffeeduck <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZEGLH2">CoffeeDuck Refillable Coffee Capsules For Nespresso - 3 Pods - Thes Espresso Cups fit all Nespresso machines from after October 2010 - Please make sure you have the correct machine before purchasing</a>..... I haven't tried these myself, they are a bit more expensive and from what I've read in other reviews and have seen on YouTube, they didn't just didn't seem to be the best choice for me; you may want to go online and look at the Amazon reviews of these products to judge yourself.  Also, it looks like the brown ones (which are out of stock) are the ones for Nespresso machines made prior to October 2010; the black ones (still available here) are for machines after 2010 (I have the old original C190 Concept machine (model c190) from 2001). Just as an aside, I've also seen videos of people simply re-using a used Nespresso pod  and re-sealing the foil piece with a new piece of aluminum foil (I tried this once and the results were really crappy and watery, and coffee grounds ended up in my machine).<br /><br />Anyway, back to Ne-Cap.....I fill it with my own espresso grind (illy or Lavazza) and I've got to say that the coffee was good and had a decent crema.  They're pretty easy to use as well, although you might need to experiment a bit with the coffee, grind and amount you put into the capsule to ensure you get a nice rich cup of coffee.  Take out a new capsule, using your pod as the "scoop", scoop it to the very top and then simply wipe off the excess so it is filled to the top but not overflowing the rim, then very carefully peel off the paper ring from the top of the cup (uncovering the sticky ring on the top of the cap) and then place the pre-cut aluminum cap on top of the capsule to seal in the coffee (note: you need to be somewhat careful when you're peeling off the paper from the cup to expose the sticky seal or else you'll also remove the sticky seal which is supposed to stay on the cup).  Although the sticky seal for these capsules is not the same as the Nespresso air tight seal (which I think is only done to keep their packaged coffee fresh), the seal is good enough to perform the job and prevent coffee from exploding outside the capsules.  I know their video shows them tamping down the coffee pods as they fill them, but for me, no tamping works best (and it's simpler).<br /><br />After experimenting a bit, I noticed that if you want the richer coffee and thick crema, you should stick with a darker roasted, robusta beans, finely ground (espresso or fine grind...check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0D8">Lavazza Crema e Gusto Ground Coffee, Italian , 8.8-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 4)</a> which is primarily robusta and is on sale with subscribe and save).  And when tamping down on the coffee, don't pack it in too much before attaching the foil top or else you just get a little dribble of coffee coming out (and in all honesty, I've been using these capsules for some time, but every once in awhile, this still happens to me. The drink is fine, it just takes awhile longer to fill the cup).  Along with the illy brand of coffee,  Cafe Pico, Cafe Bustelo, Lavazza Crema and Pilon also do a very good job in these capsules. If you want to see how much coffee Nespresso uses in their capsules, you can also open up a new Nespresso capsule and see what the grind looks like and the amount of coffee they use so you get an idea. I'm too cheap to do that ;-)<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend making these cups too far in advance (since you don't have an airtight seal once you make the cup), but instead make them when you're ready to use them that day.  Although this may seem a bit of work if you're in a rush (and remember, you do have to buy your own coffee), it is sort of fun to experiment with the different blends (you can use any full or half decaff coffee for those last minute guests that want espresso without all the caffeine or you can experiment and add flavorings like vanilla, spices etc.).

review/text: Very time consuming to peel off paper around edge of capsule, usually pulls off sticky part, so push sticky ring back down around tiny rim in a circle, then try to separate foil lids one by one, add the rubber ring and gently push up around bottom rim of capsule (which fell off on half of the capsules I tried), tamp in expensive ground coffee I purchased, makes a mess, then insert in machine and lots of water pours into tray on bottom!  Surely someone can invent some easier solution for more coffee choices for the Pixie machine.  Waste of money and time all around!

review/summary: Good, but could be better! (updated)
review/text: I will start with some helpful info..<br /><br />-Nespresso machine: Pixie<br />-Ne-Cap capsules 100 pcs. ($23.29)<br />-Coffee: Lavazza - Crema e Gusto 250g enough for 50 capsules ($5.75)<br />-Empty capsule weight: ~1 gram<br />-Filled capsule weight: ~6 grams<br />-One capsule preparation time: 60-70 secs<br />-Cost of filled capsule: ~$0.35<br /><br />The main reasons for purchasing the refill capsules are, being able to enjoy the coffee I like and save some money.<br /><br />I haven't encountered any troubles with the capsules EXCEPT that you dont get the best out of it, as most of the hot water is spilled into the used capsules container; although I had the capsules filled, pressed and sealed appropirately. Therefore, I had to reuse the same capsule, however, sometimes replaced it with another one. The reason of water spill/waste is that Ne-Cap capsules are shorter than Nespresso capsules. Thus I assume if they were the same size, the capsules will perform much better.<br /><br />This option is somehow economical, nevertheless, sometimes you may need to use two capsules to enjoy your Espresso, or Cappuccino cup.<br /><br />Conclusion, if you are not enjoying the taste of Nespresso flavours or you like to have your own ground coffee, and want to save some $$$, go for it..BUT dont expect the same performance and cleanness of Nespresso capsules.<br /><br />Update 2/8/2012================<br /><br />When I first used the Ne-Caps, I gave it 3 stars. After using almost 30 capsules, I got to believe that it's not worth it and that Nespresso capsules are irreplaceable. I tried all possible ways to enhance the performance of the capsules, I made more holes at the base, also I dilated the existing ones, but all my attempt were useless. The shape of Ne-Cap pods should be modified to look like nespresso ones. That way, I believe they would be better. So my advice is to stick to nespresso despite the price. Save yourself the time and headache and enjoy your easy, tasty coffee.

review/text: It isn't just a quick simple thing, they don't fit the newest nespresso machines, so there is a little black rubber ring that you put on I think?!? underneath the lid (no directions, just a note saying they don't fit anymore so you have to use the little package of rings in addition to adding the foil lid)I'd return them, but it's not worth the shipping fee.

review/summary: Not as advertised, or I am missing something
review/text: Manufacturer refused to admit problem with their capsules when it doesn't work.<br /><br />Problem:<br />1. 1/3 to 1/2 capsules ends in very dilute coffee/dirty hot water<br />2. seal by far not perfect<br />3. foil cap not reliable peforated<br />4. used capsule compartment becomes overflow hot water compartment and sometimes overflow<br /><br />Since the manufacturer says the problem is not theirs, I tried many permutation to make the capsules work, including:<br />1. filling grinds to different level, full to not-so-full<br />2. compacting grind to different degree, from no compaction to hard compaction<br />3. using 1 or 2 rubber seal<br /><br />Results remain unreliable. When it works it works great. That's about 1/5 of the time. 1/3 of the time it is acceptable, the rest of the time I wasted the coffee and money on the capsule. In the end, it turns out to be more expensive than the nespresso capsules. Not worth the effort and frustration to get a cup of coffee nicer than nespresso's own only for 1/5 of the time.

review/text: Good delivery and speed of service.The cups are not glued properly and some will fail. I imagine some problem with manufacturing. The most of them work fine
