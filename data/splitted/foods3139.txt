review/summary: great taste, more fat than i expected
review/text: Tastes great and I'll happily finish the box but my mistake for not checking the nutritional info more carefully before ordering... 15g of fat per bar is pretty damn high. I was hoping for a protein snack that was pretty lean otherwise. This is sweet and delicious but not as 'healthy' as I was hoping for.

review/summary: Very healthy
review/text: I dont really worry about my weight these days.  These bars are not exactly low calorie, though, in the writeup I read on the internet I , the guy who created the product says he sometimes eats a couple  of them for lunch. That's about right, it would be a tasty light on-the-go lunch at 420 calories. So much better for you than a candy bar. I read an interview the magazine about the founder of the company, and it inspired me to try other bars also, where they are selling them everywhere . I loved it. The one I sampled was different from this one, but this one sounded like I would enjoy it even more, and I did.

review/text: A friend gave me a couple of these "energy" type bars last year and I immediately liked them a lot. But the prices at the local health stores and bicycle/mountain stores prohibited me from buying them as much as I wanted to. Amazon stepped in and I bought them by the box at a very decent price.<br /><br />I like to have them on bicycle rides and I'll eat one half-way through and I feel a little "lift" immediately afterward.<br /><br />Taste good, filling - ya oughta get some.

review/summary: TASTY CHOCOLATE TREAT
review/text: These bars do not qualify as high protein or health bars, but exceed in the taste department. Contain all natural ingredients, which will give you instant energy for that tennis game or other favorite sport. Not recommended as trail bars, because heat will melt the dark chocolate in the bar. Can be refrigerated. The three main ingredients are almonds, dark chocolate and cherries, in that order. They do contain some added vitamins. Recommended.

review/text: I ordered the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew bars and I was pleasantly surprised how good they tasted. My husband likes them and so does my daughter. The only thing is I wished they had a little less sugar. The nutritional facts say they have 14g of sugar. Now 14 grams of sugar is not bad if you are comparing it to a candy bar but for a nutritional bar I would ideally like 10g of sugar or less.

review/summary: I've finally found "my" bar
review/text: I've been some combination of nursing and/or pregnant for a few years now, and trying to find time for a meal when chasing after a toddler or when morning sickness gives you many reasons to avoid every food on earth can be a real challenge. Because of this I sometimes feel like my pantry is some sort of test cabinet for a nutritional bar company. There are always at least a few kinds in there, ones that I've tried before and like and ones that I'm trying out for the first time. I finally got around to trying Kind Bars after all this time, and this specific flavor is officially on my "that's it, you've found a gold medal winner" list.<br /><br />There's usually something for my picky side to take issue with, but not this time. I love that they have extra protein, as they really manage to leave me feeling full and satisfied if I end up turning to one in place of lunch. The fact that it was packed with nuts made me suspect that I would find it too crunchy, but it has the perfect level of chewiness with a really pleasing-but-not-overpowering crunch. Unlike their sister bars (Passion Fruit Macadamia + B Complex, which I purchased at the same time) these are not cloyingly sweet. Don't get me wrong, they have sweetness, but I find that it's just the right amount-- you're tasting the nuts and other good things with just a bump of sweetness to help it along.<br /><br />I bought one box to try them out, now I'm back to load up on them while they are on sale. I'm going to be keeping these as my main bar with one or two other favorites for occasional variety. If you are the kind of person that is always on the lookout for a quick meal or snack fix, I really can't recommend this specific bar more!

review/summary: Deceptive labeling for glorified peanut bars
review/text: I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description. It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond, walnut and macadamia, especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list. Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts?<br /><br />I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills.<br /><br />It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description. If I had only ordered these I likely would never have purchased another product from KIND PLUS.

review/text: I knew this was a tasty flavor of Kind bars.  They are hard to find in stores, so I ordered two boxes.  My mistake was ordering them in the SUMMER, for delivery to Virginia.  They arrived in a very melty state.  They recovered, more or less, and became bar-shaped again and don't have an off taste.  However, the chocolate is changed in texture and I have to eat these bars while leaning over the sink or a plate to catch chocolate schnitzels that fly around!<br />DON'T ORDER THESE IN SUMMERTIME!!!!

review/summary: No sulphur dioxide!
review/text: These bars are soooooo good.  My daughter has asthma which can be triggered by sulphur dioxide and these bars don't use this chemical to preserve the dried fruit. The bars are not hard or crunchy but they are not chewy either.  Texture is kinda like a snickers bar.  Easy on the teeth.  Everyone in my family has loved these bars.  I thought the price was a little high but now that I've tasted them, they are completely worth it.  I used to buy Clif organic Z bars which weigh 36g and these are little bigger at 40g and much better tasting and more nutritious.<br /><br />Update:  I've downgraded my rating because I just bought the peanut butter dark chocolate + protein and it contains soy protein isolates which are difficult to digest and can cause GI distress.  I heard one of the owners of the company on a podcast (Romy Nelson) talking about the cons of this very protein and why they did not use it about a year ago.  What gives!

review/text: These are delicious, especially if you like cranberries and almonds. The cranberries are not too tart or sour, so they provide a nice sweetness to the bar. The whole almonds while delicious make it a little harder to chew, so if you've got fragile teeth buyer beware. I switched to these for a while from the macadamia and mango ones, which are also great, and I noticed a bigger energy boost from these, the cranberry ones. A great product. Bit pricey though, at $1.50 a bar.

I fell in love with this bar first and eventually, it became popular because at one point, the Starbucks I used to frequent could not keep this flavor in stock!!!<br /><br />My kids do not like the flavors I ordered but there are some that I am sure that will sway them over!<br /><br />Thank you amazon for bringing these in at such great prices!!!

review/summary: Probably the best nutritional bar I've had thus far
review/text: KIND bar is little like fine dinning, they don't give you a huge portion, and its quite expensive compared to others, but the portion they give you is so good. This is one of the few health bar that doesn't give you that sugar high and then nap time afterward.<br /><br />As a working individual that logs a lot of hours behind a monitor, sometime it is difficult to grab a meal when you are in the middle of something. So for the past few years, I've been stashing a collection of nutritional bar at my desk. Usually, that stash consist of items on sale from either Amazon or Vons. I've many different bars, from Clif Bar, Nature Valley's Granola Bar, to Balance Bar. None of them can compare to KIND bar. I've actually never heard about this company until a sale on Amazon, but due to great reviews. Which is why I want to put in my 2 cents as well.

review/text: Purchased one out one day and really enjoyed it.  Found them on Amazon and ordered this flavor, which is my favorite and Coconut.  These bars taste great & are not like other protein or natural bars I have tried in the past.  I would recommend these bars for a quick snack, after work out or even breakfast.

review/text: I have never been one to rely on nor crave a nutritional bar. Following a gluten-free and low-allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them. Well indeed they truly are scrumptuous. My 18 year old loves them and when running out the door will grab one or two for the road. I have only tried the Walnut and Date and the Cranbery, Almonds and Oxidants varieties as I follow a blood type diet and also do not love foods that are too sweet. We are on our second box of each and I will be looking at the other varieties to try in time.

review/summary: Almond cashew + omega 3 Snack Bar
review/text: This is a nice snack.  It looks fairly healthy.  It's tasty and filling, especially with a cup of tea.  It is pretty chewy and loaded with nuts.  The almonds are on the hard side, in case you have trouble chewing.  The bar is mostly nuts with some cranberries and something that tastes like a date paste holding it all together.  It tastes a little on the sweet side but not too bad.  The wrapper claims 50 % each of vitamins B3, B6, B12 - 500 mg Omega 3, all natural, gluten free, wheat free, 4 g fiber, non GMO (sorry, don't know what that means), no trans fats, 150 calories per bar/80 from fat.  Total fat 9g, o sodium, o cholesterol, 190 mg potassium, 16 g carbs (I think--wrapper hard to read), 14g sugar, 4 g protein<br /><br />If you are looking for a decent snack for you or your children's lunch box, here ya go.

review/summary: Hard to believe it's good for you
review/text: I was looking for a replacement for my morning biscotti, something a bit more nutritious.  After searching on Amazon and reading reviews of breakfast snacks,<br />I decided to try these bars.  I'd had a KIND bar once and sort of remembered it was good. Well, these are FANTASTIC!  At first bite, I realized there were chunks of sweet mango, the intense mango flavor hit my palate, and it tasted real, not at all artificial.  This was followed by a bit of cruncy coconut which just perfectly tempered the sweet mango.  The macadamia's added a stronger crunch with just a hint of honey.  So I tried the ultimate test:  I gave one to my co-worker (out of the package, a blind test). This person lives on junk food and considers Krispy Kreme one of the four major health groups!  She absolutely loved this bar and sat down and ordered some on her break!!  The ones from Amazon were received in two days, expiration date was Dec 2010 (ordered April). They are fresh and the price was great with subscribe and save.  Love that I am getting some extra calcium and vitamin D (and no, you can't taste whatever they put in to add that).  I'll be ordering these regularly through subscribe and save. I just have to make sure I don't eat them for snacks, just for breakfast, or I'll run out =)

review/summary: A great snack
review/text: These taste really good!<br /><br />The primary nut is almond, although there is a background of peanuts, and occasionally cashew. The sweet element is  made up of dried cranberries and a generous amount of dried cherries, held together by an undertone of honey and lashings of delicious dark chocolate to bind everything together. Delicious.<br /><br />A haiku adds class and authority to any review,or, to put it differently, what can seventeen syllables tell us about this product?<br /><br />Berries and cherries<br />Almonds peanuts cashews too<br />Choco honey yum.

review/summary: very yummy and excellent protein
review/text: The bar is very tasty and has the protein I was looking for. A great product. I canceled just this month because the price went up by nearly $2. With shipping, a box now costs $14, which is still not bad compared to many other protein/nut bars on the market. Just a little too expensive for me.

When I openned the package this morning I was so confused if there was anything wrong... Instead of 12 fruit bars, there were only 8!!!! I shop at Amazon all the time and never complain or anything but this is so RIDICULOUS! I couldn't believe my eyes I just thought that I was wrong. But I keep counting over and over and there were just 8! Now I don't want to say anything but so mad!

review/summary: TO SWEET
review/text: May 15th, 2012 9:04 am<br />  I bought this product[KIND PLUS, Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants Gluten Free] for my grandchildren for a healthy snack at school!<br />  When it came I tried it, it was very tasty, but very very sweet and it had something in it that was so hard to bite, that I thought it would chip my tooth! I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy! We see all the healthy stuff and then think wow this is good for us, but we neglect to notice the larger amounts of fats or salts or sugars that has been added and then it is not as healthy as we thought! It is the fats/ salts/ and sugars that is destroying our bodies from the inside out!<br />Polar2[Eya-Andrea]

review/summary: Why would anyone buy these?
review/text: I bought these to try out based on good Amazon reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain:<br /><br />These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like "gluten free" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat).<br /><br />In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing.

review/text: These bars are great and truly a 5 star product. Some of the nuttier varieties from Kind are a little hard on your teeth, no worries like that with these. Nice soft, chewy, tasty. Best fruit/nut or granola bar I've found. Downside, a little on the pricey side and a little high in saturated fat. But the perfect sweet "healthy" natural treat, and gluten free, a wonderful plus. You can really taste the mangoes and the macadamia nuts. A nice balance of both. These bars have calcium added but you cannot taste it, they just taste delicious.

review/summary: price v. value: five stars, even with the peanuts
review/text: UPDATE: The five stars are for the almond-walnut-macadamia bars, peanuts and all. I gave the cashew-almond-omega3 bars a try later and was somewhat disappointed with them. Not as much flavor. Back to almond-walnut-macadamia bars.<br /><br />I've gone through a few boxes of the KIND bars named for their alleged content of almonds, walnuts, and macadamias. I haven't encountered any of the funny tastes, apparent staleness, or wrappers horribly stuck to the bars, that some reviewers have mentioned. As other reviewers point out, there are a lot of peanuts relative to the content of walnuts, macadamias, and walnuts. But it tastes good nonetheless, and for the price ($1.06 per bar if you buy on subscription) it  strikes me as a good value. This is a relatively high-calorie snack bar (almost 200 cal), but it's also high protein (10g), has extremely little saturated fat, and a relatively low amount of sugar. It's substantial enough that you can easily resist eating a second bar. The bars also contain some worthy vitamins and minerals in amounts sufficient to matter. So far, knock wood, the deliveries on Amazon's subscription have been fast and the product has arrived in excellent condition. I don't expect to get a gourmet no-peanuts bar for this price--it's a good product and good value at this price.
